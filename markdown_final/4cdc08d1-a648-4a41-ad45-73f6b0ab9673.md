## Question

meloxicam

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about meloxicam's pharmacology, indications, dosing, safety, and perioperative use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and mechanism to anchor risk–benefit thinking. Then, I should verify labeled indications and key off-label uses. Next, I will review dosing by indication and special populations, followed by a careful safety analysis including boxed warnings, GI, CV, renal, hepatic, hematologic, and dermatologic risks. After that, I will examine perioperative and acute pain data, including IV formulations and opioid-sparing effects. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing recommendations and monitoring, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and mechanism so I don't misattribute risks later. Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with preferential COX-2 inhibition at lower doses and broader COX-1/COX-2 inhibition at higher doses, which explains its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects via prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, and this mechanistic nuance will matter when I interpret GI and CV safety signals [^112CJDnE] [^115Sc2NG].

> I need to check the labeled indications next. Meloxicam is FDA-approved for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients weighing at least 60 kg. Importantly, the IV formulation is indicated for moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults, which is distinct from the oral indications and will influence perioperative considerations [^111YdYeG] [^112Jn4yg].

> Now, dosing by indication and population — let me verify the specifics. For adults with OA or RA, the recommended starting dose is 7.5 mg once daily, with the option to increase to 15 mg once daily if needed. For JRA, the dose is 7.5 mg once daily in children who weigh at least 60 kg, and tablets are not used in children under 60 kg. In hemodialysis, the maximum is 7.5 mg daily. In severe renal impairment, use is not recommended. In mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no adjustment is needed, but caution is warranted in severe hepatic disease. In older adults, start at the low end and monitor closely due to higher NSAID risk [^112RToTC] [^115mxxrT].

> Hold on, I should verify the boxed warnings and core safety profile before moving to nuanced risks. NSAIDs, including meloxicam, carry boxed warnings for serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (MI, stroke) and serious GI adverse events (bleeding, ulceration, perforation). Risk can occur early, increase with duration, and is dose-related. Meloxicam is contraindicated for perioperative pain in the setting of CABG surgery and should be avoided after recent MI unless benefits clearly outweigh risks [^114TdiFD] [^114HbTYQ].

> Let me consider GI risk more granularly. Serious upper GI events occur in about 1% with 3–6 months of therapy and 2–4% with one year; only about one in five patients is symptomatic, so vigilance is essential; risk is magnified with prior peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding, concomitant corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, SSRIs, smoking, alcohol, older age, and poor health; strategies include using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoiding multiple NSAIDs, and considering gastroprotection in high-risk patients; pooled analyses suggest meloxicam 7.5 mg may have a lower serious GI event rate than some nonselective NSAIDs, though confounding and channeling must be considered [^11448KV3] [^112vXNAA] [^115kYhAd].

> I should double-check cardiovascular risk signals and how they apply clinically. NSAIDs increase the risk of serious CV thrombotic events, including MI and stroke, with risk appearing early and rising with dose and duration; absolute risk is higher in patients with existing CV disease or risk factors; importantly, concomitant low-dose aspirin does not reliably mitigate CV risk and increases GI bleeding risk, so combined use requires close monitoring; observational and trial data suggest the relative CV risk increase may be similar across NSAIDs, though absolute event rates differ by baseline risk [^117T4zgX].

> Next, I will examine renal toxicity and hyperkalemia because these are often overlooked. NSAIDs can precipitate renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure, particularly in patients with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, dehydration, or concomitant diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs; hyperkalemia can occur even without overt renal impairment; in severe renal impairment or advanced renal disease, avoid meloxicam or use extreme caution with monitoring; in hemodialysis, limit to 7.5 mg daily and monitor renal function [^112Evzbb] [^112RToTC].

> I need to ensure hepatic and hematologic risks are addressed. Hepatotoxicity, including transaminase elevations and rare severe hepatic injury, warrants periodic liver enzyme monitoring with long-term therapy; hematologic effects include anemia from occult GI bleeding; severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including SJS/TEN and DRESS, are rare but life-threatening and require immediate discontinuation if rash or mucosal involvement appears [^113sEDRZ] [^112JmCFq].

> Let me now review perioperative and acute pain data, especially the IV formulation, since this is a common point of confusion. Initially, I thought oral meloxicam might be effective for acute postoperative pain, but wait, let me verify — Cochrane found no qualifying trials supporting oral meloxicam for acute postoperative pain, so that assumption was incorrect; however, IV meloxicam has randomized data showing reduced pain intensity and opioid consumption in bunionectomy and abdominoplasty, with onset as early as 15 minutes and sustained 24-hour effect; in TKA, perioperative IV meloxicam 30 mg reduced 24-hour opioid consumption by about 32% versus placebo and improved pain scores, supporting an opioid-sparing role within multimodal regimens; guidelines for TJA endorse NSAIDs, including selective and preferential COX-2 agents, as part of multimodal analgesia when individualized for comorbidities and duration [^113qxiH2] [^115U2CqE] [^1175YXpC] [^1142oZ6q] [^112Mphh5] [^1171Mh8f].

> But wait, what if ketorolac is the comparator — does IV meloxicam still look favorable? A recent randomized trial in TJA found IV meloxicam was associated with higher opioid consumption and longer length of stay versus IV ketorolac, despite similar pain scores, suggesting that ketorolac may outperform meloxicam in certain perioperative protocols; this does not negate meloxicam's opioid-sparing signal in other studies but highlights that agent selection and protocol context matter, and head-to-head superiority cannot be assumed [^113fQtsS].

> I should confirm practical prescribing pearls and monitoring so the plan is actionable. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; avoid concomitant NSAIDs; in patients at GI risk, consider PPI gastroprotection; in those at CV risk, discuss absolute risk, consider alternatives, and if NSAID therapy is necessary, monitor closely; obtain baseline and periodic CBC and chemistry profiles for long-term therapy to screen for occult GI bleeding, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity; review drug interactions that increase bleeding risk or blunt antihypertensive effects, and adjust as needed [^112RToTC] [^111dRUs1] [^1158SqMh].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contraindications to ensure I haven't missed anything critical. Meloxicam is contraindicated in patients with a history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after aspirin or other NSAIDs; it should be avoided in the immediate post-MI period and in the setting of CABG surgery; in pregnancy, avoid after 30 weeks due to ductus arteriosus closure risk, and use caution earlier in gestation; in pediatrics, use only in JRA patients weighing at least 60 kg at 7.5 mg daily; in older adults, start low and go slow with heightened vigilance for GI, CV, and renal adverse effects [^117586Bt] [^114HbTYQ] [^113JYd6n] [^112RToTC] [^115mxxrT].

> In summary, meloxicam is a preferential COX-2 NSAID with established efficacy for OA and RA and a role for IV meloxicam in acute postoperative pain within multimodal regimens. Its safety profile reflects class effects, with dose-dependent GI and CV risks and nontrivial renal and hepatic considerations. Careful patient selection, dose minimization, gastroprotection when indicated, and proactive monitoring enable safe, effective use, while recognizing that ketorolac may outperform meloxicam in some perioperative contexts and that oral meloxicam should not be relied upon for rapid-onset acute pain relief [^111YdYeG] [^112Jn4yg] [^114TdiFD] [^113fQtsS] [^113qxiH2].

Meloxicam is a **once-daily NSAID** with **preferential COX-2 inhibition** [^112CJDnE] that provides effective relief for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis [^117D9kZM] while offering a lower gastrointestinal risk profile than traditional NSAIDs [^112vXNAA]. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations [^112RToTC] [^112Jn4yg] [^114HbTYQ] [^117586Bt], with the IV form indicated for moderate-to-severe acute pain [^112Jn4yg] and demonstrating an opioid-sparing effect in postoperative settings [^1142oZ6q]. Key risks include cardiovascular thrombotic events [^117T4zgX], gastrointestinal bleeding [^11448KV3], and renal toxicity [^112Evzbb]; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112RToTC], and avoid in patients with recent MI, CABG, severe renal impairment, or NSAID hypersensitivity [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Preferential COX-2 inhibition [^116X9ykw] reduces prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing inflammation, pain, and fever [^112kCQF1].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Oral meloxicam has a long half-life (15–20 hours) [^112t9r1w], supporting once-daily dosing; peak plasma levels occur at 4–5 hours, with steady state by day 5.

- **Formulations**: Oral tablets (7.5 mg, 15 mg) [^112RToTC] and intravenous injection (30 mg) [^115bruKw] for acute pain management [^1175YXpC].

---

## Clinical indications

Meloxicam is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

| **Indication** | **Approved use** |
|-|-|
| Osteoarthritis (OA) | Relief of signs and symptoms [^111YdYeG] [^117D9kZM] |
| Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) | Relief of signs and symptoms [^111YdYeG] [^117D9kZM] |
| Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) | Patients ≥ 60 kg [^111YdYeG] [^112RToTC] |
| Moderate-to-severe acute pain | Intravenous formulation (XIFIRM) [^112Jn4yg] [^1175YXpC] |

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis**: Oral meloxicam 7.5–15 mg/day significantly improves pain, function, and stiffness compared to placebo [^117D9kZM] and is comparable to diclofenac and piroxicam [^117D9kZM].

- **Acute postoperative pain**: Intravenous meloxicam 30 mg reduces pain intensity [^1175YXpC] and opioid consumption in postoperative patients [^1142oZ6q], with onset as early as 15 minutes [^115U2CqE].

- **Opioid-sparing effect**: IV meloxicam reduces opioid use by approximately 32% in the first 24 hours post-surgery [^114ExMFS] [^111wHJCr].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Meloxicam carries **significant safety considerations**:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (MI, stroke) [^117T4zgX], especially with prolonged use or high doses [^117T4zgX] [^114TdiFD].

- **Gastrointestinal risk**: Risk of serious GI events (bleeding, ulceration, perforation) [^11448KV3]; lower than non-selective NSAIDs but still significant [^112vXNAA].

- **Renal risk**: Potential for renal toxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, or concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or diuretics [^112Evzbb].

- **Common adverse effects**: Dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache [^116X9ykw] [^115oGaHw].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, a history of asthma or urticaria after NSAID use, active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe renal impairment, and use during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [^114TdiFD]. Precautions include use in elderly patients (higher risk of GI, CV, and renal adverse effects) [^115mxxrT], patients with cardiovascular disease, renal or hepatic impairment, hypertension, or those taking anticoagulants, corticosteroids, or SSRIs [^1158SqMh].

---

## Drug interactions

- **Anticoagulants**: Increased bleeding risk with warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs [^1158SqMh].

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Potential renal function deterioration and reduced antihypertensive effect [^1158SqMh].

- **Diuretics**: Reduced natriuretic and antihypertensive effects [^1158SqMh].

- **CYP2C9 inhibitors**: May increase meloxicam plasma levels, requiring dose adjustment [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals [^112RToTC]. Consider patient-specific risk factors (CV, GI, renal) and monitor for adverse effects [^111dRUs1]. For postoperative pain, IV meloxicam can be part of a multimodal regimen to reduce opioid consumption [^1142oZ6q].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

Versus other NSAIDs, meloxicam has a **lower GI risk** than non-selective NSAIDs [^112vXNAA] but a similar cardiovascular risk profile [^112vXNAA]. Versus COX-2 inhibitors, it has comparable efficacy with a slightly higher GI risk than highly selective agents like celecoxib [^113DbuSk].

---

Meloxicam is a **once-daily NSAID** with preferential COX-2 inhibition, effective for OA, RA, and acute postoperative pain, with a favorable GI profile relative to non-selective NSAIDs. It carries **meaningful CV, GI, and renal risks** [^112JmCFq]; use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and avoid in high-risk patients.

NSAIDs

A network meta-analysis evaluated NSAID efficacy, including 21 trials of various NSAIDs of treatment durations ranging 2–26 weeks. Thirteen were included in the meta-analysis for pain. Naproxen (1000 mg/day) associated with a statistically significant greater reduction in pain vs. placebo (standardised mean difference − 10.28; 95% CI − 20.39, − 0.17), although evidence was considered "very low" quality. No other NSAIDs had significant differences in their effects on pain vs. placebo/each other. Within this systematic review, only one trial of NSAIDs was considered to be at low risk of bias. This represented a phase III, 12-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial comparing oral meloxicam of varying doses to placebo (negative control arm) and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (active comparator arm). Eight hundred ninety four patients were randomised to treatment, with baseline endpoint scores similar amongst treatment groups. Statistically significant reductions in pain levels were seen for all active treatment groups compared to placebo (P < 0.05) with a mean reduction in 100 mm pain intensity VAS of − 21.2 (standard error [SE] 2.1), − 25.1 (2.1), and − 24.3 (2.1) with meloxicam 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 22.5 mg daily, respectively; − 25.4 (SE 2.1) with diclofenac; and − 14.4 (SE 2.1) with placebo. As with many trials of NSAIDs in RA, however, patients were required to have been taking an NSAID pre-trial, and have flared on stopping it; consequently, the trial population is likely to include people most likely to benefit from using NSAIDs.

Gabapentinoids

A National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) systematic review identified no trials examining gabapentin/pregabalin efficacy.

Anti-depressants

A Cochrane review summarised anti-depressant efficacy in 8 trials (seven at high-risk of bias). All evaluated tricyclic anti-depressants. Due to poor-quality, heterogeneous trials with mixed results meta-analysis were deemed unsuitable. Qualitative analyses found no evidence of an effect of antidepressants on pain in the short term (< 1 week), and conflicting evidence of a medium- (1–6 weeks) or long-term (> 6 weeks) benefit.

### Single dose oral meloxicam for acute postoperative pain in adults [^113qxiH2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly in treating pain associated with arthritis. The usual oral dose for osteoarthritis is 15 mg daily, but lower doses of 7.5 mg are advised in older patients. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of single dose oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (June 2009); EMBASE (June 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral meloxicam for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the "pain relief versus time" curve to derive the proportion of participants with meloxicam experiencing least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals.

Main Results

No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral meloxicam in patients with established postoperative pain.

Authors' Conclusions

In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^117GnFde]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, with better gastrointestinal tolerability compared with nonselective NSAIDs, has been proven effective when administered orally for ameliorating the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.–However, largely due to its poor solubility, orally administered meloxicam is not rapidly absorbed; peak plasma concentrations after a dose of 30 mg are not reached until 9–11 hours after administration. Consequently, this slow onset of action is a reason why oral meloxicam is not currently approved for the management of acute pain.

A novel nanocrystal colloidal dispersion formulation of meloxicam (N1539; Recro Pharma, Inc. Malvern, PA, USA) has recently been developed for bolus intravenous (IV) administration, providing faster onset of analgesia than can be achieved with oral administration. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in females who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, the IV nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam was effective in relieving moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. All single doses of meloxicam IV evaluated (5 mg to 60 mg) resulted in significantly lower pain intensity (PI) scores and better global pain-control scores than placebo; doses > 5 mg also achieved significantly better pain-relief scores than morphine (10 mg to 15 mg), and the use of rescue medication was lower in all meloxicam IV dose groups than in the morphine and placebo groups.

The present Phase 2 study (NCT02675907) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IV nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam administered in doses of 30 mg and 60 mg compared to placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following a standardized bunionectomy procedure. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of meloxicam IV administered as a bolus injection over 15–30 seconds (rather than 1–2 minutes, as in earlier studies) by assessing vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, electrocardiography (ECG) changes, wound healing, and the occurrence of AEs. The principal efficacy objective was the estimated effect size of the two doses of meloxicam IV, determined via time-weighted summed PI differences (PID) over the first 48 hours (SPID 48), relative to placebo.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of meloxicam in pediatric JRA patients from 2 to 17 years of age has been evaluated in three clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been adequately studied. Since meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the liver and hepatotoxicity may occur, use meloxicam with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been studied. The use of meloxicam in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended. In patients on hemodialysis, meloxicam should not exceed 7.5 mg per day. Meloxicam is not dialyzable [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^114b52cC]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an intravenous (IV) nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following a standardized unilateral bunionectomy.

Methods

Fifty-nine subjects aged 18–72 years were randomized to receive doses of either 30 mg (n = 20) or 60 mg (n = 20) meloxicam IV or placebo (n = 19), administered once daily as bolus IV injections over 15–30 seconds (two or three doses). Safety, the primary objective, was assessed by physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Efficacy was evaluated by examining summed pain intensity differences over the first 48 hours (SPID 48) using analysis of covariance models. Use of opioid rescue analgesic agents was evaluated.

Results

Generally, AEs were mild-to-moderate in intensity, and their incidence was similar across the three treatment groups. No serious AEs were reported; there were no withdrawals due to AEs, including injection-related AEs. The estimated effect size for SPID 48 versus placebo was 1.15 and 1.01 for meloxicam IV doses 30 mg and 60 mg, respectively (P ≤ 0.01). Both doses produced significantly greater pain reductions versus placebo (P ≤ 0.05) at all evaluated times/ intervals during the 48-hour period. The proportions of subjects with ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% overall reduction in pain from baseline after 6 and 24 hours were significantly higher with meloxicam IV 30 mg doses versus placebo, but not with meloxicam IV 60 mg doses. The time to first use of rescue medication was significantly longer versus placebo with meloxicam IV 60 mg (P < 0.05), but not with meloxicam IV 30 mg doses.

Conclusion

Meloxicam IV was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate-to-severe post-bunionectomy pain. Once-daily administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg and 60 mg exhibited rapid onset of analgesia (as early as 15 minutes) with maintenance of analgesic effect for two consecutive 24-hour periods.

5.14	Laboratory Monitoring

Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)]. XIFYRM is not indicated for long-term treatment.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^1142oZ6q]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate the effect of perioperative meloxicam IV 30 mg on opioid consumption in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Subjects

In total, 181 adults undergoing elective primary TKA.

Methods

Subjects received meloxicam 30 mg or placebo via an IV bolus every 24 hours, the first dose administered prior to surgery as part of a multimodal pain management protocol. The primary efficacy parameter was total opioid use from end of surgery through 24 hours.

Results

Meloxicam IV was associated with less opioid use versus placebo during the 24 hours after surgery (18.9 ± 1.32 vs 27.7 ± 1.37 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P < 0.001) and was superior to placebo on secondary endpoints, including summed pain intensity (first dose to 24 hours postdosing, first dose to first assisted ambulation, and first dose to discharge) and opioid use (48–72 hrs. 0–48 hrs. 0–72 hrs. hour 0 to end of treatment, and the first 24 hours after discharge). Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 69.9% and 92.0% of the meloxicam IV and placebo groups, respectively; the most common AEs were nausea (40% vs. 59%), vomiting (16% vs 22%), hypotension (14% vs 15%), pruritus (15% vs 11%), and constipation (11% vs 13%).

Conclusions

Perioperative meloxicam IV 30 mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen for elective primary TKA reduced opioid consumption in the 24-hour period after surgery versus placebo and was associated with a lower incidence of AEs typically associated with opioid use.

### Are COX-2 inhibitors preferable to non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with risk of cardiovascular events taking low-dose aspirin? [^114pjhUp]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. Only aspirin offers primary and secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, but trials have not answered directly whether low-dose aspirin is cardioprotective with COX-2 inhibitors. A large inception cohort study showed that concomitant use of aspirin reduced risk of cardiovascular events when given with rofecoxib, celecoxib, sulindac, meloxicam, and indometacin but not when given with ibuprofen. In large trials assessing gastrointestinal safety, there were fewer gastrointestinal events in patients using both COX-2 inhibitors and aspirin than in those using non-selective NSAIDs and aspirin; significantly fewer uncomplicated upper gastrointestinal events took place in the MEDAL trial. Analysis of VIGOR and two capsule endoscopy studies showed significantly less distal gastrointestinal blood loss with COX-2 inhibitors than with non-selective NSAIDs. Endoscopy trials showed that low-dose aspirin does not diminish the gastrointestinal benefits of COX-2 inibitors over non-selective NSAIDs. In an elderly epidemiological cohort receiving aspirin, both celecoxib and rofecoxib reduced risk of admission for gastrointestinal events. Comparison of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risks is difficult: likelihood and severity of cardiovascular events differ between individuals, agents, and exposure. Mortality associated with gastrointestinal events is less frequent than with cardiovascular events, but asymptomatic ulcers can result in severe complications. Data support the conclusion that COX-2 inhibitors are preferable to non-selective NSAIDs in patients with chronic pain and cardiovascular risk needing low-dose aspirin, but relative risks and benefits should be assessed individually for each patient.

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^116ZvNsp]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic) in pregnant patients for 20–30 weeks of gestation: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monitor for oligohydramnios. Limit use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider obtaining ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue if oligohydramnios develops. The drug meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^112RobTq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A large impediment to the wider adoption of oral NSAIDs for postoperative primary TKA analgesia are concerns regarding the GI and renal adverse effects associated with COX-1 inhibition from nonselective NSAIDs, especially with the increased utilization of postoperative IV ketorolac, IV corticosteroids, and VTE prophylaxis of aspirin. Currently, limited evidence is available regarding the safety profile of nonselective NSAIDs after discharge from primary TJA. In light of the opioid epidemic, a working committee of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Hip Society, Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine have suggested that the safety of nonselective NSAIDs after primary TKA be investigated.

Therefore, we sought to investigate for any potential differences in COX-1 inhibition-related postoperative complications between nonselective NSAID dosing of meloxicam, preferential COX-2 NSAID dosing of meloxicam, or highly selective COX-2 NSAID dosing of celecoxib. Our findings suggest that using meloxicam at either a nonselective (15 mg/d) or preferential COX-2 (7.5 mg/d) dose as a part of a postoperative multimodal TKA pain protocol does not seem to result in an increased incidence of postoperative GI bleeding compared with the usage of celecoxib, P = 0.4, considering that patients in the three cohorts had similar GI risk profiles: 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0% of patients in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohorts had a history of peptic ulcer disease (P = 1.0). These findings did not agree with our hypothesis because we expected patients on meloxicam, particularly when consuming 15 mg/d, to have a greater incidence of GI bleeding and ulceration based on meloxicam being a nonselective NSAID at higher doses.

### Channelling of patients taking NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors and its effect on interpretation of outcomes [^115kYhAd]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

When new drugs with improved safety or efficacy are introduced, they may be preferentially prescribed to specific populations of patients. Safety and efficacy may be underestimated if such channelling effects are not recognized. Meloxicam and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors were developed as safer alternatives to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies of the use of meloxicam and COX-2-specific inhibitors demonstrate that both of these drugs are being prescribed to patients at increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse drug events. In the case of COX-2-specific inhibitors, this channelling appears to represent a prescribing pattern consistent with current recommendations. Subsequent analysis of the data, after adjusting for channelling bias, showed that the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity for meloxicam was similar to that for other NSAIDs, while COX-2-specific inhibitors reduced the risk of developing gastrointestinal adverse drug events by approximately 60%. These studies serve as examples of observed channelling bias and highlight the need for adjusting for channelling in order to provide a valid assessment of relevant outcomes for drugs likely to be preferentially prescribed to specific populations.

### Which medications are effective in reducing the risk of arthrofibrosis after total knee arthroplasty? [^114x46RB]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Administration of medications that inhibit inflammation and fibrosis may reduce the risk of stiffness. The purpose of this study was to determine the isolated and combined effects of montelukast, celecoxib, meloxicam, and dexamethasone on rates of arthrofibrosis in patients after primary TKA.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis of a healthcare database was performed by querying all patients who underwent primary TKA between 2004 and 2024. The treatment cohort consisted of patients who underwent TKA and were concurrently prescribed either as monotherapy or as a combined (dual or triple therapy): montelukast, dexamethasone, celecoxib, or meloxicam. Propensity scoring was used to match the treatment and control cohorts 1:1. The primary outcome was the incidence of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) or arthroscopic lysis of adhesions (aLOA) over a one-year follow-up period.

Results

Monotherapy of dexamethasone and celecoxib, and dual therapy of celecoxib/dexamethasone and dexamethasone/meloxicam significantly reduced rates of MUA or aLOA following primary TKA (P < 0.05). Patients prescribed other combinations of medication therapies did not experience improvement. Patient counts were insufficient to evaluate outcomes for meloxicam/montelukast and dexamethasone/meloxicam/montelukast cohorts.

Conclusion

This investigation found that postoperative monotherapy of dexamethasone and celecoxib and dual therapy of celecoxib/dexamethasone and dexamethasone/meloxicam were associated with reduced rates of MUA or aLOA following primary TKA.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with placebo: Oral or IV NSAIDs administered preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively do not appear to increase the risk of medical complications following primary TJA, and providers should consider patient comorbidities, the type of NSAID administered, dose, and duration of administration. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Among randomized clinical trials comparing perioperative oral NSAIDs and placebo, twelve studies reported on medical complications, and qualitative examination demonstrated no consistent difference between oral selective COX-2 agents (including Celecoxib and Meloxicam), oral non-selective NSAIDs, and placebo, with the exception of a lower incidence of postoperative fever with patients receiving an oral NSAID.

Health Care Utilization

With respect to charges associated with hospital stays, the total amount was approximately 10% lower for the meloxicam IV group compared with subjects in the placebo group (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2). The duration of hospital stay was numerically shorter for subjects who received meloxicam IV versus placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4935) (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2). Findings for other resource utilization parameters (all-cause readmissions, emergency department visits due to pain, physician office phone calls due to pain, and skilled nursing facility admission and duration) were lower for the meloxicam IV group, but statistical comparisons were not performed (Supplemental Digital Content 3, Table S2).

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^111wHJCr]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results of the current study demonstrate that meloxicam IV provides additional pain control when included as part of a perioperative multimodal approach to acute pain management in subjects undergoing TKA. Opioid use was 32% lower in the meloxicam IV group than in the placebo group in the initial 24-hour postoperative period (primary endpoint). Reduction in opioid use was also reported in later time periods (48–72 hours, 0–48 hours, 0–72 hours, and 0 to end of treatment). The finding that meloxicam IV reduces opioid use in the first 24 hours after discharge is notable given the lack of reporting on the effect of opioid prescribing practices after discharge with other pain protocols, including enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. The additional pain control provided by meloxicam IV is evidenced by the longer time to the first use of opioid rescue medication in the active-treatment arm. Furthermore, meloxicam IV was associated with improved pain scores (vs placebo) in the postoperative period. Significant differences were observed in the early postoperative period (first dose to 24 hours) and in later time intervals (ie, first dose to assisted ambulation and first dose to discharge). Improved pain in the immediate postoperative period was also evidenced by improvement in the subject-reported OBAS score on the first postoperative day. The lower pain scores at first assisted ambulation and at discharge, shorter LOS, and the lower use of opioids at discharge suggest that subjects were ready to discharge sooner after receiving meloxicam IV. It is also noteworthy that the better pain scores achieved with meloxicam IV were apparent even without adjusting for increased opioid use in the placebo arm. These results are consistent with those of a post hoc analysis of a phase 3 trial in which meloxicam IV was evaluated in subjects who underwent major surgery: total opioid consumption was substantially lower in the meloxicam IV group than in the placebo group. The effect was most evident among subjects who underwent orthopedic procedures; opioid use was 23.6% lower during treatment with meloxicam IV.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115dMB23]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of perioperative meloxicam IV 30mg on opioid consumption in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Subjects

In total, 181 adults undergoing elective primary TKA.

Methods

Subjects received meloxicam 30mg or placebo via an IV bolus every 24hours, the first dose administered prior to surgery as part of a multimodal pain management protocol. The primary efficacy parameter was total opioid use from end of surgery through 24hours.

Results

Meloxicam IV was associated with less opioid use versus placebo during the 24hours after surgery (18.9 ± 1.32 vs 27.7 ± 1.37mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P < 0.001) and was superior to placebo on secondary endpoints, including summed pain intensity (first dose to 24hours postdosing, first dose to first assisted ambulation, and first dose to discharge) and opioid use (48–72hrs., 0–48hrs., 0–72hrs., hour 0 to end of treatment, and the first 24hours after discharge). Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 69.9% and 92.0% of the meloxicam IV and placebo groups, respectively; the most common AEs were nausea (40% vs. 59%), vomiting (16% vs 22%), hypotension (14% vs 15%), pruritus (15% vs 11%), and constipation (11% vs 13%).

Conclusions

Perioperative meloxicam IV 30mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen for elective primary TKA reduced opioid consumption in the 24-hour period after surgery versus placebo and was associated with a lower incidence of AEs typically associated with opioid use.

5.2	Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with XIFYRM. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short- term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue XIFYRM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

At multiple time points during the initial 24 hours postdose, PI was lower in subjects treated with meloxicam IV (Figure 2). Moreover, summed PI scores were better for subjects who received meloxicam IV versus placebo for most time intervals, including notable recovery milestones (eg, first dose to 24 hours postdosing [P < .0001], first dose to first assisted ambulation [P = 0.0235], and first dose to discharge [P = 0.0001] [Table 3]). The OBAS score was significantly lower for meloxicam IV compared with placebo-treated subjects on the first postoperative day (LS mean [SE] 4.45 [0.360] vs 5.90 [0.375] for meloxicam and placebo, respectively; difference [95% CI], –1.45 [–2.39, –0.51]; p = 0.0027). Changes in OBAS over other intervals are summarized in Table 4.

Following surgery, subjects were able to request opioid analgesia as needed (ie, rescue medication). Time from EOS to first use of opioid rescue medication (via IV or oral administration) was significantly longer with meloxicam IV versus placebo (P = 0.0003) (Table 4). Meloxicam IV was associated with a longer time to first IV rescue medication (P = 0.0009) and a longer time to first oral rescue medication (P = 0.0036) (Table 5).

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^112kKtep]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the importance of a patient's medical history has been stressed when prescribing NSAIDS, particularly higher doses of meloxicam, it has an equivalent safety profile to celecoxib after primary TKA. Meloxicam usage, particularly at higher doses does not seem to increase the risk of complications potentially related to COX-1 inhibition. Therefore, meloxicam may be considered a safe and low cost alternative to celecoxib for TJA postoperative analgesia.

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^113sEDRZ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for HF, and death.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs reduce inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of NSAIDs has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Meloxicam [^112CJDnE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^114xCFmo]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although protocols for pain management after TKA have improved patient outcomes, a substantial proportion of patients still experience residual pain and functional limitations, with residual pain being a major factor in patient dissatisfaction. Thus, better pain control has the potential to improve patient satisfaction and functionality. Opioids are frequently used for pain control in patients who undergo TKA (> 40% of cases), but there are concerns about the negative consequences of overreliance on these agents, including AEs and the risk of dependence. There are data to suggest that preoperative opioid use is associated with worse patient outcomes after total joint arthroplasty. A meta-analysis of six studies that involved assessment of patient-reported outcomes after TKA demonstrated that preoperative opioid use was linked to significantly worse patient-reported outcome scores relative to nonuse of preoperative opioids. Thus, regimens that reduce the need for perioperative opioids may have potential benefits. For example, effective pain management that minimizes opioid use was shown to improve postoperative rehabilitation and decrease length of stay. In addition, data suggest that NSAID use in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery is associated with reductions in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, with one meta-analysis demonstrating a decrease of approximately 30% in these AEs when NSAIDs were combined with patient-controlled morphine analgesia.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115JwFk4]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen demonstrated an opioid-sparing effect among subjects who underwent elective primary TKA. Meloxicam IV had a favorable AE profile comparable to that of placebo and was not associated with an increase in AEs associated with NSAIDs. Select measures of health care resource utilization also tended to be lower with meloxicam IV, including 10% lower mean total hospital charges. These results suggest that meloxicam IV has a promising role in multimodal analgesic regimens in this clinical setting.

14.1 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis
14.2 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind,
controlled trial. MOBIC (3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg daily) was compared
to placebo. The four primary endpoints were investigator's global assessment, patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, and total WOMAC score (a self-administered questionnaire addressing pain, function, and stiffness). Patients on MOBIC 7.5 mg daily and MOBIC 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in each of these endpoints compared with placebo. The use of MOBIC for the management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was evaluated in six double-blind, active-controlled trials
outside the U.S. ranging from 4 weeks' to 6 months' duration. In these
trials, the efficacy of MOBIC, in doses of 7.5 mg/day and 15 mg/day, was comparable to piroxicam 20 mg/day and diclofenac SR 100 mg/day and consistent with the efficacy seen in the U.S. trial. The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled multinational trial. MOBIC (7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 22.5 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The primary endpoint in this study was the ACR20 response rate, a composite measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of RA response. Patients receiving MOBIC 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in the primary endpoint compared with placebo. No incremental benefit was observed with the 22.5 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose. 14.2 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
in patients 2 years of age and older was evaluated in two 12-week,
double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled trials. Both studies
included three arms: naproxen and two doses of meloxicam. In both
studies, meloxicam dosing began at 0.125 mg/kg/day (7.5 mg maximum) or 0.25 mg/kg/day (15 mg maximum), and naproxen dosing began at 10 mg/kg/day. One study used these doses throughout
the 12-week dosing period, while the other incorporated a titration
after 4 weeks to doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day and 0.375 mg/ kg/day (22.5 mg maximum) of meloxicam and 15 mg/kg/day of naproxen. The
efficacy analysis used the ACR Pediatric 30 responder definition, a
composite of parent and investigator assessments, counts of active
joints and joints with limited range of motion, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate. The proportion of responders were similar in all three groups in both studies, and no difference was observed between the meloxicam dose groups.

### Meloxicam [^112RToTC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of meloxicam and other treatment options before deciding to use meloxicam. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with meloxicam, adjust the dose to suit an individual patient's needs.

In adults, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of meloxicam is 15 mg regardless of formulation. In patients with hemodialysis, a maximum daily dosage of 7.5 mg is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Meloxicam may be taken without regard to timing of meals.

2.2 Osteoarthritis

For the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of meloxicam is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.

2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis

For the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of meloxicam is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.

2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course

For the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended oral dose of meloxicam is 7.5 mg once daily in children who weigh ≥ 60 kg. There was no additional benefit demonstrated by increasing the dose above 7.5 mg in clinical trials.

Meloxicam tablets should not be used in children who weigh < 60 kg.

2.5 Renal Impairment

The use of meloxicam in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended.

In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dosage of meloxicam is 7.5 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Meloxicam

Meloxicam tablets have not shown equivalent systemic exposure to other approved formulations of oral meloxicam. Therefore, meloxicam tablets are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam product even if the total milligram strength is the same. Do not substitute similar dose strengths of meloxicam tablets with other formulations of oral meloxicam product.

### Meloxicam… [^112t9r1w]. FDA (DailyMed) (2012). Low credibility.

Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. Mean Cmax was achieved within four to five hours after a 7. 5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption. With multiple dosing, steady state concentrations were reached by Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling. Administration of meloxicam capsules following a high fat breakfast resulted in mean peak drug levels being increased by approximately 22% while the extent of absorption was unchanged. The time to maximum concentration was achieved between 5 and 6 hours.

No pharmacokinetic interaction was detected with concomitant administration of antacids. Based on these results, meloxicam tablets can be administered without regard to timing of meals or concomitant administration of antacids. Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. NSAIDs, including meloxicam tablets, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%. This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19. 2 hours to
12. 5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC. This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.

Background and Objectives

To describe the safety and tolerability of intravenous meloxicam compared with placebo across all phase II/III clinical trials.

Methods

Safety data and opioid use from subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain who received ≥ 1 dose of intravenous meloxicam (5–60 mg) or placebo in 1 of 7 studies (4 phase II; 3 phase III) were pooled. Data from intravenous meloxicam 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg groups were combined (low-dose subset).

Results

A total of 1426 adults (86.6% white; mean age: 45.8 years) received ≥ 1 dose of meloxicam IV; 517 (77.6% white; mean age: 46.7 years) received placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in intravenous meloxicam and placebo-treated subjects was 47% and 57%, respectively. The most commonly reported TEAEs across treatment groups (intravenous meloxicam 5–15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively) were nausea (4.3%, 20.8%, 5.8% and 25.3%), headache (1.5%, 5.6%, 1.6% and 10.4%), vomiting (2.8%, 4.6%, 1.6% and 7.4%) and dizziness (0%, 3.5%, 1.1% and 4.8%). TEAE incidence was generally similar in subjects aged > 65 years with impaired renal function and the general population. Similar rates of cardiovascular events were reported between treatment groups. One death was reported (placebo group; unrelated to study drug). There were 35 serious adverse events (SAEs); intravenous meloxicam 15 mg (n = 5), intravenous meloxicam 30 mg (n = 15) and placebo (n = 15). The SAEs in meloxicam-treated subjects were determined to be unrelated to study medication. Six subjects withdrew due to TEAEs, including three treated with intravenous meloxicam (rash, localized edema and postprocedural pulmonary embolism). In trials where opioid use was monitored, meloxicam reduced postoperative rescue opioid use.

Conclusions

Intravenous meloxicam was generally well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Rescue Medication Use.

Compared with placebo, all active treatments reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue medication in the first 24 hours postdose (P < .001). Relative to placebo subjects, those who received meloxicam IV 60 or 30 mg were 90% less likely to require rescue medication during the first 24 hours, with an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.16) for the meloxicam IV 60 mg group and an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.17) for the meloxicam IV 30 mg group. Those who received meloxicam IV 15, 7.5, or 5 mg were 86% (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.23), 80% (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14–0.30), and 81% (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.12–0.29) less likely to require rescue medication in the first 24 hours, respectively.

Compared with morphine, all meloxicam IV doses reduced the likelihood of rescue medication use within the first 24 hours postdose (P ≤ .010). Relative to morphine, meloxicam IV 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg doses reduced the risk of rescue medication use in the first 24 hours by 72% (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18–0.45; P < .001), 73% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45; P < .001), 62% (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23–0.61; P < .001), 41% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.88; p = 0.010), and 45% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85; p = 0.007), respectively.

### Time dependent risk of gastrointestinal complications induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use: a consensus statement using a meta-analytic approach [^117SFPa4]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated document assessing the global, NSAID-specific, and time dependent risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications through meta-analyses of high quality studies.

Methods

An exhaustive systematic search was performed. Inclusion criteria were: RCT or controlled study, duration of 5 days at least, inactive control, assessment of minor or major NSAID adverse effects, publication range January 1985 to January 2003. The publications retrieved were assessed during a specifically dedicated WHO meeting including leading experts in all related fields. Statistics were performed conservatively. Meta-regression was performed by regressing NSAID adjusted estimates against study duration categories.

Results

Among RCT data, indolic derivates provided a significantly higher risk of GI complications related to NSAID use than for non-users: RR = 2.25 (1.00; 5.08) than did other compounds: naproxen: RR = 1.83 (1.25; 2.68); diclofenac: RR = 1.73 (1.21; 2.46); piroxicam: RR = 1.66 (1.14; 2.44); tenoxicam: RR = 1.43 (0.40; 5.14); meloxicam: RR = 1.24 (0.98; 1.56), and ibuprofen: RR = 1.19 (0.93; 1.54). Indometacin users had a maximum relative risk for complication at 14 days. The other compounds presented a better profile, with a maximum risk at 50 days. Significant additional risk factors included age, dose, and underlying disease. The controlled cohort studies provided higher estimates: RR = 2.22 (1.7; 2.9). Publication bias testing was significant, towards a selective publication of deleterious effects of NSAIDs from small sized studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis characterised the "compound" and "time" aspects of the GI toxicity of non-selective NSAIDs. The risk/benefit ratio of such compounds should thus be carefully and individually evaluated at the start of long term treatment.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: are they really atherothrombotic, and if not, why not? [^115RRVa6]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY: Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are increasingly being used in place of "conventional" nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is because they are just as effective as NSAIDs in relieving arthritic pain and yet less gastrotoxic. However, the cardiovascular safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been questioned because they selectively reduce prostacyclin production, thus disrupting the normal homeostatic balance and promoting a prothrombotic state. These theoretical concerns appear to be supported by the results of clinical trials demonstrating an increased risk of myocardial infarction with COX-2 inhibitors compared with a conventional NSAID, and indirect comparisons of the rates of myocardial infarction among patients treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor compared with aspirin in different trials. However, emerging data from animal, experimental and clinical studies suggest that COX-2 is atherogenic and thrombogenic, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be cardioprotective. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with placebo have demonstrated no excess of cardiovascular events among patients allocated COX-2 inhibitors, and preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial of the selective COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam, in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were treated with aspirin, demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events among patients allocated the COX-2 inhibitor.

Conclusions

Continuing uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of any cardiovascular effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors, coupled with their widespread and increasing use, mandates prospective randomized evaluation of their efficacy and safety in patients at increased risk of future cardiovascular events.

5.1	Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with VIVLODEX. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue VIVLODEX until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy and safety of meloxicam injection in the treatment of moderate to severe pain was evaluated in two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose clinical trials in patients with postoperative pain. In both trials, oral oxycodone 5 mg was permitted as rescue medication for pain management.

Study 1 (Bunionectomy Surgery)

In the first controlled, multiple-dose trial (NCT02675907) of adult patients with postoperative pain who underwent bunionectomy surgery, 201 patients were treated with meloxicam injection 30 mg or placebo administered once daily for two days starting on the day after surgery. An optional third dose was permitted just prior to discharge. A minimum postoperative baseline pain intensity of 4 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) (range 0–10) and pain categorized as moderate or severe were required for randomization. The majority of patients were female (85%). The average age was 48 years. The mean overall baseline pain intensity on the NPRS was 6.8. A statistically significant difference demonstrating efficacy was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint of the summed pain intensity difference over the first 48 hours (SPID48). The average pain intensity over time is depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 2. A generally consistent separation in pain scores between the meloxicam injection and placebo groups was observed from time of onset through most of the dosing interval with a narrowing at the end of the first 24-hour dosing interval.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^115U2CqE]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Meloxicam IV had a rapid onset of action; significant decreases in PID values from baseline were detected with both doses as early as 15 minutes after administration. Moreover, compared with placebo, meloxicam IV 30 mg resulted in significantly more subjects with PI reductions of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% from baseline within the first 6 and 24 hours after the initiation of treatment, according to W2LOCF analysis. The time to first use of rescue medication was significantly longer with the meloxicam IV 60 mg doses than with placebo and, overall, fewer doses of rescue medication were used by subjects who received meloxicam IV. Although differences in rescue medication usage between the meloxicam IV and placebo groups were not statistically significant (likely due to the small sample size), the rescue analgesia findings from this study indicate that, as with other NSAIDs administered intravenously in postoperative pain settings,–meloxicam IV may have an opioid-sparing effect. This may be beneficial in reducing the occurrence of opioid-induced AEs that, in some patients, may slow postoperative recovery. Determining whether the opioid-sparing effect of meloxicam IV is clinically significant will require investigation in larger studies.

To address the impact of rescue medication on the treatment response in this study, two methods of analysis were used: LOCF and W2LOCF. Although LOCF was initially stated to be the primary method of analysis, the W2LOCF method was ultimately used for the primary analysis, following its identification as a more appropriate method for imputation. The LOCF method served as a supportive analysis. For most efficacy evaluations, PI results determined by the two methods were consistent. The main difference pertained to the proportions of subjects with pain reductions of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% from baseline in the first 6 hours and 24 hours after the initial dose of meloxicam IV 30 mg. The proportions of subjects with these overall pain reductions were significantly greater with the 30 mg dose than with placebo according to the W2LOCF analysis method but not the LOCF method.

Higher doses of meloxicam (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of serious GI events; therefore, the daily dose of meloxicam should not exceed 15 mg.

Pediatrics

Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)

Three hundred and eighty-seven patients with pauciarticular and polyarticular course JRA were exposed to meloxicam with doses ranging from 0.125 to 0.375 mg/kg per day in three clinical trials. These studies consisted of two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials (one with a 12-week open-label extension and one with a 40-week extension) and one 1-year open-label PK study. The adverse events observed in these pediatric studies with meloxicam were similar in nature to the adult clinical trial experience, although there were differences in frequency. In particular, the following most common adverse events, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia, were more common in the pediatric than in the adult trials. Rash was reported in seven (< 2%) patients receiving meloxicam. No unexpected adverse events were identified during the course of the trials. The adverse events did not demonstrate an age or gender-specific subgroup effect.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue meloxicam until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Table 3 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Meloxicam

Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking meloxicam with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of meloxicam and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with meloxicam may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure.

ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with meloxicam in elderly, volume-depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.

Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects.

### Comparison of the incidence rates of selected gastrointestinal events reported for patients prescribed celecoxib and meloxicam in general practice in england using prescription-event monitoring (PEM) data [^113DbuSk]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Celecoxib and meloxicam are classified as cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors, and were developed to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity commonly associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) monitored the safety of these drugs immediately after launch in England using the non-interventional observational cohort technique of prescription-event monitoring (PEM). Our objective was to investigate whether there is a clinically relevant difference in incidence of reported symptomatic (acid/peptic) and complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding) between celecoxib and meloxicam during use in general practice.

Methods

Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions written by general practitioners (GPs) for meloxicam (December 1996 to March 1997) and celecoxib (May to December 2000). Simple questionnaires requesting details of events occurring during/after treatment and potential risk factors (including age, sex, history of upper GI problems, and NSAIDS prescribed within 3 months of treatment) were posted to prescribing GPs at least 6 months after the first prescription for each patient. Incidence rates of the first event were calculated; crude and adjusted rate ratios (RR) obtained using regression modelling.

Results

For celecoxib and meloxicam, respectively, 1054 (6.0%) and 1376 (7.2%) patients had symptomatic (acid/peptic) upper GI events whereas 42 (0.2%) and 67 (0.4%) had complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding). A higher proportion of the celecoxib cohort had an indication for osteoarthritis (28.1 vs 23.2%), were female (68.3 vs 67.1%), were aged 60 yr or more (59.5 vs 55.0%), were prescribed NSAIDs within 3 months of starting treatment (49.4 vs 47.9%), and had a past medical history of upper GI conditions (54.7 vs 29.2%) than those prescribed meloxicam. This suggests differential channelling of groups at higher risk of such events on to celecoxib compared with meloxicam. There was no difference between the two drugs in the time to occurrence of either group of event. The RR over the 270-day study period for celecoxib compared with meloxicam were 0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.85) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.32, 0.96) for symptomatic (acid/peptic) upper GI events and complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding), respectively, adjusted for age, age2, sex, indication, medical history of upper GI problems and whether NSAIDs were prescribed within 3 months prior to starting treatment.

Conclusions

This study reports a relative reduction (23%) in the incidence of symptomatic (acid/peptic) GI events, and a relative reduction (44%) in the incidence rate of complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding) for celecoxib compared with meloxicam.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam / rizatriptan PO (also known as Symbravo):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including VT and VF, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists.
- **Cerebrovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and rizatriptan has been associated with significant BP elevations, including hypertensive crisis. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.
- **Vasospastic reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-coronary vasospastic reactions, including peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction, splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome.

By contrast, adding celecoxib 200 mg for 3 months to tamsulosin 0.2 mg for 6 months did not improve IPSS scores, meloxicam 7.5 mg BID up to 6 months starting on the day of implant or 1 week before showed no difference in urinary retention (7%) or IPSS in a study of 300 patients, and intraoperative dexamethasone 6 mg did not decrease urinary retention in an I-125 seed implant trial of 196 patients where rates were 2% vs. 1%. In summary, randomized trials show a benefit of alpha-adrenergic blockers for improving short-term urinary outcomes after brachytherapy.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Selective COX-2 NSAIDs after discharge from primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) — the workgroup has elected to only make a recommendation regarding the use of selective oral NSAIDs after discharge from a primary TJA, and oral selective COX-2 (includes selective [i.e. Celecoxib] and preferential [i.e. Meloxicam] COX-2 inhibitory agents) NSAID utilization of an extended duration reduces the postoperative pain and opioid consumption. For total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a single high quality study comparing an oral selective COX-2 NSAID to placebo for six-weeks provides overwhelming evidence favoring oral selective COX-2 NSAID use following a primary TKA. Because similar evidence is lacking after a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), the workgroup provides a consensus recommendation favoring the administration of an oral selective COX-2 NSAID after discharge from primary THA. Furthermore, inclusion of an oral NSAID as a component of a postoperative multimodal pain management protocol following primary TJA has demonstrated a reduction in pain, opioid consumption, and the risk of opioid-related adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea/vomiting, sedation, or urinary retention. Therefore, we can support the use of oral selective COX-2 NSAIDs after discharge from a primary TJA as part of a multimodal pain regimen.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^113SWGuT]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients typically report high levels of pain after orthopedic surgery, and managing this pain can be challenging. The importance of effective pain management is underscored by adverse outcomes associated with uncontrolled postoperative pain, which include delayed recovery, longer hospital stays, readmissions, increased morbidity, and decreased quality of life. In an effort to improve the management of postoperative pain, current guidelines strongly recommend an integrative approach, including use of multimodal analgesia and minimization of opioids.

In the past, the limited number of options to treat moderate-to-severe pain led to overreliance on the use of opioids. Given the potential risks associated with opioids, such as addiction, gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), pruritus, and respiratory depression, among others, there has been an increased emphasis on using alternative medications and decreasing opioid use in patients who undergo elective or nonelective surgical procedures. In general, it is recommended that opioids be used at the lowest possible dose and not in isolation. Therefore, a multimodal analgesic regimen that includes two or more analgesic agents with different mechanisms of action to provide enhanced analgesia is a rational approach. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for this purpose, as they have not only demonstrated efficacy for reducing postoperative pain, but have also demonstrated benefits with respect to patient satisfaction (improved), opioid consumption and related AEs (reduced), systemic inflammation (reduced), and time to recovery (shortened). However, they can lead to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, exacerbation of respiratory disease, thrombotic events, and renal or hepatic injury, the risk of which may be related to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selectivity. Furthermore, few intravenous (IV) options are currently available.

### Dose response and safety study of meloxicam up to 22.5 mg daily in rheumatoid arthritis: a 12 week multicenter, double blind, dose response study versus placebo and diclofenac [^112tSJGT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This Phase III, placebo and active controlled, multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg daily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

A 12 week, randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group trial compared daily oral meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg to placebo (negative control) and diclofenac 75 mg BID (positive control). A total of 894 patients (18 years of age with confirmed RA who flared following an NSAID-free period) were randomized to be treated. Baseline scores for all endpoints were similar among the treatment groups. Patient assessments were at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or early termination.

Results

All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.001). Meloxicam 7.5 and 22.5 mg was significantly superior to placebo in all 5 primary efficacy endpoints (swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient pain, patient and physician global; all p < 0.05). Diclofenac 150 mg was superior to placebo for 4 of 5 primary efficacy measures (all but swollen joint count; p < 0.05) and meloxicam 15 mg was superior for 3 of 5 primary endpoints (patient pain and patient and physician global). AUC of patient global, patient pain, and modified Health Assessment Questionnaire demonstrated dose-response (p < 0.04), while AUC ACR20 showed a qualitative trend in the same direction. The rate of gastrointestinal (GI) events during the 12 week trial for all doses of meloxicam and diclofenac did not differ significantly from placebo (23.2–32.0%). GI withdrawals were comparable and not significantly different across all treatment groups (4.3–5.7%).

Conclusion

This trial demonstrated a dose response relationship for meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg using AUC measurement of response for the treatment of RA. All 3 doses of meloxicam. and positive control, were effective in the treatment of RA. The overall incidence rate of GI events did not differ significantly from placebo in either the meloxicam treatment groups or the positive control.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^116X9ykw]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meloxicam is an NSAID with a prolonged half-life that has preferential, but not exclusive, inhibition of COX-2, demonstrating a more favorable gastrointestinal AE profile (ie, lower rates of GI-related AEs [dyspepsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI mucosal damage]) than that of nonselective NSAIDs. Intravenously administered meloxicam (meloxicam IV) utilizes a novel nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam and has been evaluated in seven phase 2 and 3 postoperative studies in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following hard-tissue surgery or soft-tissue surgery.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg (first dose administered prior to surgery) on opioid consumption in subjects undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this study, meloxicam IV was used as part of a multimodal pain management regimen to provide pain relief in accordance with generally accepted good practices. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety of meloxicam IV 30 mg and to evaluate its effect on postoperative pain, as well as associated health care resource utilization, compared with that of placebo.

Adults

Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The meloxicam Phase 2/3 clinical trial database includes 10,122 OA patients and 1012 RA patients treated with meloxicam 7.5 mg/day, 3505 OA patients and 1351 RA patients treated with meloxicam 15 mg/day. Meloxicam at these doses was administered to 661 patients for at least 6 months and to 312 patients for at least one year. Approximately 10,500 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled osteoarthritis trials and 2363 of these patients were treated in ten placebo- and/or active-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were the most frequently reported adverse events in all treatment groups across meloxicam trials.

A 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo and with an active control. Two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials were conducted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare the efficacy and safety of meloxicam with placebo.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^115Sc2NG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of degenerative joint disease provides patients with an improved quality of life and better functional status; however, the procedure can result in moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. Historically, opioid medications have been the cornerstone of postoperative analgesia after TKA, but our improved understanding of pain physiology and transmission helped to usher in the era of multimodal analgesia. The premise of multimodal analgesia is to use nonnarcotic medications such as acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), among others, to reduce opioid-related adverse effects while providing improved pain management. For example, the tissue damage during TKA causes the release of arachidonic acid, the precursor to prostaglandins, resulting in a hyperalgesiac response from the peripheral nerves. Because NSAIDs block the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, causing a subsequent reduction in the hyperalgesiac response, NSAIDs can be used to reduce postoperative pain as an alternative to opioid medications.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are categorized based on their ability to selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform that is responsible for the production of prostiglandins. Nonselective NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) provide relatively equivalent inhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms while selective COX-2 NSAIDs are subcategorized as highly selective (eg, celecoxib) and preferentially selective (eg, meloxicam) COX-2 NSAIDs. Although meloxicam does have a preference for binding with COX-2, it also inhibits COX-1 at the higher dosage regimens of 15 mg daily. Because COX-1 is constitutively expressed throughout the body and plays a role in platelet function, protection of gastric mucosa, and renal function, it resulted in the development of the selective and preferentially selective COX-2 NSAIDs with the intention to limit the negative effect of COX-1 inhibition. Nevertheless, realizing the full benefit of highly selective COX-2 inhibition while avoiding the complications associated with COX-1 inhibition has not come to fruition.

The purpose of this study was to compare the complication rates related to COX-1 inhibition between those who receive either a nonselective (meloxicam 15 mg/d), preferential COX-2 (meloxicam 7.5 mg/d) or a highly selective COX-2 (celecoxib) NSAID after primary TKA and determine whether meloxicam, at a dose of 15 mg/d, is more cost-effective when considering the potential cost of increased complications related to COX-1 inhibition.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, has resulted in renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

The renal effects of meloxicam may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Because some meloxicam metabolites are excreted by the kidney, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating meloxicam. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of meloxicam [see Drug Interactions (7)].

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease. Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If meloxicam is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Meloxicam has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to meloxicam and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Comparison of the incidence rates of selected gastrointestinal events reported for patients prescribed rofecoxib and meloxicam in general practice in england using prescription-event monitoring data [^112SSAcb]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

and objectives. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rofecoxib and meloxicam are classified as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors. The Drug Safety Research Unit monitored the safety of these drugs immediately after their launch in England using the non-interventional observational cohort technique of prescription-event monitoring (PEM). Our objective was to investigate whether there is a clinically relevant difference in the incidence of reported symptomatic (acid/peptic) and complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding) between rofecoxib and meloxicam during use in general practice.

Methods

Patients were identified from dispensed prescriptions written by general practitioners (GPs) for meloxicam (between December 1996 and March 1997) and rofecoxib (between July and November 1999). Simple questionnaires requesting details of events occurring during/after treatment and potential risk factors (including age, sex, history of upper GI problems, and NSAIDS prescribed within 3 months of treatment) were posted to prescribing GPs approximately 9 months after the first prescription for each patient. Incidence rates of the first event were calculated, and crude and adjusted rate ratios were obtained using regression modelling.

Results

For rofecoxib and meloxicam respectively, 1127 (7.4%) and 1376 (7.2%) patients had symptomatic (acid/peptic) upper GI events, whereas 57 (0.4%) and 67 (0.4%) had complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding). A past medical history of upper GI problems was an important risk factor only for symptomatic (acid/peptic) upper GI events for both drugs, despite a two-fold difference in the proportion reporting previous GI problems (48.4 and 25.1% for rofecoxib and meloxicam respectively). The adjusted rate ratio of symptomatic (acid/peptic) upper GI events or complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding) for rofecoxib compared with meloxicam was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.65, 0.79) and 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.59, 1.42) respectively.

Conclusions

This study reports a relative reduction (29%) in the incidence rate of symptomatic (acid/peptic) GI events, and no difference in the incidence rate of complicated upper GI conditions (perforations/bleeding) for rofecoxib compared with meloxicam.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

Study 2 (Abdominoplasty Surgery) In the second controlled, multiple-dose trial (NCT02678286) of adult patients with postoperative pain who underwent elective abdominoplasty surgery, 219 patients were treated with meloxicam injection 30 mg or placebo administered once daily for two days starting on the day of surgery. An optional third dose was permitted just prior to discharge. A minimum postoperative baseline pain intensity of 4 on the NPRS (range 0–10) and pain categorized as moderate or severe were required for randomization. The majority of patients were female (98%). The average age was 40 years. The mean overall baseline pain intensity on the NPRS was 7.3. A statistically significant difference demonstrating efficacy was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint of the summed pain intensity difference over the first 24 hours (SPID24) as well as over the first 48 hours (SPID48). The average pain intensity over time is depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 3. A generally consistent separation in pain scores between the meloxicam injection and placebo group was observed from time of onset through most of the dosing interval with a narrowing at the end of the first 24-hour dosing interval.

Onset of Meaningful Pain Relief and Use of Rescue Analgesic Medication

The median time to first rescue analgesic use in patients treated with meloxicam injection (2 hours in Study 1 and 1 hour in Study 2) came before the median time to patient-reported meaningful pain relief in both studies (2 hours in Study 1 and 3 hours in Study 2). Fifty percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 49% of patients treated with placebo in Study 1 received rescue analgesia medication in the first 2 hours after the start of dosing. Seventy-eight percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 78% of patients treated with placebo in Study 2 received rescue in the first 3 hours after the start of dosing.

### A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib, diclofenac sodium, and meloxicam in patients with acute gouty arthritis [^1174DrJx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute attacks of gouty arthritis are characterized by the rapid onset of severe pain, swelling, and erythema of the affected joint. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are considered the drugs of first choice for treating acute gout. Rofecoxib is a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated analgesic efficacy in the setting of acute pain. Whether it is effective in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis remains to be evaluated.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib compared with diclofenac sodium sustained release (SR) and meloxicam in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.

Methods

In this single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study, patients aged ≥ 18 years with acute gout within 48 hours of onset were randomized to receive oral treatment with 2 tablets of rofecoxib (25 mg), diclofenac (75 mg), or meloxicam (7.5 mg) once daily for 7 days. The primary outcome measures were patients global assessment of response to therapy and investigator assessment of response to therapy on days 3 and 8. Other efficacy measurements included investigator assessment of total inflammatory scores on days 3 and 8 and patient assessment of pain intensity during the first 12 hours of treatment.

Results

Sixty-two patients (53 men, 9 women; mean [SD] age, 51.1 [12.1] years) were assigned to receive rofexocib (n = 20), diclofenac (n = 21), or meloxicam (n = 21). For patient global response to therapy on days 3 and 8, rofecoxib was associated with analgesic efficacy in significantly more patients compared with meloxicam (84.2% vs 40.0% of patients [P = 0.005] and 94.7% vs 60.0% of patients [P = 0.02], respectively); no significant differences versus diclofenac were found. Similarly, for investigator global assessment of response to therapy, a greater percentage of responders was found in the rofecoxib group compared with the meloxicam group on day 3 (88.9% vs 40.0% of patients [P = 0.02]), but the difference was not significant on day 8. A greater percentage of responders was found in the rofecoxib group compared with the diclofenac group on day 3 (88.9% vs 47.3% [P = 0.007]), but the difference was not significant on day 8. Compared with baseline, all regimens showed significant improvement in total inflammatory scores on days 3 and 8 (all P < 0.01). During the first 12 hours after dosing, pain intensity score was significantly reduced with rofecoxib starting at 0.5 hours (P < 0.05), but not with diclofenac or meloxicam. Clinical adverse events (AEs) were reported in 4 (20.0%), 7 (33.3%), and 6 (28.6%) patients in the rofecoxib, diclofenac, and meloxicam groups, respectively; the most common AEs reported were edema in 1 patient each in the rofecoxib (5.0%) and meloxicam (4.8%) groups and 2 patients (9.5%) in the diclofenac group and abdominal (1 [5.0%], 1 [4.8%], and 2 [9.5%], respectively). No significant differences in tolerability were found among the 3 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with acute gouty arthritis, rofecoxib 50 mg once daily provided more effective treatment than diclofenac sodium SR 150 mg and meloxicam 15 mg administered orally once daily for 7 days in ≥ 1 efficacy assessment of overall analgesic effect on day 3 or day 8. Rofecoxib achieved a rapid onset of pain relief, demonstrating significant improvement 30 minutes after dosing. All of the regimens appeared well tolerated in the population studied.

### Determinants of gastro-protective drugs co-prescription during treatment with nonselective NSAIDs: a prospective survey of 2197 patients recruited in primary care [^116vdAmZ]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to identify the magnitude of gastro-protective drugs (GPDs) co-prescription and the profile of patients who received GPD co-prescription, during nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) treatment in a "real life setting" of primary care practice.

Methods

A pragmatic prospective 6-month survey of 2197 new takers of nonselective NSAIDs, selected and followed by general practitioners (GPs) on the bias of their usual standards of care.

Results

Forty-seven percent of our survey population used at least one GPD during the 6-month follow-up. No difference was identified between piroxicam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam and nimesulid for the GPD co-prescription. Besides the presence of gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, previous use of GPD, previous occurrence of GI disorders and increase in age are the most prominent predictive factors of GPD use during NSAID treatment. When adjusted for other risk factors, co-prescription of GPD was significantly increased in patients aged 55 years and above (odds ratio (OR): 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.64) with no further increase in the co-prescription in older subjects.

Conclusion

Patients above 55 years with previous history of GI symptoms or GPD use are more likely to benefit from cytoprotective medications.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^114ExMFS]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 251 subjects were screened, 194 of whom were deemed eligible and assigned randomly to a study group. Of these, 181 (meloxicam IV, n = 93; placebo, n = 88) received ≥ 1 dose of study drug, and all treated subjects completed the study through the last visit (Figure 1). Baseline demographics, and surgical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In general, study groups were similar in terms of demographic and surgical characteristics. Most surgeries (69.1%) were able to spare or minimize invasion of the quadriceps tendon. The majority of subjects in both groups received 2 or 3 doses of study drug (Table 2).

Efficacy

With respect to the primary endpoint (opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after EOS), opioid use was significantly lower with meloxicam IV-treated subjects (18.9 mg ± 1.32 IVMED vs 27.7 mg ± 1.37 IVMED; P < .0001), corresponding to 31.7% less opioid usage during this period (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure S1). Meloxicam IV was also associated with statistically significant differences from placebo for several secondary endpoints. For example, opioid consumption was lower in the meloxicam IV group at all other time intervals, with statistically significant differences from placebo for most comparisons (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Table S1). Opioid usage was numerically lower for subjects in the meloxicam IV group during hours 24–48 (9.7% decrease; p = 0.2449) and significantly lower for subjects in the meloxicam IV group during hours 48–72 (32.1% decrease; p = 0.0306), hours 0–48 (24.3% decrease; P < .0001), hours 0–72 (25.0% decrease; P < .0001), hour 0 to end of treatment (25.9% decrease; p = 0.0002), and in the first 24 hours after discharge (19.1% decrease; P = 0.00394).

### Efficacy assessment of meloxicam, a preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation: the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in unstable angina treatment-2 (NUT-2) pilot study [^115xQaWj]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the use of heparin, aspirin, and other antiplatelet agents, acute coronary syndrome patients without ST-segment elevation remain at risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events. Given the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis, we tested the hypothesis that the combination of meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and heparin and aspirin would be superior to heparin and aspirin alone.

Methods and Results

In an open-label, randomized, prospective, single-blind pilot study, patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation were randomized to aspirin and heparin treatment (n = 60) or aspirin, heparin, and meloxicam (n = 60) during coronary care unit stay. Patients then received aspirin or aspirin plus meloxicam for 30 days. During the coronary care unit stay, the primary outcomes variable of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, or death was significantly lower in the patients receiving meloxicam (15.0% versus 38.3%, P = 0.007). The second composite variable (coronary revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, and death) was also significantly lower in meloxicam-treated patients (10.0% versus 26.7%, P = 0.034). At 90 days, the primary end point remained significantly lower in the meloxicam group (21.7% versus 48.3%, P = 0.004), as did the secondary end point (13.3% versus 33.3%, P = 0.015) and the need for revascularization alone (11.7% versus 30.0%, P = 0.025). No adverse complications associated with the meloxicam treatment were observed.

Conclusions

Meloxicam with heparin and aspirin was associated with significant reductions in adverse outcomes in acute coronary syndrome patients without ST-segment elevation. Additional larger trials are required to confirm the findings of this pilot study.

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^113mS6v8]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of meloxicam IV was investigated in three Phase 2 clinical trials using validated models for both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries, including bunionectomy, hysterectomy, and dental impaction.–In these studies, once-daily administration of meloxicam IV provided onset of analgesia as early as 15 mins post-dose, with maintenance of analgesic effect over a 24-hr period in subjects with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. The drug was generally well tolerated, with an incidence of AEs that was comparable to placebo.

In phase 3 trials using validated models of subjects with postoperative pain following soft-tissue surgery (abdominoplasty)and hard-tissue surgery (bunionectomy), subjects who received meloxicam IV had a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity versus subjects randomized to placebo. In both studies, meloxicam IV demonstrated a safety profile comparable to placebo with respect to number, severity, and frequency of AEs.

A recent phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and tolerability of meloxicam IV 30 mg in adults scheduled to undergo major elective surgery with an inpatient hospital stay > 24 hrs (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02720692). The primary objective, evaluation of meloxicam IV safety and tolerability, was assessed by incidence of AEs and serious AEs, physical examination, vital signs, clinical tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), wound evaluation, and postoperative opioid consumption. The clinical study enrolled a heterogeneous subject population in order to study the use of meloxicam IV under a wide range of procedures, including both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries. Here, the safety and tolerability findings from a subpopulation of subjects in this study who underwent orthopedic surgeries are reported.

Methods

Study Design and Subjects

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult subjects undergoing elective unilateral TKA; it was conducted in hospital settings and was planned to require a hospital stay of ≥ 24 hours. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive meloxicam IV 30 mg or placebo IV as a bolus injection every 24 hours, consistent with meloxicam dosing recommendations. The randomization scheme was generated prior to study initiation by an independent statistician who was not involved in the study. Randomization was assigned by central Interactive Web Response Systems (IWRS), with access limited to unblinded personnel. Matching placebo was utilized to prevent unblinding. Study medication was administered in addition to a multimodal pain management protocol that included perioperative use of analgesics with differing mechanisms of action. The study was designed and monitored in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by a central Institutional Review Board (Western Institutional Review Board Protocol 20172394) and the local institutional review boards of participating institutions when required. All subjects provided written informed consent. The trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03434275; Date of registration: February 15, 2018). Each study site had its own principal investigator (Supplemental Digital Content 4, Table S3).

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^111trwJh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

After receiving exemption from our institutional review board, we searched our institutional database to identify patients who received a primary TKA between January 2015 and February 2020 who used celecoxib or meloxicam for postoperative analgesia. Because meloxicam acts as a preferential COX-2 inhibitor at lower doses and a nonselective NSAID at higher does, patients taking meloxicam were further stratified into a 15 mg/d meloxicam cohort and 7.5 mg/d meloxicam cohort, and as such, three cohorts of patients were analyzed. A total of 4,994 patients were included in this study who took either celecoxib (n = 3,174), meloxicam 15 mg/d (n = 1,369), or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d (n = 451) for postoperative TKA analgesia. Baseline characteristics between the three groups were similar with the exception of a slightly higher percentage of men in the celecoxib cohort, slightly higher BMI in the meloxicam cohorts, and lower CCI in the meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohort (Table 1); however, the age-adjusted CCI demonstrated similarity among the three cohorts. Patients were either prescribed meloxicam 7.5 mg/d, meloxicam 15 mg/d, or celecoxib because of surgeon preference. Surgeons tended to choose one medication and one dosage regimen and did not switch over to another medication based on perceived risk. Patient pain protocols were otherwise similar among the three groups, and all patients were prescribed with a proton-pump inhibitor as a part of the standard of care at our institution. Patients who did not fill their prescriptions or were found to not be taking the prescription were excluded. After reviewing discharge records and patient charts, a total of 4,994 patients were included in the study.

### Intravenous meloxicam versus ketorolac for pain control following total joint arthroplasty: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113fQtsS]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although joint arthroplasty surgery is considered safe and effective in reducing osteoarthritis-related pain long-term, the surgery is known to be painful in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, optimal pain management has become a crucial goal for orthopaedic surgeons. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used but can cause adverse effects due to their mechanism of action. Meloxicam, however, has a unique mechanism of action, allowing it to better spare the gut lining, translating to reduced complications. This double-blind randomized controlled trial sought to compare intravenous (IV) meloxicam and IV ketorolac for total joint arthroplasty regarding pain scores, opioid consumption, and lengths of stay.

Methods

All other institutional protocols and medications remained unchanged. A total of 223 patients were randomized. The meloxicam group received 30 mg IV meloxicam preoperatively two hours before primary incision, while the ketorolac group received 15 mg IV ketorolac intraoperatively followed by 15 mg IV every six hours, scheduled for two doses. Pain, opioid consumption, and nausea were recorded at two and 24 hours postoperatively. An a priori power analysis demonstrated a need for 170 total patients. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05291598) and received Institutional Review Board approval.

Results

The IV meloxicam group had increased total opioid consumption 24 hours postoperatively and longer lengths of stay compared to the IV ketorolac group; however, there were no differences in pain scores or nausea.

Conclusion

The use of IV meloxicam as part of a perioperative pain management protocol led to increased opioid consumption, longer lengths of stay, and a lower rate of same-day discharges compared to IV ketorolac.

14.1 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The use of meloxicam for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled trial. Meloxicam (3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The four primary endpoints were investigator's global assessment, patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, and total WOMAC score (a self-administered questionnaire addressing pain, function, and stiffness). Patients on meloxicam 7.5 mg daily and meloxicam 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in each of these endpoints compared with placebo.

The use of meloxicam for the management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was evaluated in six double-blind, active-controlled trials outside the U.S. ranging from 4 weeks' to 6 months' duration. In these trials, the efficacy of meloxicam, in doses of 7.5 mg/day and 15 mg/day, was comparable to piroxicam 20 mg/day and diclofenac SR 100 mg/day and consistent with the efficacy seen in the U.S. trial.

The use of meloxicam for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled multinational trial. Meloxicam (7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 22.5 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The primary endpoint in this study was the ACR20 response rate, a composite measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of RA response. Patients receiving meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in the primary endpoint compared with placebo. No incremental benefit was observed with the 22.5 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^112kCQF1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of Meloxicam injection on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy subjects. A total of 48 subjects were administered intravenous meloxicam 30 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo- adjusted, baseline- corrected QTc based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.

### Is it safe to give meloxicam or celecoxib to chronically anticoagulated patients following primary total knee arthroplasty? [^114Ft57u]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are foundational components of multimodal pain protocols and have been shown to improve pain and range of motion following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy undergoing TKA are potentially disadvantaged because there are concerns with concurrent NSAID use due to bleeding concerns. Evidence suggests that cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox-2) inhibitors may not be associated with increased bleeding risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of concurrent administration of NSAIDs in chronically anticoagulated patients undergoing primary TKA.

Methods

Using an administrative claims database, we reviewed the records of 232,542 patients undergoing TKA between 2017 and 2021. Within this cohort, there were 2,299 patients who were chronically anticoagulated and 508 patients who were prescribed either celecoxib or meloxicam following TKA. The outcomes of interest included 30- and 90-day transfusion and readmission rates, rates of manipulation, and reoperations up to 180 days, and 30, 90, and 180-day opioid consumption measured as oral morphine equivalents between the two groups.

Results

Concurrent administration of NSAIDs was not associated with increased risks for blood transfusions and readmissions at 30, 90, and 180 days. The administration of NSAIDs was associated with a decrease in manipulations without an increased risk for reoperations [odds ratio (OR) 0.48, confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.82, P = 0.007]. A modest reduction in 90 (9%, P = 0.038) and 180 (10%, P = 0.040) opioid prescriptions filled was observed in anticoagulated patients receiving NSAIDs following primary TKA.

Conclusions

Concurrent administration of COX-2 NSAIDs in chronically anticoagulated patients undergoing primary TKA was not associated with increased transfusions or readmissions. Patients receiving COX-2 inhibitors had a lower risk of manipulation and reduced opioid consumption at 90 days postoperatively. These results should be interpreted with caution, and if considering NSAID therapy in anticoagulated patients, they should be closely monitored.

Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

Post-MI Patients

Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

Avoid the use of meloxicam in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If meloxicam is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic):
- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Avoid using in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Do not use in patients undergoing CABG.
- **Serious gastrointestinal adverse events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, especially in elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitor for signs of bleeding.

### Risk of serious upper gastrointestinal and cardiovascular thromboembolic complications with meloxicam [^112vXNAA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk of serious gastrointestinal and thromboembolic complications with approved doses of meloxicam.

Methods

We pooled data from clinical trials of meloxicam at doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/d. A blinded gastrointestinal adjudication committee used prespecified criteria to identify gastric or duodenal perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or hemodynamically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. For analysis of thromboembolic complications, investigator-reported events were analyzed without adjudication.

Results

We analyzed data from 24,196 patients from 28 trials, most of whom had been followed for up to 60 days. Of these patients, 13,118 received meloxicam (10,158 received a daily dose of 7.5 mg and 2960 received 15 mg), 5283 were treated with diclofenac 100 mg, 181 received diclofenac 150 mg, 5371 were treated with piroxicam 20 mg, and 243 received naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Patients who received 7.5 mg of meloxicam daily had a 0.03% risk of serious upper gastrointestinal events, which was significantly lower than the risk in those who received diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam (P < 0.02). With the 15 mg daily dose of meloxicam, this risk was significantly different only when compared with piroxicam (P = 0.03). The risk of thromboembolic events in patients treated with meloxicam at either dose was lower than with diclofenac, but similar to that observed with piroxicam and naproxen.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis of 24,196 patients demonstrates that meloxicam has a favorable gastrointestinal and thromboembolic safety profile. However, only a small number of patients were followed for more than 60 days, and meaningful comparisons were not possible in this subgroup.

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^115MidLh]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety of meloxicam IV in adult subjects undergoing major surgery, including, but not limited to, orthopedic procedures (eg, total hip or knee replacement), open or laparoscopic abdominal surgeries, or gynecological surgeries and a range of other soft-tissue surgeries (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02720692). The study was conducted at sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand between March 2016 and April 2017; all subjects provided written informed consent. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the central Institutional Review Board (IRB) with additional review by local IRBs where required and was performed according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guideline for Industry and, where applicable, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study randomization was stratified into two groups: subjects who underwent an orthopedic procedure and those who underwent a non-orthopedic procedure. This post hoc analysis evaluated the safety and opioid-reducing effects of meloxicam IV among the subgroup of subjects in the strata undergoing a range of orthopedic procedures (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of Orthopedic Surgery Types

Dosing

Subjects who met postoperative randomization eligibility criteria were randomized (3:1 using a computer-generated block randomization scheme) to IV treatment with meloxicam 30 mg or placebo, administered as a bolus injection every 24 hrs. Randomization was stratified by subjects greater than 65 years with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 60‒89 mL/min/1.73 m²) versus other. Subjects received the first dose of study medication within 6 hrs of the end of surgery, with additional doses administered as clinically appropriate up to a maximum of seven doses.

Concomitant NSAIDs were prohibited within 7 days prior to surgery. During surgery, subjects received the standard of care anesthesia and analgesic regimens (excluding the use of NSAID medication) according to the clinical practice of the surgeon based on the surgery type. Subjects with inadequately controlled pain could receive standard of care rescue medication. Although opioid analgesics were the most common type of rescue medication, any rescue analgesic (except for other NSAIDs) was acceptable according to the standard practice of the study site.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^1154iFfP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study contains all the weaknesses that are present in retrospective reviews. Because we established cohorts based on what TKA patients were prescribed, the retrospective nature of the study means that patients who were prescribed may not have been taking celecoxib or meloxicam as instructed. Nonetheless, we reviewed the discharge medications of those who had a discharge record present in our system and whether celecoxib or meloxicam use was mentioned in patient chart note search to improve the accuracy of our data. About our primary end point, GI bleeding/ulceration, we were underpowered because of the low incidence of these complications in our cohort. The low incidence of GI complications and thus the underpowered findings may be attributable to the rarity of the complication. At our institution, the historical rate of GI complications after TJA from 2008 to 2019 was 0.6% (102/17,402 patients), and peptic ulcer disease was found to be a notable risk factor. In our study, 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0% of patients in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohorts, respectively, had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease (P = 1.0), suggesting that patients in our study had low GI risk in general. Furthermore, our institutional guidelines limit the prescription of NSAIDS to patients with serious GI risk. Therefore, we believe that these variables, taken together, should not detract from the findings of our study and that these results offer the best available evidence on NSAIDS and postoperative complications in TKA. We would encourage prospective studies to corroborate our findings. We also could not evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of the medications used at various dosages. Nevertheless, clinical practice guidelines dictate that irrespective of COX-1/COX-2 selectivity, there is no difference in analgesic effectiveness among NSAIDs. Although we used average retail costs, in practice, the cost of prescriptions may vary depending on insurance coverage, rebate, and discount programs at pharmacies. The strengths of our study include having the largest retrospective comparative study of the safety profile of NSAIDS in the realm of TJA and having a large cohort size of patients, showing that our results have external validity.
