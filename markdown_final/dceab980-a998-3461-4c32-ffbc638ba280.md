## Question

What causes complete right opacification of hemithorax

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes complete right hemithorax opacification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core radiographic definition and the immediate implications for mediastinal shift. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic buckets that can produce this appearance. Next, I will prioritize the most common causes and outline a practical diagnostic approach anchored in chest radiography, ultrasound, and CT. Finally, I will consider age-specific differentials and special scenarios, and close with a concise synthesis that ties mechanism to management implications.

> Let me first confirm the radiographic construct: complete right hemithorax opacification implies the entire right lung field is uniformly opaque on chest radiograph, which practically mandates either massive pleural effusion, complete lung collapse/atelectasis, or a very large intrathoracic mass, and it is typically accompanied by mediastinal shift away from the opacity if the process is compressive or volume-losing, whereas consolidation alone usually does not shift the mediastinum unless it is extensive and associated with volume loss [^b26322c3] [^37ffb6b4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the major etiologic categories. The causes consistently fall into four buckets: pleural space disease (effusion, empyema, hemothorax, chylothorax), parenchymal/airway disease with complete collapse or consolidation, intrathoracic masses compressing or replacing lung, and postoperative or congenital anatomic variants that mimic these processes, and this framework aligns with pediatric and adult case series as well as radiology reviews of unilateral hemithorax opacification [^b26322c3] [^fa03cfb1] [^bcdc05c1].

> I will now examine pleural etiologies first because they are the most common cause of a "white hemithorax". Massive pleural effusions, particularly malignant effusions, can completely opacify a hemithorax and displace the mediastinum contralaterally; large series show malignancy accounts for roughly half of massive effusions, with parapneumonic/empyema and tuberculosis also prominent, and bedside ultrasound can rapidly distinguish effusion from consolidation or mass and guide thoracentesis for diagnosis and symptom relief [^37ffb6b4] [^5741d46f] [^65c0deaa]. Wait, let me verify pediatric nuances: in children, large effusions from infection or chylothorax are common, and ultrasound is recommended as the second-line modality to characterize effusions and detect septations or loculations that change management [^fa03cfb1] [^b26322c3].

> Next, I should review complete lung collapse or atelectasis as a cause. Endobronchial obstruction from tumor, mucus plug, or foreign body can cause total lung collapse with mediastinal shift toward the affected side; bronchoscopy has better radiologic outcomes than conservative therapy for near-complete or complete collapse, and case series document carcinoid tumors, mucus plugging in ABPA, and even lobar torsion producing complete opacification with shift, so I need to ensure I do not miss a removable endobronchial cause [^e56caff6] [^3dffcb27] [^f405ecb0] [^651ae75d]. But wait, what if the shift is away from the opacity? That pattern pushes me back toward effusion rather than pure collapse, so I should double-check the direction of mediastinal displacement on the radiograph before concluding [^b26322c3].

> Let me consider large intrathoracic masses that can fill or compress the hemithorax. Primary pleural or chest wall tumors such as solitary fibrous tumor, liposarcoma, ganglioneuroma, and rhabdomyosarcoma can occupy much of a hemithorax and mimic effusion or collapse; CT is essential to define size, origin, and relationship to vessels and bronchi, and to guide biopsy when indicated [^06f258cf] [^f81d6c48] [^6296d457] [^d9d5ba19]. I should confirm that these masses often show contralateral mediastinal shift and may abut the chest wall or diaphragm, which helps distinguish them from purely pleural or parenchymal processes on imaging [^notfound].

> I need to check postoperative and congenital scenarios that can mimic these findings. After pneumonectomy, the pneumonectomy space gradually fills with fluid and can appear as a uniformly opacified hemithorax with mediastinal shift toward the operated side; failure to fill or a falling air-fluid level should prompt evaluation for bronchopleural fistula or other complications, and this is a classic pitfall if surgical history is unknown [^b6809d07] [^f427636f]. Congenital agenesis or aplasia of a lung can present with opacified hemithorax and dramatic contralateral herniation; CT can show a rudimentary bronchus in aplasia versus complete absence in agenesis, which prevents mislabeling as post-surgical change [^fb96ce18].

> Now, I should outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach and make sure I am not missing a rapidly reversible cause. Start with a careful chest radiograph to confirm complete opacification and document mediastinal shift and diaphragmatic position; then proceed to bedside ultrasound to distinguish effusion from consolidation or mass and to guide thoracentesis if fluid is present; if ultrasound is inconclusive or a mass/collapse is suspected, obtain contrast-enhanced chest CT to define anatomy and plan interventions such as bronchoscopy, drainage, or biopsy; in children, prioritize ultrasound to minimize radiation and escalate to CT only if necessary [^b26322c3] [^5741d46f] [^65c0deaa]. Hold on, I should verify that bronchoscopy is indicated for suspected endobronchial obstruction or unexplained complete collapse, given its diagnostic and therapeutic yield in complete atelectasis [^e56caff6].

> Let me think about age-specific differentials so I do not overgeneralize. In adults, malignant pleural effusion, lung cancer with collapse, and large pleural-based tumors predominate, whereas in children, massive parapneumonic effusions, empyema, chylothorax, and congenital anomalies such as pulmonary agenesis/aplasia or CPAM are more likely; trauma-related hemothorax and postoperative changes also enter the differential depending on context [^37ffb6b4] [^b26322c3] [^fa03cfb1]. I should double-check for infectious etiologies like tuberculosis in the right demographic and consider fungal disease in immunocompromised hosts, as these can present with large effusions or destructive lung lesions that mimic malignancy [^37ffb6b4] [^be0ac68e].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought consolidation alone could explain complete hemithorax opacification, but I should correct that. Extensive consolidation can approach complete opacification, yet it typically lacks the mediastinal shift seen with effusion or total collapse unless there is substantial volume loss; thus, the presence and direction of mediastinal shift are pivotal in narrowing the differential and should be verified on the initial radiograph before committing to a pathway [^b26322c3] [^37ffb6b4]. I also need to remember that rounded atelectasis and other pleural-based pseudotumors can mimic masses, so correlating with prior films and using CT features helps avoid unnecessary resection [^68e0a72d].

> In summary, complete right hemithorax opacification reflects a limited but high-stakes differential: massive pleural effusion, complete lung collapse from endobronchial obstruction, a large intrathoracic mass, or postoperative/congenital anatomic changes. Rapid recognition with chest radiography, targeted ultrasound, and selective CT, followed by timely thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, or tissue diagnosis, enables appropriate management and can be lifesaving when airway compromise or malignant disease is present [^b26322c3] [^5741d46f] [^e56caff6].

Complete right hemithorax opacification is most often due to **massive pleural effusion** (malignant, empyema, hemothorax, chylothorax) [^37ffb6b4] or **complete right lung collapse** from endobronchial obstruction (tumor, mucus plug, foreign body) [^e56caff6] [^f405ecb0]. Other causes include large intrathoracic masses (lung cancer, lymphoma, sarcoma) [^35fd9655], massive consolidation (pneumonia, ARDS) [^e658a925], or post-pneumonectomy changes [^b6809d07]. Key distinguishing features include mediastinal shift (away with effusion, toward with collapse), air bronchograms (consolidation), and surgical history (post-pneumonectomy) [^b26322c3] [^b6809d07]. Diagnosis relies on **chest X-ray**, **ultrasound**, and **contrast-enhanced CT** [^b26322c3] [^5741d46f]; urgent management is guided by the underlying cause, with thoracentesis or bronchoscopy as first-line interventions when indicated [^e56caff6].

## Common causes of complete right hemithorax opacification

### Pleural effusion

- **Malignant pleural effusion**: The most common cause of massive effusions, often from lung, breast, or ovarian cancer [^37ffb6b4] [^cad5f254].
- **Empyema**: Complicated parapneumonic effusions can fill the hemithorax [^37ffb6b4].
- **Hemothorax**: Trauma, surgery, or malignancy can cause large hemorrhagic effusions [^9f0fb7bd].
- **Chylothorax**: Thoracic duct injury or malignancy can cause lymphatic effusions [^1016b953].

---

### Lung collapse (atelectasis)

- **Endobronchial obstruction**: Tumors (e.g. carcinoid, lung cancer), mucus plugs (e.g. ABPA), or foreign bodies can cause complete right lung collapse [^e56caff6] [^f405ecb0].
- **Postoperative atelectasis**: Common after thoracic surgery or prolonged ventilation [^3865ada6].
- **External compression**: Large masses or lymphadenopathy can compress bronchi, causing collapse [^a0800f16].

---

### Consolidation

- **Pneumonia**: Severe bacterial or viral pneumonia can cause extensive consolidation [^e658a925].
- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Bilateral or unilateral opacification can occur [^94f320e1].
- **Pulmonary hemorrhage**: Alveolar bleeding can mimic consolidation [^notfound].

---

### Intrapulmonary or pleural masses

Large intrathoracic masses — such as **lung cancer**, **lymphoma**, **sarcoma**, or **solitary fibrous tumor** — can opacify the hemithorax [^35fd9655] [^06f258cf]. Pleural tumors like **mesothelioma** or **pleural sarcoma** can also present this way [^f81d6c48].

---

### Post-pneumonectomy changes

After pneumonectomy, the right hemithorax gradually fills with fluid and appears opacified on imaging [^b6809d07] [^f427636f].

## Radiographic features and diagnostic approach

| **Cause** | **Mediastinal shift** | **Air bronchograms** | **Diagnostic imaging** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pleural effusion | Away from opacity | Absent | - Ultrasound <br/> - CT [^5741d46f] |
| Lung collapse | Toward opacity | Absent | - CT <br/> - Bronchoscopy [^e56caff6] |
| Consolidation | None or minimal | Present | - CT <br/> - Clinical correlation [^notfound] |
| Mass lesion | Variable | Variable | - CT <br/> - MRI <br/> - Biopsy [^d9d5ba19] |
| Post-pneumonectomy | Toward opacity | Absent | - Clinical history <br/> - CT [^b6809d07] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Pleural effusion**: Thoracentesis for diagnosis and symptom relief; consider pleurodesis or indwelling catheter for recurrent effusions [^e1c76d98].
- **Lung collapse**: Urgent bronchoscopy for obstruction removal; treat underlying cause [^e56caff6].
- **Consolidation**: Antibiotics for infection; supportive care for ARDS or hemorrhage [^e658a925].
- **Mass lesion**: Biopsy for diagnosis; surgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy based on pathology [^d9d5ba19].
- **Post-pneumonectomy**: Routine surveillance; investigate if rapid change or new symptoms occur [^b6809d07].

---

Complete right hemithorax opacification reflects a limited but high-stakes differential — **effusion, collapse, consolidation, mass, or post-pneumonectomy** — and requires prompt imaging and targeted intervention to restore ventilation and establish the diagnosis [^b26322c3].

## References

### Oesophageal lung: a rare cause of complete hemithorax opacification [^0eb6da2c]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Congenital bronchopulmonary foregut anomalies are uncommon group of disorders that reflect upon the embryological development of the foregut. These conditions represent the intimate embryological proximity of the foregut and tracheobronchial tree. The radiological findings are typically of segmental or lobar consolidation with abnormal vascular supply or foregut communication. We report a case of a breathless neonate with oesophageal origin of the right main bronchus. This communication was well demonstrated with the help of an oesophagogram. The radiologist plays an important role by identifying this communication on a CT done for non-resolving lung collapse. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest is also useful in evaluating the vascular supply of the lung that helps in diagnosis and also directs treatment.

### Cough-induced chylothorax in a two-year-old boy-case report and review of the literature [^1016b953]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chylothorax is a very rare form of pleural effusion in children, especially after the neonatal period, and predominantly occurs secondary to cardiothoracic surgery. It can lead to significant respiratory distress, immunodeficiency, and malnutrition. Effective treatment strategies are therefore required to reduce morbidity.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy two-year old boy was admitted with history of heavy coughing followed by progressive dyspnea. The chest X-ray showed an extensive opacification of the right lung. Ultrasound studies revealed a large pleural effusion of the right hemithorax. Pleural fluid analysis delivered the unusual diagnosis of chylothorax, most likely induced by preceded excessive coughing. After an unsuccessful treatment attempt with a fat-free diet and continuous pleural drainage for two weeks, therapy with octreotide was initiated. This led to complete and permanent resolution of his pleural effusion within 15 days, without any side effects.

Conclusions

Severe cough may be a rare cause of chylothorax in young children. Octreotide seems to be an effective and safe treatment of spontaneous or traumatic chylothorax in children. There is, however, a lack of comprehensive studies for chylothorax in children and many issues concerning diagnostic strategies and treatment algorithms remain.

### White hemithorax in children [^fa03cfb1]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this pictorial review is to introduce the radiologist to the differential diagnosis of a white hemithorax in children, to provide significant information on the diagnostic work-up, and to promote radiation-free techniques whenever possible. There are many causes of white hemithorax in children and it can be due to a variety of chest disorders. In most cases, plain chest radiographs and ultrasound will suffice. However, additional information provided by, e.g., CT or MRI is sometimes required.

### Pulmonary kaposi sarcoma presenting as complete lung consolidation [^c7a60028]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The patient in our case presented with progressive dyspnoea and cough. Chest radiograph reveals complete opacification of the hemithorax. Complete lung consolidation was not seen on chest CT. The patient in this case had extensive pulmonary and endobronchial Kaposi sarcoma (KS) that led to complete consolidation of the right lung that was diagnosed via bronchoscopy. After diagnosis, he was restarted on antiretroviral therapy and single-agent chemotherapy for treatment of pulmonary KS.

### Complete right lung agenesis presenting with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis [^a6b58d75]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 26 year-old lady presented with episodic breathlessness, chest tightness, recurrent nasal obstruction and excessive sneezing, mainly during change of season along with opacity of the right hemithorax on chest x-ray. Further detailed work-up including spirometry, high-resolution CT scan of the thorax and fibre-optic bronchoscopy confirmed complete right lung agenesis in patients with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. Complete control of symptoms was achieved with formeterol 6 μg and mometasone 200 μg (via dry powder inhaler) and intranasal fluticasone 50 μg (nasal spray) 2 puffs twice daily and oral montelukast 10 mg with levocetirizine 5 mg once daily.

### Etiology and pleural fluid characteristics of large and massive effusions [^37ffb6b4]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To report the etiology of large and massive pleural effusions, and to compare their biochemical fluid characteristics with those of smaller size, and between malignant and nonmalignant conditions.

Design

Retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing thoracentesis at an academic medical center in Lleida, Spain, during a 10-year period.

Patients

Posteroanterior chest radiographs were available in 766 patients during the study period. Large pleural effusions (ie, two thirds or more of the hemithorax without its complete obliteration) were identified in 70 patients (9%), and massive pleural effusions (ie, hemithorax was completely opacified) were identified in 93 patients (12%).

Results

A similar etiologic spectrum between large and massive pleural effusions was observed. The most frequent cause of these pleural effusions was malignancy (89 patients; 55%), followed by complicated parapneumonic or empyema (36 patients; 22%), and tuberculosis (19 patients; 12%). Compared with nonmalignant pleural effusions, patients with large or massive malignant pleural effusions were more likely to have pleural fluids with higher RBC counts (18.0 x 10(9) cells/L vs 2.7 x 10(9) cells/L, respectively; p < 0.001) and lower adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity (11.5 vs 31.5 U/L, respectively; p < 0.001), which were the two parameters that were selected by a stepwise logistic-regression model as independent predictors of malignancy. In addition, large/massive malignant pleural effusions showed higher median RBC counts (18.0 x 10(9) cells/L vs 4.3 x 10(9) cells/L, respectively; p < 0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (641 vs 409 U/L, respectively; p = 0.001), lower pH (7.39 vs 7.42, respectively; p = 0.006) content, but similar cytologic yield (63% vs 53%, respectively; p = 0.171) than smaller malignant pleural effusions.

Conclusions

The presence of a large or massive pleural effusion enables the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis of pleurisy, since most effusions are secondary to malignancy or infections (either bacterial or mycobacterial). Bloody pleural fluid with low ADA content favors a malignant condition.

### Near complete obliteration of the left hemithorax by congenital lobar emphysema in an adult [^49d64b43]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Congenital lobar emphysema is a rare pulmonary malformation typically diagnosed during infancy and is characterized by bullous disease. A 28-year-old woman, who presented with 1 week of progressive dyspnea and chest pain, was found to have left hemithoracic lung hyperinflation with perfusion deficit upon radiographic evaluation. Bullous disease was found intraoperatively to originate from 1 lower lobe segment. Normal parenchymal lung expansion occurred following resection of the affected segment. Therefore, we present a rare case of congenital lobar emphysema resulting in near-complete occupancy of the left hemithorax and diagnosed in a previously asymptomatic adult without history of predisposing factors.

### Scan the lung: point-of-care ultrasound of a pulmonary consolidation with loculated pleural effusion [^5741d46f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thoracic ultrasound has become an increasingly valuable tool in the evaluation of critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED). The utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to identify suspected pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and pneumonia has been well established (Pagano et al.; Brogi et al.; Cortellaro et al.; Irwin and Cook [1-4]). The 2014 American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Ultrasound Imaging Compendium included lung and pleural ultrasound with the primary indication of identifying pneumothorax and pleural effusion as part of the core POCUS indications for all emergency physicians [5]. We present a unique case in which a patient presented to the ED in respiratory distress. Portable chest X-ray demonstrated near complete opacification of his right hemithorax. POCUS demonstrated a large right sided loculated pleural effusion with associated septations and surrounding consolidation suggestive of a parapneumonic effusion.

### Cough-induced chylothorax in a two-year-old boy-case report and review of the literature [^ce720905]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A two-year-old boy was referred to our emergency department by his pediatrician due to progressive dyspnea, asymmetric breathing sounds by auscultation and fatigue. The boy was born at term and had no pertinent past medical history.

During the 15 days prior to hospitalization, the boy suffered from a heavy paroxysmal cough without fever. Outpatient treatment consisted of salbutamol inhalation and systemic prednisolone administration leading only to short-term alleviation of his symptoms.

At the time of admission, clinical examination revealed symptoms of respiratory distress with intercostal and subcostal retractions. Breathing sounds over the right lung were absent. Vital signs were stable and venous blood gas analysis did not show signs of respiratory insufficiency.

Chest X-ray showed a complete white-out of the right hemithorax with left mediastinal shift (Fig. 2 B). Ultrasound studies revealed an extensive right-sided pleural effusion with caudal shift of the diaphragm and liver (Fig. 2 D). The boy was admitted to our intensive care unit for close monitoring and further evaluation. A contrast enhanced CT Thorax displayed no evidence of malignancy, no signs of pleural inflammation, thrombosis, contrast medium leak or lymphatic malformation. We performed a thoracentesis with fractioned pleural fluid aspiration of 1200 ml milky-cloudy fluid.

### Blastomyces gilchristii as cause of fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome [^e658a925]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Study

A 27-year-old woman sought care at an emergency department in a rural community in northwestern Ontario, Canada, for a nonproductive cough, right-sided chest heaviness, nausea, and abdominal pain that had developed over the previous week. She had a previous diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus and a history of intravenous drug use.

On examination, deep and labored breathing was observed, and decreased air entry in the left upper lung was heard on auscultation. A chest radiograph revealed left upper lobe consolidation (Figure 1, panel A). Blood chemical analysis revealed diabetic ketoacidosis (25.4 mmol/L glucose, 3.2 mmol/L K+, 6.0 mmol/L HCO 3 −, anion gap 27 mg/dL, and pH 7.0 venous blood gas). Intravenous fluoroquinolone was administered for suspected left upper lobe bacterial pneumonia, and fluid resuscitation and intravenous insulin were administered for diabetic ketoacidosis.

A) Day 0: posterior–anterior (PA) chest radiograph at initial emergency department examination. Discrete confluent left upper lobe consolidation with air bronchograms are visible. B) Day 5, 15:10: PA chest radiograph demonstrating complete confluent opacification of the left hemithorax with extensive air bronchograms. C) Day 6, 23:30: PA chest radiograph postintubation with confluent left lung consolidation and new right patchy airspace opacification. Arrow indicates the correct placement of a nasogastric tube.

During the first 2 days in hospital, the patient was stable and afebrile, despite remaining tachycardic and tachypneic. From day 3 to day 4, the patient became febrile (38.3°C) and tachypnea worsened to the point that >4 L of O 2 was required to maintain O 2 saturation >90%. The patient’s leukocyte count was elevated at 13.5 × 10 9 cells/L.

### Radiographic evaluation of the pleural fluid accumulation rate after pneumonectomy [^f427636f]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Understanding the radiographic appearance and normal rate of fluid accumulation after pneumonectomy is important in order to detect postoperative complications.

Methods

Upright posterior-anterior chest radiographs of 94 postpneumonectomy patients were assessed for the rate of pleural fluid accumulation as a percentage of hemithorax volume.

Results

Overall median time to 70% hemithoracic opacification was 3 days and mean time was 27 days. The median time to 100% opacification was 66 days and mean time was 96 days.

Conclusion

The median time to 70% hemithoracic opacification postpneumonectomy is 3 days, while median time to 100% opacification was 66 days.

### Expanding upon the unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax in children [^373fa5f2]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax is a common pediatric chest radiographic finding that may also be seen at computed tomography. It may result from congenital or acquired conditions involving the pulmonary parenchyma, airway, pulmonary vasculature, pleural space, and chest wall, as well as from technical factors such as patient rotation. Unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax has a broad differential diagnosis that includes unilateral emphysematous or bullous disease, pneumatocele, foreign body aspiration, Swyer-James syndrome, congenital lobar emphysema, endobronchial mass, unilateral pulmonary agenesis, proximal interruption of the pulmonary artery, scimitar syndrome, diaphragmatic hernia, and Poland syndrome. Although certain causes of unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax are clinically significant and potentially life threatening, others are of minimal or no clinical significance. When evaluating a patient with this finding, it is important to establish whether the apparent unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax is truly too lucent (hypoattenuating) or if the contralateral hemithorax is too opaque (hyperattenuating). It is imperative that radiologists be aware of the various causes of unilateral hyperlucent hemithorax so that they may diagnose the underlying condition and appropriately guide patient management.

### Integrated diagnostic imaging of primary thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma [^d9d5ba19]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We report a rare case of primary thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma in a girl who was referred with acute chest pain, hacking cough, and wheezing. A chest X-ray revealed a complete opacity of the right hemithorax. Ultrasound revealed a right-sided pleural effusion and a solid mass above the liver dome, suggesting a neoplastic disease, which quickly led to further specific examination. Use of CT and MRI together with bone scintigraphy completed the investigation. The biopsy specimen showed a pattern of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This case was reported to emphasize the role of US in the evaluation of a child with hemithorax opacity.

### Unilateral lung whiteout in children: four cases and a discussion of management [^bcdc05c1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Unilateral lung whiteout is caused by several conditions, and etiologies tend to vary according to age. To elucidate the etiologies, a review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE to search for articles published between January 1985 and December 2015. The search terms included “unilateral lung whiteout” and “opaque hemithorax.” The inclusion criteria for the search were articles written in English concerning patients with unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax. Exclusion criteria included case studies of unilateral lung whiteout or opaque hemithorax with no specific extractable data and articles written in a language other than English. Etiologies are summarized in Table 1. Five etiologies are the most common in all ages, but additional less common etiologies also occur, varying by age. – In our case reports, we present patients with four of the most common etiologies. Table 2 provides a summary of these 4 cases.

TABLE 1 
Etiologies of Unilateral Lung Whiteout

TABLE 2 
Summary of the Cases

A comparison of similarities and differences in clinical characteristics is worthy of discussion. In our first 3 cases, all of the patients were between 1 and 2 years old and presented with acute respiratory distress. All three had tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, decreased unilateral breath sounds, and decreased unilateral chest wall motion. Detailed physical examination of the chest, including not only auscultation but also inspection, palpation, and percussion, provided very helpful clues leading to elucidation of the type of intrathoracic pathology involved in the unilateral lung whiteout. Although the condition of patients presenting to the ED may be critical, physicians should make an effort to carry out a detailed physical examination. We cannot emphasize enough the importance of a focused physical examination.

Normal post-operative anatomy

A. Wedge resection and segmentectomy Wedge resection is a non-anatomic sublobar resection, whereas segmentectomy corresponds to an anatomic sublobar resection of one to four segments. CXR and CT show a linear increased density due to a parenchymal staple line (Fig. 1). At early stage, a small area of peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidation can be observed on CT images, reflecting contusion and haemorrhage. Fig. 1 Wedge resection. Axial CT image (parenchymal window) shows a linear increased density due to a parenchymal staple line (black arrow)
B. Lobectomy and bilobectomy One or two lobes are resected, resulting in a significant loss of volume, with compensation by expansion and reorientation of the remaining lobe(s), associated with mediastinal deviation and displacement of the bronchovascular hilar structures. Post-operative monitoring consists of a daily CXR, on which the positioning of the drain(s) is evaluated, as well as the re-expansion of the remaining homolateral lobe(s) (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Post-operative radiograph of a right lower lobe resection. CXR allows visualisation of the drains in postero-basal (black arrow) and antero-apical (white arrow) positions The early post-operative aspect consists in a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax of low abundance, parietal emphysema and retraction of the hemithorax. After a few days and weeks, a decrease in the signs of retraction and an expansion of the remaining lobe(s) appear. Later on, imaging shows retraction of the operated hemithorax, mediastinal attraction, filling of the costo-diaphragmatic recess, elevation of the diaphragmatic dome, hilar displacement and pulmonary hyperlucency (related to compensatory hyperinflation with relative vascular rarefaction); parietal sequelae and surgical material persist. Chest X-ray can demonstrate juxta-phrenic peak sign or a pseudo-lobar collapse aspect that can be misleading for atelectasis if the operating history is not known by the radiologist (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Lobar pseudo-collapse and juxta-phrenic peak sign. A : CXR showing a left upper lobar pseudo-collapse (white arrow). B : right juxta-phrenic peak sign (white arrowhead) Scissure changes and displacement may vary according to the site of lobectomy. Left upper lobectomy: imaging shows an ascension of the lower lobe with its scissural aspect facing the anterior upper mediastinum where a fluid collection can appear and persist permanently or be secondarily replaced by fibrous tissue. Left lower lobectomy: downward and backward movement of the lingula. Right upper lobectomy: upward displacement of the middle lobe and the apical segment of the lower lobe, revealing a frontally oriented cranial neoscissure in the extension of the initial oblique scissure. Right middle lobectomy: slight loss of lung volume, with merging of the upper and lower lobes, revealing an oblique caudal neoscissure. Right lower lobectomy: downward displacement of the dorsal segment of the upper lobe and rearward displacement of the middle lobe, showing an axially oriented posterior neoscissure; there may be a notable variation, with a greater displacement of the dorsal segment of the upper lobe extending to the diaphragm. Bilobectomy: the loss of volume is much greater, with mediastinal deviation on the operated side and diaphragmatic ascent; in case of missing information, it is possible to identify the residual lobe by looking at the vessels and the bronchial tree (Fig. 4).

C. Pneumonectomy Corresponds to the resection of an entire lung with or without resection of the parietal pleura. Post-operative monitoring consists of a daily CXR that visualises the evolution of the pneumonectomy cavity. In the early post-operative period, an air-filled cavity with parietal and sometimes mediastinal emphysema is visualised in the immediate aftermath, with the trachea and mediastinum in median position. A progressive accumulation of liquid is observed with the appearance of an air–fluid level. The cavity fills at a rate of about two intercostal spaces per day. The key point to remember is that the air–fluid level reaches the upper half or two-thirds of the hemithorax in 4 to 7 days. Complete filling occurs after a few weeks or months. Absence of filling or decrease in the level should raise concern for complication. The trachea and mediastinum gradually move to the operated side, with ascent of the diaphragmatic dome and intercostal pinch on the same side. The contralateral lung undergoes compensatory expansion and becomes hypoattenuating due to vascular rarefaction (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Pneumonectomy cavity evolution. A : First post-operative CXR in the hours following left pneumonectomy, with a chest tube in antero-apical position. B : Day 3 CXR with progressive filling of the pneumonectomy cavity. C : Day 7 CXR on which you can see that the air–fluid level reaches two-thirds of the pneumonectomy cavity. D : CXR after 2 months showing a complete filling of the cavity Later, the pulmonary arterial stump may be the site of an alluvial thrombus (Fig. 6), generally non-pathological if it is not progressive. A long bronchial stump may be the site of an accumulation of secretions of fluid like and sometimes tissular attenuation on unenhanced chest CT. In such case, contrast uptake would suggest local recurrence or superimposed infection. Mediastinal deviation on the side of the pneumonectomy is seen at variable degrees. Possible parietal sequelae that can consist of costal reshaping, herniation of the parietal fat at the site of thoracic wall resection, lymph node removal clips and possibly a high attenuation Goretex prosthesis can be present in case of diaphragmatic surgery. Fig. 6 Alluvial thrombus. Axial CT image (mediastinal window) showing an alluvial thrombus in the left pulmonary arterial stump (black arrow) An interposition flap may cover the bronchial stump and show fatty attenuation. Finally, normal evolution of the post-pneumonectomy space can be towards complete resorption or the persistence of a residual pouch.
D. Sleeve lobectomy It is an alternative to pneumonectomy when the tumour invades the origin of a lobar bronchus or when N1 nodes are fixed at the origin of the lobar bronchus to be resected. This technique has the advantage of preserving a better inspiratory reserve than pneumonectomy. An enlarged lobectomy is performed to remove the invaded bronchial division with reimplantation of the remaining lobe on the main bronchus via a termino-terminal anastomosis, with or without arterial reimplantation. This surgery mostly involves the right upper lobe because of the advantage of the relative length of the intermediate bronchus allowing for reimplantation (Table 1, Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Schematic figure of sleeve lobectomy. Left: tumour involving the proximal right upper lobe bronchus is resected along with a segment of the intermediate bronchus with negative margins along with a segment of the intermediate bronchus.

### Massive pulmonary pseudotumor [^d616ffa4]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The term pulmonary pseudotumor may be used to describe a well-demarcated interlobar pleural effusion. Pseudotumors are located within pulmonary fissures and are commonly associated with congestive heart failure and other processes that cause transudative pleural effusions. Pseudotumors are typically diagnosed presumptively on chest radiographs based on their lenticular configuration. We report a case of a massive pseudotumor opacifying one third of the right hemithorax on a frontal radiograph. CT scan of the chest showed a loculated effusion within the oblique fissure measuring 10 x 5 cm. The Hounsfield unit characteristic of the effusion was similar to that of freely layering liquid in the contralateral hemithorax that was shown to be a transudate. The pseudotumor resolved with medical management over 8 weeks. This case proves that even a massive pulmonary pseudotumor will resolve with conservative management.

Radiological findings

Chest radiograph findings

PA chest X-ray showed diffuse opacity of a whole hemithorax with severe ipsilateral mediastinal deviation, mimicking an almost complete lung collapse, in one case. The remaining 12 patients presented with a small hemithorax with aireated lung secondary to contralateral lung herniation and/or cystic bronchiectasis or cavitated lesions. Lateral projection showed retrosternal hyperclarity in all patients in relation to the existence of lung herniation contralateral to the UTLD.

CT findings

On retrospective review of the CT, the patients were classifiable in two main patterns: unilateral lung destruction with residual cystic bronchiectasis (11/13, 85%) (Fig. 1) and unilateral lung destruction without residual cystic bronchiectasis (2/13, 15%) (Fig. 2). There was a clear left-sided predominance (11/13, 85%). All patients with UTLD presented three common findings: a decrease in the diameter of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins of the affected lung (Fig. 3), anterior and posterior (retrocardiac) herniation of the contralateral lung (Fig. 1c) and hypertrophy of the ribs and/or an increased extrapleural fat. The contralateral lung herniation consisted of anterior herniation of the upper lobe or middle lobe (12/13, 92%) or posterior herniation of the lower lobe (11/13, 85%), with both lobes being affected simultaneously in most cases (10/13, 77%).

The pharyngeal airway at the level shown has been completely obliterated by haematoma and oedema. Pharyngeal projectile penetrating injuries, in the absence of major vascular injury, are frequently fatal due to airway compromise from haematoma, oedematous swelling and haemorrhagic debris. b Axial CT image of the same patient as in 8a on bone-window settings through the superior oropharynx (slightly inferior to the level in a). There is fracture disruption of the right lateral mass of the atlas (C1) at the junction with the anterior arch as well as fracture of the posterior aspect of the right ramus of the mandible cause by the bullet (which exited through zone 2 on this side). Soft tissue emphysema and swelling is evident in the right prevertebral, parapahryngeal and masticator spaces. The endotracheal tube is demonstrated. c Non-contrast CT brain of the same patient as in a and b performed 2 days later, demonstrating severe generalised hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy with symmetrical subacute low attenuation change identified in the basal ganglia at this level as well as evidence of significant cerebral oedema and swelling.

### A rare complication of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery identified by point-of-care ultrasound [^a0800f16]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Point-of-care ultrasound is a valuable tool in the evaluation of undifferentiated respiratory distress in children. This case report describes a 9-month-old male infant who presented with 4 months of progressively worsening cough and was found to be tachypneic in the emergency department. Chest radiography revealed complete opacification of the left hemithorax with cardiomegaly. Point-of-care ultrasound demonstrated atelectasis of the entire left lung and severe dilation of the left ventricle with poor function. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings were consistent with a diagnosis of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. The patient underwent successful cardiac surgery to improve myocardial perfusion. Bronchoscopy visualized the etiology of his atelectasis, pulsatile compression of the left mainstem bronchus by the dilated heart. Focused cardiac and lung ultrasound techniques, as well as pertinent sonographic findings, are reviewed.

Fig. 1 
Anterior-Posterior Chest X-Ray at 5 h of Age, Right Lung Field Homogenous Opacification

Difficulties with oxygenation continued, prompting addition of inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm) to the HFOV ventilatory regimen. Echocardiogram at that time demonstrated elevated right ventricular pressures based on intraventricular septum flattening as well as mild right ventricular dilation and low-normal right ventricular systolic function. Left ventricular systolic function was normal. A patent foramen ovale with bidirectional shunting as well as a moderate patent ductus arteriosus with left-to-right shunting were seen, but the heart was otherwise structurally normal. A dopamine infusion as well as stress-dose hydrocortisone were instituted for the treatment of hypotension. Over the course of one week, the respiratory status began to gradually deteriorate despite continuation of maximal ventilator support. The infant was successfully, though briefly, converted to SIMV in order to obtain the previously recommended CT scan of the chest to better define the lung lesion and guide management. Chest CT with contrast (Fig. 2) revealed a large area of a relatively homogeneous soft tissue density involving the majority of the right hemithorax with sparing of the right inferior hemithorax and extension across midline with left lateral displacement of the anterior junction line. Notably, a focus of loculated air density with irregular margins was noted in this area and measured 1.9 cm x 1.3 cm x 1.9 cm. A normal distribution of bronchi and pulmonary vascular structures was seen coursing throughout this area of opacification. No systemic vessels were observed to supply the mass that would raise concern for sequestration. Apparent effacement of a long segment of the bronchus to the right upper lobe with suspicion of partial effacement of the bronchus to the lateral segment of the right middle lobe were also observed.

### Imaging of congenital lung diseases presenting in the adulthood: a pictorial review [^fb96ce18]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Bronchopulmonary anomalies

Underdevelopment anomalies

Underdevelopment is classified into three types as agenesis, aplasia, and hypoplasia. In pulmonary agenesis, pulmonary parenchyma, bronchus, and vascular structures are completely absent. In pulmonary aplasia, a short rudimentary bronchus is seen without pulmonary vasculature and lung parenchyma. In addition to airways, alveoli, and vascular structures are present, at decreased size and number in pulmonary hypoplasia.

Bilateral pulmonary agenesis is a fatal condition causing death in the intrauterine period or within the first hours after delivery. However, pulmonologists, as well as radiologists, may encounter patients with unilateral pulmonary agenesis as the long-term survival rate is approximately 60%. Higher mortality can be related to other congenital anomalies including cardiac malformations.

Pulmonary underdevelopment causes compensatory hyperplasia of the remaining lung. Pulmonary agenesis and aplasia have similar imaging findings and simulate pneumonectomy. Contralateral lung herniation across the midline and prominent ipsilateral mediastinal shift are characteristics imaging features. Opacified hemithorax with mediastinal shift on frontal chest X-ray and hyperlucency in the anterior chest due to herniation of contralateral hyperinflated lung on lateral chest X-ray can be seen. Pulmonary aplasia can be distinguished from pulmonary agenesis by the existence of the rudimentary blind-ending bronchus which can be depicted in detail on CT (Fig. 2).

### Spontaneous middle lobe torsion: an institutional case series [^651ae75d]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of lobar torsion can be challenging because of the subtlety of early radiographic findings and the relative rarity of this occurrence. The most common radiographic findings are hilar and vasculature displacement, air trapping, opacification of the affected lung, and a collapsed lobe. It has been discussed in the literature that the absence of hypoxia with opacification of the affected lung may further support the diagnosis of torsion. If torsion is present, the affected lobe should be completely shunted, as both the airway and perfusing vasculature are typically compromised. This is in contrast to opacification secondary to mucous plugging, where the vasculature remains patent creating a ventilation–perfusion mismatch promoting hypoxia.Delays in diagnosis secondary to difficulties in radiographic interpretation were observed in both cases in this series.

In retrospect, patient 1 had radiographic evidence of torsion 15 days before his lobectomy. A large right pleural effusion was also noted but had been longstanding and was thought to be a reactive hepatic hydrothorax. Patient 2 had post-OLT imaging that showed a right-sided pleural effusion and opacification with collapse of the ML, which was interpreted as mucous plugging. Despite the lack of usual risk factors, both patients were ultimately diagnosed with ML torsion and hemorrhagic infarction requiring surgical exploration and lobectomy.

### Imaging of urgencies and emergencies in the lung cancer patient [^02ef542a]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare complication of lung cancer with an estimated occurrence rate of 0.03-0.05% in primary lung cancer. Only 2% of all spontaneous pneumothoraces is coexistent with malignant lung diseases. In approximately 75% of these cases, pneumothorax is the presenting feature of lung cancer. The clinical presentation is variable, depending on the extent of the pneumothorax, ranging from asymptomatic to extreme dyspnoea with hypotension and tachycardia in case of tension pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening. In tension pneumothorax, a positive pressure on mediastinal and intrathoracic structures can result in a reduced cardiac output with typical features of hypoxaemia and haemodynamic compromise. Erect chest radiograph is the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnosis of a pneumothorax. CT is considered as the “gold standard” for the detection of a small (and anterior) pneumothorax and size estimation. The differentiation of a large from a small pneumothorax is made by identification of a rim of >2 cm between the lung margin and chest wall at the level of the hilum. Moreover, CT can better identify the relationship with underlying lung pathology, such as lung cancer (Fig. 3). Particularly in older patients presenting with a spontaneous pneumothorax, CT images should be scrutinised for malignancy as a possible cause. A tension pneumothorax should be suspected if there are additional features such as a mediastinal shift to the contralateral side or depression of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.

Spontaneous pneumothorax as the first sign of a primary lung carcinoma in an 87-year-old woman who presented at the emergency department with thoracic pain and severe respiratory distress. a Supine anteroposterior chest radiograph clearly depicts a right-sided pneumothorax with complete collapse of the right lung. The visceral pleural edge is observed clearly as a very thin, sharp line (yellow arrows) with the absence of vascular marking beyond the pleural line. b Axial contrast-enhanced chest CT in lung window setting shows a large thin-walled cystic lesion (asterisk) with peripheral solid nodular component (yellow arrow) in the right upper lobe as the underlying cause of the pneumothorax. Also, note the extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. Histopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (type “lung cancer associated with cystic airspaces”) was made after lobectomy

Small, asymptomatic pneumothorax can be treated conservatively. Larger, symptomatic pneumothorax requires active intervention by needle aspiration or chest drain insertion.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^c0648565]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Lateral hemithorax injuries—initial assessment and imaging: In unstable patients with absent breath sounds indicative of pneumothorax and/or hemothorax, place chest tubes on the affected side without waiting for confirmatory imaging; point-of-care chest ultrasonography (extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma [eFAST]) can be used to document pneumothorax/hemothorax when the provider has adequate training, and clinical examination can be incorrect in up to a third of cases. For hemodynamically stable patients, initially image with chest radiography, delineate wounds with radiopaque markers to approximate the injury trajectory, and if the initial chest radiograph is normal perform a follow up chest radiograph in 3-6 hours to rule out delayed pneumothorax; trauma centers with expertise in ultrasonography may choose to use this technique as a screening tool to detect pneumothorax and/or hemothorax. Before tube drainage, obtain a chest radiograph to evaluate for hemothorax or pneumothorax, perform a repeat chest radiograph after chest drainage to assess for retained hemothorax and/or pneumothorax, and consider using a contrast-enhanced MDCT scan (optimally at least a 64 slice) to evaluate for active chest wall hemorrhage, residual hemothorax and/or pneumothorax.

Lipoblastoma, a rare benign tumor of adipose tissue, typically occurs in the superficial or deep layers of soft tissue on the trunk or extremities. Other sites of occurrence include the head, neck, and retroperitoneum. Lipoblastoma of the chest wall and parietal pleural have been reported, but occurrence within the lung has not been previously described. We report a case of pulmonary lipoblastoma in a young child presenting with complete opacification of the left hemithorax and mediastinal shift on chest radiograph. A lobectomy was performed, and the diagnosis was made by histological examination.

Adjacent to the consolidated lung there is complex multiloculated pleural effusion (asterisks), in keeping with empyema, which extends in a sub-pulmonary location (arrowheads). It is difficult to delineate the exact extent of the empyema and evaluate the adjacent consolidated lung because of the complex echogenicity of the empyema. c Color Doppler US in coronal plane through the left lung.

### Massive lung collapse with partial resolution after several years: a case report [^c033be71]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment with intravenous cefotaxime, supplemental oxygen and intensive chest physiotherapy was initiated but total right lung atelectasis, shift of the mediastinum to the affected side and herniation of the left lung into the right hemithorax was obvious on chest CT scan. Several small areas of ground glass opacities and overexpansion were present in the left lung. Only mild respiratory distress persisted, despite obvious shift of trachea and left ictus to the right and bronchial breath sounds over the entire right hemithorax. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation in room air was normal. On ventilation-perfusion scan there was no perfusion nor ventilation to the right lung but the left lung appeared normal. Cardiac angiography showed displacement of the heart towards the right hemithorax, normal anatomy of heart and large vessels and very slow circulation in the right pulmonary artery.

Several non-invasive as well as invasive interventions were done to recruit ventilation of the right lung: oral steroids (dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg during 1 week), bronchial instillations of 5% acetyl-cysteine (3 × 20 ml), selective intubation and ventilation into the right main bronchus during 1 hour, instillation of surfactant (Survanta 200 mg). Total right lung collaps persisted. Cefotaxime was administered intravenously for a total duration of 3 weeks; thereafter amoxicillin was continued orally for 2 weeks despite negative lower airway cultures during repeat bronchoscopy and during selective intubation. A puncture biopsy of the right lung was performed. Histology revealed a thickened visceral pleura due to fibrosis and collapsed normal lung without signs of fibrosis nor inflammation. Ultrastructural examination of the cilia excluded primary ciliary dyskinesia. Thoracoscopy was performed to exclude lung entrapment by the pleural thickening and revealed a normal pleural cavity and a collapsed right lung. A right lower lobe biopsy showed collapsed lung with normal histology and a slightly thickened visceral pleura and interlobular septae. Absence of abnormalities in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles excluded bronchiolitis obliterans. Post thoracotomy, again in an effort to gain lung expansion, the boy was ventilated using high frequency oscillation for three days during which a second fruitless trial with selective intubation was performed.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old young female was referred to the TB clinic of a tertiary hospital with about 3 weeks history of shortness of breath and a total left “whiteout” on a chest radiograph suspected to be a massive left pleural effusion (Fig. 1). She had a 5-month history of cough, productive of scanty clear sputum with associated night sweats and minimal weight loss. A chest tube was passed at a district hospital with no significant pleural aspirate obtained. Thus, the tube was removed and patient was referred as a case of suspected pulmonary TB. On past medical history, the patient had been diagnosed with seizure disorder at the same district hospital about 7-months prior to the onset of the chronic cough for which oral Carbamazepine 200 mg daily was initiated. According to the mother, patient had a normal childhood with no significant medical events and their family history was unremarkable. She was a secondary school student and lived in a rural community with her parents who were peasant farmers growing corn and a variety of vegetables. The patient together with her siblings helped out on their parents’ farm often.

Fig. 1 
Frontal chest radiography showing complete opacification of the left lung with mediastinal shift to the right side

At presentation, we found a chronically-ill looking young female, mildly dyspneic at rest with no pallor, fever or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Chest auscultation was suggestive of left hemithorax consolidation whiles other systems examined revealed normal findings. Initial investigations done included repeat sputum geneXpert (Negative) and a fasting blood sugar of 5.1mmol. Other test results are shown in Table 1.1 and 1.2.

Chest Computed Tomography (CT-scan) showed replacement of the left lung by a large complex heterogeneously enhancing mass with hypoenhancing areas suggestive of cystic change or necrosis. The lesion caused complete compression of the left main bronchus and partially encased the pulmonary trunk and thoracic aorta (Fig. 2). Oesophageal compression by the mass was also evident. A second 4 mm solitary pulmonary nodule was noted in the apex of the right lung as well as multiple enlarged supraclavicular, paratracheal, sub-carinal, and left hilar lymph nodes.

### The clothes maketh the sign [^b58afcc2]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Veil-like opacity

Left upper lobe collapse can present as a radiographic veil-like opacity projected over the left hemithorax, this subtle opacity is a result of anterior collapse of the left upper lobe, which produces a subtle opacity rather than a sharp interface with aerated lung as the X-ray beam crosses the abnormality en face rather than tangentially (Fig. 22). Associated radiographic features include elevation of the left hilum and hemidiaphragm and a crescentic lucency between the mediastinum and the atelectatic upper lobe known as the Luftsichel sign. The crescentic lucency represents the upward displacement of the lingula.

P =. 004) and all-cause mortality by 6. 7% over screening with chest radiographs. An updated analysis showed that the estimated reduction in lung cancer mortality was 16%. . One approach to assessing overdiagnosis involves examining the volume-doubling time of lung tumors detected on LDCT. In one study, the volume-doubling times of 61 lung cancers were estimated by using an exponential model and successive CT images. Lesions were classified into the three following types: type G, type GS, and type S. The mean volume-doubling times were 813 days, 457 days, and 149 days for types G, GS, and S, respectively.

In this study, annual CT screening identified a large number of slowly growing adenocarcinomas that were not visible on chest x-ray, suggesting overdiagnosis. . A study of LDCT screens that were performed on more than 12, 000 patients from 2016 to 2017 at 72 U. S. institutions found a mean effective dose of 1. 2 mSv. Almost two-thirds of the institutions had a median effective dose higher than the American College of Radiology guideline of 1 mSv. Diagnostic evaluation and downstream complications In the NLST chest x-ray arm, among subjects with positive screens at baseline, 86% received imaging as diagnostic follow-up, 5% received a bronchoscopy, and 5% underwent a surgical procedure. Diagnostic imaging rates were modestly lower after postbaseline positive screens, while bronchoscopy and surgery rates were similar. A total of 0. 3% of false-positive screens were associated with a complication of an invasive diagnostic procedure. . In the PLCO trial, 0.

### Massive lung collapse with partial resolution after several years: a case report [^eab89f4b]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Because of relatively mild respiratory symptoms and the risk of a post-pneumonectomy syndrome, a conservative approach was maintained. To our surprise, five years after the initial diagnosis, a partial re-expansion of the affected right lung was noted on high-resolution computed tomography. This is the first case ever described with a comparable evolution. Could recanalization of larger airways be the cause? Reversibility of pulmonary involvement is documented in bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP) and other diseases like idiopathic interstitial pneumonia but has not been described in bronchitis obliterans.

### Primary pleural liposarcoma: a rare differential for an opaque hemithorax [^f81d6c48]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Primary pleural liposarcoma (PPL) is a rare primary malignant pleural tumour originating from primitive mesenchymal tissue. We report the case of a 25-year-old man with a 6-week history of shortness of breath, cough, chest pain and hoarseness of voice. Chest X-ray showed a left opacified hemithorax, and thoracic CT scan revealed a large, heterogeneous, hypodense mass in the left hemithorax. The patient was taken up for ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the mass lesion, and histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis as a pleomorphic variant of PPL. We highlight the importance of considering PPL as a differential diagnosis in cases of large hemithoracic masses.

### Clear vision through the haze: a practical approach to ground-glass opacity [^62575273]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ground-glass opacity (GGO) is a common, nonspecific imaging finding on chest computed tomography that may occur in a variety of pulmonary diseases. GGO may be the result of partial filling of alveolar spaces, thickening of the alveolar walls or septal interstitium, or a combination of partial filling of alveolar spaces and thickening of the alveolar walls and septal interstitium at the histopathologic level. Diseases that commonly manifest on chest computed tomography as GGO include pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Generating an extensive list of possible causes of GGO in radiologic reports would not be helpful to referring physicians. Preferably, a more concise and focused list of differential diagnostic possibilities may be constructed using a systematic approach to further classify GGO based on morphology, distribution, and ancillary imaging findings, such as the presence of cysts, traction bronchiectasis, and air trapping. Correlation with clinical history, such as the chronicity of symptoms, the patient's immune status, and preexisting medical conditions is vital. By thorough analysis of imaging patterns and consideration of relevant clinical information, the radiologist can generate a succinct and useful imaging differential diagnosis when confronted with the nonspecific finding of GGO.

### Spontaneous right whole-lung torsion secondary to bronchial carcinoma: a case report [^92106c52]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 82- year old male patient, with the only known comorbidities being hypercholesterolemia and sigmadiverticulosis, presented to a nearby hospital with productive cough and progressive dyspnea in the last 14 days. Chest x-ray showed a right lung opacification with pleural effusion. Subsequent chest CT scan revealed a 180° degree counterclockwise torsion of the whole right lung with partial atelectasis of the lower lobe and middle lobe as well as venous congestion and complete atelectasis of the upper lobe (Fig. 1). The patient was then transferred to our thoracic surgical unit for further treatment. Upon arrival in our department a chest tube was placed on the right side and 1 l of pleural fluid was evacuated. Furthermore bronchoscopy was performed, showing torsion of the right mainstem bronchus with complete obstruction of the upper lobe. The intermediate bronchus showed even more profound rightward torsion with partial obstruction of the middle and lower lobe orifice (Fig. 1). After drainage 12 h later a follow-up CT scan was performed, which showed complete evacuation of the pleural effusion with better ventilation of the middle and lower lobe but persistent lung torsion with suspected pulmonary venous occlusion and venous congestion of the upper lobe. A tumor was not suspected, but could not be excluded due to massive congestion of the whole upper lobe. Therefore the patient was taken to the operating room for diagnostic thoracoscopy. As suspected, the entire right lung was torqued in a 180-degree counterclockwise direction. Since thoracoscopic detorsion could not be achieved and the whole upper lobe showed hemorrhagic infarction, we converted to thoracotomy and performed anatomic resection of the right upper lobe (Fig. 2). The upper lobe vein was centrally compressed by a tumor resulting in venous congestion and finally hemorrhagic infarction of the entire upper lobe. This finding was also confirmed by the pathologist who diagnosed a central bronchial adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe with compression and invasion of the upper lobe vein and additional hemangiosis carcinomatosa. The patient had an uneventful post-operative course and was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day 6. Because of concomitant malignant pleural effusion an adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended.

### Chest radiography versus lung ultrasound for identification of acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^dcca9d9d]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Defining ARDS

ARDS was defined in two ways: using a combination of the Berlin definition with chest radiography (Berlin-CXR) or modified using lung ultrasound as an alternative imaging method (Berlin-LUS). For both definitions, diagnosis of respiratory failure was within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms, not fully explained by heart failure or fluid overload. For both ARDS definitions, patients on noninvasive ventilation could be classified as having mild ARDS but not moderate or severe ARDS. With regards to oxygenation, patients with ARDS required the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen to be 300 mmHg or lower. For the Berlin-CXR definition, the imaging criterion required the presence of bilateral radiographic opacities not fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules. For the Berlin-LUS definition, the imaging criterion required at least one region of each hemithorax to be affected by multiple B lines (> 2 B lines per rib space) or consolidation on lung ultrasound. However, consolidation adjacent to pleural effusion could be a consequence of pulmonary atelectasis and was not counted as positive for ARDS.

### Focal hepatic activity during ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy due to systemic-portal shunt due to superior vena cava obstruction from histoplasmosis-induced fibrosing mediastinitis [^08f98714]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman with a history of fibrosing mediastinitis secondary to histoplasmosis diagnosed on mediastinoscopy presented with dyspnea. A ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrated decreased perfusion to the entire right lung. In addition, the perfusion images demonstrated focal abnormal activity in part of the liver. On computed tomography of the chest, there was significant soft tissue opacification in the mediastinum occluding the right pulmonary artery, with passage of the injected contrast via collateral vessels to the liver. The main collateral pathway was via the right internal thoracic vein and the umbilical vein. Pulmonary angiography confirmed complete occlusion of the right pulmonary artery.

### Important prognostic factors for survival in patients with malignant pleural effusion [^cad5f254]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Pleural effusion was the first manifestation of malignancy in approximately 15% of asymptomatic patients. The most common symptoms that were reported by patients were dyspnea (80%) with a modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) score of 2 (moderate) to 4 (very severe), dull chest pain (30%), and nonproductive cough (10%). In 40% of patients with a personal history of cancer and with chronic symptoms of disease (longer than 30 days), many (90%) patients had symptoms attributable to the cancer itself, such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise. A total of 52% of pleural effusions were large (affected two thirds or more of the hemithorax) and 33% were massive (opacified the entire hemithorax).

Table 1 shows the ECOG PS scores. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the 165 patients in the study population and the causes of MPE. Table 3 and Figure 1 show survival analysis according to the type of primary tumor. All of our patients had a median survival of 5 months (range: 1.0 – 96.0 months). Survival time was calculated in months rather than in days because it is a classical time variable according to multiple authors. Patients with MPE from ovarian cancer showed better survival than those whose cancers were located in other anatomical sites (Table 3). Table 4 shows that some prognostic factors (variables) were not available in all cases. Table 4 shows the Kaplan–Meier univariate analysis, which showed that survival was significantly related to ECOG PS (chi-square = 195.40, p < 0.0001), the site of the cancer (chi-square = 5.54, p < 0.01), pleural cytology (chi-square = 4.20, p = 0.04), and histology (chi-square = 4.09, p = 0.04). With regard to the cancer site, only ovary tumors were significant compared with other malignant tumors. Other potential independent diagnostic factors that were examined did not appear to affect survival time.

### Postpneumonectomy-like syndrome due to bronchial carcinoid: a unique case report [^3dffcb27]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of persistent productive cough of yellowish sputum over the last four week and mild exertional dyspnea over the last two years. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she took no regular medications. There was no personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. She was in no distress on presentation to the ED with a resting hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 97% while breathing room air. Her physical examination was remarkable for absent breath sounds and decreased tactile fremitus on the left middle and lower lung fields. No wheezing or stridor were heard. Laboratory data were within normal limits.

A chest x-ray (CXR) in the ED demonstrated opacification of the left middle and lower lung fields, hyperinflation of the right lung and deviation of the trachea to the left (Fig. 1). A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed complete left lung atelectasis due to a mass obstructing the left main bronchus and excessive mediastinal deviation to the left with substantial herniation of the hyperdistended right lung into the left hemithorax (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of tracheobronchial narrowing in the right lung or esophageal compression. The mass was well demarcated and of soft-tissue quality, demonstrating homogeneous contrast enhancement, starting 2.8 cm distal to the main carina, measuring 4.4 × 2 × 2.8 cm (Fig. 2). Abdominal and head CT scans showed no abnormal findings. The patient subsequently underwent a diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy which revealed a pale hypervascular polypoid mass completely obliterating the left main bronchus which was biopsied using forceps (Fig. 3). Histopathological examination of endobronchial biopsies disclosed a carcinoid tumor with a Ki-67 index of approximately 10%.

### Acute lobar atelectasis [^3865ada6]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Lobar atelectasis (or collapse) is an exceedingly common, rather predictable, and potentially pathogenic companion to many forms of acute illness, postoperative care, and chronic debility. Readily diagnosed by using routine chest imaging and bedside ultrasound, the consequences from lobar collapse may be minor or serious, depending on extent, mechanism, patient vulnerability, abruptness of onset, effectiveness of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and compensatory reserves. Measures taken to reduce secretion burden, assure adequate secretion clearance, maintain upright positioning, reverse lung compression, and sustain lung expansion accord with a logical physiologic rationale. Both classification and logical approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of lobar atelectasis derive from a sound mechanistic knowledge of its causation.

### Bronchial carcinoid tumor presenting with complete lobar collapse and unilateral lung emphysema [^f447e55d]. Clinical Imaging (2001). Low credibility.

Bronchial carcinoid tumors have different radiographic manifestations. This is a presentation of a case of bronchial carcinoid tumor which presented with complete right upper lobe collapse and emphysematous change of the right residual lung. According to bronchoscopic and operative findings, the emphysematous change of the right residual lung was contributed by a check-valve effect of the endobronchial tumor of the right main bronchus and a compensatory effect of the right residual lung post complete collapse of the right upper lobe.

### Dyspnea with slow-growing mass of the left hemithorax [^06f258cf]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 65-year-old male patient who presented with gradually worsening dyspnea over 2 years. History was significant for smoking and the absence of any hazardous occupational exposure. The clinical findings at presentation included absent breath sounds and stony dullness on the left side, with tracheal deviation contralaterally and clubbing. A chest roentgenogram showed a left-sided opacity occupying almost the entire left hemithorax. A subsequent CT scan of the chest revealed an intrathoracic, extrapulmonary lesion producing a mediastinal shift. Surgical resection of the mass was performed, and pathology, along with immunohistochemical studies positive for CD34 and negative for epithelial markers, confirmed the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP). SFTP is a rare neoplasm, and diagnosis is often difficult. Suspicion of SFTP should arise in the setting of a patient presenting with a paucity of symptoms (except in the case of an accompanying paraneoplastic syndrome), the absence of exposure to asbestos, and a large mass with sharp margins and encapsulation seen on a chest radiograph.

### Tricuspid bullet embolism: lessons learnt from a rare firearm sequelae [^f2a76788]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Case description

This is a case of a patient in his 20s who presented with seven gunshot wounds to his extremities and abdomen. On arrival, the patient was intubated, and the massive transfusion protocol was initiated. Focused abdominal sonogram for trauma (FAST) demonstrated questionable pericardial fluid and positive intraperitoneal fluid. Chest radiography (chest X-ray; CXR) demonstrated a right hemopneumothorax, right lateral fifth rib fracture, right anterior fifth costal cartilage fracture and bullet shrapnel overlying right hemithorax (figure 1).

Figure 1 
Chest X-ray taken in the trauma bay showing bullet shrapnel overlying right hemithorax and mid-chest with large right-sided hydropneumothorax and opacification of right lung. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by the right lung. Right-sided rib fracture is also noted.

The patient was taken emergently for an exploratory laparotomy. He was found to have ballistic injuries to his liver (caudate and dome), diaphragm, stomach and colon. He underwent posterior stomach wedge resection, resection of distal colon and was left in discontinuity. Due to the possible pericardial effusion seen on FAST, an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed by the cardiac anesthesiology team, which was determined to be normal. At the end of the case, a temporary abdominal closure was placed, and he was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit.

Postoperatively, completion CT was obtained. This demonstrated multiple bullet fragments over the right upper quadrant, pelvis, and surprisingly, in the right atrium at the atrioventricular junction and tricuspid valve with possible right atrial wall injury (figure 2). The patient had continued transfusion requirements.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale: from the American Society of Echocardiography and society for cardiac angiography and interventions [^a92d34a3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Saline contrast echocardiography for shunt localization—during transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in an apical four-chamber view with saline contrast injection, there is complete opacification of the RA and RV with delayed entry of contrast into the LA and LV consistent with a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation; if the bubbles cross within the first three cardiac cycles, an intracardiac shunt is present, whereas subsequent cardiac cycles demonstrate continued opacification of the LA and LV consistent with intrapulmonary shunting, with immediate passage of saline contrast from right to left, seen clearly to cross a PFO.

### Thoracoscopic resection of extralobar sequestration in a neonate [^f49d9986]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The authors report a case of extralobar pulmonary sequestration (ELS) located at the right costophrenic recessus and resected thoracoscopically in a 22-day-old girl. Prenatally, spontaneous resolution of a cystic adenomatoid lung lesion (CCAM) occurring independently in the upper right hemithorax was observed. ELS with preceding complete resolution of CCAM in the ipsilateral hemithorax has not been reported before. This is the first neonate reported with ELS treated by thoracoscopy.

### An unusual cause for a relatively common radiographic abnormality [^9970c7da]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old Indian woman presented to the respiratory clinic with chest pains, long-standing swallowing difficulties and a chest radiograph, which was reported as showing a shadow in the right paratracheal region. A CT scan was obtained and was reported as demonstrating a right-sided paratracheal lymph node and varicosities adjacent to the inferior vena cava. Histology from an endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a heavily blood-stained sample but showed no evidence of granulomas or malignancy. Subsequently, the images were reviewed, with the conclusion that they were actually of an engorged azygos vein compressing the oesophagus. MRI confirmed the absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the presence of a prominent hemiazygos vein compressing the oesophagus. This case highlights the importance of including anatomical abnormalities in the differential diagnosis and reassessing patients when the history and investigations do not correlate.

### Comparative outcomes of inpatients with lung collapse managed by bronchoscopic or conservative means [^e56caff6]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Key messages

Should patients with near-complete or complete lung collapse be managed initially with bronchoscopy or with conservative measures?
Bronchoscopy has significantly better radiological outcomes.
We discovered that bronchoscopy has significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications for patients with near-complete or complete lung collapse.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^b090c57d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic evaluation of suspected paradoxical embolism—agitated saline technique and interpretation: To assess for the role of PFO in cryptogenic stroke, the presence of a right-to-left shunt needs to be established; if routine color Doppler imaging fails to detect a shunt, assessment can include lowering the Nyquist limit or performing an agitated saline contrast study. Injections should be performed at rest and with provocative maneuvers such as cough and the Valsalva maneuver. The presence of PFO is presumed when agitated saline is seen in the left atrium within three cardiac cycles after complete opacification of the right atrium, whereas absence after five cardiac cycles should prompt consideration of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Persistent interatrial bowing toward the right atrium can hold a PFO closed and yield a false-negative finding. Adequate beats must be captured to evaluate for PFO, and the agitated saline contrast study may need to be repeated multiple times if necessary.

### Stepwise diagnostic algorithm for high-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities on CT [^4aaae358]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Thoracolithiasis

Thoracolithiasis is an entity in which one or more calcified or non-calcified loose bodies move freely in the thoracic cavity without any preceding trauma, intervention, or pleurisy. The prevalence of thoracolithiasis is approximately 0.086%. Thoracolithiasis usually manifests as a single calcified nodule and tends to occur in the left hemithorax. Most thoracoliths are located in the lower part of the pleural cavity, notably below the level of the top of each hemidiaphragm dome, which may be due to the effect of gravity. The longest diameter of thoracoliths ranges from 2.1 to 10.6 mm, and they all show calcification with an oval or round-shape. Because of the continuous movement associated with breathing, thoracoliths can become rounded and polished. Based on the presence of a necrotic fatty core in most thoracoliths and their left-sided predominance, dropping of twisted or torn epipericardial fat undergoing aseptic necrosis seems to be the most explainable etiology. As the mobility of the nodule is the critical finding in the diagnosis, comparison with older imaging studies is crucial (Supplementary Fig. S 13).

Step 5: Identify the morphological pattern: linear, consolidation, nodular, or micronodular

If there is no distributional predominance, Step 5 is the final step. High-attenuation abnormalities are classified into linear, consolidation, nodular, or micronodular pattern according to morphological characteristics.

Category 6: Linear pattern

Linear high-attenuation lesions include staple line, tracheobronchial calcification, and granulomatous infection. Among these lesions, staple line is often difficult to distinguish from granulomatous infection, and tracheobronchial calcification may be misdiagnosed as calcified lesions of non-bronchial origin.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^14b72b74]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) definition—computed tomography (CT) criteria and zone demarcation: Chest CT must show bilateral and nondependent ground-glass opacities, reticular abnormalities, lung distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and/or honeycombing involving ≥5% of a lung zone, and we define ILAs as nondependent bilateral parenchymal abnormalities detected on CT with these patterns by visual estimate, without meeting interstitial lung disease (ILD) criteria. Nonemphysematous cysts, centrilobular nodularity, and features of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis can be present but do not contribute to the volume of affected lung needed to satisfy the definition of ILA. We continue to recommend the demarcation of upper, middle, and lower lung zones by the levels of the inferior aortic arch and right inferior pulmonary vein, creating a total of six zones (three zones per lung). The need for findings to be incidental and exclusion of high-risk populations has purposefully been removed from the definition, and bilaterality may not be necessary in some high-risk cases; mild abnormalities occurring exclusively in dependent locations on supine imaging should be confirmed to persist on prone imaging.

### Recurrent pleural effusion in a young woman: calcifying fibrous tumour of the pleura [^15f36bfe]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 23-year-old woman with a long-standing history of recurrent left-sided pleural effusion unrelated to her menstrual cycle. At her last presentation, non-contrast-enhanced chest CT showed a pleural effusion and a lower left hemithorax mass, both large enough to cause complete collapse of the lower lobe and partial collapse of the upper lobe. Thoracoscopic surgery revealed a multilobulated mass originating from the dome of the diaphragm with pleural deposits. Histopathology diagnosed this as a calcifying fibrous tumour of the pleura, a rare benign tumour with excellent prognosis when completely excised.

### Massive right-sided hemorrhagic pleural effusion due to pancreatitis ; a case report [^9f0fb7bd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hemorrhagic pleural effusion, especially in the right hemithorax rarely occurs as the sole presentation of pancreatitis.

Case Presentation

This article reports massive right-sided hemorrhagic pleural effusion as the sole manifestation of pancreatitis in a 16-year-old Iranian boy. The patient referred to Nemazee Hospital, the main hospital of southern Iran, with right-sided shoulder and chest pain accompanied with dyspnea. His chest x-ray showed massive right-sided pleural effusion. The pleural fluid amylase was markedly elevated (8840 U/L), higher than that in the serum (3318 U/L). Abdominal CT scan showed a cystic structure measuring about 5.2 cm in the head of pancreas, highly suggestive of a pancreatic pseudocyst. Pleural effusion resolved after 3 weeks of chest tube insertion but not completely. After this period of conservative therapy another CT scan showed that pseudocyst was still in the head of pancreas. So, external drainage was done with mushroom insertion and the patient was discharged after 40 days of hospitalization. The cause of pancreatitis could not be identified.

Conclusion

Pancreatitis should be taken into consideration when hemorrhagic pleural effusion, especially in the right hemithorax occurs.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^60c6deb4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in asbestos-exposed individuals—diagnostic sensitivity, imaging approach, and interpretation: HRCT is much more sensitive in the detection of asbestosis than plain chest radiographs, although even a normal HRCT cannot completely exclude asbestosis. Among asbestos-exposed individuals with unremarkable chest radiographic findings (ILO score 0/0 or 0/1), 34% were identified by HRCT as having findings suggestive of asbestosis. Prone views should always be obtained, as it is essential to distinguish between dependent atelectasis and parenchymal fibrosis in the posterior lung fields. HRCT findings in asbestosis are typically bilateral and include intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, subpleural “dotlike” opacities and lines, parenchymal bands, occasional ground-glass opacity, and honeycombing in advanced disease. The extent of parenchymal opacification does not correlate with cumulative asbestos exposure and thus cannot be used to estimate exposure.

### Pulmonary blastoma: radiologic findings in five patients [^35fd9655]. Clinical Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the radiologic findings of pulmonary blastoma on chest radiograph and CT.

Materials and Methods

Chest radiographs and CT scans of five patients with pathologically proven pulmonary blastoma were retrospectively evaluated and radiologic findings were correlated with histopathologic findings.

Results

On chest radiograph, the pulmonary blastoma manifested as a solitary parenchymal mass (n = 2), a solitary parenchymal nodule (n = 1), hilar bulging with fingerlike parenchymal opacities (n = 1), or opacification of hemithorax (n = 1). On CT, the pulmonary blastoma manifested as a solitary parenchymal mass (n = 2), a solitary parenchymal nodule (n = 1), an endobronchial mass with postobstructive pneumonitis (n = 1), or a parenchymal mass with multiple subpleural masses and pleural effusion (n = 1).

Conclusion

Pulmonary blastomas most commonly manifested as a solitary parenchymal mass on chest radiograph and CT. These radiologic features are nonspecific and many primary or metastatic tumors of the lung could be included in differential diagnosis.

### Prevalence and impact of eustachian valve on the diagnosis of patent foramen ovale in patients ventilated for an acute respiratory distress syndrome [^41f6b97e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Eustachian valve was identified in 19 patients (24%) and its median length reached 15 [11.5–16.5] mm. PFO was identified in 19 patients (24%), with mild-to-moderate right-to-left shunt (grade 1: n = 13; grade 2: n = 6 patients; grade 3: n = 0). RA opacification was incomplete in 13 patients (16%), 12 of them having Eustachian valve. Incomplete RA opacification was more frequent in patients with Eustachian valve than in their counterparts (12/19 (63%) versus 1/60 (2%): p < 0.001), whereas PFO prevalence was similar (5/19 (26%) versus 14/60 (23%): p = 0.767). In 3 patients with incomplete RA opacification due to Eustachian valve, injection of microbubbles through the IVC (femoral vein) enabled complete RA opacification and PFO identification in 2 of them with a grade 2 interatrial shunt (Fig. 1).

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: lessons from Singapore [^0596e835]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Radiologic Changes

We saw a variety of chest x-ray changes in these patients (Tables 3 and 4). The primary abnormalities were patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. Opacities were predominantly in the lower lung zones in most patients. Three patients had upper lobe infiltrates. However, five of the patients were admitted to the hospital with normal chest x-ray results.

### Talc (sclerosol) [^c1a11eae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General:

1) Future procedures. The possibility of future diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involving the hemithorax to be treated must be considered prior to administering Sclerosol® Intrapleural Aerosol. Sclerosis of the pleural space may preclude subsequent diagnostic procedures of the pleura on the treated side. Talc sclerosis may complicate or preclude future ipsilateral lung resective surgery, including pneumonectomy for transplantation purposes.

2) Use in potentially curable disease. Talc has no known antineoplastic activity and should not be used for potentially curable malignancies where systemic therapy would be more appropriate, e.g., a malignant effusion secondary to a potentially curable lymphoma.

3) Potential pulmonary complications. Acute pneumonitis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have rarely been reported in association with intrapleural talc administration. Whether these were causally related to talc is unclear. In none of the reported cases was talc applied thoracoscopically or by insufflation. Three of four case reports of ARDS have occurred after treatment with 10 g of talc administered via intrapleural chest tube instillation. One patient died one month post treatment and two patients recovered without further sequelae.

Intravenous administration of talc is a well-recognized cause of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary lung parenchymal disease, but these complications have not been reported after intrapleural administration. Pulmonary diseases, e.g., silicosis or asbestosis-like diseases, chronic bronchitis, bronchogenic carcinoma, and pleural plaques have been reported in association with inhaled talc.

4) Contents under pressure. The contents of the Sclerosol® Intrapleural Aerosol (sterile talc powder) canister are under pressure. The canister must not be punctured and should not be used or stored near heat or open flame.

Drug Interactions: It is not known whether the effectiveness of a second sclerosing agent after prior talc pleurodesis would be diminished by the absorptive properties of talc.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^68e0a72d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Rounded atelectasis—synonyms, causes, pathology, and clinical considerations are outlined: Rounded atelectasis, also known as shrinking pleuritis, contracted pleurisy, pseudotumor, Blesovsky’s syndrome, or folded lung, presents radiographically as a mass and may be mistaken for a tumor. The condition may result from infolding of thickened visceral pleura with collapse of the underlying lung parenchyma, and histologic examination shows folded and fibrotic visceral pleura with atelectasis and variable amounts of interstitial fibrosis in the adjacent lung parenchyma. Clinical experience suggests that it is more likely to occur today as a result of asbestos exposure than other causes, the sudden appearance of rounded atelectasis may follow acute pleuritis with effusion, it may be unilateral and bilateral, and asbestos bodies and/or evidence of asbestos should be carefully sought because it is frequently removed surgically as a suspected peripheral lung cancer.

### Unusual presentation ofaortitis after aortic valve surgery with massive hemoptysis [^df8aea6b]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 51-year-old man with a history of aortic valve and ventricular septal defect repair performed 23 years earlier and hyperlipidemia presented with New York Heart Association class III symptoms of aortic stenosis. The initial cardiac surgery was performed with patch repair of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valve repair with bovine pericardium. On follow-up, the mean transaortic gradient was 43 mm Hg, and the effective orifice area was 0.7 cm 2. He underwent a redo sternotomy and aortic valve replacement (21-mm mechanical valve; St Jude Medical, St Paul, Minn). He recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 8. Echocardiography showed a normal aortic valve prosthesis and ascending aorta.

At an outpatient follow-up 6 weeks later, the patient complained of cough with blood-stained secretions. He had no other respiratory symptoms and was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His warfarin was titrated owing to an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 3.0.

Despite the normalized INR, his hemoptysis persisted, and he presented again with decreased effort tolerance and shortness of breath at rest with low-grade fever. A chest X-ray showed right lower zone opacification with elevated right hemidiaphragm (Figure 1). He was diagnosed with right lower lobe pneumonia and treated with i.v. piperacillin/tazobactam. Echocardiography showed preserved ejection fraction with no pericardial effusion or valvular regurgitation. The next day, his hemoglobin dropped from the baseline of 8.5 g/dL to 6.7 g/dL. His INR increased to 3.33 despite the withholding of warfarin. An urgent chest computed tomography scan revealed a 12.4 × 10.3-cm ascending aorta pseudoaneurysm compressing the right lung (Figure 2). There was moderate right pleural effusion with ground-glass changes in the middle and lower lobes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit immediately and warfarin reversed before undergoing emergency surgery.

### Right middle lobe torsion after right upper lobectomy despite pneumopexy in an adult: a case report and review of the literature [^4250433d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for surgical intervention for lung adenocarcinoma. She underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) RUL lobectomy, S6 segmentectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Based on preoperative computed tomography (CT), the length of the right middle bronchus was 21 mm. Intraoperative anatomic evaluation revealed an incomplete minor fissure and a complete major fissure. The right middle bronchus was relatively long. Inferior pulmonary ligament was not dissected. During lung expansion, RML moved cephalically but did not rotate at the pedicle. Since the RML was highly movable after RUL lobectomy, pneumopexy with a single stitch was performed to attach the RML to the RLL after lung expansion. The patient was under stable condition after the procedure.

However, on postoperative day (POD) 5, the patient reported a sensation of a foreign body inside her chest, particularly during inspiration. Despite this symptom, she did not exhibit respiratory distress and maintained a saturation of 99% on room air. Laboratory blood tests were within normal limits. Chest X-ray (CXR) revealed patchy opacification over the right upper lung field (Fig. 1 A). Given the absence of infection signs and lack of productive cough, atelectasis caused by postoperative sputum obstruction was unlikely. Under the suspicion of RML torsion, bronchoscopy was arranged, which showed compromised right middle bronchus (Fig. 1 B). To exclude the possibility of external compression, an urgent contrast-enhanced chest CT was performed, which revealed partially collapsed and consolidated RML and intact RLL (Fig. 1 C). Based on the aforementioned findings, RML torsion was suspected.

The patient subsequently underwent VATS exploratory thoracotomy later on the same day, which revealed necrotic RML with hemorrhagic congestion. The pedicle of the RML was rotated 180° clockwise. The previous stitch of the pneumopexy was still well in place (Fig. 1 D). The RML was considered nonviable, and hence RML lobectomy was performed. Follow-up chest radiograph on POD 3 showed sufficient expansion of remnant RLL. Her foreign body sensation also subsided after the surgery. Under stable condition, the patient was discharged on POD 6 following the second operation.

### Effectiveness of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) versus EGFR-TKIs plus talc pleurodesis in preventing recurrence of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in advanced lung adenocarcinoma (...) [^e1c76d98]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract e21684 Background: Approximately 15% of patients have pleural effusion at the initial diagnosis of advanced lung cancer. The best treatment approach to prevent re-accumulation of symptomatic MPE after initial thoracentesis remains unclear; especially in EGFR Mutation positive advanced lung cancer patients. Methods: An observational cohort study of 70 patients hospitalized with lung adenocarcinoma and MPE in the year 2012 was conducted. Treatment approach to the MPE after initial thoracentesis was assessed and time to recurrence of MPE, if any was recorded. Results: Among patients with EGFR mutation positive lung cancer receiving TKI as first line therapy, those with pleurodesis and those without pleurodesis showed similar effusion-recurrence-free survival after initial drainage, 9. 9 vs.
11. 7 months, p = 0. 80 respectively. In the entire cohort, effusion-recurrence-free survival was 3. 2 vs.
3.

9 months in no-pleurodesis and pleurodesis group respectively using talc as the sclerosing agent. Effusion-recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in EGFR positive group treated with TKIs vs.
1. 8 month in EGFR negative group. More patients with activating EGFR mutation presented with complete opacification of the hemithorax compared to none without activating EGFR mutation. Conclusions: In lung adenocarcinomas presenting with symptomatic MPE, use of EGFR-TKI alone was associated with the longest effusion-recurrence-free survival. In TKI eligible patients, early talc pleurodesis confers no additional benefit and should be reserved for non-adenocarcinoma histology, wild type EGFR or EGFR negative adenocarcinoma.

### Hypoxia due to intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in a toddler with a congenital portacaval shunt: case report [^f9dcc940]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2 
Representative of the pre-operative imaging. a Chest radiograph showing mild cardiomegaly with increased bronchovascular markings. b Contrast-enhanced axial chest computed tomography image showing normal lung parenchyma with a prominent pulmonary vasculature. c Ultrasound of the abdomen showing dilated inferior vena cava. d Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen showing portal vein (PV) shunting into the inferior vena cava (IVC)

A positive bubble contrast study was demonstrated by intravenous injection of 3.0 mL of agitated saline in the hand. Opacification of the right cardiac chambers was noticed immediately and followed within one to two beats by complete opacification of the left chambers, indicating an intrapulmonary shunt of at least 50% of the pulmonary blood flow (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 
Trans-thoracic echocardiogram in four-chamber view with bubbles after injection of agitated saline. Opacification of the right atrium and right ventricle was noticed immediately. It is followed within one to two beats by complete opacification of the left atrium and left ventricle, indicating significant intrapulmonary shunting

Cardiac catheterization showed significant intrapulmonary shunting. Angiography of the inferior vena cava and portal vein confirmed connection of the portal vein and the inferior vena cava through a portosystemic shunt that measured about 25 mm in length and 11 mm in width (Fig. 4 a). The left portal vein had a normal caliber and the right portal vein was hypoplastic (Fig. 4 a). A transcatheter embolization of the shunt was performed using a 16-mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug (AGA Medical Corporation, Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA), Fig. 4 b. Complete occlusion of the shunt was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound, echocardiogram and angiogram. Two weeks after the procedure, his oxygen saturation was 95 to 100% in room air. Repeat contrast bubble study then showed absence of fistulous flow into the left atrium and left ventricle. His cyanosis and finger clubbing gradually disappeared (Fig. 1). He has been stable and asymptomatic since his last assessment 5 years after the procedure. Hemodynamic data from the cardiac catheterization are shown in the Additional files 1 and 2.

### Prompt recognition of infectious pulmonary tuberculosis is critical to achieving elimination goals: a retrospective cohort study [^3e235c15]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

An experienced chest radiologist, blind to the smear status of the patients, re-read the posterior-anterior and lateral chest images performed at the time of diagnosis. In the context of this study, d frontal images were divided into four quadrants by halving a perpendicular drawn from the apex of the lung to the dome of the hemidiaphragm. Documented were the presence or absence of (1) parenchymal infiltrates and their dominant location—no distinction was made between infiltrates that were airspace, interstitial, nodular or some combination of these; (2) cavities, defined as a gas-filled space within pulmonary consolidation, a mass, or a nodule; (3) adenopathy—hilar, mediastinal or both; and (4) pleural effusion.

As previously reported, we categorised patients as having ‘typical’ versus ‘atypical’ radiographs based on the characteristics listed above.For patients with infiltration localised to, or predominantly in the upper long zones, with or without cavitation, but with no discernable intrathoracic adenopathy, the radiograph is ‘typical’ for adult-type PTB. In patients with (1) no abnormality; (2) intrathoracic adenopathy with or without parenchymal disease; (3) a localised or predominant lower lung zone infiltrate, with or without cavitation; (4) an isolated pleural effusion; and (5) a miliary (diffuse micronodular) pattern, the radiograph is ‘atypical’ for adult-type PTB. We report extent of disease on chest radiograph as normal, minimal, moderately, far advanced or miliary according to criteria established by the US National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease Association.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: lessons from computed tomography of the whole lung [^94f320e1]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This review aims to show how computed tomography of the whole lung has modified our view of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and why it impacts on the optimization of the ventilatory strategy.

Data Sources

Computed tomography allows an accurate assessment of the volumes of gas and lung tissue, respectively, and lung aeration. If computed tomographic sections are contiguous from the apex to the lung base, quantitative analysis can be performed either on the whole lung or, regionally, at the lobar level. Analysis requires a manual delineation of lung parenchyma and is facilitated by software, including a color-coding system that allows direct visualization of overinflated, normally aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated lung regions. In addition, lung recruitment can be measured as the amount of gas that penetrates poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions after the application of positive intrathoracic pressure.

Data Summary

The lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome is characterized by a marked increase in lung tissue and a massive loss of aeration. The former is homogeneously distributed, although with a slight predominance in the upper lobes, whereas the latter is heterogeneously distributed. The lower lobes are essentially nonaerated, whereas the upper lobes may remain normally aerated, despite a substantial increase in regional lung tissue. The overall lung volume and the cephalocaudal lung dimensions are reduced primarily at the expense of the lower lobes, which are externally compressed by the heart and abdominal content when the patient is in the supine position. Two opposite radiologic presentations, corresponding to different lung morphologies, can be observed. In patients with focal computed tomographic attenuations, frontal chest radiography generally shows bilateral opacities in the lower quadrants and may remain normal, particularly when the lower lobes are entirely atelectatic. In patients with diffuse computed tomographic attenuations, the typical radiologic presentation of "white lungs" is observed. If these patients lie supine, lung volume is preserved in the upper lobes and reduced in the lower lobes, although the loss of aeration is equally distributed between the upper and lower lobes. This observation does not support the "opening and collapse concept" described as the "sponge model." In fact, interstitial edema, alveolar flooding, or both, not collapse, are histologically present in all regions of the lung in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Compression atelectasis is observed only in caudal parts of the lung, where external forces (such as cardiac weight, abdominal pressure, and pleural effusion) tend to squeeze the lower lobes. When a positive intrathoracic pressure is applied to patients with focal acute respiratory distress syndrome, poorly aerated and nonaerated lung regions are recruited, whereas lung regions that are normally aerated at zero end-expiratory pressure tend to be rapidly overinflated, increasing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury.

Conclusion

Selection of the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure level should not only consider optimizing alveolar recruitment, it should also focus on limiting lung overinflation and counterbalancing compression of the lower lobes by maneuvers such as appropriate body positioning. Prone and semirecumbent positions facilitate the reaeration of dependent and caudal lung regions by partially relieving cardiac and abdominal compression and may improve gas exchange.

### Middle lobe syndrome: a singularly rare presentation of complicated pulmonary hydatid disease [^7f5a6bd9]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Imaging is crucial to the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid disease, as it is often the first modality that raises suspicion of the disease. Middle lobe syndrome (MLS) as a presentation of this disease is a distinct rarity. A 45-year-old woman, a never-smoker, presented with cough and streaky haemoptysis. Imaging demonstrated a trapezoidal opacity with its base towards the hilum and contiguous with the right cardiac border. The reformatted sagittal view confirmed the diagnosis of MLS. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) revealed an avascular white membranous structure wholly occluding the medial segment of the middle lobe. This was completely removed through gentle suction. Bronchial aspirate revealed hooklets of hydatid and echinococcal serology was positive. Subsequently, three cycles of albendazole were administered with remarkable clinical and radiological improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of MLS caused by pulmonary hydatidosis that was completely removed through FOB.

### Unilateral lung whiteout in children: four cases and a discussion of management [^b26322c3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Unilateral lung whiteout is not a common pediatric chest radiograph finding, but when it is encountered, timely and accurate interpretations of the radiograph are required because life-threatening respiratory failure can be associated. Lung whiteout may result from several conditions, and the differential diagnosis has a broad range. We describe 4 pediatric patients with different etiologies of unilateral lung whiteout: a large pleural effusion, mainstem bronchial plugging with a large cast, a mediastinal tumor, and consolidation. The ultimate causal diagnosis may not be initially obvious, but valuable clues can usually be found in the conventional chest radiograph to assist with appropriate early management. Chest ultrasound provides additional information, and we recommend it as the second examination for such patients.

### Tumor and tumorlike conditions of the pleura and juxtapleural region: review of imaging findings [^cda53dbb]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 8 
Diagnosis: angiosarcoma. Technique: contrast-enhanced chest CT. Description: A 64-year-old man with no history presented with progressive shortness of breath. The initial contrast-enhanced CT scan (a) to rule out pulmonary embolism shows a well-delineated pleural-based oval lesion (arrow) in the base of the right lung. Findings are relatively aspecific. Follow-up CT examination 4 weeks later (b) shows prominent disease progression, with a large amount of fluid. Despite the relatively short time interval, there is a marked increase in pleural lesions, with widespread focal contrast enhancing pleural lesions in the right hemithorax. The rapid and aggressive progression points to the possible diagnosis of angiosarcoma, which was histologically confirmed

Desmoplastic small round cell tumor

The etiology of desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), a rare tumor, is believed to be a genetic alteration of two different tumors (Wilms tumor and Ewing’s tumor). This may explain the young age of the affected population. The clinical presentation is aspecific. DSRCT can present as a single lesion or as diffuse pleural involvement with pleural effusion. This diversity of presentation patterns can be attributed to the dual genetic alterations. Locoregional bone invasion has been described as an associated finding. Imaging findings are aspecific and impose a diagnostic challenge. In general, surgical biopsy is needed for the definite diagnosis of DSRCT.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: radiograph findings correlated with CT [^3ef3caa2]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Tension pneumothorax (I-5)

Tension pneumothorax is characterized by an abnormal increase in the pressure of the involved thoracic cavity. A one-way valve between the involved lung and the pleura leads to the continuous leakage of air into the pleural cavity and causes the accumulation of air within the pleural cavity. Next, the ipsilateral lung collapses, the mediastinum is displaced away from the affected side, and the ipsilateral diaphragm is displaced downwards (especially in positive pressure ventilation) and may invert downwards. The cardiac output is reduced because of the impaired venous return, and cardiac arrest eventually ensues. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening event that occurs in the ICU; thus, it should be identified immediately, especially in patients who are treated with positive pressure ventilation. Immediate decompression of the thorax is mandatory in such cases.

Radiographic findings of the lung in tension pneumothorax are the same as those of the lung in a simple pneumothorax. In addition, mediastinal displacement, diaphragmatic inversion, increased intercostal space, and total or subtotal lung collapse reflect the expansion of the affected hemithorax (Fig. 7). A more important sign of tension pneumothorax is the flattening of the heart border, SVC, and IVC. This sign reflects impaired venous return.

Mimics of pneumothorax (I-6)

The radiographic findings of many situations, such as skin folds, interlobar fissures, bullae in the apices, and air collection in intrathoracic extrapleural space [4, 12], mimic pneumothorax.

### Pleural effusion due to pulmonary emboli [^ae9761ec]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the fourth leading cause of pleural effusion. The possibility of pulmonary embolus should be evaluated for all patients who have undiagnosed pleural effusion. The mechanism of pleural effusion caused by pulmonary embolus is usually increased interstitial fluid in the lungs as a result of ischemia or the release of vasoactive cytokines. Approximately 75% of patients with pulmonary emboli and pleural effusion have pleuritic chest pain. The most common cause of pleuritic chest pain and pleural effusion in patients under 40 years old is pulmonary emboli. Pleural effusion resulting from a pulmonary embolus usually occupies less than one-third of the hemithorax. Dyspnea is frequently out of proportion to the size of the pleural effusion. Pleural fluid caused by pulmonary emboli is usually exudative but is occasionally transudative. d-Dimer testing is a good screen for pulmonary emboli. If d-dimer results are positive, then a spiral computed tomograph should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Low-molecular-weight-heparin has become the initial treatment of choice for patients with pulmonary emboli and pleural effusion.

### Right thoracotomy to repair scimitar syndrome and an accessory hemidiaphragm [^0e37403c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The association of an accessory hemidiaphragm and scimitar syndrome is extremely rare and occurs exclusively in the right hemithorax. We present the case of a 27-year-old female, who underwent complete resection of the accessory hemidiaphragm and direct anastomosis of the scimitar vein to the left atrium through a lateral right thoracotomy. This surgical approach offered easy access to both anomalies and allowed single-stage concomitant repair; this approach avoided postoperative respiratory complications and possible torsion or stenosis of the scimitar vein.

### Rare extramedullary cardiac involvement of recurrent multiple myeloma suspected on 18F-FDG and confirmed on 18F-fluorocholine [^62282b74]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A man experienced pain in the right hemithorax 6 months after a first-line therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). FDG PET/CT showed a large extramedullary extent in the right hemithorax, which was biopsy proven. During the second-line treatment, FDG PET/CT showed no response as well as a suspected myocardium spread, a rare extramedullary location in MM. F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and then MRI confirmed myocardium lesions. This case confirms that F-fluorocholine PET/CT is able to detect MM recurrence and may be used to complete FDG PET/CT in difficult cases such as suspicion of cardiac MM.

### Contralateral reexpansion pulmonary edema with ipsilateral collapsed lung after pleural effusion drainage: a case report [^969ec5a0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 1 
Initial chest x-ray and CT show that massive pleural effusion in the right hemithorax combined with diffuse pleural thickening and several small nodules in the left lung, suggesting malignant pleural effusion

Fig. 2 
A chest radiograph and chest CT show the right half- collapsed lung, and diffuse and severe infiltrative patterns suggesting reexpansion pulmonary edema in the left whole lung field

After conservative treatment with oxygen therapy, steroid administration, and negative suction application (-20 cm H 2 O) in the right pleural cavity for five days, the right lung could be fully expanded without the development of ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema and the reexpansion pulmonary edema in the left lung resolved. Fortunately, the negative suction application (-20 cm H 2 O) in the right pleural cavity did not lead to development of reexpansion pulmonary edema or exacerbate the clinical course. The patient was weaned from oxygen supplementation.

For accurate diagnosis to determine proper management, we performed a VATS biopsy of the right pleura on the 10 th hospital day. The operative findings showed diffuse emphysematous lung, diffuse pleural nodularity, and sanguineous pleural effusion. The final pathology revealed a primary adenocarcinoma lung cancer with pleural metastasis. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. He is now undergoing palliative chemotherapy.

### Primary pulmonary Ewing's sarcoma: rare cause of massive hemothorax in a young girl-case report [^8ef920a7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 15-year-old girl presented with gradually increasing chest pain, cough, and dyspnea for 3 days, which then worsened in 2 hours, and she was eventually treated in the emergency department. There was no significant medical history, trauma included. On physical examination, she had low-grade fever (37.6 °C), hypotension (90/58 mmHg), tachycardia (122 beats/min), pain, weakness, and pale lips. Auscultation over the chest showed reduced air entry into the right hemithorax. Hematological investigations revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dl. The other biochemical investigations were within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) was performed using a Philips Brilliance multidetector scanner for evaluation of the lung. The images demonstrated a massive right pleural effusion with the collapse of the right lung, and punctate calcification was evident in the images (Fig. 1 a, b). The density of the pleural fluid was likely a result of hemothorax. The ribs and vertebrae did not show any lytic areas.

### Massive thoracic ganglioneuroma with significant mass effect on left hemithorax [^6296d457]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old, otherwise healthy, woman presented with persistent left-sided chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed a large opacity in the left hemithorax which prompted further investigation with an MRI. MRI revealed a large left apical mass occupying approximately two-thirds of the left hemithorax. The mass was investigated further with a CT with contrast which did not reveal any vascular involvement or invasion into adjacent structures. The patient successfully underwent tumour resection via left thoracotomy. The tumour was removed in its entirety. Grossly, the tumour was a 23×10×10cm, well encapsulated, ovoid, fibrous nodule. Histopathology revealed ganglion cells, nerve fibres and Schwann cells in a mucous matrix consistent with ganglioneuroma. Postoperative course was unremarkable.

Early complications

A. Bronchopleural fistula (2–13%) It occurs mostly after pneumonectomy, especially on the right side, probably due to the anatomical characteristics of the right main bronchus (larger size, lesser mediastinal coverage than the left main bronchus). It can occur immediately after surgery due to a suture release or later due to a tumour recurrence or empyema. The radiological presentation can take several forms: decrease, reappearance or non-appearance of the air–fluid level of the pneumonectomy cavity, persistence or aggravation of a pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema; visible fistula (in about 50% of cases) (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 Bronchopleural fistula. A – D CXR 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 10 days after surgery, with progressive elevation of the air–fluid level. E Febrile acute respiratory distress at day 28, CXR showing a decrease in the air–fluid level (black arrow). F Axial CT image (parenchymal window) at day 28 confirming that the air–fluid level is too low at this stage and showing an air bubble in contact with the bronchial stump (white arrow) Two major complications can occur consisting of pleural empyema and flooding of the contralateral lung with residual fluid from the lobectomy pouch leading to alveolar filling and ARDS.
B. Pleural empyema (1–10%) This severe complication happens especially after pneumonectomy in the early post-operative period, later occurrence would raise concern about bronchopleural or oesophageal–pleural fistula. CXR may show a rapidly forming pleural collection with one or more air–fluid levels. The CT scan may show an inversion of the internal concavity of the pleural pouch which takes on the appearance of a biconvex collection, a thickening of the pleural pouch wall with parietal enhancement after contrast injection and air–fluid levels (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Pleural empyema. Axial post-contrast CT image (mediastinal window) showing a pyothorax caused by a bronchopleural fistula in the aftermath of a right upper lobectomy. We can observe loss of the internal concavity of the pleural pouch, with a biconvex collection, a thickening of the pleural pouch wall with parietal enhancement
C. Lung atelectasis Collapse is more frequent in early post-operative care and should raise the following hypotheses: mucous plug, blood clot, inflammatory or post-operative bronchial stenosis or bronchial torsion.
D. Pneumonia (2–20%) This diagnosis is often difficult and should not be based on CXR alone as a third of the located infiltrates on a CXR does not correspond to an infectious cause, and an unchanged CXR cannot exclude it. Confirmation can only be obtained by isolation of the germ after bronchoalveolar lavage. Two radiological patterns are possible: bronchopneumonia (blurred opacities of bilateral distribution, often associated with foci of centrilobular micronodules with tree-in-bud aspect) and lobar or segmental pneumonia, which are rarer. As imaging findings may not be specific, alternate diagnostics should be considered including amiodarone pneumopathy, often introduced for post-operative atrial fibrillation.
E. Haemothorax (1.3%) Haemothorax is rare, and many causes are possible: residual bleeding of systemic thoracic vessels (bronchial and intercostal arteries in particular), suture loosening of a pulmonary artery, venous wound. Diagnosis is easier if the drains are still in place. After removal of the drains, a rapid increase in pleural effusion can be seen on CXR, in a context of acute anaemia; unenhanced CT may show a high attenuation pleural effusion (around 50 HU), heterogeneous or with a fluid–fluid level (Fig. 10). It is essential to look for extravasation of contrast agent or pulmonary arterial pseudoaneurysm for which embolisation is essential because of the risk of secondary rupture with haemorrhagic shock. Fig. 10 Haemothorax. Axial CT image (mediastinal window) showing haemothorax after right pneumonectomy. A region of interest placed in the effusion indicates a spontaneous density around 50 HU
F. Chylothorax (1%) A chylothorax can be the consequence of a wound to the thoracic duct or one of its main branches. The radiological picture shows a too rapid filling of the pleural lodge, and an effusion whose attenuation is dependent on the protein concentration. If the concentration is high, the fluid is denser than water; rarely, a supernatant of fat density is present and can sustain the diagnosis. Pleural puncture, or aspiration for surgical drain bringing back a milky fluid, with measurement of triglycerides in the effusion (>110 mg/dl) confirms the diagnosis.
G. Persistent air leak (3–8%) Air leaks are considered persistent when they exceed 7 days after surgery, CXR typically shows the persistence of a pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema. They are associated with increased morbidity rates and prolonged hospitalizations and are more frequent after wedge resections, lobectomies with incomplete fissure and in case of important emphysematous lesions.
H. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (2–15%) It can occur after any type of resection but more frequently after right pneumonectomy, within 2–3 days after surgery. Vital prognosis is involved. The CT scan shows extensive ground-glass opacities with septal lines evolving towards gravito-dependent pulmonary condensations suggesting ARDS. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary oedema due to heart failure (importance of biology, associated right heart failure signs and echocardiography), lung infections (importance of the evolution and possible isolation of the germ by bronchial-alveolar lavage), re-expansion pulmonary oedema and aspiration pneumopathy (fistula) (Fig. 11). Fig. 11 Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Axial CT image (parenchymal window) showing an ARDS after left lower lobe segmentectomy. In this case, ARDS abnormalities were predominant on the right side; gravito-dependent pulmonary condensations are present with normal anterior lung, then ground-glass opacities, then posterior alveolar condensations
I. Lobar torsion (< 0.4%) Also called twist, it is the torsion of a lobe adjacent to a lobectomy. In 70% of cases, this complication involves the middle lobe after right upper lobectomy. The torsion of the arterial, venous and bronchial pedicle may be more or less complete. Spontaneous evolution with haemorrhagic infarction and gangrene can be lethal. CXR shows condensation and abnormal displacement of the affected lobe. CT finds condensation of the lobe, with slight enhancement after injection, and torsion of the pedicle (Fig. 12). Fig. 12 Lobar torsion. Coronal CT images (A : mediastinal window, B parenchymal window) showing a left lower lobar torsion after left upper lobectomy. A CT shows the torsion of the pedicle (white arrow) and the ascent of the left lower lobe. B We notice the condensation of the remaining lobe (black arrow)
J. Cardiac hernia (< 0.1%) This is the dislocation of the heart through a surgical pericardial breach, which occurs in the early post-operative period, resulting in cardiac decompensation. Chest X-ray and CT show a displacement of the heart in the pneumonectomy cavity. Treatment includes lateral decubitus on the side opposite the pneumonectomy and reoperation in extreme urgency.
K. Oesophageal–pleural fistula (0.2–1%) This complication is much rarer than bronchopleural fistula and can occur in the early post-operative period or later, leading to suspicion of recurrence. CT shows pleural empyema, and the fistula can be detected by ingestion of iodinated contrast medium (Fig. 13). Fig. 13 Oesophagopleural fistula. Axial CT images (mediastinal window) without injection and without ingestion of iodinated contrast medium (A), with injection and ingestion of iodinated contrast medium (B). We note the absence of spontaneous hyperdensity of the pleural empyema, and its filling with iodinated contrast medium after ingestion (black arrow). A drain was already in the empyema at the time of CT acquisition (black arrowhead)
L. Pulmonary embolism Although it is not different from conventional pulmonary embolism, it should not be confused with an alluvial thrombus within a pulmonary artery stump. This alluvial thrombus itself can be pathological when it is progressive (Fig. 14). Fig. 14 Progressive alluvial thrombus. Axial CT images (mediastinal window) in May 2019 (A) and November 2019 (B), showing an evolutive alluvial thrombus in the interlobar artery stump, respectively, 6 months and 11 months after right lower and middle bilobectomy
M. Phrenic paralysis Phrenic paralysis results from the intraoperative sectioning of the phrenic nerve, involuntary or more often necessary due to its infiltration by the tumour. It is suspected when the diaphragmatic dome rises. Confirmation can be obtained by « Sniff test » under fluoroscopic control, ultrasound exploration or dynamic MRI (Fig. 15). Fig. 15 Phrenic paralysis. Coronal MR dynamic images showing a right phrenic paralysis after right lower lobectomy. During exhalation (A), the two diaphragmatic domes are raised; during inhalation (B), the left dome is lowered while the right remains in place
N. Gastroparesis It is a syndrome defined by an objectively delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction. It results from a surgical disruption of the vagal pathways innervating the stomach and pylorus, involuntary or more often necessary. Gastroparesis should be suspected when early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and/or bloating occur, early after a surgery that may damage the vagus nerve. The diagnosis can be easily demonstrated on CT, by showing a marked gastric dilatation in the absence of mechanical obstruction or gastric masse (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Gastroparesis. Axial CT images (portal venous phase) at the level of the pyloroduodenal junction (A) and of the third part of the duodenum (B), showing a marked gastric dilatation upstream of the pyloroduodenal junction (white arrow), without any mechanical obstruction. There is no duodenal dilatation (black arrows), neither of the other parts of the small intestine (black stars). Note the mild aeric colic distention (black arrowheads)

Fig. 15 
Diagnosis: schwannoma. Technique: standard chest radiography, contrast-enhanced chest CT and 18FDG-PET CT. Description: A 55-year-old man with no significant medical history was referred for a chest radiograph because of a persistent cough. As an incidental finding, a sharp delineated mass (arrow) laterally in the right hemithorax was found on the postero-anterior chest radiograph (a). Coronal and axial CT images (b, c) in the mediastinal window setting reveal a small homogeneous lesion located intercostally between the 5th and 6th right ribs. The lesion shows high uptake on 18-F-FDG PET (d). Although the high uptake on PET may mislead to a malignant cause, histopathologic examination of the resected specimen confirmed the suggested diagnosis of a schwannoma

Fig. 16 
Diagnosis: benign schwannoma with low mitotic activity. Technique: standard chest radiography, contrast-enhanced chest CT and MRI. Description: A 55-year-old man with respiratory distress was transferred to our hospital after drainage of a hemothorax. The antero-posterior chest radiograph (a) shows a large mass in the left lung with a perilesional rim of air (due to pneumothorax). On contrast-enhanced CT (b) the homogeneous hypointense mass is located paravertebral in the left lower lobe with vertebral scalloping (arrow on c). There are no intralesional calcifications or necrosis. Note also the adjacent consolidation due to atelectasis. On the axial T2 FS WI MR image (d), the lesion has a high signal intensity and is relatively enhancing after contrast administration (e). Based on imaging findings and the size of the lesion, a malignant nerve sheath tumor was suggested. Histopathologic examination of the resected mass, however, did not reveal signs of malignancy but showed an 11-cm large benign schwannoma with low mitotic activity. Genetic counseling for NF-1 was negative

### Intrapulmonary gallstone [^ad0d23f6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

An octogenarian presented to her primary care physician with hemoptysis and a disabling chronic cough that developed several months after a complicated partial cholecystectomy. During investigation, a biopsy sample showed a right lower lobe inflammatory mass containing bile pigment and abundant neutrophils. Thoracotomy performed approximately 18 months after symptom onset confirmed a right lower lobe lung abscess together with a large gallstone embedded at its center and a healed defect in the right hemidiaphragm. A wedge excision of this mass was performed. The patient made an excellent uncomplicated recovery from this rare complication of a gallbladder operation.

### Total unilateral pulmonary collapse secondary to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a case series of an unusual cause of complete atelectasis [^f405ecb0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a bronchopulmonary disease caused by a complex hypersensitivity to Aspergillus and is usually associated with underlying respiratory diseases such as asthma or cystic fibrosis. Mucus plugging can lead to segmental or lobar atelectasis, but complete lung atelectasis has been exceptionally reported in the literature, making it difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis of ABPA may however be suggested in patients without known predisposing respiratory disorder, even in the absence of other relevant radiographic findings.

Case presentation

We report five cases of total unilateral lung collapse secondary to ABPA in 70–81-year-old women. Two of them had a past history of ABPA, while total unilateral lung collapse was the first sign of the disease in the other three patients, contributing to the initial misdiagnosis. Flexible bronchoscopy was initially performed to remove mucus plugs from the obstructed airways but was inefficient in four cases. Corticosteroid and/or antifungal treatment was needed.

Conclusion

ABPA can cause total unilateral lung collapse even in patients without known underlying chronic respiratory disease, making the diagnosis difficult. Flexible bronchoscopy should be considered when lung collapse is associated with respiratory distress but corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment for ABPA.

Late complications

Note that bronchopleural fistula and oesophageal–pleural fistula can be both early and late complications.
A. Parietal dehiscence It corresponds to the herniation of the pulmonary parenchyma through a fragile area of the wall due to a failure of parietal reconstruction. It occurs frequently and is often considered as a normal post-operative finding. It can be pathological when significant and symptomatic. The diagnosis is usually clinical and can be easily demonstrated on CT (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Parietal dehiscence. Left upper lobe parenchyma herniation (black arrow)
B. Gossypiboma (< 0.1%) Intrathoracic retention of an operating compress, which may be pleural, mediastinal or more rarely intrapulmonary after migration. It can result in a heterogeneous mass with air bubbles and sometimes calcifications, and a peripheral enhancement after injection. The use of radiolabelled compresses makes it possible to diagnose it on CXR.
C. Post-pneumonectomy syndrome (0.1%) This complication generally occurs lately, in patients operated on in childhood or adolescence, after complete resorption of the liquid contained in the pneumonectomy cavity, most often on the right side. This syndrome corresponds to the mediastinal displacement towards the side of the pneumonectomy, with stretching and compression of the bronchial tree against the descending aorta or the spine. To diagnose dynamic compression, CT scan acquisitions can be done during exhalation as bronchial compression may sometimes be missed on inspiratory images alone. Moreover, evaluation of subsequent air trapping can be achieved on end-expiratory images.
D. Chest wall vascular fistula (< 0.1%) Very rare, this complication is the consequence of the development of systemic arterial fistulas in areas of pleural adhesions. CT finds an irregular aspect of the pleura with an increase in the calibre of the systemic arteries (thoracic and intercostal); exceptionally, the fistula is visualised between the systemic arteries and the pulmonary veins or arteries flowing in the opposite direction. Arterio-embolization gives variable results.
E. Local tumour recurrence Recurrence usually occurs in the first 2 years after surgery and is often located along parenchymal staples (Fig. 15), on a bronchial suture, on the pleura (Fig. 15) or the chest wall. Recurrence may also be related to regional lymph nodes. This recurrence may manifest in various ways ranging from asymptomatic findings at systematic chest CT to respiratory failure due to tracheal obstruction, bronchopleural or oesophageal–pleural fistula. PET scan is sometimes useful to differentiate a recurrence from post-operative changes (Fig. 18). Fig. 18 Local tumour recurrence. A : Axial CT image (mediastinal window) showing a tumour recurrence on a staple line from a left lower lobe wedge resection (white arrow). B Axial CT image (mediastinal window) showing a tumour recurrence on the pleura after left pneumonectomy (white arrowheads), 1 year after surgery
F. Anastomotic dehiscence This is a complication of sleeve lobectomies (6% of cases). It can be complicated by bronchopleural fistula and often requires a totalisation (pneumonectomy). CT can find a bronchial parietal defect at the site of the anastomosis (best sign but rarely found), pneumomediastinum, extra-mediastinal air bubbles surrounding the anastomosis, and bronchial narrowing and irregularity.
G. Anastomotic stenosis Late complication after sleeve lobectomy (18% of cases), it presents variable consequences depending on the degree of stenosis. It can be infra-clinical, responsible for air trapping or even collapse. This stenosis can be visualised on CT.

### Radiological findings of unilateral tuberculous lung destruction [^22b5470a]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, UTLD is an irreversible complication of pulmonary TB that presents with characteristic radiological findings: unilateral volume loss predominantly in the left lung, decreased diameter of the ipsilateral main pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, and herniation of the contralateral pulmonary parenchyma. The pattern with residual cystic bronchiectasis is the most frequent. Usually the tuberculous infection is inactive, although associated non-tuberculosis infection may develop and affect the destroyed lung. Therefore, a correct diagnosis and radiological follow-up are very important in these patients.

### Anesthesia for bronchoscopy interventional therapy in a patient with gorham-stout disease, lung cancer, and right lung atelectasis: a case report [^fd84c76e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 59 -year-old, 68 kg male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine with a one-month history of worsening cough and chest tightness and a diagnosis of right lung squamous cell carcinoma. Ten years prior, the patient developed left maxillary swelling, facial asymmetry, malocclusion, and missing teeth in the left upper and lower jaws. Pathological examination revealed proliferating thick-walled capillaries beneath the maxillary epithelium, dilated capillaries between bone trabeculae, and bone trabecular resorption, consistent with massive osteolysis, confirming GSD (Fig. 1). The patient received no regular treatment. Two years earlier, a chest computed tomography (CT) scan for recurrent cough and chest tightness identified a right lower lobe mass and obstructive pneumonia. Pathological analysis confirmed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and the patient underwent regular radiotherapy and chemotherapy with stable pulmonary lesions on follow-up.

Preoperative evaluations included: (1) Imaging: Enhanced chest CT demonstrated right pneumothorax with hydropneumothorax, a right main bronchus mass, complete right lung atelectasis, mediastinal shift to the right, and right pleural effusion (Fig. 2). (2) Laboratory tests: Blood biochemistry showed hypoalbuminemia (34.2 g/L), hyperglycemia (8.0 mmol/L), and elevated C-reactive protein (140.5 mg/L). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxemia [PaO₂ (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood)of 58 mmHg]. (3) Physical examination: Karnofsky Performance Status score was 60, and Borg dyspnea score was 3. Breath sounds were diminished in the right lung with dullness to percussion; the left lung exhibited coarse breath sounds. Other ancillary examinations showed no significant abnormalities.

### Multidetector CT of pulmonary cavitation: filling in the holes [^95b5e67d]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary cavitation causes significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of the presence and aetiology of a cavity is therefore crucial in order to avoid further demise in both the localized pulmonary and systemic disorders that may manifest with pulmonary cavity formation. Multidetector CT has become the principal diagnostic technique for detecting pulmonary cavitation and its complications. This review provides an overview of the aetiologies and their imaging findings using this technique. Combining a literature review with case illustration, a synopsis of the different imaging features and constellations is provided, which may suggest a particular cause and aid the differentiation from diseases with similar findings.
