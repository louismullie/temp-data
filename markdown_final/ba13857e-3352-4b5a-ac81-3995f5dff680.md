## Question

What is the duration of treatment for E. coli bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for Escherichia coli bacteremia and how to apply the evidence to clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions that determine whether a 7-day course is appropriate. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence comparing 7 versus 14 days. Next, I will review meta-analyses and guideline recommendations to confirm consistency. After that, I need to check subgroup nuances and exceptions where longer therapy might be warranted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note how to monitor and adjust based on clinical response and source control [^116fXk2s].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and inclusion criteria that underpin the 7-day recommendation. The pivotal trials and meta-analyses focus on uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteremia, typically Enterobacterales such as E. coli, in patients who are hemodynamically stable and afebrile for at least 24–48 hours before discontinuation, with adequate source control and without severe immunosuppression or deep-seated foci requiring prolonged therapy; this is the population in whom 7 days has repeatedly proven noninferior to 14 days [^114KmM5Y] [^116x1utH] [^112ZkcRw].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality randomized evidence. The BALANCE randomized clinical trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, enrolled 3,608 hospitalized patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection and found that 7 days of therapy was noninferior to 14 days for 90-day mortality, with a risk difference of −1.6 percentage points and a 95.7% CI that crossed zero, supporting noninferiority; this result held in both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, and the trial included ICU and ward patients with predominantly urinary sources and Enterobacterales pathogens, aligning with typical E. coli bacteremia presentations [^115KeWh6].

> I should confirm that this is not an isolated signal. Multiple meta-analyses converge on the same conclusion: 7 days is noninferior to 14 days for Gram-negative bacteremia. An updated JAMA Network Open meta-analysis of 4 RCTs including BALANCE found a 97.8% probability of noninferiority for 90-day mortality with 7 versus 14 days, with consistent findings across subgroups; similarly, an individual participant data meta-analysis of three earlier RCTs showed no significant differences in mortality, relapse, complications, or resistance emergence between 7 and 14 days, reinforcing the robustness of the 7-day strategy in appropriately selected patients [^1138ouRo] [^116x1utH].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The 2025 IDSA complicated UTI guidance explicitly recommends a shorter course of 7 days for patients with complicated UTI and associated Gram-negative bacteremia who are improving clinically on effective therapy, and it advises that duration be counted from the first day of effective therapy; this aligns with stewardship principles and the RCT evidence base for Enterobacterales bacteremia, particularly when the urinary tract is the source [^116fXk2s] [^117G4Hrr]. Hold on, I should verify broader sepsis guidance as well: the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests shorter over longer courses when source control is adequate, which supports a 7-day approach in stable, responding patients with Gram-negative bacteremia [^1122xiuH].

> But wait, what about subgroup nuances and exceptions where 7 days might be insufficient? I need to ensure I flag scenarios warranting longer therapy: inadequate source control, persistent bacteremia, endovascular infection, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, CNS involvement, or severe immunocompromise; these were generally excluded from the RCTs and remain indications for extended courses. Observational data in immunocompromised patients suggest higher relapse risk and potential benefit from longer therapy, and a large cUTI-with-bacteremia observational study suggested that 7 days may underperform when oral step-down agents lack comparable bioavailability, whereas 10–14 days performed similarly; this caveat does not negate RCT findings but reminds me to individualize when pharmacokinetics or host factors are unfavorable [^112ZXJL7] [^113eEKRz] [^113kLr8k].

> Let me consider biomarker-guided strategies as a potential refinement. A randomized trial showed that CRP-guided discontinuation, with a median duration around 7 days, was noninferior to fixed 14-day therapy and comparable to fixed 7-day therapy for 30-day clinical failure; this supports using clinical response and biomarker trajectories to tailor duration, while acknowledging that the CRP arm had adherence challenges and wider duration ranges, so I should apply this thoughtfully and within protocols [^114eegjr] [^115vE7FF].

> I should double-check the practical implementation details. Total duration is counted from the first day of effective therapy; early IV-to-oral transition is reasonable once the patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile for 24–48 hours, and an appropriate oral agent with reliable bioavailability is available, with source control addressed; this approach reduces IV days and length of stay without compromising outcomes in uncomplicated Enterobacterales bacteremia, including E. coli from the urinary tract [^116fXk2s] [^115EJrG2] [^111D7ZPS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every E. coli bacteremia being 7 days. I need to ensure the patient truly meets "uncomplicated" criteria: hemodynamic stability, adequate source control, no severe immunosuppression, and no indications for prolonged therapy; if any of these are present, extending to 10–14 days or longer may be appropriate, and I should document the rationale for deviation from the 7-day default in such cases [^112ZXJL7] [^116fXk2s].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is that for uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia with adequate source control and clinical stability, a total of 7 days of effective antibiotic therapy is sufficient and preferred over 14 days, based on high-quality RCTs and convergent meta-analyses; this balances efficacy with reduced adverse events, resistance pressure, and length of stay, while reserving longer courses for complicated presentations or high-risk hosts [^115KeWh6] [^1138ouRo] [^116fXk2s].

---

For uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia with adequate source control and clinical stability, **7 days of antibiotics** is sufficient and noninferior to 14 days [^115KeWh6] [^114KmM5Y] [^114eegjr]. Prolonged therapy (10–14 days) is reserved for **complicated cases** — such as persistent bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, abscesses, or immunocompromise — and should be individualized based on clinical response and source control [^116x1utH] [^112ZXJL7]. Shorter courses reduce adverse events, C. difficile infection, and resistance without increasing mortality or relapse [^113dD1RD] [^114zq5ab].

---

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses

Multiple high-quality RCTs and meta-analyses show that **7 days of therapy is noninferior to 14 days** for uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia:

- **BALANCE trial**: 7 vs 14 days in 3,608 patients; 90-day mortality was 14.5% vs 16.1% (difference −1.6%; 95% CI −4.0 to 0.8), meeting noninferiority [^115KeWh6].
- **Yahav et al.**: 7 vs 14 days in 604 patients; 90-day composite outcome 45.8% vs 48.3% (difference −2.6%; 95% CI −10.5 to 5.3), demonstrating noninferiority [^114KmM5Y].
- **Meta-analyses**: 7 days is noninferior to 14 days for mortality, relapse, and complications, with fewer adverse events and less resistance [^1138ouRo] [^116x1utH] [^113dD1RD].

---

## Clinical factors influencing duration of therapy

Duration should be **individualized** based on:

| **Clinical factor** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated bacteremia with adequate source control | 7 days [^115KeWh6] [^114KmM5Y] |
| Persistent bacteremia or slow clinical response | 10–14 days |
| Endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or abscess | 4–6 weeks (source-dependent) |
| Immunocompromised patients | 10–14 days (individualized) |

---

## Risks and benefits of shorter versus longer courses

Shorter courses (7 days) offer **benefits** — fewer adverse events, less C. difficile, shorter hospital stay, lower resistance, and reduced costs — with **similar mortality and relapse** compared with longer courses [^113dD1RD] [^116x1utH] [^115KeWh6]. Longer courses (10–14 days) are reserved for **complicated cases** but increase adverse events, C. difficile, resistance, and costs without added benefit in uncomplicated cases [^113dD1RD] [^114zq5ab] [^1122xiuH].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA recommends **7 days** for uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia with adequate source control, with longer courses for complicated cases [^notfound]. The **Surviving Sepsis Campaign** likewise supports shorter courses with adequate source control, balancing safety and stewardship [^1122xiuH].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require 10–14 days, individualized to response and source control [^notfound].
- **Persistent bacteremia**: Indicates inadequate source control or complications; extend therapy and reassess [^notfound].
- **Endocarditis or osteomyelitis**: Require prolonged therapy (4–6 weeks) based on source.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia**: 7 days if clinically stable and source controlled [^115KeWh6] [^114KmM5Y].
- **Complicated cases**: 10–14 days or longer, individualized to response and source control [^1138ouRo].
- **Endocarditis or osteomyelitis**: 4–6 weeks based on source.

---

Seven days of therapy is **effective and safe** for uncomplicated E. coli bacteremia, reducing harm and resistance; longer courses are reserved for complicated cases or inadequate source control.

Key messages

- The optimal duration of treatment for bloodstream infections is understudied.

- Available data from bacteremic subgroups of prior randomized controlled trials suggest that shorter-duration therapy (not more than 7 days) may be as effective as longer-duration therapy in achieving clinical cure, microbiologic cure, and survival among most patients with bloodstream infections.

- A large dedicated randomized trial of treatment duration for bacteremia is urgently needed.

Summary

Background

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Methods

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (≤ 7) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia during hospital stay. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence.

Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs men; non-urinary vs urinary source; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). Fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Findings

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-days treatment (90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91). Relapse (1.00, 0.50–1.97); length of hospital stay (P = 0.78); readmission (0.96, 0.80–1.22); and infection complications (local: 1.62 0.76–3.47; distant: 2.00, 0.18–22.08), were without significant difference, and so were adverse events or resistance emergence.

No significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics was demonstrated in the subgroups of gender, age, hemodynamic status, immune status, and source of infection.

Interpretation

For patients hemodynamically stable and afebrile at 48 h prior to discontinuation, seven days of antibiotic therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia result in similar outcomes as 14 days, in terms of mortality, relapse, length of hospital stay, complications of infection, resistance emergence, and adverse events. These results apply for any adult age group, gender, source of infection, immune status, and hemodynamic status on presentation.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111DuJ7Z]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, the concept of shorter antibiotic treatments for bloodstream infections has gained traction. Advances in diagnostic modalities, such as rapid molecular diagnostic tests that can identify the causative pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile more quickly, have provided a rationale for potentially shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy. Shorter courses may also reduce the overall antibiotic burden on the patient, minimizing the risk of adverse events and the development of antibiotic resistance.

Recent studies have provided valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of shorter antibiotic courses for bacterial bloodstream infections. A meta-analysis of 2865 patients reported no significant differences in 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure rates, or 90-day relapse rates between shorter-course (≤ 10 days) and longer-course (> 10 days) antibiotic treatments for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia. A recent multicenter, noninferiority randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3608 hospitalized patients with bloodstream infections reported that 7 days of antibiotic therapy was noninferior to 14 days in terms of 90-day all-cause mortality (difference, −1.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −4 to 0.8). However, the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections remains a subject of intense debate. There is a lack of clear and definitive guidelines, and clinical practice varies widely. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare shorter versus longer-term antibiotic treatments for patients with bacterial bloodstream infections.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the therapeutic equivalence of shorter- and longer-course antibiotic therapy extends to patients with bacteremia. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs explicitly examining the efficacy of shorter-course versus longer-course antibiotic therapy for patients with bacteremia as well as comparable trials examining the organ system infections most commonly causing bacteremia in critically ill patients.

### Emulating a target trial of shorter compared to longer course of antibiotic therapy for Gram-Negative bacteremia [^116FbMW5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of antimicrobial therapies, gram-negative bacteremia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on a global level. Recent randomized controlled trials support shorter antibiotic treatment duration for individuals with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. The target trial framework using the cloning approach utilizes real-world data but eliminates the issue of immortal time bias seen in observational studies by emulating the analysis of randomized trials with full adherence.

Method

A hypothetical target trial allocating individuals with gram-negative bacteremia to either short antibiotic treatment duration (5–7 days) or longer antibiotic treatment duration (8–14 days) was specified and emulated using the cloning, censoring, and weighting approach. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome was a composite endpoint of clinical and microbiological relapse. The emulated trial included individuals from four hospitals in Copenhagen from 2018 through 2021.

Results

In sum, 1040 individuals were included. The median age of the cohort was 76 years, the majority were male (54%), had community-acquired gram-negative bacteremia (86%), urinary tract infection as the source of the infection (78%), and Escherichia coli as the pathogen of the infection (73%). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in all-cause mortality was 1.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -.7, 3.3), and the risk ratio was 1.12 (95% CI: .89, 1.37). The adjusted 90-day risk difference in relapse was 0.7% (95% CI: -2.3, 3.8), and the risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI: .71, 1.45).

Conclusions

We found comparative outcomes for shorter treatment duration compared to longer treatment duration in patients with gram-negative bacteremia.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 7 days of therapy likely represent the preferred duration for uncomplicated Gram-negative bloodstream infections. Future RCTs outside Enterobacterales bacteria and in populations that are more severely immunocompromised will be helpful in providing further evidence in support of shorter durations.

### Treatment duration for Escherichia coli bloodstream infection and outcomes: retrospective single-centre study [^113eEKRz]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the impact of treatment duration on mortality and on relapse in patients with Escherichia coli bloodstream infection (BSI).

Methods

Retrospective single-centre study of patients diagnosed with E. coli BSI at our centre over a 4-year period.

Exclusion Criteria

age < 18 years, clinical data not available, polymicrobial BSI, failure to receive in vitro active therapy, and death while receiving antibiotic therapy. Exposure variable was treatment duration dichotomized into short (≤ 10 days) and long (> 10 days) therapy. Primary end point was all-cause mortality within 90 days after index BSI. Secondary end point was relapse, defined as repeat isolation of E. coli from blood cultures within 90 days after index BSI, in patients with documented clinical cure and completion of therapy for the initial episode.

Results

Of the 856 analysed patients: 426 received short and 430 received long therapy. All-cause mortality at day 90 occurred in 47 patients; on multivariate analysis, short therapy was not associated with a higher risk of mortality, also after adjusting the model for the propensity score of receiving short therapy. Relapse occurred in 42 patients. Independent risk factors for relapse using death as competing risk were immunosuppression (subhazard ratio 4.67, p < 0.001), and end-stage liver disease (subhazard ratio 2.58, p 0.013). The propensity-weighted estimation of the average treatment effect for relapse reduction with long therapy (> 10 days) was -1.6% (p 0.26) in the total population, and -7.1% (p 0.18) in immunocompromised patients.

Conclusions

We could not identify shorter treatment duration as a risk factor for mortality and for relapse in patients with E. coli BSI.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^117VYRGb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The study flow chart is presented in Fig. 1. Three trials met our inclusion criteria, all were investigator-initiated, and compared an antibiotic duration of seven versus fourteen days for Gram-negative bacteremia. One of these three trials included a C-reactive protein (CRP)-based duration arm that was excluded from the analysis, leaving overall 1186 randomized patients (1182 evaluable patients; Yahav et al. 604 patients; von Dach et al. 334 patients; and Molina et al. 248 patients). Trials' characteristics are detailed in Table 1. The most common source of bacteremia in the original trials was UTI (411/604, 68%; 213/334, 64%, and 136/248, 55% of patients in the different trials). Accordingly, the vast majority of causative bloodstream isolates were enterobacterales (95%, 1125/1186), with two trials including only patients with enterobacterales bacteremia, and a third trial allowing other Gram-negatives. In the three included trials, choice and route of administration of antibiotics was at the discretion of the treating physician. Risk of bias assessment of the included trials is detailed in Fig. 2. All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment; all three were open-label.

Overall, 592 patients were included for evaluation in the short (7 days) arm and 590 in the long (14 days) arm. The Breslow–Day test showed no heterogeneity of odds ratios between trials. For the outcome of mortality, no significant difference was demonstrated for either 90- or 30-day mortality between arms (90 days mortality 7 days: 60/592 (10.1%), 14 days: 56/590 (9.5%) - OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30d mortality 7 days: 26/592 (4.4%), 14 days: 24/590 (4.1%) - OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62–1.91 (with OR > 1 favoring 14 days).

### Observational versus randomized controlled trials to inform antibiotic treatment durations: a narrative review [^11618PYp]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies comparing shorter and longer antibiotic treatment durations are increasingly common. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are an ideal methodological approach to study antibiotic treatment durations; however, these trials can be logistically and financially challenging to conduct.

Objectives

In this narrative review, we sought to compare the strengths and limitations of observational study data with those of RCT data in evaluating antibiotic treatment durations. We used uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia as an illustrative case example because several published RCTs and observational studies have been conducted in similar patient populations.

Sources

We searched MEDLINE for articles comparing treatment durations for gram-negative bacteremia from inception to June 9th, 2022. We included studies reporting on all-cause mortality and/or relapse at day 28–30. Data comparing short- versus long-course therapy were pooled by Bayesian random effects meta-analyses to assess the odds ratios (OR) of all-cause mortality and relapse at 30 days, stratified by study design. Parameters were summarized with median and 95% highest-density credible intervals (CrI). Posterior probabilities of OR > 1.0 were estimated. Observational studies were further examined to determine if and how they addressed potential sources of bias.

Content

We identified 1671 unique records and included 10 studies (seven observational and three RCTs). With respect to 30-day mortality, the Bayesian posterior probability that a longer course of therapy was better (i.e. OR > 1.0) was 42% in RCTs (OR, 0.94; 95% CrI, 0.51–1.68) and 91% in observational studies (OR, 1.25; 95% CrI, 0.88–1.73). No observational study fully addressed all potential sources of bias.

Implications

On the basis of our findings, we discuss future directions for antibiotic treatment duration trials, including approaches to limit sources of bias in observation data and novel trial designs.

In a propensity-score-weighted cohort of 183 adults with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bacteremia at 24 US hospitals, patients receiving short courses of active therapy (7–10 days, median 9 days) experienced similar odds of recurrent bacteremia or death within 30 days as those receiving prolonged courses of active therapy (14–21 days, median 14 days).

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^111VHV6F]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this individual patient data meta-analysis of three RCTs, evaluating overall 1182 patients, we found no significant difference in 90- or 30-day mortality between 7 and 14 days of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia. Other patient related outcomes, such as relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, and local or distant complications, were also demonstrated to be without significant difference. No difference in emergence of resistance or adverse events was either demonstrated between short and long therapy arms, though the number of events was low and the follow up duration limited to 90 days.

Analyzing this large database for subgroup analysis, we also did not find a significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics in the subgroups of women vs men; non urinary vs urinary source of bacteremia; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients vs non-immunocompromised patients; and age (above/below 65).

Shorter antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia has been demonstrated to have similar outcomes to longer duration in several observational studies, mostly comparing 5–10 days to longer regimens. Mortality, relapse/recurrence, clinical success, and superinfection rates were similar between longer and shorter therapy in most studies, though some demonstrated higher rates of superinfection, or resistance emergencewith longer therapy; while others reported higher rates of re-initiation of antibiotics and C. difficile with shorter regimen.

Concomitantly, three RCTs demonstrated non-inferiority of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy for hemodynamically stable patients with mainly enterobacterales bacteremia. The strength of this individual patient data meta-analysis is by allowing a larger sample size to test the effect of duration of therapy for specific subgroups of patients. In this meta-analysis, short versus long therapy had similar outcomes among 425 patients with non-urinary source of infection, 801 elderly patients (aged ≥ 65) and 359 patients with low systolic blood pressure. Nevertheless, sample size of each sub-group may not be sufficient to draw conclusions. Moreover, findings from subgroup analyses are at risk of bias given loss of randomization when considering only subgroups.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Pp29V]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bloodstream infections represent a formidable clinical challenge and are associated with major morbidity and mortality worldwide with 2.9 million deaths per year worldwide. Bloodstream infections can result from various reasons, including primary bacteremia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and infections secondary to other foci such as the urinary tract, respiratory tract, or intra-abdominal sites. Blood culture is the reference standard for detection of these micro-organisms in blood. The etiological agents are diverse, encompassing Gram-positive bacilli (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and fungi (e.g. Candida species).

The treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections has long involved the use of antibiotics, and longer-term antibiotic regimens is still the standard of care. The aim was to ensure complete eradication of the bacterial from the bloodstream and deep-seated foci of infection, also to prevent relapse or recurrence of the infection. However, in recent years, concerns have been mounting regarding the consequences of extended antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat. Prolonged use of antibiotics in the treatment of bloodstream infections is a significant contributor to the selection and spread of resistant organisms. Extended antibiotic courses increase the likelihood of emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial, which can lead to treatment failures and the need for more toxic and expensive alternative therapies. Additionally, longer antibiotic regimens are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. These may include allergic reactions, organ toxicity (such as hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity), and secondary infections, particularly Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, which can further complicate the patient's clinical course and prolong hospitalization.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristic of included trials are presented as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables, and interquartile range (IQR, 25–75 percentiles) for non-normally distributed continuous variables.

Difference in outcomes rate between 7 and 14 days of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia were examined. An analysis of outcomes by several pre-specified sub-groups of patients was also performed. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for the comparison of continuous variables between trials. For categorical variables, the fixed-effect meta-analysis model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used to estimate pooled odds ratio and associated 95% confidence interval. The Breslow–Day test for homogeneity of odds ratios was performed to test for between trials differences. The analysis was performed following the intention-to-treat principle, including all patients according to the treatment group assigned at the time of randomization. We also performed a per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 27.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^112po4rD]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gram-negative bacteremia is common in both community and health care settings, with a significant increase in incidence described for some Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. Prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy for such common infections may lead to increased resistance emergence; adverse events and secondary infections, including Clostridioides difficile infection; prolonged hospital-stay; and excess cost.

tThough recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses for Gram-negative bacteremia, prolonged courses are still commonly used and current guidelines still recommend the range of 7–14 days. In addition, it is unclear whether shorter courses of antibiotics are appropriate for specific sub-groups of patients, such as those with non-urinary source of bacteremia; intensive care patients, elderly, and others.

Observational design is a limited tool for evaluating duration of therapy due to confounding by indication and immortal time bias issues. Thus, RCTs are the preferred design to answer this question. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs is considered to be the gold standard of systematic review. IPD meta-analysis advantages (among others) are narrowing the confidence intervals, and increasing the power to evaluate treatment effect in specific sub-groups of patients.

We performed an IPD meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. We aimed to explore outcomes in several pre-specified sub-groups of patients. We hypothesized no significant difference between short and long antibiotic course for either of the sub-groups.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115GiUUr]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The ICU is the epicenter of bacteremia, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance in most hospitals. Reductions in the length of antibiotic treatment courses could potentially limit antibiotic use, adverse effects, and resistance pressure, but antibiotic stewardship efforts to shorten therapy are hampered by the lack of research regarding minimally acceptable durations of treatment for BSIs. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that both inpatients and outpatients with non- S. aureus bacteremia secondary to mild to moderate intra-abdominal infection, CAP, or pyelonephritis may be successfully treated with shorter (5 to 7 days) courses of therapy. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution, as only very small numbers of patients and subgroup analyses are currently available for interpretation. A large dedicated trial of treatment duration for bacteremia in severely ill patients is urgently needed to determine the optimal duration of therapy.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jRwJv]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic reviewof 4 retrospective cohort studies and 1 RCT involving 2865 participants evaluated the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with bacteremia due to Enterobacteriaceae. This review reported that the shorter- and longer-duration antibiotic treatments did not differ significantly in all-cause mortality, clinical cure and relapse at 90 days. Another systematic review of 7 RCTs involving 729 culture-negative neonatal sepsis, where very low-quality evidence suggested that a short antibiotic course, compared to a standard course, did not affect treatment failure rates in culture-negative neonatal sepsis. For Gram-negative bloodstream infections, a recent meta-analysisfound a high likelihood that 7-day antibiotic therapy is non-inferior to 14-day therapy (90-day mortality of 0.91, 95% credible intervals: 0.69–1.22). An early meta-analysisof 13 studies involving 227 bloodstream infections patients compared shorter versus longer antibiotic treatments. It found no significant differences in clinical cure, microbiological cure, or survival outcomes between the two groups. For sepsis and bacteremia, previous systematic review, found no significant difference in clinical outcomes between shorter- and longer-duration antibiotics, consistent with our findings on bloodstream infections. However, these systematic reviews only focused on specific groups of patients such as patients with bacteremia, neonatal sepsis or Gram-negative bloodstream infections. Compared with previous systematic reviews, our study included recent large RCTs with a low risk of bias, increasing the sample size, evaluated more outcomes, and tested additional subgroup hypotheses. To align the results with clinical practice, we used outcomes data from the longest follow-up time point of studies for analysis. To enhance result interpretation, we reported the absolute effects for all outcomes and evaluated the evidence certainty using the latest GRADE methodology.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Y38kp]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, moderate to high certainty evidence suggests that shorter-duration and longer-duration antibiotics likely have similar effects on mortality, treatment failure, relapse, and clinical cure for patients with bloodstream infections. Shorter-duration antibiotics were associated with shorter hospital stays compared with longer-duration antibiotics. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent treatment effects across age strata (neonates/adults) and bacterial categories (Gram-negative/-positive). However, due to inadequate subgroup data and population-specific pharmacodynamic uncertainties, caution is required in interpretation.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PZ2N8]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent global point prevalence survey of infections in 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) documented bloodstream infection (BSI) among 15% of patients, and this rate may be increasing over time because of increased use of immunosuppressive drugs, invasive procedures, and older patients who have concomitant medical conditions and who are admitted to intensive care. These infections are a major contributor to patient morbidity and are associated with a doubling or even tripling of mortality. Mortality rates may be higher if delayed or ineffective initial antimicrobial therapy is prescribed, and so it is difficult to reduce broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the initial empiric phase of treatment in this vulnerable patient population. In contrast, it may be more feasible to reduce antibiotic use at the back end of treatment courses. Up to half of the antibiotic use in hospital wards and critical care units is unnecessary or inappropriate, and excessive durations of treatment are the greatest contributor to inappropriate use. A reduction in the length of antibiotic courses is, therefore, a potentially viable strategy to minimize the consequences of antibiotic overuse in critical care, including antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, Clostridium difficile colitis, and costs.

The optimal duration of therapy for primary BSI and BSI secondary to major organ system infections has been poorly defined. A review of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of infections most commonly encountered in the critical care setting - including guidelines for community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), pyelonephritis, and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) - provides no guidance about the optimal duration of therapy for the subset of patients with bacteremia. In the absence of high-grade evidence, there is wide variability in antibiotic treatment duration recommendations from infectious disease and critical care specialists, and the presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for extended courses of antibiotic therapy regardless of the observed clinical response to treatment. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining duration of therapy in several organ system infections have demonstrated that treatment can be shortened to 1 week or less without worsening patient outcomes, so it is plausible that treatment duration could potentially be shortened for BSIs as well.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^112ZXJL7]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional limitations of this meta-analysis stem mainly from the inherent limitations of included trials and their external validity. These trials included patients that had 'uncomplicated bacteremia' – these were mainly immunocompetent patients, hemodynamically stable and afebrile at time of antibiotic discontinuation, with a controlled infection. For these patients our results are valid. Regarding non-fermenters Gram-negative uncomplicated bacteremia, the number of patients included was limited. Two retrospective studies evaluating therapy duration for uncomplicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia demonstrated no significant difference in mortality or relapse between short and long courses, however in a recent RCT, 8 versus 15 days of antibiotics for P. aeruginosa ventilator associated pneumonia resulted in higher recurrence rate. Further studies are needed in order to define optimal duration of therapy for P. aeruginosa and other non-fermenters bacteremia.

Von-Dach et al. included in their trial a CRP-based duration arm. For patients included in this arm it was allowed to discontinue antibiotics when CRP declined by 75% from peak. Median antibiotic duration in this arm was 7 days (interquartile range, 6–10 days), and all outcomes were non-inferior compared to the 14 days arm. Future studies should examine biomarker-guided strategy for defining antibiotic duration.

We planned this systematic review as a living systematic review and meta-analysis in light of a large ongoing trial that may provide important additional data on the topic. This trial is currently recruiting patients; and includes patients any bacteremia for the comparison of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Two pilot RCTs were performed to evaluate the feasibility of this trial in ICU and ward patients. These were not included in our meta-analysis, since no relevant outcomes per study arm were reported.

In conclusion, for patients with uncomplicated and controlled Gram-negative bacteremia, 7 days of antibiotic therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia result in similar outcomes as 14 days, in terms of mortality, relapse, complications of infection, resistance emergence, and adverse events. These results apply for any adult age group, gender, source of infection, immune status, and hemodynamic status on presentation. Future RCTs should address the duration of therapy for Gram-negative non-fermenters bacteremia.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112XZiFX]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pdiDB]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113dD1RD]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for bloodstream infections remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of shorter versus longer duration antibiotic treatment for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials without language restrictions for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between database inception and 25 November 2024, comparing shorter-duration antibiotic treatments with longer-duration antibiotic treatments in patients with bloodstream infections with a minimum difference of 3 days in duration of therapy. We employed random-effects meta-analyses to summarize the evidence. We used the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, we used the odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess the certainty of evidence. This study is registered with Open Science Framework.

Findings

Eleven RCTs published between 2006 and 2025, involving a total of 5505 participants, proved eligible. There are probably little or no differences in mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79–1.05; moderate certainty), treatment failure (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.69–1.68; moderate certainty), and relapse rates (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.82–1.63; moderate certainty) between shorter- and longer-duration antibiotics. Compared with longer-duration antibiotics, shorter-duration antibiotics do not increase hospital readmission (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75–1.1; high certainty), but reduce the length of hospital stay (MD −3.04, 95% CI −3.9 to −2.18; high certainty). With very low certainty evidence, we are uncertain whether shorter-duration antibiotics decrease any adverse events (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.76–1.32) and serious adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39–1.14) compared with longer-duration antibiotics.

Interpretation

Shorter- and longer-duration antibiotics show similar efficacy for bloodstream infections, with shorter courses reducing hospital stay. Consistent effects were observed across age groups and bacterial types, but cautious interpretation is needed due to limited subgroup data.

Funding

None.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^112kiatu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, 1041 patients (88%) were included in the per-protocol analysis. For the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, no significant difference was demonstrated between arms (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81–1.95).

Other components of the primary outcomes from the trials were without significant difference between arms (Table 2). These included relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmissions at 30 days; and distal complications and local suppurative complications at 90 days (Table 2). Other components of the primary outcomes were reported by individual trials, including restart of targeted antibiotics until 90 days by von Dach et al. without difference between arms (7-days: 9/169, 56% vs 14-days: 9/165, 56%); and absence of clinical cure (i.e. no resolution of signs and symptoms) by Molina et al. with no significant difference between arms (7-days: 8/110, 7.3% vs 14-days: 12/122, 9.8%).

Table 2
The association between study arm and outcomes, stratified by trial (For categorical variables, fixed-effect meta-analysis model, Mantel-Haenszel method. Homogeneity of odds ratios between trials was evaluated with the Breslow–Day test).

Emergence of resistance to study antibiotic was reported from two trials for a follow up of up to 90 days, reporting 36/592 cases (6%) in the short arm and 29/590 cases (5%) in the long arm, without significant difference (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.74–2.04). New clinically or microbiologically documented infection and functional capacity were reported from only one trial. This trial reported no difference in new infections between arms, and significantly shorter time to return to baseline functional capacity in the 7 days arm. As expected, duration of antibiotic therapy for the index bacteremia was significantly shorter in the seven-day arm. Adverse events that were reported from at least two trials included diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, rash and acute kidney injury. All were without significant difference between short and long therapy (Table 2).

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^1136Zghu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112j4vd6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection

Three randomized trials examined duration of antibiotic therapy in intra-abdominal infection. The first randomly assigned 90 adult patients with community-acquired localized secondary intra-abdominal infections of mild to moderate severity to 3 or at least 5 days (mean of 5.7 days and range of 5 to 10 days) of postoperative ertapenem. Patients were included if symptoms and leukocytosis had improved by day 3. Clinical cure was achieved in 39 out of 42 patients (92.9%) receiving shorter therapy and in 43 out of 48 (89.6%) receiving longer therapy. Although blood cultures were drawn when 'clinically indicated', the prevalence of bacteremia and outcomes in patients with bacteremia were not reported.

Two unblinded randomized trials compared 5 versus 10 days of cephalosporin therapy in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). All patients underwent blood cultures at enrollment. In one trial, 26 out of 90 (28.9%) were bacteremic, and no significant difference in survival was observed for shorter (43 out of 43) versus longer (45 out of 47) treatment. Infection-related mortality among bacteremic patients treated for 5 days (0%) and 10 days (11.8%) was not significantly different. In the second trial, 14 out of 50 (28%) were bacteremic, and no significant difference in outcome was observed; 83.3% of short-arm and 87.5% of long-arm patients survived their infections. Secondary outcomes of relapse and hospitalization mortality were also similar between treatment arms and for bacteremic subgroups.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for bloodstream infections remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of shorter versus longer duration antibiotic treatment for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections.

### Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment in patients with positive blood cultures: a patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1169L3s5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic management in patients with positive blood cultures is safe remains understudied. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to investigate effects of PCT-guided antibiotic management in patients with bacteremia.

Methods

We extracted and analyzed individual data of 523 patients with positive blood cultures included in 13 trials, in which patients were randomly assigned to receive antibiotics based on PCT levels (PCT group) or a control group. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of antibiotic treatment. The main safety endpoint was mortality within 30 days.

Results

Mean duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter for 253 patients who received PCT-guided treatment than for 270 control patients (-2.86 days [95% confidence interval, -4.88 to -.84]; p = 0.006). Mortality was similar in both arms (16.6% vs 20.0%; p = 0.263). In subgroup analyses by type of pathogen, we noted a trend of shorter mean antibiotic durations in the PCT arm for patients infected with gram-positive organisms or Escherichia coli and significantly shorter treatment for subjects with pneumococcal bacteremia. In analysis by site of infection, antibiotic exposure was shortened in PCT subjects with Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and those with E. coli urogenital infections.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of patients with bacteremia receiving PCT-guided antibiotic management demonstrates lower antibiotic exposure without an apparent increase in mortality. Few differences were demonstrated in subgroup analysis stratified by type or site of infection but notable for decreased exposure in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and E. coli urogenital infections.

### Seven versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteremia: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^114KmM5Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gram-negative bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Data to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy are limited.

Methods

This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial. Inpatients with gram-negative bacteremia, who were afebrile and hemodynamically stable for at least 48 hours, were randomized to receive 7 days (intervention) or 14 days (control) of covering antibiotic therapy. Patients with uncontrolled focus of infection were excluded. The primary outcome at 90 days was a composite of all-cause mortality; relapse, suppurative, or distant complications; and readmission or extended hospitalization (> 14 days). The noninferiority margin was set at 10%.

Results

We included 604 patients (306 intervention, 298 control) between January 2013 and August 2017 in 3 centers in Israel and Italy. The source of the infection was urinary in 411 of 604 patients (68%); causative pathogens were mainly Enterobacteriaceae (543/604 [90%]). A 7-day difference in the median duration of covering antibiotics was achieved. The primary outcome occurred in 140 of 306 patients (45.8%) in the 7-day group vs 144 of 298 (48.3%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -2.6% [95% confidence interval, -10.5% to 5.3%]). No significant differences were observed in all other outcomes and adverse events, except for a shorter time to return to baseline functional status in the short-course therapy arm.

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia achieving clinical stability before day 7, an antibiotic course of 7 days was noninferior to 14 days. Reducing antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia to 7 days is an important antibiotic stewardship intervention.

### Duration of antimicrobial therapy for Gram-negative infections [^1142d8yh]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The potential benefits on antimicrobial resistance emergence, incidence of antibiotic-related adverse effects, and health costs have pushed to shorten therapeutic courses for Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) infections. However, the safety of this approach is still under investigation. This review gathers recent contributions to the evaluation of the impact on antimicrobial resistance and clinical outcome of shorter therapeutic courses against GNB infections, and highlights data on the modern approach of adjustable antibiotic duration.

Recent Findings

Recent advances include data on the safety of 7-day treatment of uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections with favorable early 48-h evolution. A promising innovative approach with individualized treatment duration arises, supported by recently published results on GNB bacteremia evaluating fixed antibiotic durations and an adaptive antibiotic duration driven by blood levels of C-reactive protein.

Summary

Recent literature illustrates a strong trend towards shortened antibiotic durations in GNB infections, illustrated by lately published data in GNB bacteremia and ongoing studies in GNB ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, short antibiotic course for specific situations, such as immunodeficiency, drug-resistance, and inadequate source control should be handled with caution because of lack of supportive data.

### Impact of continuous pharmacist intervention for injectable antimicrobials on the treatment of patients with Escherichia coli bacteremia [^116LcK3a]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A prospective audit with intervention and feedback (PAF) by pharmacists is important for the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Clinically, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia is a common condition, but only few researchers have examined the role of PAF in its appropriate use of antimicrobials.

Methods

We started PAF by pharmacists in 2017 for all injectable antibiotics. This study included cases of E. coli bacteremia that resulted in hospitalization over a 4 year period from 2016 to 2019. Patients were grouped by year (Period 0–3), and clinical outcomes were examined.

Results

The pharmacists had 12 and 54 suggestions in Periods 0 and 3, respectively. The most common suggestion was de-escalation. The median duration of antimicrobial use was 12 (interquartile range: 8–15) days in Periods 0–2. The duration of antimicrobial use was significantly reduced to 9 (7–12) days in Period 3. In Period 3, the duration of antimicrobial use was reduced by 29%, while anti-pseudomonal drug use was reduced by 42% compared with that in period 0. The 30 day mortality rates were not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusions

PAF by pharmacists promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials in patients with E. coli bacteremia; it is important to continue the program for several years.

### A systematic review of the effect of delayed appropriate antibiotic treatment on the outcomes of patients with severe bacterial infections [^115k16Na]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe bacterial infections often experience delay in receiving appropriate treatment. Consolidated evidence of the impact of delayed appropriate treatment is needed to guide treatment and improve outcomes.

Research Question

What is the impact of delayed appropriate antibacterial therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with severe bacterial infections?

Study Design and Methods

Literature searches of MEDLINE and Embase, conducted on July 24, 2018, identified studies published after 2007 reporting the impact of delayed appropriate therapy on clinical outcomes for hospitalized adult patients with bacterial infections. Where appropriate, results were pooled and analyzed with delayed therapy modeled three ways: delay vs no delay in receiving appropriate therapy; duration of delay; and inappropriate vs appropriate initial therapy. This article reports meta-analyses on the effect of delay and duration of delay.

Results

The eligibility criteria were met by 145 studies, of which 37 contributed data to analyses of effect of delay. Mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving appropriate therapy without delay compared with those experiencing delay (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72). Mortality was also lower in the no-delay group compared with the delay group in subgroups of studies reporting mortality at 20 to 30 days, during ICU stay, or in patients with bacteremia (OR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.43–0.76]; OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.27–0.80]; and OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.40–0.75], respectively). No difference was found in time to appropriate therapy between those who died and those who survived (P = 0.09), but heterogeneity between studies was high.

Interpretation

Avoiding delayed appropriate therapy is essential to reduce mortality in patients with severe bacterial infections.

### Antibiotic treatment of common infections: more evidence to support shorter durations [^117CG1H8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although there is increasing recognition of the link between antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance, clinician prescribing is often unnecessarily long and motivated by fear of clinical relapse. High-quality evidence supporting shorter treatment durations is needed to give clinicians confidence to change prescribing habits. Here we summarize recent randomized controlled trials investigating antibiotic short courses for common infections in adult patients.

Recent Findings

Randomized trials in the last five years have demonstrated noninferiority of short-course therapy for a range of conditions including community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, gram-negative bacteraemia and vertebral osteomyelitis.

Summary

Treatment durations for many common infections have been based on expert opinion rather than randomized trials. There is now evidence to support shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for many conditions.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RaRJp]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Two reviewers (M.L. and Y.G.) used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. For disagreements, the reviewers (M.L. and Y.G.) first discussed to reach consensus. If no agreement could be achieved, a third-party reviewer (J.T.) made the final decision. The assessment considered five domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, directness of evidence, precision of estimates, and potential publication bias. Certainty levels included "high", "moderate", "low", and "very low". To facilitate the interpretation of results, we used relative risk estimates and baseline risk to calculate absolute effects (Risk difference, RD) for dichotomous outcomes. For all outcomes, we used the median in the control group (longer duration group) from eligible trials as the baseline risk. We assessed the imprecision of all results using the minimal important difference (MID) as a threshold. We set the MID for mortality and serious adverse events at 0.5% and 1%, respectively, and the MID for other dichotomous outcomes at 2%. For continuous variables (length of hospital stay), we set the MID at 1 day.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113H7gvu]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for bloodstream infections is unknown. Shorter durations of therapy have been demonstrated to be as effective as longer durations for many common infections; similar findings in bacteremia could enable hospitals to reduce antibiotic utilization, adverse events, resistance and costs.

Methods

A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases was conducted for the years 1947–2010. Controlled trials were identified that randomized patients to shorter versus longer durations of treatment for bacteremia, or the infectious foci most commonly causing bacteremia in critically ill patients (catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), intra-abdominal infections, pneumonia, pyelonephritis and skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI)).

Results

Twenty-four eligible trials were identified, including one trial focusing exclusively on bacteremia, zero in catheter related bloodstream infection, three in intra-abdominal infection, six in pyelonephritis, thirteen in pneumonia and one in skin and soft tissue infection. Thirteen studies reported on 227 patients with bacteremia allocated to 'shorter' or 'longer' durations of treatment. Outcome data were available for 155 bacteremic patients: neonatal bacteremia (n = 66); intra-abdominal infection (40); pyelonephritis (9); and pneumonia (40). Among bacteremic patients receiving shorter (5–7 days) versus longer (7–21 days) antibiotic therapy, no significant difference was detected with respect to rates of clinical cure (45/52 versus 47/49, risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.01), microbiologic cure (28/28 versus 30/32, risk ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.91–1.21), and survival (15/17 versus 26/29, risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.76–1.23).

Conclusions

No significant differences in clinical cure, microbiologic cure and survival were detected among bacteremic patients receiving shorter versus longer duration antibiotic therapy. An adequately powered randomized trial of bacteremic patients is needed to confirm these findings.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^117KNjXU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. We registered this review protocol in the Open Science Framework.

Eligible studies met the following criteria: (i) population: we included RCTs enrolling patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bloodstream infections via positive blood cultures and concurrent clinical symptoms attributable to the infection; (ii) intervention: eligible RCTs compared shorter-duration antibiotic regimens to longer-duration regimens, with a minimum difference of 3 days between treatment durations; (iii) comparison: the comparison did not require identical antibiotic agents or formulations across the two groups; (iv) outcomes: the outcomes included mortality, treatment failure, relapse, hospital re-admission, clinical cure, length of hospital stay, any adverse events (defined as any event with an onset occurring after the first administration of the investigational products or, if pre-existing, worsening after the first administration of investigational products, and occurring within the period of treatment with the investigational products), and serious adverse events (defined as per US FDA criteria).

We imposed no restrictions on the patient gender, age, or ethnicity, source of infection for bloodstream infections, severity of bloodstream infections, comorbidities, specific implicated organisms, type of antibiotics, dosage, or frequency. We excluded studies involving patients with severe immune suppression, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, or bacteremia that did not require active antibiotic therapy to ensure uniformity.

We developed a comprehensive search strategy in consultation with an experienced medical librarian (appendix text s1). We conducted searches in multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid; 1946–November 25, 2024), Embase (via Ovid; 1946–November 25, 2024), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 1996–November 25, 2024). We used controlled vocabulary (e.g. anti-bacterial agents, bacteremia, sepsis) and relevant keywords, such as "bloodstream infection", "macrolides", "beta-lactams", "quinolones" and "tetracyclines" into the search strategy. We manually screened reference lists of included studies and related reviews to identify additional potentially eligible articles.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114TVReZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116fXk2s]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Comparing the outcomes of adults with enterobacteriaceae bacteremia receiving short-course versus prolonged-course antibiotic therapy in a multicenter, propensity score-matched cohort [^111G6GhP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The recommended duration of antibiotic treatment for Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections is 7–14 days. We compared the outcomes of patients receiving short-course (6–10 days) vs prolonged-course (11–16 days) antibiotic therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 3 medical centers and included patients with monomicrobial Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia treated with in vitro active therapy in the range of 6–16 days between 2008 and 2014. 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching without replacement was performed prior to regression analysis to estimate the risk of all-cause mortality within 30 days after the end of antibiotic treatment comparing patients in the 2 treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included recurrent bloodstream infections, Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) bacteria, all within 30 days after the end of antibiotic therapy.

Results

There were 385 well-balanced matched pairs. The median duration of therapy in the short-course group and prolonged-course group was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7–9 days) and 15 days (IQR, 13–15 days), respectively. No difference in mortality between the treatment groups was observed (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval, .62–1.63). The odds of recurrent bloodstream infections and CDI were also similar. There was a trend toward a protective effect of short-course antibiotic therapy on the emergence of MDRGN bacteria (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, .32–1.09; p = 0.09).

Conclusions

Short courses of antibiotic therapy yield similar clinical outcomes as prolonged courses of antibiotic therapy for Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia, and may protect against subsequent MDRGN bacteria.

### Seven vs fourteen days of antibiotics for Gram-Negative bloodstream infection: a systematic review and noninferiority meta-analysis [^1128DhbW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 4 RCTs with a total of 3729 patients, we found that 7 days of therapy had a 95.1% (PP) to 97.8% (ITT) probability of noninferiority to 14 days of therapy for Gram-negative bloodstream infection with adequate source control. We also provide an analysis that allows the reader to estimate the probability of noninferiority for a variety of margins. In contrast to the prior meta-analysis on this topic, we include the results of the BALANCE RCTand use a prespecified noninferiority margin to contextualize results that are not statistically significant for superiority. This outcome is expected when performing a meta-analysis of noninferiority trials, and the method we have used can simultaneously evaluate superiority or noninferiority or even extend to equivalence by prespecifying a lower bound for the 95% CrI.

Limitations

Limitations of this meta-analysis include a conservative estimate of the upper bound of the 95% CrI, given there are only 4 RCTs. The smaller sample size in the PP group also leads to wider 95% CrIs and slightly less probability of noninferiority. Nonetheless, even in the PP group, the probability of noninferiority exceeded 95% with a 68.9% probability of superiority with shorter treatment duration. While mechanisms of potential superiority are speculative, it is plausible that longer durations of antibiotic therapy could increase iatrogenic morbidity and mortality, perhaps through longer durations of hospitalization, requirements for intravenous access, the promotion of antibiotic resistance or dysbiosis, or increasing the risk of antibiotic-related adverse events. Other limitations mainly stem from the limitations of the included studies. It should be noted that certain patient groups are underrepresented in the trials included (eg, those with immunocompromise, such as patients with solid-organ transplant), the predominant sources of infection were urinary, and most of the data pertain to Enterobacterales bacteria. Ongoing trials in bloodstream infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa will provide important complementary evidence outside the dominant pathogens. Similarly, personalized therapy based on clinical stopping rules or biomarker levelswould benefit from additional evaluation.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wMqQg]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although bacteremia caused by intravascular catheters is often cited as the commonest cause of BSI in the critical care setting, we were unable to identify any prospective, randomized investigations examining the duration of antibiotic therapy for CRBSI. Recommendations for length of treatment from the current IDSA guidelines are based only on expert opinion and retrospective case series and call for 5 to 7 days for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 to 14 days for Enterococci and Gram-negative organisms, and 2 to 6 weeks for S. aureus. Trials are urgently needed, as this may be the syndrome most appropriate for shorter-course therapy given that the focus of infection is removable and thereby leaves no persisting infectious nidus for most patients.

The available trials randomly assigning patients with intra-abdominal infections to shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy were conducted in non-ICU settings and populations and explicitly excluded those with generalized secondary peritonitis or nosocomial infections. Equivalent outcomes for shorter- versus longer-duration therapy for SBP and localized intra-abdominal infection are in keeping with similar findings in a retrospective analysis of 929 patients with intra-abdominal infections, in which less than 7 days of therapy was not associated with higher complications or mortality. We have not uncovered evidence, though, of whether the effectiveness of short-duration therapy extends to patients with severe infections complicated by bacteremia or in those for whom source control cannot readily be achieved.

Several narrative reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of treating mild to moderate CAP with short-duration antibiotic therapy (5 to 7 days). The 13 studies of pneumonia identified for this review included 5 studies of CAP that provided the prevalence of bacteremia; in total, 80 patients with bacteremia were randomly assigned in equal numbers to short (3 to 7 days) and long (7 to 10 days) durations of therapy. Only three studies provided outcome data for bacteremic subgroups, and clinical cure was reported in 19 out of 21 patients (89.4%) receiving short-duration therapy (5 to 7 days) and in 17 out of 19 patients (90.4%) receiving extended therapy (7 to 10 days). These results provide a modicum of support for the growing consensus that CAP may be safely treated with shorter durations of therapy irrespective of the presence of bacteremia. Although a large VAP trial documented equivalent survival with shorter (8 days) versus longer (15 days) treatment, very few of these patients were bacteremic, and it is unclear whether shorter-duration treatment can be extended to this subgroup.

### Seven vs fourteen days of antibiotics for Gram-Negative bloodstream infection: a systematic review and noninferiority meta-analysis [^112ovAJM]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Information Sources and Search Strategies

The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was prespecified and is available on the Open Science Framework. The reporting follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework. Starting with the existing individual patient data meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify additional eligible RCTs conducted from May 1, 2022, until November 30, 2024. The search strategy combined the Cochrane highly sensitive filter for RCTswith the terms duration OR days and antibiotic and bloodstream OR bacteremia OR bacteraemia. We applied no language or publication restrictions. References of all included trials were hand searched for additional relevant trials.

Participants were adults hospitalized with Gram-negative bloodstream infection and allocated to 7 or 14 days of therapy. Newly identified studies were combined with those previously reported in the individual patient data meta-analysis. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality as evaluated by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were independently reviewed and appraised by 2 reviewers, with disagreement resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Where data were not available in any manuscript, they were obtained directly from the study authors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 2, by 2 independent reviewers (T.C.L. and C.J.P.) and visualized using the risk-of-bias visualization (robvis). We do not report participant race and ethnicity because it was not reported in the Table 1 of 3 of the 4 included trials.

Certainty of the Evidence

The certainty of evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes was evaluated in duplicate by independent reviewers using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Findings were presented using the GRADEpro guideline development tool.

### Antimicrobial resistance as risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^1112NuVS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health issue, associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Although the effects of AMR on clinical and economic outcomes have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the effects of AMR on infection recurrence, a significant event that results in substantial illness, death, and healthcare costs. Recurrence is of particular concern among bacteremia patients, who are often fragile and have underlying conditions, because bacteremia is associated with high rates of death and AMR. AMR in bacteremia is associated with greater infection severity, higher risk for treatment failure, and longer length of hospital stay, all of which may affect risk for recurrence.

Few studies have investigated AMR as a potential risk factor for recurrent bacteremia, and all have been limited to recurrence of infection attributable to the same bacterium that caused initial infection. Conversely, the few studies not targeting a specific bacterial species or patient population (e.g. those with underlying conditions) and studying risk factors associated with recurrence within 1 year did not consider AMR as a potential risk factor. However, when studying the link between AMR and recurrence, it is important to consider the prolonged microbial imbalance that broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure (i.e. standard bacteremia treatment) can induce on the host microbiome. This imbalance includes ensuing effects on host susceptibility to colonization and infection and effects on selection and duration of carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which, for instance, can exceed 1 year for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae. AMR in an initial bacteremia episode may thus increase risk for recurrence attributable not only to the same bacterium that caused the initial infection but to any bacterium, whether acquired in the community or hospital. As such, studying bacteremia recurrence across all bacterial species and sources of infection seems clinically relevant. Moreover, it is particularly important to focus on community-onset infections, given the increasing spread of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community settings globally.

In this study, we investigated the effect of AMR in incident community-onset bacteremia on the probability of bacteremia recurrence within 1 year. We restricted incident bacteremia episodes to infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. 3 leading pathogens responsible for community-onset bacteremia, and to their leading forms of AMR of major public health concern: methicillin resistance for S. aureus and third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistance for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the major mechanism of which is ESBL production.

### The changing landscape of uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia: a narrative review to guide inpatient management [^114zq5ab]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Gram-negative bacteremia secondary to focal infection such as skin and soft-tissue infection, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or urinary tract infection is commonly encountered in hospital care. Current practice guidelines lack sufficient detail to inform evidence-based practices. Specifically, antimicrobial duration, criteria to transition from intravenous to oral step-down therapy, choice of oral antimicrobials, and reassessment of follow-up blood cultures are not addressed. The presence of bacteremia is often used as a justification for a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy regardless of infection source or clinical response. Antimicrobials are lifesaving but not benign. Prolonged antimicrobial exposure is associated with adverse effects, increased rates of Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial resistance, and longer hospital length of stay. Emerging evidence supports shorter overall duration of antimicrobial treatment and earlier transition to oral agents among patients with uncomplicated Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who have achieved adequate source control and demonstrated clinical stability and improvement. After appropriate initial treatment with an intravenous antimicrobial, transition to highly bioavailable oral agents should be considered for total treatment duration of 7 days. Routine follow-up blood cultures are not cost-effective and may result in unnecessary healthcare resource utilization and inappropriate use of antimicrobials. Clinicians should incorporate these principles into the management of gram-negative bacteremia in the hospital.

### Optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in Gram-negative infections [^111skvaV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Whilst many guidelines recommend limiting the use of antibiotics because of the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), this strategy becomes challenging when dealing with severe infections in critically ill patients. Moreover, some Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) can exhibit mechanisms of resistance that make the patient more vulnerable to recurrence of infections. We reviewed recent data on the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in these patients.

Recent Findings

Apart from having no additional clinical benefit at a certain point after initiation, antibiotics might have negative effects. Prolonged antibiotic exposure has been associated to development of AMR and represents a strong reason to avoid long courses of antibiotic therapy in GNB infections. Recent data suggest that also patients with severe infections, in whom source control is adequate, can be managed with short-course antibiotic therapy.

Summary

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy depends on many factors, but overall, many infections in the critically ill can be treated with short-course antibiotic therapy (7 days or less). The integration of signs of resolution, biomarkers, clinical judgment, and microbiologic eradication might help to define this optimal duration in patients with life-threatening infections caused by GNB.

### Defining the optimal duration of therapy for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections and associated bacteremia [^113kLr8k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data are available to guide effective antibiotic durations for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).

Methods

We conducted an observational study of patients ≥ 18 years at 24 US hospitals to identify the optimal treatment duration for patients with cUTI. To increase the likelihood patients experienced true infection, eligibility was limited to those with associated bacteremia. Propensity scores were generated for an inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis. The primary outcome was recurrent infection with the same species ≤ 30 days of completing therapy.

Results

1099 patients met eligibility criteria and received 7 (n = 265), 10 (n = 382), or 14 (n = 452) days of therapy. There was no difference in the odds of recurrent infection for patients receiving 10 days and those receiving 14 days of therapy (aOR: .99; 95% CI: .52–1.87). Increased odds of recurrence was observed in patients receiving 7 days versus 14 days of treatment (aOR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.40–4.60). When limiting the 7-day versus 14-day analysis to the 627 patients who remained on intravenous beta-lactam therapy or were transitioned to highly bioavailable oral agents, differences in outcomes no longer persisted (aOR: .76; 95% CI: .38–1.52). Of 76 patients with recurrent infections, 2 (11%), 2 (10%), and 10 (36%) in the 7-, 10-, and 14-day groups, respectively, had drug-resistant infections (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Seven days of antibiotics appears effective for hospitalized patients with cUTI when antibiotics with comparable intravenous and oral bioavailability are administered; 10 days may be needed for all other patients.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^115YQtQ4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, the study was terminated before the planned sample size was reached. Yet, noninferiority of fosfomycin for the primary end point was demonstrated so that the results support the use of fosfomycin for this indication. Continuation of the trial until the planned sample size would have provided more precision for the secondary end points. Second, the current study was performed in settings with low levels of antibiotic resistance, and practices in other countries may differ in the broadness of empirical antibiotic treatment, duration on IV treatment, and IV–oral switch. Nevertheless, eligibility was conditional on susceptibility to both fosfomycin and ciprofloxacin. Therefore, we consider our findings, that is, noninferiority of fosfomycin to ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment, valid in such settings for fosfomycin-susceptible isolates. Third, for feasibility and safety reasons, we used a treatment duration of 10 days for all patients, even though 7 days of ciprofloxacin has been demonstrated to be sufficient for treatment of acute pyelonephritis and gram-negative bacteremia. Last, implementation of fosfomycin use for step-down treatment requires reliable susceptibility testing. The MIC of E. coli to fosfomycin, as measured with automated panel tests, seems to correlate poorly with clinical and microbiological efficacy of fosfomycin for the empirical treatment of cystitis. Future improvements in routine fosfomycin susceptibility testing possibly affect the targeted use of fosfomycin, although theoretically it would lead to a higher of fosfomycin efficacy.

In conclusion, this trial demonstrates that fosfomycin 3g every 24 hours as targeted step-down treatment for E. coli fUTIs in women is noninferior to ciprofloxacin with regard to clinical cure. Fosfomycin is an additional oral antibiotic option for this indication, especially in cases of resistance, intolerance, or allergies to existing options.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112NKkd7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Trials focusing exclusively on bacteremia

A single randomized trial examined duration of antibiotic therapy exclusively in bacteremia. Chowdhary and colleagues randomly assigned ICU neonates with positive blood cultures and no obvious deep-seated focus of infection to 7 or 14 days of culture-directed antibiotic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned at day 7 if symptoms had clinically remitted by day 5 (32.5% were excluded because of failure to remit). The composite outcome included bacteriologic relapse with the same organism, a recurrent episode of illness with an elevation in serum C-reactive protein, or a subsequent clinical diagnosis of sepsis by a blinded adjudication committee. No statistically significant difference in treatment outcomes between groups was reported, and 28 out of 33 patients (84.8%) in the 7-day arm and 32 out of 33 (97%) in the 14-day arm were successfully treated. In a preplanned subgroup analysis, the success rate for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia was lower with shorter versus longer therapy: 3 out of 7 (42.9%) versus 7 out of 7 (100%), P = 0.02. Treatment success was not significantly different for shorter and longer duration of therapy in non- S. aureus infections (25 out of 26 in both groups).

### Duration of antimicrobial treatment for bacteremia in Canadian critically ill patients [^113YRb2F]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The optimum duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients with bacteremia is unknown. Our objectives were to determine duration of antimicrobial treatment provided to patients who have bacteremia in ICUs, to assess pathogen/patient factors related to treatment duration, and to assess the relationship between treatment duration and survival.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Settings

Fourteen ICUs across Canada.

Patients

Patients with bacteremia and were present in the ICU at the time culture reported positive.

Interventions

Duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients who had bacteremia in ICU.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 1,202 ICU patients with bacteremia, the median duration of treatment was 14 days, but with wide variability (interquartile range, 9–17.5). Most patient characteristics were not associated with treatment duration. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the only pathogens associated with shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.51–5.26). The urinary tract was the only source of infection associated with a trend toward lower likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42–1.08); an unknown source of infection was associated with a greater likelihood of shorter treatment (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.17–3.91). The association of treatment duration and survival was unstable when analyzed based on timing of death.

Conclusions

Critically ill patients who have bacteremia typically receive long courses of antimicrobials. Most patient/pathogen characteristics are not associated with treatment duration; survivor bias precludes a valid assessment of the association between treatment duration and survival. A definitive randomized controlled trial is needed to compare shorter versus longer antimicrobial treatment in patients who have bacteremia.

### Seven vs fourteen days of antibiotics for Gram-Negative bloodstream infection: a systematic review and noninferiority meta-analysis [^114MFQwR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bloodstream infections is uncertain. While therapy has commonly been given for 2 weeks, recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated the noninferiority of shorter courses (eg, 7 days), and/or biomarker-directed therapy, compared with a longer duration (eg, 14 days). These 3 RCTs, informed an individual patient data meta-analysis in 2023 (N = 1186). Since then, the Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical Effectiveness (BALANCE) trial was published, powered on an overall noninferiority margin of 4% for 90-day mortality; the study included 2547 patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections. Within the subgroup of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection, 7 days of therapy were noninferior to 14 days in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (risk difference, −2.8%; 95% CI, −5.6% to −0.1%).

Systematic review with meta-analysis can provide more accurate results on the efficacy of a medical intervention by combining data from individual studies. However, even the meta-analysis of data from multiple RCTs can fail to identify a superior therapy when the CIs of the pooled estimate cross the null. This is particularly true for meta-analyses containing noninferiority trials. Reporting summary results from meta-analyses of noninferiority trials that are based on a dichotomized interpretation of a P value of less than.05 ultimately fails to account for the statistical design of noninferiority studies, which are not expected to show a significant difference. Instead, a priori noninferiority margins can be selected and bayesian statistics used to provide a more valid estimate of the probability of noninferiority across different margins. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to apply this technique to RCTs comparing 7 vs 14 days of therapy for Gram-negative bloodstream infections.

Results

The study flowchart is presented in Figure 1. Four trials met our inclusion criteria. Three of these, were previously combined in an individual patient meta-analysis; the fourth RCT was the BALANCE trial. Trial characteristics are described in Table 1 and patient characteristics in Table 2. A total of 3729 participants were included in the ITT analysis (1817 [48.7%] men and 1912 [51.3%] women; median age range, 67–79 years) and 3126 in the PP analysis. Most infections were caused by species in the Enterobacterales order (3385 of 3729 [90.8%]), with one trial focused only on Enterobacterales bloodstream infectionand the others allowing other Gram-negative bacteria. In all trials, the choice and route of administration of antibiotics was decided by the treating team, and treatment duration was unmasked, either at the time of randomization or at day 7. As open-label trials, all had some concern for bias due to deviation from the intended intervention but were otherwise considered at low risk of bias (eFigure in Supplement 1).

Overall, 1884 patients were assigned to the 7-day and 1845 to the 14-day arm. For the ITT analysis (Figure 2, top), the RR for mortality with 7 vs 14 days of therapy was 0.91 (95% CrI, 0.69–1.22), corresponding to a 97.8% probability of noninferiority. The control event rate was 13.7% (253 of 1845), implying the noninferiority margin would correspond to 3.4% on the absolute scale. For comparison, the overall experimental event rate was 12.0% (226 of 1884).

### Timing of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration and outcome of adults with community-onset bacteremia [^1177VgZW]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Bacteremia is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and early interventions are often emphasized. However, the estimates of potential benefits of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment vary widely in the literature, from no effect to significant reduction in fatality with an odds ratio of up to 6. Such a controversy may be related to variations in sepsis severity, comorbidities and the immune status of study cohorts, and the distribution of causative microorganisms. Similar to previous reports dealing with the crucial relationship between patient outcomes and the appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy for specific pathogens, such as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, or bloodstream infections, our results support that appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy reduces short-term mortality in patients with community-onset bacteremia. Of importance, in accordance with increasing bacteremia severity, appropriate antimicrobials should be given as soon as possible.

Several investigations have attempted to answer the question "How early is enough to administer appropriate antimicrobials in patients with severe infection?" However, different TtAa cutoffs were determined in heterogeneous patient populations reported in the literature. First, for patients with severe Legionella pneumophila pneumonia, delays > 8 hours between appropriate antimicrobial administration and ICU admission resulted in increased mortality. Second, in another study of patients with cancer and septic shock, a delay of > 2 hours from ICU admission was associated with a poor prognosis. Finally, in a study of ED patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, a TtAa < 1 hour led to a better short-term survival rate.

To our knowledge, the present study was the first one focusing on community-onset bacteremia to prioritize antimicrobial therapy in the initial therapeutic strategy. Similar to a previous report of hospital-based bloodstream infection, the "optimum timing" of appropriate antimicrobial administration was determined as the first 48 hours after arrival at the ED. Furthermore, consistent with the SSC recommendations, this time should be shortened to 1 hour in critically ill patients. However, the administration of in vitro effective antimicrobials to treat bloodstream infections should be as early as possible to achieve optimal treatment of bacterial infections. Any delay in the administration of appropriate drugs should be avoided, if there is a suspicion of severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^113H1kUm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Which treatment duration is adequate for critically ill patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection? Which are the major determinants of antibiotic choice in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI)?

Statement 41

If the patient is critically ill the treatment duration can be deferred until after a multi-disciplinary careful evaluation (Recommendation 1B).

Inadequate source control and inappropriate antibiotics are key determinants of mortality in patients having intra-abdominal sepsis and associated bacteremia.

In order to describe characteristics of critically ill patients with secondary blood stream infection (BSI) of intra-abdominal origin and identify predictors of mortality, a retrospective, single-center study that evaluated patients admitted between January 2005 and January 2011 was recently published. Logistic regression analysis revealed inadequate source control (P = 0.002) and inappropriate antibiotics (P = 0.016) to be independently associated with mortality. In non-critically ill patients with adequate source control procedure after cIAI, the duration of the antimicrobial therapy was well defined. However, for critically ill patients, an individualized approach is always mandatory. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, is a cornerstone for the success.

Pyelonephritis

Six trials of treatment duration for pyelonephritis were included. Only two out of six trials reported outcomes for patients with bacteremia. In a blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 77 adults with pyelonephritis were randomly assigned to 7 versus 21 days of treatment with pivampicillin and pivmecillinam. All patients underwent blood cultures at enrollment, and 9 out of 61 (14.8%) were bacteremic. Clinical cure was achieved in 4 out of 4 bacteremic patients receiving 7 days and 5 out of 5 bacteremic patients receiving 21 days of treatment. A second trial involved 14 versus 21 days of antibiotics for 80 children with acute lobar nephronia, defined as an advanced state of pyelonephritis which may progress to renal abscess if left untreated. Clinical cure was lower among patients receiving shorter versus longer therapy (34 out of 41 versus 39 out of 39, P = 0.01). Four patients were bacteremic, but their outcomes were not provided.

Skin and soft tissue infection

A single randomized trial of antibiotic duration in SSTI was identified. Adult patients with uncomplicated SSTIs were randomly assigned to 5 or 10 days of therapy with levofloxacin but only if they were improving after 5 days of treatment. Clinical cure was observed in 43 out of 44 patients (97.7%) receiving 5 days of therapy and in 42 out of 43 (97.7%) receiving 10 days. Blood cultures were drawn from eight patients when bacteremia was suspected and were positive in one patient, who was excluded from the trial.

At admission, the mean age of enrolled women was 59.4 years (standard deviation [SD], 20.2), the mean Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 7.3 (SD, 4.6), 9 patients (9.3%) had a nonresuscitative policy, and 50 (51.6%) had E. coli bacteremia. More patients assigned to fosfomycin had a history of diabetes mellitus, and more patients in the ciprofloxacin had a history of nephrolithiasis (Table 1). Patients who declined participation (n = 80) had a mean age of 60.3 years (SD, 22.2), a mean CCI of 5.9 (SD, 5.5), a nonresuscitative policy in 2 (of 58 with nonmissing data, 3.4%), and 30 (37.5%) had E. coli bacteremia. Empirical antimicrobial treatment was given for a mean duration of 3.3 days (SD, 1.1), consisting of a second-generation cephalosporin (n = 35), a third-generation cephalosporin (n = 33), a second-generation cephalosporin with an aminoglycoside (n = 15), a carbapenem (n = 2), or another regimen (n = 12), leaving a mean of 6.7 days (SD, 1.1) of oral study medication.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^114ZCUTz]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best management practices

Antibiotic treatment

According to the most recent iteration of the Tokyo Guidelines, antibiotic use for patients with acute cholecystitis is important for three primary reasons: to mitigate systemic septic response and local inflammation, to prevent surgical site infections and to prevent intrahepatic abscess formation. The most common Gram-negative bacteria found in acute biliary tract infections include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas, whereas the most common Gram-positive organisms are Enterococcus and Streptococcus. While local antimicrobial susceptibility data play a role in antibiotic choice, recommendations from the most recent version of the Tokyo Guidelines incorporate a grade system that accounts for infection severity and whether infection is hospital versus community acquired (table 3). Grades I, II and III acute cholecystitis are defined as mild, moderate and severe cholecystitis, respectively. Typical prophylactic antibiotic regimens for patients with acute cholecystitis (calculous, acalculous or ischaemic) or acute cholangitis are either piperacillin or cephalosporin based and are represented in table 3. Additional antimicrobial agents including carbapenems, monobactams, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin may be necessary depending on the clinical setting, patient allergies, local antimicrobial resistance patterns and patient colonisation. Recommendations regarding duration of antibiotic therapy are also based on grade severity. If bacteraemia with Gram-positive cocci is encountered during the clinical course, antibiotic treatment duration of minimum of 14 days is recommended. This extended course differs from that of Gram-negative bacteria, as Gram-positive microorganisms (eg, Enterococcus and Streptococcus) are associated with infective endocarditis. The typical patient scenario for a diagnosis of ischaemic cholecystitis is consistent with grade III severity and hence, we advocate for following this broad regimen.

Table 3
Antibiotic grade system

Non-surgical interventions

After initiating resuscitation and antibiotic administration, source control of the ischaemic gallbladder tissue is paramount. For this cohort, source control most commonly comes in the form of temporary gallbladder drainage. Gallbladder drainage procedures represent a quick and minimally invasive alternative to cholecystectomy for critically ill patients. These approaches have been shown to be an effective method of decompressing the gallbladder and thereby reducing inflammation and minimising bacterial overgrowth. Multiple studies have demonstrated the outcome benefits of drainage procedures versus immediate cholecystectomy for critically ill patients, including decreased morbidity, fewer ICU admissions, decreased hospital length of stay and lower patient costs. There are currently two primary drainage procedures employed for patients diagnosed with ischaemic cholecystitis and deemed to be poor surgical candidates: percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGD) and endoscopic drainage, which can be done via a transpapillary or transmural approach.

### Oral β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for definitive treatment of enterobacterales bacteremia from a urine source [^115c2Byf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

There were notable differences between our study and prior studies. Nearly all of the previous studies included patients with several sources of bacteremia. We limited the likely source of bacteremia to urine and limited the organisms to select Enterobacterales against which oral β-lactam antibiotics typically have some in vitro activity. The urine source of bacteremia was associated with lower mortality and recurrent bacteremia rates in previous studies; therefore, our results may not apply to other sources of bacteremia and do not apply to other Enterobacterales species. Our population comprised nearly all older men, which represents a group at increased risk of recurrent infection because of functional and structural urologic abnormalities. However, the findings may not be applicable to younger patients in whom β-lactam antibiotics may result in subtherapeutic concentrations owing to higher renal clearance. Some authors recommend a 90-day outcome period, and the comparative considerations of different outcome windows have been discussed elsewhere.

There are additional considerations for interpreting and applying our results. Existing breakpoints for oral β-lactam antibiotics are not intended to guide the treatment of gram-negative bloodstream infections. Even when reported as susceptible, oral β-lactam antibiotics given at traditional doses may result in subtherapeutic serum concentrations when organism minimum inhibitory concentrations are at the upper range of susceptibility. Therefore, individual patient characteristics associated with oral β-lactam pharmacokinetics, measured or predicted organism minimum inhibitory concentrations, and limitations of alternative treatments should be considered before the selection of an oral β-lactam antibiotic. Involvement of infectious diseases and antimicrobial stewardship programs should be considered to optimize patient selection. Another important consideration is that the shortest effective treatment duration is unknown, as durations shorter than 7 days have not been systematically studied, to our knowledge. Therefore, we may have overestimated the association of oral antibiotics with outcomes because it is plausible that some patients were adequately treated before initiating oral step-down therapy. Given these considerations, a better understanding of patient factors associated with recurrence is important, as patient-specific factors, rather than definitive antibiotic selection or route, may be the primary factors associated with suboptimal outcomes.

¶This regimen is indicated for cUTI due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and AP due to E. coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia.

# This regimen is indicated for cUTI due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for AP due to E. coli.

ÞDrug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis. This indication is based on a surrogate endpoint. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations achieved in humans are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit [see Clinical Studies (14.9)].

ßThe safety of levofloxacin tablets in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations beyond 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. Prolonged levofloxacin tablets therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.

àDrug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis. Higher doses of levofloxacin tablets typically used for treatment of pneumonia can be used for treatment of plague, if clinically indicated.

### Seven-versus 14-day course of antibiotics for the treatment of bloodstream infections by enterobacterales: a randomized, controlled trial [^112ZkcRw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To prove that 7-day courses of antibiotics for bloodstream infections caused by members of the Enterobacterales (eBSIs) allow a reduction in patients' exposure to antibiotics while achieving clinical outcomes similar to those of 14-day schemes.

Methods

A randomized trial was performed. Adult patients developing eBSI with appropriate source control were assigned to 7 or 14 days of treatment, and followed 28 days after treatment cessation; treatments could be resumed whenever necessary. The primary endpoint was days of treatment at the end of follow-up. Clinical outcomes included clinical cure, relapse of eBSI and relapse of fever. A superiority margin of 3 days was set for the primary endpoint, and a non-inferiority margin of 10% was set for clinical outcomes. Efficacy and safety were assessed together with a DOOR/RADAR (desirability of outcome ranking and response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk) analysis.

Results

248 patients were assigned to 7 (n = 119) or 14 (n = 129) days of treatment. In the intention-to-treat analysis, median days of treatment at the end of follow-up were 7 and 14 days (difference 7, 95%CI 7–7). The non-inferiority margin was also met for clinical outcomes, except for relapse of fever (-0.2%, 95%CI -10.4 to 10.1). The DOOR/RADAR showed that 7-day schemes had a 77.7% probability of achieving better results than 14-day treatments.

Conclusions

7-day schemes allowed a reduction in antibiotic exposure of patients with eBSI while achieving outcomes similar to those of 14-day schemes. The possibility of relapsing fever in a limited number of patients, without relevance to final outcomes, may not be excluded, but was overcome by the benefits of shortening treatments.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect for antibiotic duration in bloodstream infection: an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the BALANCE randomised clinical trial [^115biAGq]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Formulation of clinical decision rules

We aimed to formulate two candidate decision rules for guiding antibiotic duration through expert clinician consensus. First, we identified potential variables of interest by inviting all BALANCE investigators (representing a diverse group of general internists, hospitalists, infectious disease, and/or critical care physicians) to complete a survey querying respondents on: (a) baseline factors they consider in deciding duration of therapy; and, (b) time-varying factors they consider when deciding when to stop antibiotic therapy in patients with gram-negative BSI. A copy of the survey sent to BALANCE investigators is available in the Supplementary Appendix A.

Next, we ranked variables and formulated two candidate clinical decision rules through expert consensus (SWXO, RAF, ND). Disagreements were resolved through discussion among the three lead investigators. Formulation of the rules took into account survey results, data availability within the BALANCE cohort, ease of interpretation and use across different settings, and results of the conventional BALANCE subgroup analyses (e.g. we included gram-positive or polymicrobial infection in the candidate rule as there was a non-statistically significant signal toward a potential subgroup effect in the primary BALANCE analysis, detection of which may have been limited by smaller numbers in the gram-positive and polymicrobial groups). Relative weighting of the components in the score were determined based on relative ranking of the variables in the survey results. We determined that 2 points should be assigned to each of the top 2 ranking components in the survey results, with 1 point assigned to remaining components. We also considered other variables highlighted as important by respondents that may not have been included in the multiple-choice portion in the survey (e.g. persistent bacteraemia was highlighted as a potential reason to prolong therapy by multiple respondents, hence it was included in the score). We specified a priori that two decision rules would be formulated: one static decision rule (to be applied on day four of illness, considering patient variables at baseline and up to day four, stratifying patients into different risk groups, each with a planned total antibiotic duration) and one dynamic stopping rule (to be evaluated daily based on time-dependent parameters on each day of illness, informing clinicians if antibiotics could be safely stopped on the first day that all criteria are met). These were planned both for the analyses reported in this paper, but also to inform the design of a potential future prospective trial evaluating personalized antibiotic duration. Day four was chosen for the static decision rule as this was deemed a time point at which early clinical response could be evaluated. We also pre-specified before reviewing the survey results that the static decision rule should classify patients into three risk groups (low, moderate, and high) with the intention of allowing three corresponding treatment durations in a future trial (< 7 days, 7 days, and > 7 days). Cut-offs for the scores were determined based on clinical consensus; that none of the high-risk features (i.e. score = 0) should be present to consider shorter duration (< 7 days), where multiple features should be present to consider prolonged duration (> 7 days).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^115EJrG2]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174vUrp]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Pneumonia

Thirteen eligible trials that included a total of 6,825 patients of various ages, clinical settings, and treatments were included (Table 1). Five trials examined treatment duration in pediatric pneumonia, six studied adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and two studied ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Clinical success rates were similar with shorter versus longer therapy in five studies of neonatal pneumonia (Table 1 and Figure 2). These studies either documented no patients with bacteremia or did not report on this subgroup.

Six trials of adult CAP found no difference in clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration of treatment. Five trials included information on patients with bacteremia, and three provided subgroup analyses of outcomes of patients with bacteremia. In a trial of mild to moderate CAP, 388 patients were randomly assigned to 5 or 7 days of treatment with telithromycin. Blood cultures were positive in 23 out of 388 (5.2%), and treatment was successful for 20 out of 20 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. The pathogens implicated in the remaining three bacteremias (and the corresponding patient outcomes) were not reported. In a trial of 530 patients with mild to moderate CAP, only 14 (2.7%) were bacteremic, and no significant difference in clinical success was noted between 7 out of 7 bacteremic patients receiving 5 days of levofloxacin and 6 out of 7 (85.7%) receiving 10 days. Finally, a trial (n = 52) of adult inpatients with CAP documented bacteremia in 6 out of 46 patients (13%). Neither of 2 bacteremic patients receiving 7 days of cefuroxime achieved clinical success (although 1 died within 24 hours of initiation) versus 3 out of 4 patients receiving 10 days.

One small VAP trial randomly assigned 30 patients to 7 or 10 days of culture-directed antibiotic therapy, and similar rates of survival among those treated for 7 days (64.3%) and 10 days (62.5%) were reported. The numbers of patients with bacteremia or their outcomes were not provided. In a large, multicenter, high-quality trial that randomly assigned 402 adult patients to 8 or 15 days of therapy, survival was not different: 160 out of 197 (81.2%) versus 169 out of 204 (82.8%). While all patients were blood cultured at enrollment and 28 out of 402 patients (7%) were bacteremic, the outcomes of these patients with bacteremia were not separately reported.

In the PP analysis, 1527 patients were assigned to 7 days and 1599 to 14 days (Figure 2, bottom). The RR for mortality with 7 vs 14 days of therapy was 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.68–1.32), which corresponded to a 95.1% probability of noninferiority. The control event rate was 12.4% (199 of 1599), corresponding to a noninferiority margin of 3.1% on the absolute scale.

The probability of superiority (RR < 1.00) was 76.6% in the ITT analysis and 68.9% in the PP analysis. The probability of noninferiority or superiority vs the upper limit of the RR is presented in Figure 3.

The y-axis represents the probability of a result less than or equal to the x-axis value. For example, at the prespecified upper bound of 1.25, the probability that the risk ratio (RR) is 1.25 or less is 97.8% for the intention-to-treat analysis and 95.1% for the per-protocol analysis. The dashed line at 1.00 represents superiority (RR is ≤ 1.00); the dashed line at 1.25 represents noninferiority.

Certainty of the Evidence

For a common clinical presentation, with 4 RCTs at no risk of serious bias, we graded the certainty of the evidence as high. We graded the importance of the outcome as critical (eTable in Supplement 1).

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### Bacteraemic urinary tract infection: management and outcomes in young infants [^111tjkpV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine predictors of parenteral antibiotic duration and the association between parenteral treatment duration and relapses in infants < 3months with bacteraemic urinary tract infection (UTI).

Design

Multicentre retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Eleven healthcare institutions across the United States.

Patients

Infants < 3months of age with bacteraemic UTI, defined as the same pathogenic organism isolated from blood and urine.

Main Outcome Measures

Duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy, relapsed UTI within 30days.

Results

The mean (± SD) duration of parenteral antibiotics for the 251 included infants was 7.8days (± 4days), with considerable variability between institutions (mean range 5.5–12days). Independent predictors of the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy included (coefficient, 95% CI): age (-0.2days, -0.3days to -0.08days, for each week older), year treated (-0.2days, -0.4 to -0.03days for each subsequent calendar year), male gender (0.9days, 0.01 to 1.8days), a positive repeat blood culture during acute treatment (3.5days, 1.2–5.9days) and a non-Escherichia coli organism (2.2days, 0.8–3.6days). No infants had a relapsed bacteraemic UTI. Six infants (2.4%) had a relapsed UTI (without bacteraemia). The duration of parenteral antibiotics did not differ between infants with and without a relapse (8.2 vs 7.8days, p = 0.81).

Conclusions

Parenteral antibiotic treatment duration in young infants with bacteraemic UTI was variable and only minimally explained by measurable patient factors. Relapses were rare and were not associated with treatment duration. Shorter parenteral courses may be appropriate in some infants.

### Seven vs fourteen days of antibiotics for Gram-Negative bloodstream infection: a systematic review and noninferiority meta-analysis [^112L9zUR]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Gram-negative bloodstream infections are a common cause of hospitalization. A 2-week duration of antibiotic therapy has been commonly used, but shorter durations may have similar outcomes.

Objectives

To assess whether 7 days of antibiotic therapy was noninferior to 14 days.

Data Sources

Starting with a 2022 individual patient data meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched to identify additional eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted from May 1, 2022, until November 30, 2024.

Study Selection

RCTs involving primarily adults who were hospitalized at the time of Gram-negative bloodstream infection and were allocated to 7 or 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Studies were independently reviewed by 2 investigators.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

PRISMA guidelines were followed. Data were extracted by 2 investigators. Any unpublished data were obtained directly from study authors. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 2, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were pooled by separate random-effects meta-analyses for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. A noninformative prior probability was used for the effect, and an evidence-based weakly informative prior probability was used for heterogeneity. Risk ratios (RRs), 95% credible intervals (CrIs), and probability of noninferiority were calculated using a prespecified upper bound of 1.25 or less.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Ninety-day all-cause mortality.

Results

Four eligible RCTs contributed 3729 patients in the ITT population (1912 women [51.3%]; median age range, 67–79 years) and 3126 in the PP population. In the ITT analysis, within 90 days, 226 patients (12.8%) receiving 7 days of antibiotics died compared with 253 (13.7%) receiving 14 days, corresponding to an RR for 90-day mortality of 0.91 (95% CrI, 0.69–1.22) and a 97.8% probability of noninferiority. In the PP analysis, the RR was 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.68–1.32), corresponding to a 95.1% probability of noninferiority.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections and adequate source control, 7 days of antibiotic therapy had a high probability of being noninferior to 14 days. These findings support a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for appropriately selected patients like those in the included RCTs.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^116AV2uF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) duration of therapy — We recommend that ASPs implement guidelines and strategies to reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Suitable approaches include developing written guidelines with specific suggestions for duration, including duration of therapy recommendations as part of the preauthorization or prospective audit and feedback process, or specifying duration at the time of antibiotic ordering (eg, through an electronic order entry system). Findings from 2 pre–post investigations suggest similar clinical outcomes with reduced duration; in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, education and PAF reduced use from 20.7 days to 13.1 days (P < .001), with no significant differences in length of stay or 30-day readmission rates, and among inpatients with SSTIs duration fell from 13 to 10 days; P < .001) after a guideline. Evidence from systematic reviews and RCTs demonstrates that shorter courses are associated with outcomes similar to longer courses in adults and children with few adverse events.

In a multicenter, observational, propensity-score-weighted cohort of 249 adults with uncomplicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, patients receiving short-course (median, 9 days; interquartile range [IQR], 8–10) therapy had a similar odds of recurrent infection or death within 30 days as those receiving longer courses (median, 16 days; IQR, 14–17).

### Antimicrobial treatment duration for uncomplicated bloodstream infections in critically ill children: a multicentre observational study [^116rVvGE]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The nature of critical care requires clinicians to make clinical decisions amidst evolving patient characteristics, changing clinical parameters, new laboratory findings and fluctuating clinical stability. These complex factors, in addition to differences in institutional culture and the general lack of evidence-based guidelines for treatment duration of infections have also been shown to contribute to significant variations in prescribing practice regarding antimicrobial use.

In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, it is important to develop strategies to reduce antimicrobial overuse. One way to achieve this would be to optimize the duration of antimicrobial therapy and provide the shortest effective and safe duration of treatment. Our study results provide important data that demonstrates there is a need to study what duration is actually needed for adequate treatment of BSIs in critically ill children and to determine whether shorter treatment durations could be appropriate for patients with certain clinical and infection-related characteristics. More prospective research to produce evidence that will inform and develop optimal prescribing policies for treating BSIs is needed.

Strengths of this study include the range of participating PICUs across five cities in four provinces across Canada, the capture of all systemic antimicrobial therapies received by patients from the first positive index blood culture and adjudication in every case to confirm that the antimicrobial therapies used were reported active against the pathogen when treatment duration was calculated. We also mitigated survivor bias by excluding patients who died early while on antibiotics so that their deaths would not be incorrectly attributed to having received short duration antimicrobial therapy. Our study results are generalizable because we did not put restrictions on the sources of infection or types of pathogen included, with the exception of contaminating organisms and the few foci of infection where prolonged treatment is well-established. We also used multivariable linear regression analysis to account for pre-selected differences between patients, pathogens and infections, as well as clustering of patients within PICUs.

There are some limitations to this study due to the retrospective observational design. Adequate treatment duration was adjudicated based on the days of consecutive therapy with active antimicrobials, but we could not confirm that the antimicrobials were always intended for the treatment of the BSI. The determination of an underlying source of infection in a retrospective chart review was challenging because this was not always explicitly stated in the chart and reported signs and symptoms and test results alone do not always sufficiently clarify the source. Clinical decisions about treatment duration depend on the clinical context and there could have been other confounding factors influencing treatment duration that were not captured. Finally, details about the timing of source control, which would influence the duration of antimicrobial therapy prescribed, were not captured.

### Time-to-positivity in patients with Escherichia coli bacteraemia [^113yApca]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The time from the start of incubation to a positive reading of blood cultures (time-to-positivity; TTP) is related to the concentration of bacteria in blood. Information concerning the correlation of TTP with clinical parameters, and its usefulness as a prognostic factor in patients with Escherichia coli bacteraemia, is limited. To investigate the relationship of TTP to clinical parameters, 459 cases of monomicrobial E. coli bloodstream infections from a single institution between 1997 and 2005 were reviewed. All cases involved patients who were not undergoing antibiotic treatment at the time of blood sampling. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.3%. Median TTP was significantly shorter for patients who died than for those who survived (9.7 h, inter-quartile range 7.85–11.05 h vs. 11.2 h, inter-quartile range 10.1–11.4 h; p < 0.001). Patients with TTP in the lowest quartile were more likely to be female, to have a non-urinary tract or an unknown origin of bacteraemia, to have severe sepsis or shock, and to subsequently die. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the hazard ratio for death from any cause for patients with a short TTP was 3.13 (95% CI 1.28–7.64; p 0.01). TTP in patients with E. coli bacteraemia provides prognostic information beyond that provided by the presence of haematological illness, a Charlson score ≥ 3, a non-urinary tract origin of bacteraemia, and the presence of severe sepsis or shock.

### The duration of hypotension before the initiation of antibiotic treatment is a critical determinant of survival in a murine model of Escherichia coli septic shock: association with serum lactate and inflammatory cytokine levels [^115RBjc5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

This study was designed to examine the relationship between the timing of antibiotic treatment and both survival rates and hemodynamic/inflammatory correlates of survival in a murine model of Escherichia coli septic shock.

Methods

Surgical implantation of an E. coli (O18:K1:H7)-laced, gelatin capsule-encased fibrinogen clot was used to generate a bacteremic model of murine septic shock. Survival duration, hemodynamic responses, and circulating serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and lactate levels were assessed in relation to increasing delays in or absence of antibiotic treatment.

Results

A critical inflection point with respect to survival occurred between 12 and 15 h after implantation. When initiated at or before 12 h, antibiotic treatment resulted in ≤ 20% mortality, but, when initiated at or after 15 h, it resulted in > 85% mortality. Physiologically relevant hypotension developed in untreated septic mice by 12 h after implantation. Values for heart rate differed between untreated septic mice and sham-infected control mice by 6 h after implantation, whereas values for cardiac output and stroke volume did not differ until at least 18–24 h after implantation. Antibiotic treatment initiated ≥ 12 h after implantation was associated with persistence of increased circulating serum lactate, TNF- alpha, and IL-6 levels.

Conclusions

The timing of antibiotic treatment relative to hypotension is closely associated with survival in this murine model of septic shock. Delay in antibiotic treatment results in the persistence of inflammatory/stress markers even after antibiotic treatment is initiated.

### Clin-star corner: what's new at the interface of geriatrics, infectious diseases, and antimicrobial stewardship [^1155KotP]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are among the leading causes of adverse drug events in older adults. Short-course antibiotic therapy has been shown to work as well as the traditional longer durations for many types of infections. Antibiotic stewardship interventions including deprescribing strategies have shown a reduction in patient readmissions and mortality among older adults. We identified practice-changing clinical trials focusing on three major domains of overprescribing antibiotics in older adults - community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gram-negative bacteremia. The selected articles underscore the safety and effectiveness of shorter durations of antibiotic treatment for infections in older adults, thus highlighting an opportunity for deprescribing in the aging population. By optimizing antibiotic use, we stand to reduce adverse events and enhance overall health outcomes in older adults.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^117TD9Hh]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Initial treatment — KAS 5: Clinicians Should Initiate Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation) — is presented with epidemiology in infants < 90 days and de-escalation when enterovirus is identified. Gram-negative organisms have been responsible for the majority of infections (60% to 80%), and E coli has been the most common pathogen detected, with a prevalence of 70% to 90% of UTIs, 30% to 60% of bacteremia infections, and 15% to 30% of bacterial meningitis; GBS remains present in > 20% of febrile infants with bacteremia after the first week, and L monocytogenes is rarely encountered. Enteroviral testing of CSF has been shown to shorten length of stay and duration of antimicrobial use, and if CSF is positive for enterovirus, antimicrobial agents should be discontinued (or withheld) because concomitant enteroviral and bacterial meningitis is rare.

### Clinical outcomes of early phenotype-desirable antimicrobial therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia [^111vfCVR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Initiating effective therapy early is associated with improved survival among patients hospitalized with gram-negative bloodstream infections; furthermore, providing early phenotype-desirable antimicrobial therapy (PDAT; defined as receipt of a β-lactam antibiotic with the narrowest spectrum of activity to effectively treat the pathogen's phenotype) is crucial for antimicrobial stewardship. However, the timing of targeted therapy among patients hospitalized with gram-negative bloodstream infections is not well understood.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes between patients who were hospitalized with Enterobacterales bloodstream infections receiving early vs delayed PDAT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used a large, geographically diverse, hospital-based US database (PINC AI Healthcare Database). Participants were adult (aged ≥ 18 years) patients with an inpatient admission between January 1, 2017, and June 30, 2022, with at least 1 blood culture isolate positive for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis and receiving PDAT on blood culture collection days 0 to 4.

Exposure

Early vs delayed PDAT, with early PDAT defined as receipt of PDAT on blood culture collection days 0 to 2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was desirability of outcome ranking, in which patients were assigned a mutually exclusive rank 1 through 5. Rank 1 indicated the most desirable outcome (alive with no events), whereas rank 5 indicated the least desirable outcome and included all patients who died within 30 days of blood culture collection.

Results

Among 8193 eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.0 [16.4] years; 4758 [58.1%] female; 1200 [14.6%] African American or Black, 729 [8.9%] Hispanic, and 5778 [70.5%] White) from 252 hospitals, 5033 (61.4%) received early PDAT. Patients receiving early PDAT were similar in age (mean [SD], 68.2 [16.9] vs 70.3 [15.6] years) but more likely to have a lower median (IQR) Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score (2 [1–5] vs 3 [1–5]) compared with patients receiving delayed PDAT. After adjusting for comorbidities and severity of illness, patients receiving early PDAT were 20% less likely to be readmitted within 30 days compared with those receiving delayed PDAT (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.92; P < .001). A higher percentage of patients receiving early PDAT had a desirability of outcome ranking of 1 compared with patients receiving delayed PDAT (56.3% vs 52.2%, P < .001). Those receiving early PDAT had a 52.5% probability (95% CI, 51.3%-53.7%) of a more desirable outcome than those receiving delayed PDAT, a finding that persisted in the adjusted analysis (probability, 52.0%; 95% CI, 50.9%-53.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Receiving early PDAT was associated with favorable 30-day clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with Enterobacterales blood stream infections. Early PDAT may be important not only for antimicrobial stewardship but also for improving patient outcomes.

Introduction

Bloodstream infection (BSI) refers to the presence of actively proliferating microbes in the normally sterile blood. BSI can lead to life-threatening organ failure and organ dysfunction, including sepsis and septic shock. Worldwide, BSI affects > 30 million peopleand causes 2.91 million deaths (range: 1.74–4.53 million), ranking among the top seven causes of mortality in Europe and North America, but its impact varies among countries. In the United States, BSI accounts for 15−30% case fatality rates in nosocomial infections. A critical aspect of BSI is the accurate diagnosis of the infecting pathogen, their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and the possible primary sources of infection, all of which will inform the optimal and targeted treatment regimen. Treatment of BSI is complicated by the need for timely source control and lengthy antimicrobial therapy. Survival rates rapidly decline in cases where adequate and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is not administered within the first few hours after clinical onset of BSI. The clinical, public health and economic burden of BSI is immense.

The causative agents of BSI are diverse, but Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus are the predominant bacterial pathogens that together account for > 40% of cases. The opportunistic E. coli is broadly divided into two groups: extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and intestinal pathogenic E. coli (InPEC). ExPEC strains typically occupy a niche in the intestinal microbiota of humans, but they can gain access to sites beyond the gastrointestinal tract, where they can cause serious infections. ExPEC can reach the bloodstream through bacterial translocation or underlying infections at different ports of entry (urinary tract, digestive, or hepatobiliary) or intravascular catheter-related routes. However, the underlying sources of infections may not always be apparent from the clinical presentation, especially later in the course of a BSI. Nonetheless, the increasing incidence of BSI caused by E. coli over the last two decades is troubling, with rates growing from 18.7% in 1997–2000 to 24% in 2013–2016. Worldwide, the number of deaths due to E. coli BSI remains high (242,000 in 2019, range: 133,000–398,000). This increasing trend is partly attributed to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli in BSI, in particular those strains carrying β-lactamase-encoding genes.

### Effect of C-reactive protein-guided antibiotic treatment duration, 7-day treatment, or 14-day treatment on 30-day clinical failure rate in patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^114eegjr]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic overuse drives antibiotic resistance. Gram-negative bacteremia is a common infection that results in substantial antibiotic use.

Objective

To compare the clinical effectiveness of C-reactive protein (CRP)-guided, 7-day, and 14-day antibiotic durations 30, 60, and 90 days after treatment initiation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, noninferiority, point-of-care randomized clinical trial including adults hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia conducted in 3 Swiss tertiary care hospitals between April 2017 and May 2019, with follow-up until August 2019. Patients and physicians were blinded between randomization and antibiotic discontinuation. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) were eligible for randomization on day 5 (± 1 d) of microbiologically efficacious therapy for fermenting, gram-negative bacteria in blood culture(s) if they were afebrile for 24 hours without evidence for complicated infection (eg, abscess) or severe immunosuppression.

Intervention

Randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio to an individualized CRP-guided antibiotic treatment duration (discontinuation once CRP declined by 75% from peak; n = 170), fixed 7-day treatment duration (n = 169), or fixed 14-day treatment duration (n = 165).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the clinical failure rate at day 30, defined as the presence of at least 1 of the following, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%: recurrent bacteremia, local suppurative complication, distant complication (growth of the same organism causing the initial bacteremia), restarting gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy due to clinical worsening suspected to be due to the initial organism, or death due to any cause. Secondary outcomes included the clinical failure rate on day 90 of follow-up.

Results

Among 504 patients randomized (median [interquartile range] age, 79 [68–86] years; 306 of 503 [61%] were women), 493 (98%) completed 30-day follow-up and 448 (89%) completed 90-day follow-up. Median antibiotic duration in the CRP group was 7 (interquartile range, 6–10; range, 5–28) days; 34 of the 164 patients (21%) who completed the 30-day follow-up had protocol violations related to treatment assignment. The primary outcome occurred in 4 of 164 (2.4%) patients in the CRP group, 11 of 166 (6.6%) in the 7-day group, and 9 of 163 (5.5%) in the 14-day group (difference in CRP vs 14-day group, -3.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 1.1]; P < .001; difference in 7-day vs 14-day group, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 6.3]; P < .001). By day 90, clinical failure occurred in 10 of 143 patients (7.0%) in the CRP group, 16 of 151 (10.6%) in the 7-day group, and 16 of 153 (10.5%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, 30-day rates of clinical failure for CRP-guided antibiotic treatment duration and fixed 7-day treatment were noninferior to fixed 14-day treatment. However, interpretation is limited by the large noninferiority margin compared with the low observed event rate, as well as low adherence and wide range of treatment durations in the CRP-guided group.

### Shortening antibiotic therapy duration for hospital-acquired bloodstream infections in critically ill patients: a causal inference model from the international EUROBACT-2 database [^113igNuE]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSIs) are severe and require antibiotic therapy. In non-complicated BSIs, shortened therapy reduces side effects without compromising efficacy. The impact of shortened antibiotic therapy in HA-BSI critically ill patients without indication of prolonged therapy requires further evaluation.

Methods

Using the international prospective EUROBACT-2 cohort, we compared shortened (7–10 days) versus long (14–21 days) treatment durations in ICU patients eligible for shortened therapy. Patients without antibiotic therapy within 3 days after HA-BSI occurrence or requiring prolonged therapy (due to infection source, microorganism, or clinical deterioration) were excluded. Treatment failure, defined as death, persistent infection, or subsequent infectious complications by Day 28, was assessed using an inverse-probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression.

Results

Among 2600 patients, 550 were eligible for shortened treatment, 213 received short, and 337 received long treatment. The most common infection source was intravascular catheters (33%), most common microorganisms were Enterobacterales (39%). Patients with long treatment were more frequently infected with Staphylococcus aureus (11% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.025) or difficult-to-treat microorganisms (23% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), and received more commonly combination therapy (46% vs. 30%, p < 0.001). Short treatment was associated with reduced 28-day treatment failure (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44–0.93, p = 0.019), mainly due to reduction in subsequent infectious complications (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.91, p = 0.018). Mortality (OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.59, 1.43], p = 0.7) and persistent infection rates (OR 0.47 [95% CI 0.17, 1.14], p = 0.12) were similar.

Conclusions

In selected ICU patients with HA-BSI, shortened antibiotic treatment might be considered. Eurobact2 was a prospective international cohort study, registered in ClinicalTrials.org (NCT03937245).

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^115Q3VXV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 25 — Tunnel infections states that empiric antibiotics should be initiated to target both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and should be modified once culture and sensitivity results are available. The typical treatment duration for CVC tunnel infections is 10 to 14 days in the absence of concurrent bacteremia, and if CVC-related bacteremia is also present, the duration of treatment should be dictated by the management strategy for the CVC-related bacteremia. If the tunnel infection is not effectively treated with antibiotics, consider CVC exchange with a new subcutaneous tunnel to preserve the venous access site; if not possible, the CVC should be removed and a new CVC placed at a new entry site.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jSqSL]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, while our data suggest that longer durations of antibiotics are not necessary for uncomplicated blood stream infections they should not be extrapolated to situations including Staph aureus bacteraemia, prosthetic joint infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or unresolved source control where longer duration is the standard of care. Secondly, our pre-specified age-stratified subgroup analysis (neonates versus adults) demonstrated no statistically significant interaction effect, indicating consistent treatment effects across age groups within the analyzed evidence base. This consistency was further supported by our bacterial categorization subgroup analysis (Gram-negative versus Gram-negative/positive), which showed no significant heterogeneity, mitigating concerns about pathogen-related confounding. Notably, the findings of our study regarding Gram-negative bloodstream infections are similar with those of a recent meta-analysis. Therefore, due to population-specific pharmacodynamic considerations and the potential presence of infections caused by uncommon or resistant pathogens, cautious interpretation is required regarding its generalizability to neonates or infections caused by special pathogens. Thirdly, there was limited data available for some pre-specified subgroup analyses. Additionally, there is currently a lack of data on the type of infecting organisms, sources of infection, and whether changes in antibiotic treatment. Especially, the lack of data on bloodstream infections occurring in the context of severe infections limits the generalizability of our findings to such patients, warranting caution in their application. The definitions of outcomes such as treatment failure, relapse, and clinical cure were not always consistent across trials. Reassuringly, these variations did not lead to significant heterogeneity. Given that fewer than 10 studies for a certain outcome, we were unable to assess publication bias. While we made efforts to include all eligible studies, the possibility of publication bias affecting the stability of the results cannot be fully excluded. For mortality and treatment failure with zero-event studies, we applied a continuity correction of 0.5 for trials reporting no events. Nonetheless, our results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses after excluding zero-event studies. Moreover, interpretation of mean length of stay should be made with caution, as potential skewness in the underlying data-especially from studies with small sample sizes-may limit the accuracy of pooled estimates.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^11196Q3L]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment for renal abscesses involves a combination of appropriate antibiotics and percutaneous or open surgical drainage. Only intravenous antibiotics were used in this case, because the abscess was too small to drain. In adult populations, it is recommended that renal abscesses less than 3 cm are treated without drainage, and this recommendation is also frequently applied to pediatric patients. Case studies in children have reported that renal abscesses less than 3 cm can be successfully treated without drainage.

Although the preferred antibiotic for ESBL-positive microorganisms is carbapenem, the selection of other antibiotics is under discussion due to antimicrobial resistance. Carbapenem treatment needs to be given intravenously and requires a longer duration of hospital stay. Two previous retrospective studies showed that the initial empiric antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTIs caused by ESBL did not worsen the outcome, and the authors concluded that switching to appropriate antibiotics after detection of ESBL-producing microorganisms was sufficient. The efficacy of non-carbapenem antibiotics such as amikacin, fosfomycin, cefmetazole, and flomoxef for UTIs with ESBL-producing bacteria has been reported. However, the efficacy of antibiotics other than carbapenem for blood culture-positive UTIs caused by ESBL-producing pathogens among children is unknown. Because the use of piperacillin-tazobactam as a "carbapenem-sparing" option was inferior to meropenem with bacteremia of an ESBL-producing pathogen in an adult population, selection of carbapenem-sparing antibiotics for similar cases should be carefully considered. Thus, there is an opinion that carbapenem be recommended from the beginning of treatment for renal abscesses in children to avoid worsening of the outcomes. Regardless of a longer hospital stay, we continued meropenem for 3 weeks in the present case, which was blood culture positive with a renal abscess caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. We did not suspect an ESBL-producing pathogen infection at first and therefore treated the patient with non-carbapenem antibiotics before switching to carbapenem after confirming the results of the culture. Although we successfully treated the patient, it required us to investigate appropriate empiric and definitive therapies for a pediatric renal abscess with bacteremia caused by ESBL-positive microorganisms.

### Antibiotic treatment for 7 versus 14 days in patients with bloodstream infections [^115KeWh6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early, appropriate antibiotic therapy is important, but the duration of treatment is uncertain.

Methods

In a multicenter, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned hospitalized patients (including patients in the intensive care unit [ICU]) who had bloodstream infection to receive antibiotic treatment for 7 days or 14 days. Antibiotic selection, dosing, and route were at the discretion of the treating team. We excluded patients with severe immunosuppression, foci requiring prolonged treatment, single cultures with possible contaminants, or cultures yielding Staphylococcus aureus. The primary outcome was death from any cause by 90 days after diagnosis of the bloodstream infection, with a noninferiority margin of 4 percentage points.

Results

Across 74 hospitals in seven countries, 3608 patients underwent randomization and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 1814 patients were assigned to 7 days of antibiotic treatment, and 1794 to 14 days. At enrollment, 55.0% of patients were in the ICU and 45.0% were on hospital wards. Infections were acquired in the community (75.4%), hospital wards (13.4%) and ICUs (11.2%). Bacteremia most commonly originated from the urinary tract (42.2%), abdomen (18.8%), lung (13.0%), vascular catheters (6.3%), and skin or soft tissue (5.2%). By 90 days, 261 patients (14.5%) receiving antibiotics for 7 days had died and 286 patients (16.1%) receiving antibiotics for 14 days had died (difference, -1.6 percentage points [95.7% confidence interval {CI}, -4.0 to 0.8]), which showed the noninferiority of the shorter treatment duration. Patients were treated for longer than the assigned duration in 23.1% of the patients in the 7-day group and in 10.7% of the patients in the 14-day group. A per-protocol analysis also showed noninferiority (difference, -2.0 percentage points [95% CI, -4.5 to 0.6]). These findings were generally consistent across secondary clinical outcomes and across prespecified subgroups defined according to patient, pathogen, and syndrome characteristics.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection, antibiotic treatment for 7 days was noninferior to treatment for 14 days. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; BALANCE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03005145.).

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Timing of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration and outcome of adults with community-onset bacteremia [^114reeB1]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that the elapsed time from arrival at the ED to the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is a crucial determinant of short-term outcomes in patients with community-onset bacteremia. The optimum timing of appropriate antimicrobial administration in mildly ill patients was the first 48 hours after arrival at the ED. With increasing severity of bacteremia, this time should be limited to the first 1 hour in critically ill patients. Therefore, to achieve a favorable outcome in critically ill patients, epidemiological surveillance, rapid pathogen identification, or the incorporation of broad-spectrum antimicrobials as empirical therapy into an antibiotic stewardship program should be considered.

### Early switch from IV to oral antibiotics for uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia… [^111D7ZPS]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The results suggest that transition to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. Importance Gram-negative bacteremia is a global health concern, and optimizing the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotics is a critical step in improving patient treatment and resource utilization. Our study aimed to estimate the potential effect of an early switch to oral antibiotics compared with continuing IV antibiotics on all-cause mortality among individuals with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia by using a target trial framework. Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was defined as initiation of either piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin in combination with gentamicin, mecillinam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem, ertapenem, or tobramycin.

Choice of IV and oral antibiotic agent after availability of the susceptibility report was at the discretion of the treating physician but had to comply with the susceptibility result. Antibiotic treatment had to be maintained for 7 to 14 days. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9. 1% for the early switch group and
11. 7% for the group receiving prolonged IV treatment, corresponding to an RD of −2. 5% and an RR of 0.
78. Two studies18, 19 have explored the current treatment pattern among patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia and found that just one-fifth were transitioned to oral antibiotics within 5 days, thus highlighting the need for further studies and information to establish the optimal timing of and criteria for oral stepdown treatment.

Prior studies reported success for patients with uncomplicated bacteremia switching to oral treatment within 3 to 5 days. 20, 21 Current guidelines22 recommend a total treatment duration of 7 days for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, and a recent study suggested that 5 days of treatment for patients showing clinical response guided by CRP values may be sufficient in the treatment of gram-negative bacteremia. 23 As the eligibility criteria in our cohort required patients to achieve clinical stability before day 5, a cutoff prior to day 5 may seem more reasonable.

### Information for clinicians | E. coli infection… [^111fhZdK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most intestinal E. coliinfections can be managed symptomatically.
- Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.
- Early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure in children with STEC infection. Diagnosis E. coli infection is diagnosed when the bacteria are identified from the sample of a patient with an acute diarrheal illness. Treatment Hydration Most E. coli infections can be managed symptomatically. Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated. Evidence from studies of children with STEC O157 infection indicates that early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure. Antibiotics Antibiotics used to treat infection with diarrheagenic E. coli other than STEC include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifaximin.

Clinicians treating a patient whose clinical syndrome suggests STEC infection should be aware that administering antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Resistance to antimicrobials is increasing worldwide. The decision to use an antibiotic should be carefully weighed against the severity of illness, the possibility that the pathogen is resistant, and the risk of adverse reactions, such as rash, antibiotic-associated colitis, and vaginal yeast infection. Antimotility agents Antimotility agents should be avoided for patients with bloody diarrhea; treatment should be reassessed if symptoms have not improved in 48 hours. Antimotility agents also should not be given to patients with STEC infection because these agents may increase the risk of complications, including toxic megacolon, HUS, and neurologic complications. No known data show that kaolin-pectin compounds or lactobacillus slow diarrhea or relieve abdominal cramping. HUS diagnosis HUS is diagnosed using standard blood chemistry and blood count tests. HUS treatment HUS is treated with supportive care, including the management of fluids and electrolytes. In some cases, treatment may involve:

- Dialysis
- Transfusions of red blood cells, platelets, or both With good supportive care, most people with HUS recover completely. Outcomes are typically better for children than adults.

### Effect of C-reactive protein-guided or fixed antibiotic duration on clinical failure in patients with Gram-Negative bacteremia… [^115vE7FF]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Most patients with bacterial bloodstream infections still receive between 10 and 14 days of antibiotics, although these durations are based largely on expert opinion, and recent evidence from retrospective analyses and a randomized trial indicate clinical noninferiority between 7-day and 14-day courses. 4, 5. Median therapy duration in the intention-to-treat CRP-guided group was 7 days. The patient who underwent 28 days of treatment was discovered to have multiple kidney abscesses after randomization, and CRP was not used to guide therapy. In patients with normal kidney function or mild insufficiency, the median therapy duration was 7 days; in patients with moderate or severe insufficiency, the median therapy duration was 8 days.

The median number of antibiotic days of therapy throughout the 90-day study period was 9 in the CRP-guided group, 9 in the 7-day group, and 16 in the 14-day group. In this randomized clinical trial, CRP-guided antibiotic durations and fixed 7-day durations of antibiotic therapy were noninferior to 14-day durations of antibiotic therapy in 30-day rates of clinical failure among patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia. These patients, all with source control and some evidence of response to antibiotics by day 5, experienced little clinical failure in general, whether treated with 14 or 5 days of antibiotics. This observation reinforces the principle that antibiotic duration need not be predefined in the first days of acute illness; rather, it should be determined in the days thereafter, in line with the patient's ongoing response.

With regard to fixed 7-day antibiotic courses, these findings support those of Yahav et al, 4 who demonstrated noninferiority to 14-day courses for gram-negative bacteremia in a similar population. However, the overall rate of clinical failure in the present study was lower because all-cause hospitalizations were not included as a criterion for failure and this primary outcome was assessed at day 30 rather than day 90.
