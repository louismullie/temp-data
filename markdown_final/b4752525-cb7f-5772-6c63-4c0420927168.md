## Question

What are the common causes of Burr cells in a patients blood smear?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of Burr cells on a peripheral blood smear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining Burr cells and their morphologic spectrum. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that produces them. Next, I will categorize the major etiologic groups and prioritize the most common causes. After that, I need to check for less common or artifactual contributors. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and a practical diagnostic approach, making sure I distinguish Burr cells from look-alikes like acanthocytes and schistocytes with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic definition so I don't mislabel cells. Burr cells, also called echinocytes or crenated red cells, are erythrocytes with evenly spaced, blunt, rounded projections over the cell surface; they are distinct from acanthocytes, which have irregular, variably sized spicules, and from schistocytes, which are true fragments from mechanical trauma in microangiopathic processes.

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology I'm invoking is accurate. Burr cells typically arise from membrane-cytoskeletal instability or altered lipid composition, often triggered by environmental changes, oxidative injury, or liver disease; this contrasts with schistocytes, which result from intravascular mechanical shear and fragmentation, and acanthocytes, which reflect membrane protein defects or altered lipid ratios in liver disease and certain inherited disorders [^91ef8a3c] [^1d3c44d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency without anchoring to the literature. The most consistently cited and clinically important cause of Burr cells is liver disease, particularly advanced cirrhosis and cholestasis, where altered plasma lipids and membrane remodeling produce spiculated erythrocytes; this is the prototypical setting in which Burr cells are encountered and should be prioritized in the differential [^notfound].

> Next, I should review hemolytic anemias and microangiopathic processes, but wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating Burr cells with schistocytes. In thrombotic microangiopathies such as TTP, HUS, and HELLP, the hallmark is schistocyte formation from mechanical fragmentation; however, some reports and case definitions list Burr cells among microangiopathic changes, likely reflecting overlapping morphologies or concurrent crenation, so I should acknowledge that Burr cells may be seen in TMAs even though schistocytes dominate the smear and carry stronger diagnostic weight [^812cef48] [^bae627bb] [^1d3c44d2].

> I will now examine renal failure as a distinct but related context. Observational data associate the presence of Burr cells with renal and liver failure and with increased 30-day mortality; while the exact mechanism is multifactorial, uremic toxins and membrane injury plausibly contribute to crenation, so I should keep renal dysfunction high on the list when Burr cells are prominent, especially in hospitalized patients [^3c1a0838].

> But wait, what if the Burr cells are actually artifacts of preparation rather than true in vivo pathology. I should double-check slide-making variables. Automated or poorly prepared smears, prolonged storage, drying artifacts, and suboptimal staining can induce crenation that mimics Burr cells; therefore, I need to correlate with clinical context and, if uncertain, request a fresh, expertly prepared smear to distinguish artifact from true Burr cells [^7dd0b395].

> Let me consider less common but clinically relevant associations so I don't miss important differentials. Burr cells have been described in inherited red cell membrane disorders and in certain dyserythropoietic states, and they can appear in neonates and young infants as a transient, sometimes physiologic finding; in these settings, the smear should be interpreted alongside reticulocyte counts, hemolysis labs, and clinical history to avoid overcalling pathology [^91ef8a3c] [^f08c7e99].

> I should confirm the key distinctions to avoid misclassification. Acanthocytes have irregular, variably sized spicules and are classically linked to severe liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia, and vitamin E deficiency; schistocytes are helmet-shaped fragments and indicate mechanical hemolysis in TMAs; Burr cells, by contrast, show uniform, blunt projections and most often reflect liver disease, uremia, or artifact, with only occasional reports in TMAs where schistocytes predominate [^c4c1ff02] [^1d3c44d2].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications so the finding is actionable. The presence of Burr cells, particularly in the setting of renal or hepatic failure, correlates with worse outcomes in hospitalized cohorts; in suspected TMAs, Burr cells may accompany schistocytes and support the diagnosis, but urgent ADAMTS13 testing and initiation of plasma exchange should not be delayed pending morphology alone; in liver disease, Burr cells reinforce the severity of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis and may coexist with target cells and acanthocytes [^91ef8a3c] [^1d3c44d2] [^c4c1ff02].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is practical. When Burr cells are identified, I should verify smear quality, review the CBC and reticulocyte count, assess for hemolysis with LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin, evaluate liver and renal function, and consider the clinical context for TMA, liver disease, or artifact; if the smear is suboptimal, I should request a manual review by an experienced morphologist to confirm the morphology and quantify other abnormal RBC shapes that refine the differential [^1d3c44d2] [^94b9d848].

> In summary, I should prioritize the causes by frequency and clinical relevance. Most commonly, Burr cells reflect advanced liver disease and cholestasis; they are also seen with renal failure, occasionally in TMAs where schistocytes are the dominant finding, and rarely in inherited membrane disorders or as neonatal transient changes; importantly, preparation artifacts can mimic Burr cells, so correlation with clinical data and smear quality is essential to avoid misattribution and to guide appropriate workup and management [^c4c1ff02] [^91ef8a3c] [^812cef48] [^f08c7e99] [^7dd0b395].

Burr cells (echinocytes) on a peripheral smear most often reflect **liver disease** (cirrhosis, cholestasis) [^c4c1ff02] or **renal failure** [^91ef8a3c], where altered membrane lipids or uremic toxins cause crenation. They are also seen in **microangiopathic hemolytic anemia** (TTP, HUS, HELLP) [^812cef48] [^bae627bb] due to mechanical membrane injury, and in **artifactual crenation** from delayed smear preparation or improper pH/osmolarity [^7dd0b395]. Less common causes include hemolytic anemias, snake envenomation, and inherited membrane disorders. Burr cells are a morphologic clue that prompts evaluation for liver/renal dysfunction, hemolysis, or TMAs, and should be interpreted with clinical context and smear quality in mind [^23f2bad3].

## Pathophysiology of burr cell formation

Burr cells arise from **membrane-cytoskeletal instability** or **environmental injury**, leading to uniform, blunt projections:

- **Liver disease**: Altered plasma lipids (cholestasis, cirrhosis) disrupt membrane integrity, causing crenation [^c4c1ff02].
- **Renal failure**: Uremic toxins injure RBC membranes, producing echinocytosis [^notfound].
- **Microangiopathic hemolysis**: Mechanical shear from fibrin strands damages membranes, yielding schistocytes and burr cells [^bae627bb].
- **Artifactual crenation**: Delayed smear preparation or improper pH/osmolarity induces uniform spiculation [^notfound].

## Diagnostic significance and clinical implications

Burr cells are a **morphologic marker** that signals underlying disease; their presence should prompt:

- **Liver/renal evaluation**: Check LFTs, bilirubin, creatinine, and urea [^notfound].
- **Hemolysis workup**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte count, and Coombs test [^1d3c44d2].
- **TMA assessment**: Platelets, creatinine, neurologic symptoms, and ADAMTS13 activity when TTP/HUS is suspected [^f1fa136e].
- **Smear quality check**: Repeat smear if artifact is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Differentiation from other abnormal RBC morphologies

Accurate identification is essential: **burr cells** have uniform, blunt projections, whereas **acanthocytes** have irregular, variably sized spicules (e.g. liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia) [^c4c1ff02], and **schistocytes** are fragmented, helmet-shaped cells from mechanical hemolysis (e.g. TTP/HUS, DIC) [^1d3c44d2].

---

## Clinical management considerations

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Liver/renal disease**: Treat the hepatic or renal disorder; burr cells resolve with correction of the primary process.
- **TMAs**: Urgent plasma exchange for TTP; supportive care and complement blockade for HUS/aHUS [^f1fa136e].
- **Hemolysis**: Immunosuppression, withdrawal of offending drugs, or treat the infection [^1d3c44d2].
- **Artifacts**: Repeat smear to confirm true morphology [^notfound].

---

Burr cells reflect membrane injury from liver/renal disease, MAHA, or artifacts; they are a **diagnostic clue** that guides evaluation for serious conditions and should be interpreted with clinical context and smear quality in mind [^23f2bad3].

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^bae627bb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

The triad signs of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia

Haemolysis, one of the major characteristics of the disorder, is due to a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA). Red cell fragmentation caused by high-velocity passage through damaged endothelium appears to represent the extent of small vessel involvement with intima damage, endothelial dysfunction and fibrin deposition. Presence of fragmented (schizocytes) or contracted red cells with spicula (Burr cells) in the peripheral blood smear reflects the haemolytic process and strongly suggests the development of MAHA. Polychromatic red cells are also seen in blood smears, and increased reticulocyte counts reflect the compensatory release of immature red cells into peripheral blood. Destruction of red blood cells by haemolysis causes increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and decreased haemoglobin concentrations. Haemoglobinaemia or haemoglobinuria is macroscopically recognizable in about 10% of the women. Liberated haemoglobin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin in the spleen or may be bound in the plasma by haptoglobin. The haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is cleared quickly by the liver, leading to low or undetectable haptoglobin levels in the blood, even with moderate haemolysis. Low haptoglobin concentration (< 1 g/L – < 0.4 g/L) can be used to diagnose haemolysis and is the preferred marker of haemolysis. Thus, the diagnosis of haemolysis is supported by high LDH concentration and the presence of unconjugated bilirubin, but the demonstration of low or undetectable haptoglobin concentration is a more specific indicator.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Automatic wedge smears preparation may cause traumatic morphological changes in peripheral blood cells [^7dd0b395]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, several automated analysers that prepare and stain blood smears have been introduced in clinical laboratories. Despite the use of instrumental settings based on physical characteristic of individual samples, traumatic injuries of neutrophil and lymphocytes can be observed. Some samples present a very high percentage of damaged cells, allowing the speculation that a cellular susceptibility may enhance mechanical traumatism. These artefacts can puzzle morphological evaluation in both traditional and digitised microscopy; in addition, unskilled operators can be misled.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^8517e656]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

The Study

A confirmed case of HUS was defined as the acute onset of anemia with microangiopathic changes (i.e. schistocytes, burr cells, or helmet cells) on peripheral blood smear, acute renal injury (i.e. hematuria, proteinuria, or elevated creatinine level), and a low platelet count (platelets < 150,000/mL) within 3 weeks of an acute diarrheal illness. A probable case of HUS was defined as the acute onset of anemia with microangiopathic changes, acute renal injury, and a low platelet count without a history of diarrhea in the preceding 3 weeks; or hemolytic anemia without confirmed microangiopathic changes, acute renal injury, and a low platelet count within 3 weeks of an acute diarrheal illness.

Hospital admission notes, laboratory reports, and discharge summaries were requested for patients who had HUS (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 283.11) listed as their primary or any secondary diagnosis for 1998 and 1999. All medical charts were reviewed, and patients were classified as having a confirmed, probable, or undetermined HUS case. Persons with multiple hospitalizations were counted only once. The records from case reports and medical charts were matched by last name, first name, and date of birth. The capture-recapture method was used to evaluate the completeness of HUS reporting and to estimate the "true" number of HUS cases and the 95% confidence interval.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^85da85cc]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
(A) Peripheral blood smear. The peripheral blood smear shows morphological abnormalities typically described in hyposplenism (e.g. Howell‐Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, spiculated cells, target cells) (Hematoxylin–eosin ×100). (B) Bone marrow biopsy. The bone marrow biopsy shows normal cellularity for the age, normal myelo‐erythroid ratio and maturation; megakaryocytes are scattered and without the typical cytologic modifications of myeloproliferative neoplasms (Hematoxylin–eosin, ×20) [Color figure can be viewed at]

During the assessment of a new‐onset thrombocytosis, it is of the upmost importance to distinguish secondary (or reactive) thrombocytosis from true hematological diseases. First of all, for practical purposes, we searched for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. The most common causes of reactive thrombocytosis are iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, hemolysis, and other causes that trigger an acute‐phase response (Table 1). Thus, we performed serum tests to check for the iron status (iron, transferrin, and ferritin) and for an acute‐phase reaction (CRP, ESR): all of them were normal. A normal LDH serum level, together with a normal hemoglobin concentration and reticulocyte count, excluded hemolytic processes. Despite the absence of symptoms and signs of an underlying infection, we performed a chest radiograph that ruled out a pulmonary infection, and an abdominal ultrasound that revealed no signs of abdominal infection and reported a poorly assessable spleen. The most common mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms (BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms) were not found.

### Which observations from the complete blood cell count predict mortality for hospitalized patients? [^91ef8a3c]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Information on the prognostic utility of the admission complete blood count (CBC) and differential count is lacking.

Objective

To identify independent predictors of mortality from the varied number and morphology of cells in the complete blood count defined as a hemogram, automated five cell differential count and manual differential count.

Design

Retrospective cohort study and chart review.

Setting

Wishard Memorial Hospital, a large urban primary care hospital.

Patients

A total of 46,522 adult inpatients admitted over 10 years to Wishard Memorial Hospital-from January 1993 through December 2002.

Intervention

None.

Measurements

Thirty-day mortality measured from day of admission as determined by electronic medical records and Indiana State death records.

Results

Controlling for age and sex, the multivariable regression model identified 3 strong independent predictors of 30-day mortality-nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), burr cells, and absolute lymphocytosis-each of which was associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of death within 30 days. The presence of nucleated RBCs was associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 25.5% across a range of diagnoses, excluding patients with sickle-cell disease and obstetric patients, for whom NRBCs were not associated with increased mortality. Having burr cells was associated with a mortality rate of 27.3% and was found most commonly in patients with renal or liver failure. Absolute lymphocytosis predicted poor outcome in patients with trauma and CNS injury.

Conclusions

Among patients admitted to Wishard Memorial Hospital, the presence of nucleated RBCs, burr cells, or absolute lymphocytosis at admission was each independently associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of death within 30 days of admission.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^65b0010f]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendation generation

Previously coded data were used to develop 4 domains of recommendations, ie, curricular considerations, method of PBS review, morphologic considerations, and specific disorders. Disorders were further subcategorized into disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Response rates per round of revision were 87.5%, 87.5%, and 100%.

Strong and unanimous consensus was reached on multiple aspects of PBS education, including curricular considerations, method of review, and morphology (Table 2). All agreed that trainees should learn PBS review through a structured approach that includes the identification of monolayer, use of various magnifications, switching between magnifications, and systematic review of each cell line. Procurement of PBS slides should encompass both patients under the care of the trainee and slide "libraries" to ensure all trainees see similar morphology regardless of personal experience on ward and consult rotations.

Ideal curricula should include education on how PBS review can augment or eliminate the need for more advanced testing and should include discussions on the practical use of PBS within the context of resource limited vs resource rich settings. Trainees should be aware of the growing use of digital microscopy and understand the benefits and limitations of digital microscopy.

Trainees should be able to name and identify common cytoplasmic and nuclear features that aid in diagnosis. CR on individual disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets can be seen in Table 2. Participants agreed that specific emphasis should be placed on disorders in which correct and timely diagnosis is paramount to avoiding significant patient morbidity, acute decompensation, or death. Acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias, specifically TMA, were felt to warrant explicit curricular emphasis. Conversely, fellows should also be competent in the recognition of commonly encountered diagnoses that are more indolent in nature, eg, iron deficiency anemia. However, consensus was not reached on how to balance education in these competing interests.

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^63420681]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^4fb514c5]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- Fellows should have a methodology for PBS review and be competent in identifying morphology suggestive of both common and morbid diagnoses.
- Curricular emphasis should be placed on the competency of identifying morphologic features of acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias.

### The use of eculizumab in gemcitabine induced thrombotic microangiopathy [^feac64d5]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Laboratory findings suggestive of MAHA include elevation in creatinine and LDH, proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, decreased haptoglobin and the presence of reticulocytes. Peripheral smears show the presence of fragmented erythrocytes (schistocytes), burr cells as well as microspherocytes. The diagnosis of chemotherapy induced TMA can be challenging due to myelosupression from chemotherapy itself that can present with similar findings of anemia and thrombocytopenia. However, signs of hemolysis (schistocytes, burr cells, elevated reticulocytes and LDH) and negative Coombs test aids the diagnosis of TMA. Reticulocyte count may be low because of prior transfusions or myelosupression. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that serum creatinine > 2.26 mg/dl and a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L is highly suggestive of aHUS, and TTP is more likely when creatinine is < 2.26 mg/dl and platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L. Since aHUS carries higher rates of morbidity and mortality, this approach may help physicians to diagnose and initiate treatment early while awaiting results of ADAMTS13 activity and when Shiga-toxin is absent. Additionally, kidney biopsy in MAHA demonstrates thickening of the glomerular capillary wall along with fibrin deposition in the capillaries and arterioles, giving the characteristic tram-track appearance. Immunofluorescence demonstrates the deposition of IgM and C3 in the mesangium, and electron microscopic examination shows pronounced endothelial injury. Renal biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of TMA but is preferred by many histologists as it may aid in the quantification of irreversible sclerotic lesions that may help in prognostication of patients with GiTMA. Because these chemotherapeutic drugs are often used for treatment of various malignancies, differentiating malignancy related and chemotherapy associated TMA can be difficult to ascertain. Experimental studies have shown, however, that markers such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin 6, vWF antigen and low molecular weight vWF multimers may help differentiate chemotherapy related TMA from malignancy related TMA.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^60d17a1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Diagnosing TMAs by automated red cell morphology analyses [^0c2ec0de]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Notably, Foy et al assessed their algorithms within the clinical disease context and confirmed the ability of their RBC-differentiating algorithm to make specific diagnoses. Using predominant cell types to arrive at a gestalt assessment of the smear pathology, the authors analyzed the RBC-differentiation ability of smears using the peripheral blood from patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome and could distinguish these from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). Importantly, they went on to demonstrate that schistocyte counts are associated with prognosis. The authors further found that they could correlate schistocyte counts from patients without TMA with all-cause mortality, similar to what had been shown previously for parameters such as red cell distribution width.

There are limitations. As expected, the sensitivity of the classification appears to vary for different cell types, and each will require validation. This system does not account for cells that might change shape within circulation, such as sickle cell anemia. This machine learning algorithm relies heavily on the use of black-white boundary detection to identify different RBC shapes but does not detect or differentiate between RBC inclusions.

Assessing peripheral blood smears requires expertise and is a time-consuming and costly exercise. Although the authors clarify that their RBC-differentiation algorithm is not intended to replace manual review, the idea that an automated, high-level, accurate RBC differential would be useful in a resource-limited setting is very appealing. Even in the United States, there is pressure on hematology laboratories to minimize the number of smears that require review. The intriguing possibility of diagnosing iron deficiency, thalassemia, sickle cell, or immune-hemolytic pathologies via smear further extends the potential utility of RBC-differentiation algorithm. This also paves the way to encourage more scientific research: why do schistocytes correlate with mortality? What causes schistocyte formation in those with nonhematological acute illnesses?

The future is very likely to include some type of accurate RBC differential that will not only be able to make the diagnosis but will also monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Classical hematology has frequently been regarded as too difficult and the problems as too emergent. One of the remaining reasons for a hematologist to visit the hospital in the middle of the night is the possibility of seeing schistocytes on a smear, which will help diagnose a TMA, particularly TTP. This could also be a boon to the idea of a better work-life balance for classical hematologists.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^94b9d848]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Manual review of the PBS via light microscopy or digital whole slide imaging is strongly preferred over single high-power field images. Independent use of the compound light microscope is a mandatory skill that should be attained by graduation. Expertise in the identification of normal morphology aids in the recognition of more subtle pathology on PBS. Trainees should be wellversed in the identification of both normal and pathologic cytoplasmic and nuclear characteristics. The identification of staining and preparation artifact is necessary to allow for proper clinical reasoning. Curricula should emphasize the utility of PBS in the context of contemporary testing as it can augment or eliminate the need for other diagnostic testing, minimize medical waste, and reduce time to diagnosis. Adept fellows will contextualize PBS morphology within the greater clinical context of the patient's clinical history, laboratory, and pathologic data; and harbor an understanding of how positive and negative PBS findings affect Bayesian reasoning. Trainees should have a thorough and reproducible methodologic approach to PBS evaluation, although all educators need not be expected to teach a uniform approach across all ACGME training institutions. Specific emphasis should be placed on distinction of malignant and benign etiologies of leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. Finally, trainees should identify morphology suggestive of hemolytic anemias and suspect specific diagnoses based on PBS review with otherwise limited clinical information. In the institutions, participants practice with high resource availability and low exposure to tropical diseases. It was felt that the outsized global impact of malaria (247 million cases, and 619 000 deaths in 2021) warranted specific attention.

Broad consensus existed on the specific morphologies and diagnoses within the fellow's purview. This is an important development that can guide PBS curricular design (Tables 3 and 4). The high interrater agreement on included morphology and diagnoses indicates that hematologists likely have a shared mental model of what constitutes fellow competency, despite the lack of current formally accepted theory.

Qualitative data from the focus group sessions offer potential insights into the importance that participants place in various aspects of fellow competency. The high proportion of time spent on the specific diagnoses of acute leukemia and TMA possibly indicates a bias among attending hematologists to place heightened emphasis on the recognition of these conditions. The domains of PBS review do not appear to be weighted equally in the minds of hematologists, with an excess of attention focused on conditions that predispose patients to a high risk of short-term morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the relatively minimal discussion on the identification of abnormal platelet morphology and primary disorders of platelets potentially indicates a relative perceived lack of importance.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^7f38d88b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): focus on peripheral blood cell morphology [^ea9787cd]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have shown peculiar morphological anomalies in COVID-19 patients' smears. We searched all the peer-reviewed scientific publications that explicitly reference the cytomorphological alterations on peripheral blood smears of patients with COVID-19. We extracted data from sixty-five publications (case reports, patient group studies, reviews, and erythrocyte morphology studies). The results show that frequent alterations concern the morphology of lymphocytes (large lymphocytes with weakly basophilic cytoplasm, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, large granular lymphocytes). Neutrophils display abnormal nuclei and cytoplasm in a distinctive cytomorphological picture. Besides a left shift in maturation, granulations can be increased (toxic type) or decreased with areas of basophilia. Nuclei are often hyposegmented (pseudo-Pelger-Huёt anomaly). Apoptotic or pycnotic cells are not uncommon. Monocytes typically have a large cytoplasm loaded with heterogeneous and coalescing vacuoles. Platelets show large and giant shapes. The presence of erythrocyte fragments and schistocytes is especially evident in the forms of COVID-19 that are associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Such atypia of blood cells reflects the generalized activation in severe COVID-19, which has been demonstrated with immunophenotypic, molecular, genetic, and functional methods. Neutrophils, in particular, are involved in the pathophysiology of hyperinflammation with cytokine storm, which characterizes the most unfavorable evolution.

### Evaluation and differential diagnosis of persistent marked eosinophilia [^e6a5cb21]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is commonly encountered in clinical practice. The causes of peripheral blood eosinophilia are varied, ranging from benign eosinophilia to malignancy. A careful history and physical examination along with directed clinical evaluation may help determine the cause. When uncontrolled, peripheral blood eosinophilia may result in end-organ damage and life-threatening complications. This article summarizes the differential diagnosis and evaluation of persistent marked eosinophilia.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^70d65387]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

Methods

Case Ascertainment

Patients were enrolled from January 2001 through December 2002 from the public tertiary-care pediatric hospitals, Hospital "Dr. Humberto Notti" in Mendoza, which serves an urban and semirural area, and Hospital "Dr. Juan P. Garrahan" in Buenos Aires, which serves an urban area. Study personnel detected STEC cases through daily review of the hospitals' laboratory records and detected diarrhea-associated HUS cases through biweekly discussions with nephrologists.

Definitions

A case of STEC infection was defined as illness in a previously healthy child < 16 years old who was evaluated at a participating institution and who had either culture-confirmed O157 STEC diarrhea, culture-confirmed non-O157 STEC diarrhea, or definite diarrhea-associated HUS. For convenience, we included only children permanently residing within 15 km of each institution. Local investigators stated that the characteristics of the population within each of these areas were similar to that within 50 or 100 km of the respective hospitals. We chose these 2 areas so that the population serviced would be similar to the Argentine population living in areas with a high incidence of HUS.

Definite HUS was defined as acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment as determined by 1) hematocrit < 30% with microangiopathic changes on peripheral blood smear (e.g. schistocytes, burr cells, helmet cells, or red cell fragments); 2) platelet count < 150,000/mm³; and 3) serum creatinine concentration > 2 standard deviations above the upper limit of normal for age and sex; or abnormal urinary sediment by dipstick, i.e. hematuria (> 2+) or proteinuria (> 2+). HUS was considered diarrhea-associated when a diarrheal illness preceded HUS by < 3 weeks. We excluded children with a family history of HUS, secondary HUS (e.g. drug-associated), or HUS associated with pneumococcal infection. Probable HUS was defined as an illness that met only 2 of the laboratory criteria in a patient with culture-confirmed STEC infection.

### Incidental neutropenia: an emergency medicine focused approach [^0e507514]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 cells/microL and may be discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic, afebrile patient.

Objective

This narrative review provides an approach to the afebrile emergency department patient with incidental neutropenia.

Discussion

Neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL, with mild neutropenia defined as an ANC ≥ 1000 to < 1500 cells/microL, moderate ≥ 500 to < 1000 cells/microL, severe < 500 cells/microL, and agranulocytosis < 200 cells/microL. Incidental or isolated neutropenia is an ANC < 1500 cells/microL discovered on laboratory testing unrelated to the patient's chief complaint (e.g., chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, etc.) and not associated with fever or infectious signs and symptoms. There are a variety of etiologies, with inherited forms, dose-dependent drug-induced neutropenia, and infections the most common causes. Testing includes complete blood count with differential and peripheral smear. Management is based on the patient's hemodynamic status, presence of fever, severity of neutropenia, and the peripheral smear. Patients who are critically ill, febrile, have severe neutropenia, or have a concerning peripheral smear (schistocytes, atypical lymphocytes) should undergo hematology consultation. Those with critical illness or fever with neutropenia should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics. Patients who are afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and non-toxic appearing with mild or moderate neutropenia can likely be discharged for repeat testing in one to two weeks.

Conclusion

Understanding the approach to incidental neutropenia can improve patient care. Critically ill or febrile patients should be admitted, but select patients may be discharged.

### Malignant or benign leukocytosis [^2580cc30]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step. Examination of the PB smear is essential to confirming the automated blood cell differential or affirming the manual differential performed on the PB smear. Next is separation of the leukocytosis into a myeloid versus a lymphoid process. Distinguishing a reactive lymphoid proliferation from a lymphoproliferative disorder requires examination of lymphocyte morphology for pleomorphic lymphocytes versus a monomorphic population, with the latter favoring a lymphoproliferative neoplasm. Samples suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorders can be confirmed and characterized by flow cytometry, with molecular studies initiated in select cases; precursor lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoblasts) should trigger a BM examination. Myeloid leukocytosis triggers a differential diagnosis of myeloid leukemoid reactions versus myeloid malignancies. The manual differential is key, along with correct enumeration of blasts and blast equivalents, immature granulocytes, basophils, and eosinophils and identifying dysplasia to identify myeloid malignancies. Confirmation and characterization of myeloid malignancies should be performed with a BM examination and the appropriate ancillary studies. Myeloid leukemoid reactions commonly result from infections and show activated neutrophil changes on morphology; these should prompt evaluation for infection. Other causes of reactive myeloid leukocytoses are also discussed herein.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^7b54129a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of hematological malignancies relies on expert cytomorphological examination of blood, bone marrow and/or other tissue biopsies, together with molecular analyses that aid subclassification and prognosis. For example, anemias, characterized by reduced hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and altered red blood cell (RBC) numbers, can be both a disease and a feature of other conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) –. For this reason, the diagnosis and further subtyping of MDS requires the detection of cytopenias, changes to white blood cell (WBC) and RBC maturation blood cell through cytomorphologic analysis of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood slides (PBS), cyto- and histochemistry, karyotyping and immunophenotyping –.

Focus group results

Transcribed statements from focus group 1 were coded thematically in an iterative fashion. Individual statements could be coded in several thematic categories if multiple dimensions were identified. Major emerging thematic categories included benefit provided by PBS review, cell lineage, medium used for PBS review, procedure of PBS review, source of slide, specific diagnosis, and specific morphology (Figure 2). Subtopics were developed within each theme.

Figure 2.
Participant statement coding. Statements were categorized and subcategorized following inductive coding. Seven emerging domains of theory are shown. Subdomains are noted where applicable. ∗Further subcategorization can be found in the supplemental Data. The number of further subcategories are noted in parentheses.

Most discussion centered on specific cell lineage (32.8% of the statements), specific diagnosis (39.7% of the statements), and specific morphology (26.0% of the statements). The procedure of PBS review was discussed the least (9.2% of the statements).

Participants reported the majority of their slides for PBS teaching as having originated from clinic or consult service patients currently being seen by the educator or trainee. Some voiced the importance of reviewing PBSs from collated slide libraries to ensure that trainees get a full breadth of exposure. Thorough systematic review was most commonly discussed as the appropriate method for trainee review, whereas some noted abbreviated methods were used in clinical practice by attending hematologists.

White blood cells and red blood cells accounted for the vast majority of cell lineage–based discussion (48.8% and 41.9%, respectively). The most commonly discussed morphologies were schistocytes, spherocytes, blasts, and macro-ovalocytes (supplemental Appendix). Acute leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), TMA, and hemolytic anemias were the most discussed diagnostic subcategories.

Several benefits of PBS review were stated. First, PBS review is often available at the time of consultation which can improve time to initial diagnosis. The rapid availability to review PBS is specifically important because it pertains to confirming or refuting "can't miss diagnoses" that convey a high likelihood of morbidity or mortality if misdiagnosed. Furthermore, the identification of morphologic characteristics informs Bayesian reasoning and aid in clinical decision making, and in turn, allows for early initiation of therapeutic interventions.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^3e4428ed]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is also important to point out some additional limitations of our method. Firstly, the blood cell detection techniques, ranging from WBC and RBC detection to nuclear segmentation in WBC and morphometric characterization, could be improved. For example, methods using transformers for hierarchical multi-resolution deep-learning architectures can replace the task of using predefined features, which can also bias results, as has been recently shown in histopathology. Our protocol was designed to mimic the typical steps of hematological assessment — detecting relevant regions of the slide/image, identification of individual cells and analyzing their morphology. Other steps were pragmatic: owing to their great numbers, annotating RBCs in order to train a dedicated detection algorithm would be time consuming; for this reason, we opted for a fast and simple, but perhaps less accurate detection protocol. With appropriately annotated data, supervised RBC detection could be further improved with deep-learning models. Lastly, the characterization of blood cells and nuclei using self-supervised or unsupervised deep-learning methods might also help avoid some biases introduced by more predefined sets of features.

Notwithstanding the limitations discussed above, our work provides proof-of-principle that computational cytomorphology can augment the ability of automated blood cell analyses to identify abnormalities suggestive of hematological disease, with minimal additional cost. This can help identify patients needing further and usually more invasive and expensive testing, such as bone marrow aspirates or genomic sequencing. Recent applications of computational cytomorphology on bone marrow smears have demonstrated how it can identify leukocytes, and assist diagnostic predictions – in specialized haemato-oncology. By demonstrating that this can now be extended to blood smears/slides, our work reveals the potential for the large-scale incorporation of automated cytomorphology into routine diagnostic workflows.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^7e755de2]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Immunofluorescence microscopy on the blood smear identifies patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms [^7e69b222]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Aggregates of NMMIIA in the RBC are also typical for two hereditary platelet disorders associated with constitutional dyserythropoiesis due to germline mutations in the transcription regulator GATA1 or GFI1B, and might represent a novel marker of dyserythropoieis in the peripheral blood. This may link the pathogenesis of somatic mutations in MPN and germline mutations in hereditary platelet disorders.

Further studies are required to investigate this aspect as well as to identify mechanisms leading to the morphologic changes found in platelets and RBC of MPN subjects.

In conclusion, blood cell phenotyping by IF on the peripheral blood smear seems to be a clinically useful and easy-to-apply additional diagnostic tool to identify patients with MPN. This approach might be particularly useful in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to second-level diagnostic tools to stratify patients who may benefit from further genetic testing, as well in high-income country as Germany as a screening tool prior to next generation sequencing.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^1d3c44d2]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^c39c5a05]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Percentage of small platelets on peripheral blood smear and child-turcott-pugh class can predict the presence of oesophageal varices in newly diagnosed patients with cirrhosis: development of a prediction model for resource limited settings [^9826cc1c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sri Lanka is a developing country with resource limited settings to manage patients with cirrhosis and its complications. In Sri Lanka the most common causes of cirrhosis are alcohol related and cryptogenic [probably non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related], whereas chronic hepatitis B & C infections and haemachromatosis are uncommon aetiologies for cirrhosis. NASH-related cirrhosis is rapidly increasing in Sri Lanka and is the dominant cause for liver transplantation.

In the present study, we attempted to assess the associations and the utility of changes in haematological parameters in the full blood count (FBC) and peripheral blood morphology and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, among patients with cirrhosis, as a useful predictors of presence and degree of OV in our resource limited setting. A FBC and a peripheral blood smear are ready available resources. Identifying the morphological changes in a peripheral blood smear only requires a well stained blood smear and trained non-specialist medical officer in a resource poor setting.

### Hemolytic anemia [^a518eb93]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### Peripheral blood lymphocyte appearance in a case of I cell disease [^46e3bb56]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

In general, peripheral blood smears are performed to obtain information with regard to various morphological features as an aid in the diagnosis of infection or malignancy. This report presents a patient with I cell disease (inclusion cell disease), a fatal lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defect in an enzyme responsible for the transfer of mannose-6-phosphate ligands to precursor lysosomal enzymes. As a consequence, most lysosomal enzymes are transported outside the cell instead of being correctly targeted into the lysosomes, resulting in the storage of macromolecules in lysosomes. I cell disease, with its heterogeneous clinical presentation, can be diagnosed by the presence of intracellular vacuole-like inclusions in lymphocytes and fibroblasts, high serum lysosomal enzyme activities, and a defect of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This report describes the morphological aspects of peripheral lymphocytes in a blood smear of a patient, the first clue to the final diagnosis of I cell disease. The observed vacuole-like inclusions in lymphocytes of this patient were negative for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Sudan black B staining, in contrast to earlier reports.

### Primary plasma cell leukemia: consensus definition by the international myeloma working group according to peripheral blood plasma cell percentage [^45591b17]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The correct and timely diagnosis of PCL is dependent upon the ability of the pathologist or hematologist to screen and recognize plasma cells in the peripheral blood smear. They should be aware of the clinical relevance of a careful morphological examination of peripheral blood smears to exclude the presence of circulating plasma cells.

PCL is unique in the spectrum of malignant monoclonal gammopathies and characterized by a poor prognosis, the shortest OS and the elevated frequency of some genetic abnormalities (i.e. deletion 17p, hypodiploidy, and t (11;14)) along with some distinctive molecular and epigenetic characteristics. Some classical clinical features, reduced bone marrow reserve, extramedullary involvement, and elevated LDH, are more common than in patients with "standard" MM. Short duration of response in primary PCL has been disappointing. Even with significant improvement in the last years, the use of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors and either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation cannot overcome the poor prognosis in this disease.

In the two series analyzed, the morphology examination was crucial to identify patients bearing clinical and prognostic features compatible with the described natural history of primary PCL. Consistently between both articles, the OS in patients with 5% or more circulating plasma cells was significantly shorter than in patients with MM without circulating plasma cells. This significance was retained in one of the studies in multivariate analysis. Moreover, the prognosis was quite similar in both series with these patients and those with the conventional definition of PCL. At least in the US series, this adverse outcome was worse than patients with high-risk MM and less than 5% of circulating plasma cells, reflecting a different biology beyond standard cytogenetic prognosis. Patients with ≥ 5% circulating plasma cells showed lower platelet count and higher bone marrow plasma cell infiltration, two clinical features of primary PCL. In a previous study, the impact of the morphological examination was also assessed, even if the cutoff for high-risk group/PCL was not consistent with the other reports (2%). Several limitations of this consensus include that both retrospective series are not entirely and well comparable, as well as data in the literature about circulating plasma cells by morphology is rather scarce. There is no information about secondary PCL in this regard. The change in the criteria for diagnosis of PCL are, in principle, applicable only to primary PCL patients and the change into the definition for secondary PCL criteria requires further investigation.

### Role of peripheral blood smear in identifying thrombotic microangiopathy in snakebites with venom-induced consumption coagulopathy [^73b637f0]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombotic microangiopathy is a clinical syndrome that may occur following snake envenomation, and is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular thrombotic occlusion, often leading to acute kidney injury. This study investigates the role of peripheral blood smear analysis in predicting thrombotic microangiopathy in snakebite patients with coagulopathy at a South Indian tertiary care center.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted over a 20-month period. Patients with snakebite-induced coagulopathy were enrolled, and those with a history of transfusion, bleeding disorders, hemolytic anemia, or anticoagulant use were excluded. Clinical assessments and laboratory investigations, including full blood count, peripheral blood smear, kidney function tests, and lactate dehydrogenase activity, were performed at 48h, 72h, and 96h post-bite.

Results

Out of 58 patients, 9% developed thrombotic microangiopathy, with all cases showing fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes) on blood smear. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 43% of patients, and 36% developed acute kidney injury, with 16 requiring hemodialysis. Patients with schistocytes had longer hospital stays with a median of 30days (IQR: 28-48days) compared to those without schistocytes who had a median hospital stay of 7days (IQR: 5-10days) (P = 0.001). The mortality rate was 3%.

Discussion

The presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood smear was strongly associated with acute kidney injury and prolonged hospitalization. Schistocytes may serve as an early indicator of thrombotic microangiopathy in snakebite patients, facilitating timely intervention. The use of a peripheral blood smear is a simple, cost-effective diagnostic tool in resource-limited settings to aid in the prediction of thrombotic microangiopathy and guide treatment, especially for optimal referral to specialized centers.

Conclusions

Peripheral blood smear analysis can be a valuable predictor of thrombotic microangiopathy in snakebite patients, with a potential role in improving outcomes in resource-constrained settings that need further evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^632f97ec]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis ehrlichiosis — laboratory findings — typically presents in the first week with leukopenia (nadir usually 1,300–4,000 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (nadir usually 50,000–140,000 platelets/μL, although occasionally < 20,000 platelets/μL), and mild or moderately elevated hepatic transaminases. Anemia occurs later in clinical illness and is reported in 50% of patients, and mild-to-moderate hyponatremia might also be present. During the recovery period, a relative and absolute lymphocytosis is seen in most patients. Pancytopenia has prompted bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in some cases, which typically reveals normocellular or hypercellular marrow. Morulae might be observed in monocytes in peripheral blood and occasionally in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or bone marrow; a routine blood smear can provide a presumptive clue for early diagnosis, but visualization of morulae still requires confirmatory diagnostic testing. When CSF is evaluated, a lymphocytic pleocytosis is most commonly observed, although neutrophilic pleocytosis also can occur.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^b6f0e8b2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

An accurate diagnosis of MDS and other hematological malignancies is essential to guide treatment: while megaloblastic anemia (MA), which can be confused with MDS –, is generally treated with dietary changes or supplements, the treatment of MDS generally involves chemotherapeutic agents, blood/platelet transfusions and hypomethylating agents, and depends on risk stratification which considers blood counts, BM cytomorphology and cytogenetics. Furthermore, MDS prognosis can also benefit from molecular genetics, used to define clinically-relevant MDS subtypes such as SF3B1 -mutant MDS that is associated with improved survival times. It should be noted that MDS cases with splicing factor mutations such as SF3B1 -mutant MDS account for over 50% of all cases, constituting an important MDS subtype.

While abnormalities such as an increased prevalence of hypolobulated granulocytes, abnormal granularity in neutrophils or abnormal RBC are common in MDS. peripheral blood cell morphology is generally insufficient for MDS diagnosis. This is compounded by challenges in the assessment of subtle cytomorphological alterations and heterogeneity across any given PBS leading to inter-observer variation. While diagnoses stemming from the analysis of a PBS (requiring the analysis of hundreds of cells) typically show high concordance, the classification and characterization of individual WBC is more challenging. Additionally, the evidence on whether trained experts can distinguish specific cell types is conflicting, and a study looking specifically at cell type classification concordance among 28 morphologists showed that experts agreed on only 60% of all classified cells. This creates challenges in identifying relevant cytomorphology-disease associations. Computational methods, which have shown promise in the characterization and prognostication of MDS and AML using bone marrow slides – and identification of abnormal leukocytes, can help address some of these problems.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^4081f38b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We present an automated protocol for the detection and characterization of thousands of blood cells in PBS linked with machine-learning methods that can use these cellular descriptions to distinguish between clinical conditions and identify novel associations between cytomorphological phenotypes and clinical diagnoses. Importantly, we show that our approach generalizes to other centers and scanners.

Haemorasis, our open-source method to extract and characterize large numbers of WBC and RBC from digitized PBS, demonstrates how this can be automated with no recourse to proprietary software. We make it publicly available as a Docker container, enabling its straightforward application. Using Haemorasis, we detect and characterize over half a million WBC and millions of RBC. With morphometric moments (the mean and variance of morphometric features for each PBS) we show the diagnostic importance of cytomorphological heterogeneity for various conditions. This observation bears similarity to previous reports that associated RDW with increased AML transformation risk. It is also worth considering that quantifying morphological variation, especially of subtle features, is likely to be challenging to achieve by visual assessment, as it requires the absolute quantification and evaluation of large numbers of cells.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^23f2bad3]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The interpretation of peripheral blood smear (PBS) morphology is a core skill of the practicing hematologist and plays a key role in their ability to provide a timely diagnosis. The morphologic evaluation can reveal pathologic findings, which allow for timely diagnosis and rapid treatment for intracellular parasitic infections, hemolytic anemias, suspected thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and acute leukemias. However, the absence of pathologic findings required when diagnoses of exclusion, such as immune thrombocytopenia purpura, are under consideration.

Identification of pathologic morphology on PBS is an acquired skill that requires iterative visuospatial training to allow for high fidelity object recognition. Object recognition theories suggest that iterative training and the repetitive exposure to unique combinations of visual stimuli, including shapes, contours, colors, and textures, are needed to develop rapid object recognition with retained fidelity. Hematologists in the United States hone these skills during fellowship training.

In North America, graduate medical education (GME) training programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). During the training, fellows routinely order and interpret PBSs under the supervision of an attending hematologist. The ACGME outlines fellowship specific milestones across several domains in an effort to ensure a minimum level of clinical exposure and competency across programs. The ACGME milestones for hematology mandate competency in the "interpretation of peripheral blood smears". Despite this mandate, there neither is an established "gold standard", nor are there published, peer-reviewed recommendations on the methodology of teaching PBS review.

Other medical specialties require trainees to be competent in the interpretation of analogous visuospatial tasks. Examples include the interpretation of radiographic images (radiology, pulmonology, and internal medicine), echocardiography (cardiology), anatomic pathology (pathology), and urine sediment (nephrology). Clinical competency in the use of echocardiographic imaging is among the most granular and developed among these, but is still largely based on expert consensus. There are no agreed upon interdisciplinary best practices in skill acquisition in object recognition despite the seemingly ubiquitous nature of visuospatial skill mastery at the GME level.

We convened a focus group of academic hematologists, well-versed in the clinical application and teaching of PBS review with the goal to develop a theoretical framework for PBS education at the GME level. Here, we describe proposed theory and the consensus recommendations (CR) of a multiinstitutional focus group, developed using constructivist grounded theory and modified nominal group technique (NGT).

### Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: a Work group report of the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee [^cf78a13a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Bone marrow biopsy technique and specimen utility — A bone marrow biopsy is usually performed at the iliac crest and involves 2 stages: an aspirate and a core biopsy, and for adequacy at least a 1.5-cm length of the bone marrow core is required. It is essential to collect peripheral blood for a complete blood count with differential and peripheral blood smear evaluation before or shortly after the bone marrow biopsy for correlation of findings, and due to the excellent cellular detail and single-cell suspension of the aspirate smear it is the preferred specimen for performing a differential cell count and determining the percentage of individual cell types in the bone marrow.

### To and TAFRO-a cryptic cause of acute renal failure: a case report [^81f85817]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

A peripheral blood film noted microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells without the presence of teardrop poikilocytes, schistocytes, blasts, or other morphologically diagnostic or sinister findings (Fig. 1). No monoclonal paraprotein was found, Parvovirus-B19 serology was negative, and haemoglobin electrophoresis did not suggest the presence of a hemoglobinopathy. Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV serology were negative. Aside from a low-titre anti-nuclear antigen antibodies (ANA) of 1:80, serum autoantibodies including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA), and rheumatoid factor were all negative. His progressive, and symptomatic, bicytopenia (haemoglobin 85 g/L, platelets 38 × 10⁹/L) requiring intermittent transfusions of packed red blood cells prompted a bone marrow aspirate and trephine. This identified a hypercellular marrow with increased granulopoiesis, reduced erythropoiesis, megakaryocyte clustering and dysplasia in association with grade 2 fibrosis (Fig. 1). A subsequent JAK2 V617F, CALR, and MPL mutation analysis was negative. With the renal function deteriorating, a kidney biopsy was performed with simultaneous platelet transfusion. Light microscopy showed mild expansion of the mesangial matrix, with increased endocapillary cellularity of the glomeruli (Fig. 2 B), with variable thickening of the capillary walls and patchy double contour changes. There were no thrombi, sclerosing or necrotising lesions. Additionally, there was no tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, or interstitial inflammation, and no features suggestive of an arteritis, vasculitis, or cholesterol emboli (Fig. 2). Congo red staining was negative. Immunofluorescence and C4d staining were unremarkable. The overall appearance of the biopsy was in keeping with an atypical thrombotic microangiopathy. The electron microscopy had significant reprocessing artefact but excluded immune-complex deposition, and demonstrated an expanded mesangium occupied by swollen cells and diffuse glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening. (Fig. 2 D). Oligo-anuria with worsening pulmonary oedema prompted the initiation of haemodialysis at a creatinine peak of 531 μmol/L. A whole-body PET scan noted low metabolically active nodal disease above and below the diaphragm (SUV max 4.2), diffuse metabolic activity throughout the bone marrow and spleen, as well as pleural effusions, a pericardial effusion and abdominal ascites. A decision was made to forego a lymph node biopsy as the patient already fulfilled criteria for a diagnosis of TAFRO syndrome (meeting all 3 of the major criteria, and 3 of the 4 minor criteria), having excluded other possible haematologic and autoimmune conditions, 2 weeks into his hospital admission. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone was administered over 3 consecutive days, followed by daily oral prednisolone therapy. Although the HHV8 PCR was negative, the initial Interleukin-6 (IL-6) sample was not collected in the appropriate manner with the repeat sample being sent 1 week after initiation of methylprednisolone. This made the result (< 2.1 pg/mL) difficult to interpret. The renal dysfunction improved rapidly upon steroid initiation, with only 4 sessions of dialysis required during the admission. After 25 days in hospital, and 9 doses of glucocorticoid, the creatinine had improved to 165 μmol/L, with a persistent bicytopenia (Hb 105 g/L, Plts 51 × 10⁹/L). After discharge, the patient received 800 mg of intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m 2) administered weekly over 4 weeks, with the prednisolone weaned gradually. Over 6 months of follow-up, the bicytopenia resolved (Hb 135 g/L, Plts 246 × 10⁹/L) and the renal function stabilised with a creatinine of 100–110 μmol/L, eGFR 70–75 mL/Min/1.73 m², without proteinuria. Repeat testing of VEGF and IL-6 10 months from the initial presentation confirmed elevated levels of 1155 ng/L, and 410.0 ng/L, respectively. Given these results, an IL-6 inhibitor, siltuximab, was initiated.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^5b53ef10]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In health, the lifespan of a mature red blood cell is approximately 120 days. The longer an erythrocyte remains in the circulation, the greater the exposure of adult HbA to glycosylation. Conditions that reduce the lifespan of red blood cells, such as haemolysis, thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia and acute or chronic blood loss, result in lower HbA1c measurements. The opposite occurs when erythrocytes have a prolonged lifespan, as seen postsplenectomy and in iron or vitamin B 12 deficiency.

HS is an inherited disorder of red blood cells resulting in membrane instability and loss of surface area. The spherical shape and reduced deformability renders cells susceptible to damage and splenic sequestration, producing a haemolytic anaemia.

HS can be seen in all ethnic groups; the frequency commonly reported to be between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 5000 persons, with a predominance in Northern Europeans. Many genetic defects have been identified, with families often displaying unique mutations. While the majority are found to be autosomal dominant (75%), the inheritance pattern varies depending on the molecular cause, and recessively inherited and de novo mutations also occur (25%). In some cases, the genetic defect is undetermined. The membrane changes in HS result from mutations in genes encoding proteins integral in maintaining the vertical links between the inner cytoskeleton and the outer lipid bilayer. The most common defects are found in ankyrin (ANK1), spectrin (SPTA1, SPTB), Band 3 (SLC4A1) and less commonly Band 4.2 (EPB42) proteins, with studies varying in the reported prevalence of these mutations.

The clinical phenotype varies from a compensated or mild haemolytic anaemia to a severe neonatal haemolysis. Patients may experience symptoms of anaemia, jaundice, splenomegaly and gallstones. One study of 300 patients found that there was no clear clinical correlation between genetic defect and disease severity, although it was noted that spectrin/ankyrin deficiency was more often diagnosed in childhood and more frequently resulted in splenectomy.

The blood picture may guide clinicians to a diagnosis of HS. Characteristic spherocytes and the presence of immature red cells are seen on peripheral blood smear. The RDW and MCHC are often increased. The Hb is low in patients where the red cell loss is greater than erythropoiesis. Unconjugated bilirubin may be elevated, although in healthy states, this is usually mild since it is effectively processed and excreted by the liver. Folate levels may be low due to increased requirements.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^4db48954]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) — diagnostic criteria and variants specify that MCL "is defined histopathologically by the presence of greater than or equal to 20% neoplastic mast cells on a bone marrow aspirate smear", and if the aspirate is unevaluable, "MCL may be diagnosed on a core biopsy if a dense, diffuse infiltrate of atypical, immature mast cells is present". The aleukemic variant "(< 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood) is much more common than the leukemic variant (≥ 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood)". Acute MCL, "characterized by the presence of C-findings/organ damage, is present in the majority of patients", whereas chronic MCL "is defined as MCL without C-findings/organ damage and may display a more indolent disease course over time, but its natural history requires more study".

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^e8e64cf0]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The automated capture of peripheral blood smear images and artificial intelligence have the potential to address many of these limitations. Digital peripheral smear images are already automatically captured in many hospitals and are regularly used to conduct remote manual reviews. Current state-of-the-art for automated RBC morphology analysis includes CellaVision analyzers, which provide some preclassification of RBCs to assist with manual grading of smears. These systems assist in creating semiquantitative grading but are not sufficiently calibrated for important RBC subtypes, such as schistocytes, and the corresponding hardware may not be available in resource-limited settings. Research and development of additional tools have been hampered by poor reproducibility, inadequately small image data sets, limited clinical testing, or narrow focus on a few morphologies. Although some recent approaches have shown promise, they have not been validated at the cell population level, at which clinical assessments are made, nor have they been shown to add value in clinical diagnosis.

Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel, open-source machine-learning pipeline (denoted as RBC-diff) for the calculation of an RBC morphology differential from peripheral blood smear images. We validated the RBC-diff performance at single-cell and cell population levels using a clinical grading from a multicenter database of 338 577 smears. We then retrospectively applied the RBC-diff in multiple clinical contexts, demonstrating its value in differential diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we illustrated the utility of RBC-diff in a research setting by showing how this tool can derive novel single-cell data that can help improve the understanding of how morphology contributes to routine blood count indices.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^07dec496]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 7: nonimmune hydrops fetalis [^b37216df]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetomaternal hemorrhage–related nonimmune hydrops fetalis — "Fetal anemia may also occur due to fetal hemorrhage", and "Fetomaternal hemorrhage leading to hydrops may occur as either an isolated acute event, or as a chronic, ongoing hemorrhage". Diagnosis can be supported because "a Kleihauer-Betke smear will show the presence of fetal cells in the maternal peripheral blood in most cases", and "Flow cytometry can also be used to estimate the volume of fetal bleeding into the mother". Therapeutically, "This is an important diagnosis to make, because even with a massive fetomaternal hemorrhage, intravascular fetal transfusion can be lifesaving", and "we recommend that NIHF due to anemia from fetomaternal hemorrhage be treated with transfusion, unless the pregnancy is at an advanced gestational age and risks associated with delivery are considered to be less than those associated with the procedure".

### Methanol fixation, but not giemsa staining, inactivates Ebola and lassa viruses in peripheral blood smears made on plastic microscope slides [^0a76ae6d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Diseases caused by many highly pathogenic viruses, including Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa virus (LASV), present with nonspecific signs and symptoms that overlap with common tropical diseases such as malaria. Initial diagnostic tests performed on patients under investigation for viral hemorrhagic fevers routinely include analysis of peripheral blood smears to detect and quantify Plasmodium species. In light of recent and ongoing Ebola virus disease and Lassa fever epidemics, clinical laboratories around the world require protocols for dealing with highly infectious specimens from patients with suspected or confirmed high-consequence diseases. Few validated protocols for safe analysis of peripheral blood smears are available, revealing a need for further research. In this study, we evaluated the performance of two plastic microscope slide types that offer safe alternatives to glass slides, determined the temporal parameters required to inactivate EBOV and LASV in thin blood smears by methanol fixation, and assessed the virucidal activity of Giemsa stain. Both types of plastic microscope slides performed optimally; there were no significant differences in blood cell morphology or tinctorial properties nor were differences noted in Plasmodium ovale morphology or staining, when compared with glass slides. For both EBOV and LASV, viable viruses were not detected in thin blood smears following fixation in absolute methanol for at least 2 minutes. By contrast, viable EBOV and LASV were recovered from all Giemsa-stained thick blood smears.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: the future has arrived [^73a075de]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia in 2019

Most patients with CLL present with an incidental finding of a lymphocytosis, they may have palpable lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, bone marrow involvement can lead to anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Occasionally, patients may have the constitutional B symptoms with an unexplained fever of over 38°, weight loss of > 10% in less than 6 months and night sweats. A complication of CLL such as a high-grade disease transformation, an autoimmune disease or a severe infection may lead to its diagnosis.

The following diagnostic criteria are stipulated by the international workshop of CLL (iwCLL) and reiterated in the WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. The lymphocytes count in the peripheral blood must be greater than 5 × 10⁹, persistent for 3 months, and clonality of this population must be shown by flow cytometry for light chain restriction, CD5, CD23, CD79b and surface immunoglobulin expression with low levels of CD20. The presence of smudge/smear cells, an artefact of blood film production, is a typical finding in CLL. If the WCC is less than 5 × 10/L with no other signs of lymphoproliferative disorder, this constitutes monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis which is thought as a precursor to CLL, with a rate of progression of 1% per year. Identification of a clonal population of mature B cells within the lymph nodes or extranodal tissues without a peripheral blood lymphocytosis is referred to as a small lymphocytic lymphoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation is used to identify chromosomal rearrangements which can differentiate CLL from other conditions such as mantle cell lymphoma as well as helping with disease stratification.

### The impact of pathologist review on peripheral blood smears: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 22 laboratories [^57b4e874]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of peripheral blood (PB) smear review by a pathologist when requested by a technologist or provider to measure the rate of pathologist-detected clinically relevant findings.

Objective —

To report and analyze the results of clinically relevant morphologic findings on PB smears that were pathologist reviewed because of either a request from a technologist or an order from a provider.

Design —

During a 4-week study period, participants enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes program submitted data on PB smear reviews including review request source, reason for review request, and if the pathologist's review resulted in a clinically relevant morphologic finding.

Results —

Twenty-two institutions submitted data on 835 eligible PB smears. Pathologists identified clinically relevant findings on a median 53.4% of technologist-requested PB smear reviews and a median 14.3% of provider-ordered PB smear reviews. The most frequently identified pathologist finding on technologist-requested PB smear reviews was "blasts" in 91 of 532 (17.1%) followed by "atypical (possibly neoplastic) lymphocytes" in 74 of 532 (13.9%); the most frequent finding on provider-ordered reviews was "other" in 55 of 315 (17.5%) followed by "immature cells/left shift in myeloid cells or monocytes" in 12 of 315 (3.8%). Pathologists agreed with technologists' indications for review in 458 of 513 requested reviews (89.3%). Institutions that conducted postanalytic follow-up on previously reviewed PB smears had a higher rate of clinically relevant findings detected on technologist-requested smears.

Conclusions —

Pathologist review of PB smears flagged by technologists for review frequently yielded clinically relevant findings. This was higher in institutions that conducted postanalytic reviews. Provider-ordered reviews resulted in clinically relevant findings in a median of 14.3% of smears.

### Ticlopidine hydrochloride [^d4b8770a]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Neutropenia

Neutropenia may occur suddenly. Bone-marrow examination typically shows a reduction in white blood cell precursors. After withdrawal of ticlopidine, the neutrophil count usually rises to > 1200/mm within 1 to 3 weeks.3

Thrombocytopenia

Rarely, thrombocytopenia may occur in isolation or together with neutropenia.

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever. The signs and symptoms can occur in any order, in particular, clinical symptoms may precede laboratory findings by hours or days. With treatment (often including plasmapheresis), 70% to 80% of patients will survive with minimal or no sequelae. Because platelet transfusions may accelerate thrombosis in patients with TTP on ticlopidine, they should, if possible, be avoided. prompt

Aplastic Anemia

Aplastic anemia is characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia together with a bone marrow examination that shows decreases in the precursor cells for red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Patients may present with signs or symptoms suggestive of infection, in association with low white blood cell and platelet counts. treatment, which may include the use of drugs to stimulate the bone marrow, can minimize the mortality associated with aplastic anemia.

Recommendations
5. All persons at risk for ML — on the basis of the etiologic agent of the Leishmania infection, if known, and the region in the New World in which infection was acquired — should be questioned about and examined for mucosal symptoms and signs, respectively, even during the initial evaluation [Strong, low].
6. During all evaluations (i.e. initial and subsequent), persons at risk for ML should be questioned explicitly about the development, evolution, and other characteristics of mucosal symptoms; and they should have a thorough examination of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa even if they do not have any mucosal symptoms [Strong, low].
7. Persons at risk for ML should be educated and provided personalized documentation about the importance of seeking medical attention for possible ML if they ever develop persistent, atypical (unusual for the person) naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal manifestations that do not have a clear etiology [Strong, low].
8. Persons at risk for ML who have persistent mucosal symptom(s) or compatible abnormalities of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa should be referred to a specialist for an otorhinolaryngologic examination, which typically should include fiberoptic endoscopy [Strong, low].
9. Clinicians might refer some at-risk persons without documented mucosal symptoms or signs to an otolaryngologist, especially if it was not possible to conduct a thorough review of systems and mucosal examination or if the assessments may not have been adequate or reliable [Weak, very low].

IV. In a person with a compatible clinical course and epidemiologic context, what types of samples should be collected to evaluate for the diagnosis of VL?

Recommendations
10. We recommend the collection of tissue aspirates or biopsy specimens for smears, histopathology, parasite culture, and molecular testing [Strong, low].
11. Bone marrow aspiration is the preferred first source of a diagnostic sample. Liver, enlarged lymph nodes, and whole blood (buffy coat) are other potential sources of tissue specimens [Strong, low].
12. Serum should be collected for detection of antileishmanial antibodies (see VIII) [Strong, moderate].
13. In immunocompromised persons, blood should be collected for buffy coat examination, in vitro culture, and molecular analyses [Strong, very low].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^3ce31f4f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) — diagnostic definition and variants. MCL is defined histopathologically by the presence of greater than or equal to 20% neoplastic mast cells on a bone marrow aspirate smear, and when an aspirate is a dry tap and unevaluable, MCL may be diagnosed on a core biopsy if a dense, diffuse infiltrate of atypical, immature mast cells is present. The ICC does not distinguish between acute and chronic MCL and only uses the term MCL. The aleukemic variant (< 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood) is much more common than the leukemic variant (≥ 10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood). Acute MCL, characterized by the presence of C-findings/organ damage, is present in the majority of patients, whereas chronic MCL is defined as MCL without C-findings/organ damage and may display a more indolent disease course over time, but its natural history requires more study.

Examination of the bone marrow poses several unique challenges to the pathologist: it is a semisolid organ without helpful gross correlation, it exists in a dynamic state with the peripheral blood and other organs of the lymphohemopoietic system, and the diagnosis of diseases affecting bone marrow often depends heavily on ancillary special studies. The bone marrow examination ideally encompasses review of the bone marrow biopsy histology (with or without additional nondecalcified clot preparation material), bone marrow aspirate smear cytology, and the peripheral blood smear; optimal procurement and processing of these samples is critical in ensuring that a maximal level of diagnostic information can be extracted. The pathologist must be aware of the clinical context of the bone marrow and the results of ancillary tests, whether these are ordered by the pathologist or the clinician. A combination of excellent diagnostic samples, appropriate ancillary tests, and knowledge of the clinical context provides the best background to distinguish between the common reactive and neoplastic processes that involve the bone marrow and to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in making these distinctions.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^6bb0a583]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Across all cohorts, for each PBS we detected an average of 26,000 (range 70 to 133,916) RBC per PBS (a total of 12,042,425 RBC) and around 1,400 (range 12 to 39,862) WBC/PBS (a total of 646,952; Fig. 2e)). The cellular density for the MLL cohort was on average smaller by 44% for RBC/mm² and 10.5% for WBC/mm² compared to CUH (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Fig. S3a). Further heterogeneity was observed across conditions, with controls having the highest WBC density and the lowest RBC density (28.9 WBC/mm², 189 RBC/mm²), anemia having the highest RBC density (383 RBC/mm²) and MDS having the lowest WBC density (13.8 WBC/mm²; Supplementary Fig. S3b). Lastly, we also noted that automated blood films produced a higher fraction of good tiles compared to manually prepared slides while controlling for cohort and condition — an additional 5%, highlighting the utility of standardization (Supplementary Fig. S3c).

In line with the findings in Fig. 1c, we extracted on average more cells in controls than in individuals with either MDS or anemia (Supplementary Table S4), although heterogeneity across slides rendered this trend statistically insignificant. Generally, the cellular density of detected WBC in the PBS correlated with WBCCs from automated analysers, validating our detection protocol through an orthogonal approach (robust; Fig. 2f), and demonstarting that we detect a representative number of WBC in PBS. Finally, we characterized all individual cells using morphological features used in other morphometric software programs – (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Fig. S3). For each cell, we quantified its size, shape, color distribution and texture and for WBCs we also characterized their nuclear size and shape (Supplementary Fig. S4). We note here that our method for WBC nuclei segmentation underperforms in conditions of low contrast (where nucleus and cytoplasm are hard to distinguish) or high granularity (particularly for eosinophils and basophils; Supplementary Fig. S5), leading us to focus on cases of high contrast and avoiding conclusions pertaining to eosinophils or basophils.

### HIV-child with disseminated talaromyces marneffei (penicillium marneffei) infection: a rare severe case report [^3be1919d]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The blood routine examination of the subject indicated different degrees of reduction, especially thrombocytopenia. The coagulation test showed that the fibrinogen of the child was significantly decreased, while the coagulation function was obviously abnormal, and the symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding appeared in the later stage of the course of the disease. However, the reports of T.marneffei complicated with thrombocytopenia are rare. In the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, it is necessary to consider whether the patients are complicated with coagulation dysfunction, and be alert to the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding or other organs of hemorrhagic diseases that endanger the lives of patients.

Childhood AIDS patients with T.marneffei are not typical in clinical practice. After children are infected with T.marneffei, the disease develops very rapidly, and the mortality rate significantly increases. Blood bacterial culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of T.marneffei in a microbiological test. However, although this detection method is accurate and has a high detection rate, it requires time to be completed. On the other hand, bone marrow smear tests may be used to detect apparent cell structures/infection inside the bone marrow; however, this method is invasive and not easily performed. In this study, eight bone marrow smears and 10 mL bone marrow were collected for examination. T.marneffei was detected in both peripheral blood smear and bone marrow smear. However, bone marrow puncture is an invasive technique, and the more critical the patient is, the more difficult the operation will be. The microscopic examination of the peripheral blood smear is undoubtedly the most economical and rapid test method, which is used as a reference for bone marrow smear test results. Still, the detection rate of the peripheral blood smear is lower than that of the three inspection methods. Therefore, the combination of a peripheral blood smear, bone marrow smear, and bacterial blood culture might be the most accurate and efficient detection approach for T.marneffei, which in turn may save valuable time for clinical treatment of such patients, and reduce the mortality and missed detection rate.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — immunocompromised hosts: relapse risk, treatment duration, and monitoring: Immunocompromised patients infected with B. microti are at risk for high-grade parasitemia, hospitalization, and complications that include severe hemolytic anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, congestive heart failure, renal impairment, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and a subgroup of highly immunocompromised patients are at risk for relapse despite standard antimicrobial therapy; those at risk include individuals who have received or are receiving rituximab, are receiving other immunosuppressive regimens for transplantation or malignancy, have malignancy and are asplenic, or have HIV infection with low CD4 T cell counts (AIDS). In these patients, persistent or intermittently symptomatic infection may continue for more than 2 years. A retrospective case-control study of 14 such patients showed that complete cure typically requires ≥ 6 consecutive weeks of antimicrobial treatment, including 2 final weeks during which parasites are no longer detected on peripheral blood smear. For severe illness, immunocompromised patients should be monitored at least daily on blood smear until parasitemia has decreased to < 4%; thereafter, blood smears should be obtained at least weekly until parasites are no longer detected, and blood smears should be obtained and/or Babesia PCR performed if symptoms consistent with babesiosis recur. There is no standardized approach to monitoring highly immunocompromised patients but close clinical and laboratory follow-up are important; monitoring Babesia parasites on blood smear and treating them until the blood smear becomes negative is necessary; until additional data become available, the use of PCR to help decide which antimicrobial therapy is discontinued should be determined on a case by case basis.

Introduction

Quantitation and differential profiling of blood cells are the cornerstone of modern clinical diagnosis. For example, the white blood cell (WBC) differential, a quantitative profile of WBC subtypes, can flag infections or malignancies. Unlike WBCs, there are no functionally distinct normal RBC subtypes. However, morphologic RBC subtypes are associated with pathology and can be pathognomonic– eg, sickle cells in sickle cell disease, spiculated cells in liver disease, or teardrop cells in bone marrow disorders. Although clinical laboratory technologies to analyze WBCs have advanced, RBC profiling technologies have not and are still primarily limited to evaluating changes in RBC size and hemoglobin content, with only a limited analysis of morphology. An objective and quantitative differential of RBC subtypes could provide valuable clinical insights as a scalable, standardized, and automated summary of morphology. However, RBC shape cannot be accurately detected by standard automated hematology analyzers that rely on optical scatter or electrical impedance, making alternative approaches necessary.

To be the most clinically useful, RBC morphology classification must be fast and accurate. For example, identification of schistocytes is a linchpin in the diagnosis of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP), a life-threatening medical emergency that can be treated with immediate therapeutic plasma exchange. Yet, assessment of schistocytes is primarily performed through manual examination of a peripheral smear, a slow and subjective process often involving initial evaluation by a laboratory technologist and subsequent review by a hematologist or hematopathologist. These review processes typically generate semiquantitative flags (No flag, 1+, 2+, and 3+) that categorize smears in terms of frequency but are based on criteria that can vary substantially across hospitals. The result may be delayed or inaccurate diagnosesthat do not fully use the information present in the smear. The lack of methods for rapid and objective RBC evaluation is also a key obstacle in clinical research to investigate the novel diagnostic information contained in peripheral blood smears. In particular, the lack of automated tools means that RBC morphology quantitation is not regularly recorded in electronic medical records and is subsequently unavailable for large-scale retrospective studies of hematologic diseases. More broadly, smears contain rich information on the RBC shape, size, and hemoglobin content at the single-cell level, which are rarely captured or used. This is in stark contrast to the increasing role of single-cell data in understanding human physiology in other settings.

### Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitors-an overview [^7c4d3e1f]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematological

Unlike with chemotherapy treatment, CPI therapy is not commonly known to cause myelosuppression or cytopenia. There are case reports of aplastic anaemia (bone marrow) and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (peripheral blood) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura with anti-PD-1 agents, which seem to occur within 12 weeks of starting therapy. However, given the rarity of these cases, patients with cytopenia should be evaluated for common causes too, such as cancer progression, gastrointestinal bleeding and drugs.

In cases of nivolumab-induced aplastic anaemia, blood work should include a Coombs test, reticulocyte count and haemolysis assays (lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin and haptoglobin). Blood smears demonstrate pancytopenia with scattered lymphocytes. Bone marrow has a paucity of haematopoietic elements, with CD8 + T cells accounting for around 50% of the aspirate on flow cytometry.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is investigated in a similar way, with results showing a positive direct Coombs test, raised reticulocyte count and haemolysis assay of raised lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, and reduced haptoglobin. Blood smears show spherocytosis. The development of immune thrombocytopenic purpura is likely related to raised PD-1 expression on B cells. Blood results show decreased platelet count, with anti-platelet antibodies present. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates an abundance of megakaryocytes with immature platelets.

2.3.2. Red blood cell morphology

Inherited disorders of cobalamin or folate metabolism which cause megaloblastic anemia may present with a classical blood film appearance. In overt cases, the complete blood count (CBC) will show a macrocytic anemia, which progresses to pancytopenia. Hypersegmented neutrophils and oval shaped macrocytic red blood cells are the typical features on the blood film. There is usually strikingly abnormal red cell morphology, with marked variation in red blood cell size and shape due to the ineffective erythropoiesis. Of note, these features may be subtle or absent in some cases. A markedly elevated LDH and bilirubin is usually seen, which can lead to confusion with hemolysis or malignancy. While disorders of absorption and transport of cobalamin and folate are classically associated with megaloblastic anemia, this is not a characteristic finding of many of the intracellular inherited cobalamin or folate disorders (e.g. Cbl A, B, G; MTHFR and others); therefore, the absence of megaloblastic anemia does not rule out all cobalamin or folate disorders.

Several IMDs are associated with hemolysis (see section). Hemolysis is suggested on blood film examination by the presence of anemia in combination with polychromasia. Polychromasia describes red cells that are reddish-blue due to the staining of both hemoglobin (red) and residual RNA (blue) (Fig. 4). These are the morphological equivalent of reticulocytes, and if there is polychromasia, the reticulocyte percentage will be elevated. Further examination of the red blood cell morphology will give clues as to the underlying cause of the hemolysis; for example, spherocytes in autoimmune hemolytic anemia or hereditary spherocytosis, or sickle cells in sickle cell disease. Acanthocytes are red cells with spiky projections of unequal length and distribution and are typically seen in association with hemolytic anemia in people with abetalipoproteinemia. They are also seen in hypobetaliproteinemia, and vitamin E deficiency. Acanthocytes can also be seen in advanced liver disease, which is referred to as "spur cell" hemolytic anemia, for example in advanced Wilson disease or neonatal haemochromatosis. Stomatocytes are typically seen in sitosterolemia, with an associated hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly and abnormally large platelets; they can also be seen in certain forms of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

### New onset pancytopenia in adults: a review of underlying pathologies and their associated clinical and laboratory findings [^0d8cb643]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Pancytopenia is regularly encountered in hematology practice, yet there exist few published assessments of the frequencies of various etiologies, and these frequencies exhibit substantial geographic variation. We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.

Anemia frequently accompanies and plays a minor role in the presentation and course of infection, whether parasitic, bacterial, or viral. However, a variety of infections, many of which are common in Africa and Asia, cause specific hematologic syndromes. The pathophysiology of these syndromes is complex, and to some extent, reduced red cell production may form part of an innate protective host response to infection. Across the world and in endemic areas, malaria is the most important among this group of infections and forms a major part of everyday practice.

Bone marrow findings include that "Diffuse infiltration in the bone marrow is typically observed with T-PLL, but diagnosis is difficult to establish based on bone marrow evaluation alone", and "In general, bone marrow biopsy is not essential for establishing a diagnosis of T-PLL though should be used to confirm remission to therapy".

3. How to suspect CM-TMA?

CM-TMA presents the three classic features of thrombotic microangiopathies: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage, with certain specific characteristics. These clinical manifestations typically develop rapidly and may progress to organ failure and death if not adequately treated.

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

Non-immune microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is a hallmark of TMA, characterized by erythrocyte destruction in the microcirculation due to endothelial damage. It is identified by the following laboratory findings: elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte count, and free hemoglobin; decreased haptoglobin; and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. The direct coombs test is negative, except in TMA secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, where up to 90% of cases may present with a positive result, because it detects the binding of anti-T antibodies to recently exposed Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen on the red blood cell membrane. In such cases, if therapeutic plasma exchange is indicated, the exchange should be performed with 5% albumin, because fresh frozen plasma contains pre-formed antibodies anti Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen IgM, that may worsen the disease process.

Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count below 150,000/mm³ or a 25% decrease from baseline levels. This reduction occurs due to platelet consumption in microthrombi formed within small vessels. Thrombocytopenia severity in CM-TMA is generally less pronounced than in TTP.

Organ damage

Organ damage is multisystemic. Renal involvement, characterized by the formation of microthrombi in glomerular capillaries that impair glomerular filtration, is distinctive of CM-TMA and uncommon in TTP. About 50–60% of patients require renal replacement therapy, and malignant hypertension is frequently observed. Neurologic manifestations include encephalopathy, focal deficits, seizures and coma, but are considerably less frequent than in TTP. Skin, cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems involvement are described in small number of case reports.

Attention should be drawn to the fact that approximately 25% of patients with CM-TMA may present with renal-limited TMA. A kidney biopsy is essential for early detection. Morphological findings alone do not allow for the identification of the underlying etiology; therefore, patients should be screened for complement dysregulation. Renal-limited TMA is associated with less severe renal dysfunction and a lower risk of death compared to cases with hematological involvement. The effect of anti-C5 therapy in renal-limited TMA remains unclear.

Key alternative diagnoses, which must be ruled out, include vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, autoimmune haemolytic anaemias, haemoglobinopathies or infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus or leishmaniasis. Ferritin and transferrin saturations should be assessed to evaluate for secondary iron overload. A high level of soluble transferrin receptor and low/unrecordable serum hepcidin in the absence of iron deficiency has also been noted in some CDA‐I patients (Cazzola et al, 1999), but neither test is readily available in the clinic.

### Diagnosis of atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis [^f7aaa055]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The variable manifestations of infectious mononucleosis rarely cause clinicians to suspect primary Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection; consequently, costly diagnostic tests and unnecessary treatments are undertaken. Seventeen cases of clinically atypical and 11 cases of clinically typical infectious mononucleosis were diagnosed through screening for atypical and apoptotic lymphocytes in the peripheral blood samples by means of an automated hematologic analyzer. Atypical and typical cases did not differ significantly with respect to peripheral white blood cell counts; percentages of lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, CD4(+) lymphocytes, human leukocyte antigen — DR positivity in CD3 lymphocytes, or apoptotic cells in blood smear after incubation; or levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Only the percentage of CD8(+) lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with typical infectious mononucleosis than it was in patients with atypical infectious mononucleosis. Because certain atypical cases of infectious mononucleosis display laboratory abnormalities that are characteristic of typical infectious mononucleosis, enhanced awareness can help in the diagnosis.

### Infantile pyknocytosis… [^f08c7e99]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the course of an intensive study of full-term newborn infants manifesting hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of hemolytic disease, we became aware of the occurrence of markedly distorted and contracted erythrocytes in the blood of some of these patients. These cells conform to the type previously described under a variety of names, such as "burr cells, "1 "irregularly distorted and contracted erythrocytes, "2 and others. In order to evaluate the significance of these cells it became necessary to determine whether and in what percentage they might normally be found in this age group. We therefore studied unselected full-term and premature infants as well as adults. A significant age-determined relationship was found in that burr cells were encountered in slightly greater numbers in healthy full-term infants than in adults, and in significantly greater numbers in prematures than in full-term infants. Where the number of burr cells was within the physiologic range.

### CKD in MYH9-related disorders [^12296a13]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

MYH9-related disorders are rare causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) presenting as chronic glomerulonephritis and derive from mutations of the MYH9 gene, which encodes for the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA. These disorders are autosomal dominant and include May-Hegglin anomaly and Sebastian, Fechtner, and Epstein syndromes. Diagnosis of these disorders is made first in early childhood because of the characteristic peripheral-blood smear findings of thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and variably detected basophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in leukocytes. CKD typically develops later in adulthood and may progress to end-stage renal disease. MYH9-related disorders may be associated with deafness and cataract; hence, Alport syndrome becomes important in the differential diagnosis. However, the autosomal dominance pattern of inheritance and characteristic peripheral-blood smear findings in the former help differentiate the two conditions. New evidence suggests that MYH9 gene alterations also are associated with a greater risk of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis in African Americans. The purpose of this review is to focus on the known, but rarely recognized association of MYH9-related disorders with CKD and highlight the recent discoveries related to the MYH9 gene that may explain the reason for a high CKD burden in African Americans.

Bone marrow examination

The next step in the workup of an unexplained anemia (or cytopenia) is a BM examination, still the gold standard for the diagnosis of MDS (Table 1).

Bone marrow aspirate

A BM aspirate (stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa) is essential to assess the morphology of individual cells. The typical findings of MDS in the aspirate include dysplasia in any lineage as well as possible hyperplasia or hypoplasia. The cellularity, however, is best estimated with a biopsy. Blasts may have granules or Auer rods, and they are counted and reported as percentage of nucleated BM cells. The smears are also stained for iron (Prussian blue) to assess for the presence of ring sideroblasts. The BM aspirate is also the substrate of special tests to exclude MDS and to establish the diagnosis of another hematologic disorder. Figure 1 provides pictures of BM abnormalities in MDS.

Bone marrow trephine biopsy

A BM biopsy is important for evaluating the BM cells in their milieu. This is where the cellularity can be assessed more accurately, although this parameter has not been found to be critical for either the diagnosis or prognosis or MDS. BM biopsy might also identify fibrosis, which is found in the World Health Organization (WHO)-defined entity MDS with fibrosis (MDS-f).BM biopsy is less reliable than the aspirate for evaluating the morphology of single cells or for assessing the blast count. Importantly, BM histology may reveal metastatic disease from non-hematopoietic malignancies and granulomas suggestive of sarcoidosis or an infectious process.

### The pathophysiology of malarial anaemia: where have all the red cells gone? [^508fe078]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Malarial anaemia is an enormous public health problem in endemic areas and occurs predominantly in children in the first 3 years of life. Anaemia is due to both a great increase in clearance of uninfected cells and a failure of an adequate bone marrow response. Odhiambo, Stoute and colleagues show how the age distribution of malarial anaemia and the haemolysis of red blood cells may be linked by an age-dependent increase in the capacity of red blood cells to inactivate complement components absorbed or deposited directly on to the surface of the red blood cell. In this commentary, we discuss what has been established about the role of complement deposition on the surface of red blood cells in the pathology of malarial anaemia, how genetic polymorphisms of the complement control proteins influence the outcome of malaria infection and how the findings of Odhiambo, Stoute and colleagues and others shed light on the puzzling age distribution of different syndromes of severe malaria.

### Real-time, high-throughput super-resolution microscopy via panoramic integration [^33486cfd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

High throughput, super-resolution imaging of peripheral blood smear

Leveraging raster scanning, SPI effectively scales super-resolution imaging to accommodate large cellular populations and whole-slide applications. We demonstrated this capability by imaging peripheral blood smears labeled with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Fig. 2a, Methods). Specifically, SPI continuously inspected a testing area containing over 100,000 cells with modest sweeping at 9250 μm²/s across 2 mm × 2 mm, exceeding the static FOVs of conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Movie S4). Notably, SPI can acquire such an area of interest using around 60 s (Supplementary Movie S4), a throughput in line with commercial whole-slide scanners (typically 40–180 s for an equivalent imaging area), while delivering unprecedented sub-diffraction-limited clarity of major red blood cells (Fig. 2c-e). Moreover, WGA-stained images generated by SPI distinctly depicted cell membranes and cytoplasm, facilitating viable three-part differential analysis of white blood cell subtypes, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes (Fig. 2f-h). Population analysis (> 80,000 cells) revealed that red blood cells (93.1%) and platelets (6.8%) comprise the majority of the blood smear. Owing to the high sensitivity of SPI, rare white blood cells were resolved into neutrophils (49.3%), lymphocytes (38.8%), and monocytes (11.9%), in close relevance to conventional hematologic quantifications(Fig. 2i).
