## Question

H pylori regimen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting an H. pylori eradication regimen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is treatment-naive or treatment-experienced. Then, I should verify antibiotic exposure history and penicillin allergy status. Next, I will review local resistance patterns and the role of susceptibility testing. After that, I will select a first-line regimen with dosing and duration, followed by a contingency plan if the first choice is unsuitable. Finally, I will outline salvage strategies, special populations, and confirm the test-of-cure plan, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because treatment-naive patients have different preferred options than those with persistent infection after prior therapy, and I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios before committing to a regimen [^993b3e64] [^344c6c64].

> I need to check antibiotic exposure history carefully, especially macrolide and fluoroquinolone use, because prior macrolide exposure predicts clarithromycin resistance and prior fluoroquinolone exposure predicts levofloxacin resistance; repeating these classes after failure is discouraged and reduces cure rates, so I should document this upfront [^440d0e66] [^2724ef08].

> Hold on, I should verify penicillin allergy status because it changes the first-line calculus; if there is a true immediate hypersensitivity, I must avoid amoxicillin and choose non–penicillin-containing regimens, whereas if there is no true allergy, amoxicillin-containing options remain appropriate [^notfound].

> Next, I should review local resistance patterns and consider susceptibility testing when feasible; clarithromycin resistance exceeds 15% in many regions, making clarithromycin triple therapy unreliable, and although culture-based or molecular susceptibility testing is not universally available, it can guide therapy in refractory cases or when prior macrolide/fluoroquinolone exposure is present [^440d0e66] [^a1acb099].

> For treatment-naive patients with unknown susceptibility, I will now examine first-line options; optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days is the preferred regimen in North America, with rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy as suitable alternatives, and I should confirm dosing and duration to maximize efficacy [^993b3e64] [^960dd124] [^20926369].

> Wait, let me verify the components and dosing of optimized bismuth quadruple therapy so I don't misstate it: a standard-dose PPI twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg or subsalicylate 300 mg four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three to four times daily for 14 days; I initially thought metronidazole could be dosed twice daily, but that would be incorrect for this regimen, so I should correct that to TID/QID to match guideline dosing [^960dd124].

> I should double-check the rationale for 14 days; extending therapy from 7 to 14 days improves eradication rates with minimal incremental adverse effects, and this duration is consistently recommended across contemporary guidelines for both bismuth quadruple and many alternative regimens [^d6a60504] [^02570221].

> If bismuth quadruple therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, I need to consider alternatives; rifabutin triple therapy is a reasonable empiric option in patients without penicillin allergy, and PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy is an emerging first-line choice with supportive data, though I should confirm local availability and patient-specific risks before selecting it [^a79941a0] [^20926369].

> But wait, what if someone proposes concomitant therapy as first-line; I should confirm the current stance. The 2024 ACG guideline suggests concomitant therapy is not preferred over bismuth quadruple therapy in treatment-naive patients, so I should avoid defaulting to concomitant therapy unless there is a compelling local rationale or susceptibility data supporting it [^05aa58d1] [^63b3d652].

> For treatment-experienced patients with persistent infection, I need to ensure I do not reuse antibiotics from the failed regimen; optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is preferred if not previously used, and if already used, rifabutin triple therapy is a suitable empiric alternative, with levofloxacin triple therapy reserved for cases with confirmed levofloxacin susceptibility and when other options are unavailable or unsuitable [^993b3e64] [^5c46ec67].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of susceptibility testing in salvage; when available, clarithromycin or levofloxacin susceptibility can guide the choice of PPI–clarithromycin triple or levofloxacin triple, respectively, but repeating a macrolide or fluoroquinolone after prior failure is discouraged absent susceptibility confirmation due to high resistance and low expected cure [^51d5a69a] [^2724ef08].

> I will now examine special populations; in older adults or those with significant comorbidity, I should engage in shared decision-making about repeated antibiotic exposure and consider regimen tolerability, and in children, routine eradication is generally reserved for specific indications given reinfection risk and limited pediatric-specific data, so I should individualize and avoid extrapolating adult regimens wholesale [^c19eef82] [^1beb0da8].

> Next, I should review acid suppression optimization because inadequate gastric acid suppression impairs antibiotic bioavailability; in refractory cases, using a high-dose PPI, a PPI less dependent on CYP2C19 metabolism, or a PCAB can improve outcomes, and I need to ensure patients take acid suppression correctly throughout therapy [^cf50ba44].

> I need to ensure a robust test-of-cure plan; all patients should have eradication confirmed at least 4 weeks after completing therapy and off PPIs for 2–4 weeks using a urea breath test, stool antigen, or biopsy-based testing, and I should document the result to close the loop and inform future care if infection persists [^37ecb686] [^e76725ff].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm treatment status, document antibiotic exposures and penicillin allergy, assess local resistance and consider susceptibility testing when feasible, select a 14-day first-line regimen with bismuth quadruple preferred in treatment-naive patients, avoid repeating macrolides or fluoroquinolones after failure, and confirm cure with an appropriate test; this aligns with ACG 2024, AGA 2021, and Toronto Consensus recommendations [^993b3e64] [^029048a9] [^02570221].

For H. pylori, **bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days** is the preferred first-line regimen when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown [^993b3e64], with **concomitant therapy as an alternative** [^074d9606]. Clarithromycin triple therapy is only for patients with no prior macrolide exposure in areas with low clarithromycin resistance (< 15%) [^ce2ff2a6]. Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy are options when bismuth is unavailable or contraindicated [^a79941a0] [^20926369]. Always confirm eradication with a urea breath test or stool antigen ≥ 4 weeks after therapy, off PPIs for 2–4 weeks [^37ecb686].

## First-line regimens

### Bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT)

- **Components**: PPI (standard dose BID) + bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg or subsalicylate 300 mg QID + tetracycline 500 mg QID + metronidazole 500 mg TID or QID for 14 days [^960dd124].
- **Efficacy**: High eradication rates (~88–90%) [^05aa58d1].
- **Indication**: Preferred first-line when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown [^993b3e64].

---

### Concomitant therapy (non-bismuth quadruple therapy)

- **Efficacy**: Comparable to BQT (~85–90%) [^05aa58d1].
- **Indication**: Alternative first-line, especially when bismuth is unavailable [^02570221].

---

### Clarithromycin triple therapy

Clarithromycin triple therapy consists of a PPI (standard dose BID) plus clarithromycin 500 mg BID plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg BID or metronidazole 500 mg BID for 14 days. It is effective only in areas with low clarithromycin resistance (< 15%) and in patients with no prior macrolide exposure [^ce2ff2a6] [^2724ef08].

---

## Alternative first-line regimens

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Rifabutin triple therapy | PPI + amoxicillin + rifabutin | - Option when BQT is unavailable or contraindicated [^993b3e64] [^a79941a0] |
| PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy | Vonoprazan 20 mg BID + amoxicillin 1,000 mg TID | - Option when BQT is unavailable or contraindicated [^20926369] |
| PCAB–clarithromycin triple therapy | Vonoprazan 20 mg BID + clarithromycin 500 mg BID + amoxicillin 1,000 mg BID | Suggested over PPI–clarithromycin triple when clarithromycin susceptibility is unknown [^da02daa0] |

---

## Second-line and salvage regimens

After first-line failure, **avoid repeating previously used antibiotics**, especially clarithromycin or levofloxacin [^2724ef08]. Options include:

- **Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy**: If not previously used [^993b3e64].
- **Levofloxacin triple therapy**: PPI + levofloxacin + amoxicillin, if levofloxacin susceptibility is confirmed [^5c46ec67].
- **Rifabutin triple therapy**: PPI + amoxicillin + rifabutin, reserved after multiple failures [^f527b403].

---

## Duration of therapy

Extend therapy to **14 days** for all first-line regimens to maximize eradication rates [^d6a60504] [^02570221].

---

## Follow-up and confirmation of eradication

Confirm eradication with a **urea breath test or stool antigen ≥ 4 weeks after therapy**, off PPIs for 2–4 weeks [^37ecb686].

---

## Factors influencing regimen selection

- **Local antibiotic resistance patterns**: Especially clarithromycin and levofloxacin [^440d0e66].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Prior antibiotic exposure, allergies, comorbidities [^b11c1296].
- **Adherence and tolerability**: Simpler regimens may improve adherence [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|
| First-line, unknown susceptibility | Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days [^993b3e64] |
| Alternative first-line | Concomitant therapy for 10–14 days [^02570221] |
| Low clarithromycin resistance, no macrolide exposure | Clarithromycin triple therapy for 14 days [^ce2ff2a6] |
| BQT unavailable or contraindicated | Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy [^a79941a0] [^20926369] |
| After first-line failure | Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin/rifabutin-based regimens [^993b3e64] [^5c46ec67] |

---

Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days is the **preferred first-line regimen** when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown, with concomitant therapy as an alternative. Clarithromycin triple therapy is reserved for low-resistance settings without prior macrolide exposure. Rifabutin triple therapy or PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy are options when bismuth is unavailable. Always confirm eradication after therapy.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^ac551ac3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and to the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori was readily available, treatment would be more focused and-presumably-more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States. Therefore, physicians have to rely on clinical judgment in selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and to examine available evidence for how we might improve on our current treatment selections. Information on this review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.

### Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis and treatment [^0b09faf6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed to detect and treat the Helicobacter pylori infection. Many of them have stood the test of time; others lost their value with the introduction of new test and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the current diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline of the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The current guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances.

Summary

The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^d6a60504]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Selection Criteria

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. indications and regimens: an update [^1ed930af]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

The management of Helicobacter pylori infection is still surrounded by controversy and uncertainties. Indications and correct application of current regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection are still considered a matter of debate. Regarding indications, only peptic ulcer and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are considered clear indications for treatment. In other conditions, such as atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients, dyspeptic patients, patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug users, the value of Helicobacter pylori eradication is still controversial. The regimens for first-line and second-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection have been recommended by the Maastricht 2 Consensus Report. Although all the treatments are considered to be effective, physicians still do not agree on what first-line regimen should be used. Furthermore, a consensus on the duration of the antibiotic treatment is still lacking, although Maastricht guidelines for treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection recommend a one-week therapy. Also regimens, as a third-line treatment, and methods to improve compliance and clinical outcome are still a matter of debate. All these points will be considered in the present review

### Optimal therapy for Helicobacter pylori infections [^733194c4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Although Helicobacter pylori infection is both a common and a serious bacterial infection, antimicrobial therapies have rarely been optimized, are prescribed empirically, and provide inferior results compared with antimicrobial therapies for other common infectious diseases. The effectiveness of many of the frequently recommended H. pylori infection treatment regimens has been increasingly compromised by antimicrobial resistance. Regional data on the susceptibility of strains of H. pylori to available antimicrobials are sorely needed. Noninvasive molecular methods are possible to assess clarithromycin susceptibility in isolates obtained from stool specimens. As a general rule, clinicians should prescribe therapeutic regimens that have a ≥ 90% or, preferably, ≥ 95% eradication rate locally. If no available regimen can achieve a ≥ 90% eradication rate, clinicians should use the most effective regimen(s) available locally. Eradication of infection should always be confirmed after treatment in order to provide feedback regarding local effectiveness and an early warning of increasing resistance. In most regions of the world, four-drug treatment regimens, including a PPI plus three antimicrobials (clarithromycin, metronidazole/tinidazole and amoxicillin), or a PPI plus a bismuth plus tetracycline and metronidazole provide the best results. Standard triple therapy (a PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin) should now be avoided owing to increasing resistance to this treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^167460d4]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this CPU Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the management of Helicobacter pylori after an initial attempt at eradication therapy fails, including best practice advice on specific regimen selection, and consideration of patient and systems factors that contribute to treatment efficacy. This Expert Review is not a formal systematic review, but is based upon a review of the literature to provide practical advice. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. Accordingly, a combination of available evidence and consensus-based expert opinion were used to develop these best practice advice statements.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^b11c1296]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection that is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also have a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin or starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. While choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, patients should be asked about previous antibiotic exposure and this information should be incorporated into the decision-making process. For first-line treatment, clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pylori isolates is known to be low. Most patients will be better served by first-line treatment with bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. When first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were previously used. If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are the preferred treatment options. Details regarding the drugs, doses and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^60eb5c83]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Helicobacter pylori is a prevalent, global infectious disease that causes dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The American College of Gastroenterology commissioned this clinical practice guideline (CPG) to inform the evidence-based management of patients with H. pylori infection in North America. This CPG used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to systematically analyze 11 Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions and generate recommendations. Where evidence was insufficient or the topic did not lend itself to GRADE, expert consensus was used to create 6 key concepts. For treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) for 14 days is the preferred regimen when antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. Rifabutin triple therapy or potassium-competitive acid blocker dual therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative in patients without penicillin allergy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, "optimized" BQT for 14 days is preferred for those who have not been treated with optimized BQT previously and for whom antibiotic susceptibility is unknown. In patients previously treated with optimized BQT, rifabutin triple therapy for 14 days is a suitable empiric alternative. Salvage regimens containing clarithromycin or levofloxacin should only be used if antibiotic susceptibility is confirmed. The CPG also addresses who to test, the need for universal post-treatment test-of-cure, and the current evidence regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing and its role in guiding the choice of initial and salvage treatment. The CPG concludes with a discussion of proposed research priorities to address knowledge gaps and inform future management recommendations in patients with H. pylori infection from North America.

### The toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^02570221]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Helicobacter pylori infection is increasingly difficult to treat. The purpose of these consensus statements is to provide a review of the literature and specific, updated recommendations for eradication therapy in adults.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on H pylori treatment. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an online platform, finalized, and voted on by an international working group of specialists chosen by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.

Results

Because of increasing failure of therapy, the consensus group strongly recommends that all H pylori eradication regimens now be given for 14 days. Recommended first-line strategies include concomitant nonbismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI] + amoxicillin + metronidazole + clarithromycin [PAMC]) and traditional bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI + bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline [PBMT]). PPI triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + either amoxicillin or metronidazole) is restricted to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance or high eradication success with these regimens. Recommended rescue therapies include PBMT and levofloxacin-containing therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + levofloxacin). Rifabutin regimens should be restricted to patients who have failed to respond to at least 3 prior options.

Conclusions

Optimal treatment of H pylori infection requires careful attention to local antibiotic resistance and eradication patterns. The quadruple therapies PAMC or PBMT should play a more prominent role in eradication of H pylori infection, and all treatments should be given for 14 days.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^80c61b83]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted in populations that are relatively homogenous within geographic borders, albeit ethnically distinct (e.g. Asian-Pacific populations). In contrast, the United States (US) population comprises individuals with diverse ancestral backgrounds, with correspondingly diverse H. pylori strains. In the US, the lack of recent comparative clinical trials is coupled with limited knowledge of locoregional H. pylori antibiotic resistance patterns and of regimen-specific local cure rates, as well as limited contemporary data on temporal trends and relevant demographic details (e.g. age, race and ethnicity). Current national and international guidelines provide limited guidance on how to approach factors other than H. pylori antibiotic resistance which might also underlie eradication failure, such as host- and systems-related factors. Collectively, these issues contribute to persistent H. pylori infection (Figure 1).

### Best treatment approach: should a national consensus be the best consensus? [^7ee2ee02]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti- H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance (Table 1). According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori -related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance. It seems apparent that an international consensus should play a major role in a specialist's decision making, but it also appears quite reasonable and inevitable that a national consensus, based on nationwide surveys of first-line, second-line and rescue therapies, as well as the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance, should play the major role in each clinician's judgment. In a recently published review, De Francesco et al provided a critical reappraisal of updated worldwide guidelines. The authors fairly concluded that, although several of these guidelines highlighted that the results being achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable to another one, it emerged that some therapeutic regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the need to consult existing national data. However, if solid susceptibility data are available for a specific population, then one could recommend or reject various therapeutic regimens for this population, because antimicrobial resistance seems to represent the key factor adversely affecting the outcome of eradication treatment. Nevertheless, each national study group and consensus panel should avoid taking isolated data from one study in a specific region of the country and arbitrarily generalizing them to the entire country's population. On the other hand, this extrapolation seems to be generally accepted for one country if its susceptibility pattern has been thoroughly defined.

American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Helicobacter pylori treatment guideline — scope, populations, and grading are described as follows: The guideline used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process to assess the quality of evidence and expresses quality as high, moderate, low, or very low, with the strength of recommendation given as either strong (recommendations) or conditional (suggestions). It summarizes treatment recommendations for patients with active H. pylori infection confirmed by a nonserological test, including those who have not been previously treated and those with persistent infection despite previous attempt(s) at eradication. Recommendations prioritize studies conducted in North America, and when unavailable, may be based on studies from other parts of the world and expert consensus.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8–11 for refractory H pylori infection state that longer treatment durations provide greater eradication success than shorter durations (eg, 14 days vs 7 days) and whenever possible longer durations should be selected. In some cases there should be shared decision making regarding ongoing attempts to eradicate H pylori, weighing benefits against adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression. With confirmed patient adherence, H pylori susceptibility testing should be considered to guide selection of subsequent regimens. Compiling local data on eradication success rates for each regimen and relevant patient factors is important, and aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of therapy.

### Controversies regarding management of Helicobacter pylori infections [^d6497fea]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recognition that Helicobacter pylori should be considered and treated as an infectious disease has yet to fundamentally change diagnostic and treatment practices and has resulted in many controversies.

Recent Findings

We discuss the following controversies: whether the current 'per-patient' approach to H. pylori testing based on symptoms should be expanded to include achieving population-level H. pylori eradication, whether H. pylori should be approached as an infectious gastrointestinal disease similar to that of other infectious diseases of similar severity and outcome, whether treatment of H. pylori should be primarily empiric or based on antibiotic susceptibility and locally proven successful therapies as are other infectious diseases, whether it is necessary to obtain confirmation of treatment success in every patient treated for H. pylori, and whether potassium-competitive acid blockers should replace proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori therapy.

Summary

Available guidelines and meta-analyses do not yet address H. pylori as an infectious disease. The diagnosis and management and treatment success of H. pylori infections trails behind that of other important infectious diseases. We provide new insights and propose changes in the traditional understanding required to modernize the management of H. pylori infections.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^a1acb099]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although susceptibility-guided therapy is frequently recommended for Helicobacter pylori infection, the evidence available to date supporting this strategy is limited. The aim of the present article is to review the advantages and limitations of the susceptibility-guided and the empirical strategies to treat this infection. We performed a bibliographic search to identify studies investigating H. pylori susceptibility-guided therapy. Culture is not the only way to assess antibiotic resistance, as different polymerase chain reaction-based approaches have been developed as alternative methods. For detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance, a molecular approach based on a stool sample might enable more convenient, time-saving methods. Unfortunately, the antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be obtained in all cases. Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical practice yields useful information only for a few antibiotics: clarithromycin, metronidazole, and quinolones. In addition, susceptibility towards clarithromycin and metronidazole in vitro does not necessarily lead to eradication in vivo. In the case of H. pylori therapy failure, we should not re-administer any of the antibiotics against which H. pylori has probably become resistant. Our updated meta-analysis showed that susceptibility-guided treatment is not better than empirical treatment of H. pylori infection in first-line therapy if the most updated quadruple regimens are empirically prescribed, and similar efficacy results were also demonstrated with the two strategies for second-line therapy. Cumulative H. pylori eradication rate with several successive rescue therapies empirically prescribed reaches almost 100%. Finally, the studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the susceptibility-guided treatment have achieved contradictory results. In summary, we can conclude that the evidence is too limited to support the generalized use of susceptibility-guided therapy for H. pylori treatment in routine clinical practice, either as first-line or as rescue treatment. Nevertheless, it would be recommended that susceptibility tests are performed routinely, even before prescribing first-line treatment, in specialized centers with an interest in H. pylori management.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^37ecb686]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — key concepts emphasize prevalence, linked testing-treatment decisions, regimen selection, and follow-up. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America remains substantial at 30%–40%. The determination of when to test for — and treat — H. pylori should be viewed as a single, rather than 2 separate and distinct, decisions. Clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-containing treatment regimens should be avoided in the absence of demonstrated macrolide and quinolone susceptibility, respectively. All patients who are treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure with an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 wk after completion of therapy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy. PCAB denotes potassium-competitive acid blocker and PPI denotes proton pump inhibitor.

### First-line therapies foreradication: a critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^d02f2be5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment remains a challenge for the clinician, as no available therapy is able to cure the infection in all treated patients. In the last two decades, several antibiotic combinations have been proposed, including triple therapies, bismuth-free therapies (sequential, concomitant, hybrid regimens), and bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Some national and international guidelines on H. pylori management have recently been updated, recommending or discouraging the use of each of these therapeutic approaches, based mainly on the presumed pattern of primary antibiotic resistance in different geographic areas. We examined the recommendations on first-line therapies in the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, taking into account other data affecting the efficacy of a therapy regimen beyond the primary resistance pattern. Although several guidelines highlighted that the results achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable, it emerged that some therapy regimens are recommended or discouraged with no mention of the vital need for national data.

The purpose of this CPU Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the management of H. pylori after an initial attempt at eradication therapy fails, including best practice advice on specific regimen selection, and consideration of patient and systems factors that contribute to treatment efficacy.

This Expert Review is not a formal systematic review, but is based upon a review of the literature to provide practical advice. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. Accordingly, a combination of available evidence and consensus-based expert opinion were used to develop these best practice advice statements.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^410e2003]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary objectives of this Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Expert Review are to 1) provide a salient overview of determinants of H. pylori eradication treatment failure, including host-, microbe-, and systems-related factors as they are currently understood; and, 2) leverage these data to provide clinical practitioners with evidence- and consensus-based multimodal best practice advice for treating H. pylori after the first treatment failure. We include a clinically relevant synthesis of contemporary data on the appropriateness and efficacy, or lack thereof, of specific antimicrobial treatment regimens and adjunctive therapeutic agents for this purpose. The terms "salvage" and "rescue" therapy are commonly used in the literature to describe treatment courses following the initial eradication therapy, but without a consistent definition. As such, we avoid the use of these terms. Additionally, to the extent possible, we focus on evidence from North America in order to ensure that this article is most relevant for US practitioners.

Definition of refractory infection

For the purpose of this CPU Expert Review, refractory H. pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive non-serological H. pylori test (i.e. a breath-, stool-, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks following one or more completed course(s) of current guideline-recommended first-line H. pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications that might impact the test sensitivity (e.g. proton-pump inhibitors (PPI)). Refractory H. pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a non-serological test which was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — as the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^f0de73ef]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Resistance of H. pylori to antibiotics has reached alarming levels worldwide. Local surveillance networks are required to select appropriate eradication regimens for each region. Tailored treatment of H. pylori infection according to systematic antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be useful to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance worldwide. However, whether patients should systematically undergo an upper endoscopy for bacterial culture (or PCR) before administering H. pylori eradication treatment in clinical practice remains a debatable matter. In the present article we have reviewed the advantages and limitations of the susceptibility-guided and the empirical strategies to treat H. pylori infection, which are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Main advantages and limitations of susceptibility-guided and empirical treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.

It would be recommendable that susceptibility tests (culture or PCR) are routinely performed, even before prescribing first-line treatment, in specialized centers with interest in H. pylori management, with the intention to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of naïve patients and the influence of such resistances on the efficacy of up-to-date first-line eradication treatments. Furthermore, it would also seem recommendable that susceptibility tests are routinely performed in some specialized centers after H. pylori eradication failures, to evaluate the development of resistances in this setting and to assess how they may reduce the effectiveness of rescue regimens.

However, the evidence is too limited to support the generalized use of susceptibility-guided therapy for H. pylori treatment in routine clinical practice, either as first-line or as rescue treatment. In particular, it seems that despite the use of susceptibility-guided combinations of drugs, rescue treatments are frequently unsuccessful, indicating that other factors different from in vitro antibiotic susceptibility influence eradication rates. Practical, economical, and logistical issues should be evaluated and addressed according to the target population and the clinical situation prior to the application of susceptibility-guided H. pylori therapy. In the future, stool sample-based molecular approach for detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance might enable more convenient, less invasive methods that facilitate the applicability of susceptibility-guided treatment.

What is undoubted is that we always must prescribe the most effective first-line H. pylori eradication treatments (that is those regimens that have demonstrated to achieve cure rates ⩾90% in our setting) and that the rescue treatment should be carefully chosen depending on which treatment was used initially. The results (H. pylori cure rates) of our clinical practice should be continuously audited to confirm that we always maintain a high success rate.

### Helicobacter pylori world gastroenterology organization global guideline [^42b6068a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori remains a major health problem worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and mortality due to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The burden of disease falls disproportionally on less well-resourced populations. As with most infectious diseases, the largest impact on reducing this burden comes from improvement in socioeconomic status, which interrupts transmission. This has been observed in many regions of the world, but the prevalence of infection remains high in many regions where improvements in living standards are slow to occur. Meanwhile, the optimal clinical management and treatment pathways remain unsettled and are evolving with changing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Despite decades of research and clinical practice, major challenges remain. The quest for the most effective, safe, and simple therapy remains the major issue for clinicians. The search for an effective vaccine appears to be elusive still. Clinical guidelines do not infrequently proffer discordant advice. A major challenge for guidelines is for relevance across a variety of populations with a varying spectrum of disease, antimicrobial resistance rates, and vastly different resources. As local factors are central to determining the impact and management strategies for H. pylori infection, it is important that pathways are based on the best available local knowledge rather than solely extrapolating from guidelines formulated in other regions, which may be less applicable. To this end, this revision of the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) H. pylori guideline uses a "Cascades" approach that seeks to summarize the principles of management and offer advice for pragmatic, relevant and achievable diagnostic and treatment pathways based on established key treatment principles and using local knowledge and available resources to guide regional practice.

### Reconciliation of recent Helicobacter pylori treatment guidelines in a time of increasing resistance to antibiotics [^b583e0da]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing resistance to antibiotics worldwide has adverse effects on the effectiveness of standard therapies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection. We reviewed guidelines developed by expert groups in Europe, Canada, and the United States for the treatment of H pylori infection. We compared the recommendations of these guidelines, reconciled them, and addressed the increasing resistance of H pylori to antibiotic therapy regimens. The guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line treatment, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. There is consensus for concomitant 4-drug therapy as an alternative, especially when bismuth is not available. When therapy is unsuccessful, it is likely due to resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and/or metronidazole; these drugs, if used previously, should be avoided in subsequent eradication attempts. Second-line therapies should be bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin triple therapy, depending on suspected resistance, reserving rifabutin-based triple and high-dose dual amoxicillin proton pump inhibitor therapy for subsequent treatment attempts. The increasing resistance of H pylori to antibiotic therapy necessitates local availability of susceptibility tests for individuals, and establishment of regional and national monitoring programs to develop evidence-based locally relevant eradication strategies. Further studies into the development of more easily accessible methods of resistance testing, such as biomarker analysis of stool samples, are required. Options under investigation include substituting vonoprazan for proton pump inhibitors, adding probiotics, and vaccine development. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics and new therapeutic targets could be identified based on genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses of H pylori.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^2b561a5c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The article will give an overview on reasons for treatment failure and tries to show new concepts for Helicobacter pylori treatment.

Recent Findings

Several new treatment options or modifications of already established regimens have been introduced to overcome treatment failure. Antibiotic resistance to H. pylori is the key factor for treatment failure. At the moment, standard triple therapy remains the primary choice in regions with proven low clarithromycin resistance rates. In areas with high clarithromycin resistance, four drug treatment regimens, including quadruple and sequential therapy, have proven the best results as first-line regimens. The options for second-line treatment regimens are manifold. Second-line treatment regimens need to be adapted accurately to local resistance rates.

Summary

Treatment of H. pylori infection is challenged by a dramatic fall in eradication rates all over the world. Newer regimens have been introduced including sequential, quadruple therapies and those regimens provide promising results, but the knowledge about local resistance rates remains the key to an effective therapy.

Considerations in regimen selection for refractory H. pylori

There is no shortage of guidelines from international authorities advising on H. pylori management. Some of the most prominent recent releases are listed in Table 1.–

Overall, the guidance for the management of refractory infection are relatively consistent among the expert groups. However, it should be emphasized that the body of evidence underlying their conclusions reflects the general low quality and heterogeneity of clinical studies conducted on refractory H. pylori infection. Furthermore, most of the trials included in metanalyses of second-line treatment have investigated treatment after failure of a first-line regimen with clarithromycin-based triple therapy, a regimen that we now appreciate should no longer be used in most regions of the world, including the US. Lastly, even though incorporation of antibiotic susceptibility testing has been advocated by the Maastricht expert consensus group since the first iteration of their guidelines in 1997, the slow uptake of resistance testing around the world persists and continues to propagate empiric selection of eradication therapy for most refractory H. pylori infections, especially in the US.

Nevertheless, several important themes have emerged for guiding treatment of refractory H. pylori infection. First, given the high resistance rates to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, these antibiotics or others in their class (macrolides, fluoroquinolones respectively) should not be repeated in subsequent treatment attempts. Based on the premise that secondary H. pylori resistance may have ensued as collateral damage, an antibiotic history of usage of any of these drug classes for other indications should be considered when selecting subsequent therapy. Because primary and secondary resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin are very low, these can be used in repeated regimens, even if they have been used previously for H. pylori eradication or other therapy.(BPA #2) Age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications should also guide therapeutic selection and factor into shared decision-making.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection… [^ebea0a01]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Recently, Tefera et al49 conducted a study using a triple therapy consisting of bismuth subcitrate, oxytetracycline, and metronidazole for 10 days. Fifty-five infected patients received a 14-day course of tetracycline, metronidazole, and CBS, 4 times a day. This regimen yielded a 96. 3% eradication rate, which is consistent with previous studies. Of the 55 patients, 8 had H pylori isolates that were metronidazole resistant. In one study, 54 30 patients with H pylori infection were treated with 1 of 2 regimens: 2 tablets of BSS 4 times a day, tetracycline hydrochloride, and either azithromycin for 2 weeks. Lansoprazole, another proton pump inhibitor, has been shown to be just as effective as omeprazole in triple antibiotic therapy.

In a multicenter trial64 conducted in the United Kingdom and Ireland, patients with either duodenal ulcer or gastritis and H pylori infection were randomized to 1 of 4 1-week regimens: lansoprazole plus clarithromycin with either amoxicillin or metronidazole twice daily or amoxicillin plus metronidazole with either lansoprazole or omeprazole twice a day. Quadruple antibiotic therapies have consisted of traditional bismuth-based triple therapy with the addition of an antisecretory agent, either an H2RA or a proton pump inhibitor, to achieve close to complete eradication. These regimens have consistently achieved high eradication rates. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, 71 108 consecutive patients with peptic ulcer disease and biopsy-proven H pylori infection were randomized to 7 days of triple therapy with or without omeprazole or placebo.

### Update on Helicobacter pylori treatment [^111d0a0d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

One half of the world's population has Helicobacter pylori infection, with an estimated prevalence of 30 percent in North America. Although it is unclear whether eradication of H. pylori improves symptoms in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, there is strong evidence that eradication of this bacteria improves healing and reduces the risk of recurrence or rebleeding in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer. A "test-and-treat" strategy is recommended for most patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia. With this approach, patients undergo a noninvasive test for H. pylori infection and, if positive, are treated with eradication therapy. This strategy reduces the need for antisecretory medications as well as the number of endoscopies. The urea breath test or stool antigen test is recommended. Until recently, the recommended duration of therapy for H. pylori eradication was 10 to 14 days. Shorter courses of treatment (i.e., one to five days) have demonstrated eradication rates of 89 to 95 percent with the potential for greater patient compliance. A one-day treatment course consists of bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, all given four times with a one-time dose of lansoprazole. In children with documented H. pylori infection, however, all regimens should continue to be prescribed for seven to 14 days until short-course treatment is studied and its effectiveness has been established in this population.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: treatment [^d3143b93]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Current standard treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection provide eradication rates 80 to 90%. These rates have been achieved with a variety of 1-week triple therapies using two antibiotics and an acid suppressant. Antibiotic resistance, which may develop during failed treatment, is becoming increasingly common and has led to studies of new regimens for primary therapy, and new strategies for salvage of failed therapy. Other regimens have been designed and tested with the aim of decreasing the cost of initial therapy or to improve compliance, but abbreviated regimens have high incidence of failure and may add to the problem of resistance. Increasing attention has been paid to the need for, and timing of, the determination of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori isolates either at the time of initial diagnosis or after treatment failure. New, simpler, and noninvasive methods are offered for follow-up to determine if eradication has been successful. Treatment regimens should be chosen based on local drug susceptibility patterns and the availability of approved therapeutic agents in each country. Established indications for testing for H. pylori and administering therapy include active or inactive peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, as well as hyperplastic polyps, hyperplastic gastropathy, postendoscopic resection for gastric malignancy, and acute H. pylori gastritis. It is now largely accepted that noninvestigated dyspepsia is an indication for testing for and treating H. pylori, but that dyspeptic symptoms shown not to be associated with ulcer (nonulcer dyspepsia) do not now provide an indication for testing. Controversial or unresolved indications for testing and treating include planned use of chronic antisecretory therapy, planned use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and use as a general approach to the prevention of gastric cancer.

### Pharmacological regimens for eradication of Helicobacter pylori: an overview of systematic reviews and network meta-analysis [^49f69a1b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) is one of the most common human infections with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 50%. In the United States (US) and Europe, the prevalence of H.pylori is estimated to be 20% to 50%, varying in different socioeconomic, age and ethnic groups and geography. In developing countries, the prevalence has been reported to be as high as 70%. H.pylori is usually latent and asymptomatic; however, increasing evidence has demonstrated the link between H.pylori infection and the pathogenesis of a series of upper gastrointestinal diseases: functional dyspepsia, chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma.

Eradication of H.pylori has been shown to be associated with increased rate of peptic ulcer healing and reduced risk of gastric cancer. Standard triple therapy, which includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole, is recommended as first-line eradication therapy for H.pylori infection in clinical guidelines worldwide. A treatment alternative also widely recommended is bismuth-based quadruple therapy, which contains a PPI or H 2 receptor antagonist (H 2 RA), bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline. Other treatment options include varying individual drugs within the triple therapy and quadruple therapy based regimens. More recently, sequential therapy of these multiple treatment options also has been introduced. In the US, the American College of Gastroenterology guideline (2007) recommends clarithromycin-based triple therapy for first-line eradication in patients who have not previously been treated with clarithromycin and are not allergic to penicillin. For patients who are allergic to penicillin or have previously received a macrolide antibiotic, a bismuth quadruple therapy is preferred.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^c5dcf66a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroenterologists and many general internists and primary care physicians confront questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori on a daily basis. The subject remains of global interest and continue to generate debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management' we identified over 1000 relevant articles in PubMed published over the time period 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. We have selected the most highly clinically relevant of these to review here.

Recent Findings

Clinical evidence grows regarding the benefits of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer prevention. High rates of resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, correlating with treatment failure in regimens utilizing these drugs, has stimulated interest in alternative regimens as well as the need for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well established, implementation of appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal throughout healthcare settings.

Summary

Increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice is needed to identify implementation gaps, and to suggest means to best apply the knowledge gained on H. pylori for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^042c04dc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although H. pylori was formally declared an infectious disease in 2015, this change in status has yet to be reflected in treatment recommendations or conduct and analyses of clinical studies. In infectious diseases, antibiotics are never administered to patients known to be resistance to them and additional antibiotics are not added to a therapy with the hope that the infection will be susceptible to at least one of them. Current H. pylori treatment guidelines still deal with H. pylori gastritis as if it were a typical gastroenterology disease such as constipation (i.e. of largely unknown etiology, impossible to cure, treatable but with relative low expectations, and with a high placebo response). This has resulted in a focus on randomized comparative trials where differences in cure rate rather than actual cure rates are considered the most important outcome measure. In reality, most comparative studies compare therapies with the same name (e.g. bismuth quadruple therapy rather than on their actual components) and ignore the differences in details of drug administration that allows factors such as the prevalence of resistance, duration of therapy, and relative potency of the antisecretory drug to greatly influence outcome. An example, in a recent network meta-analysis, the cure rates with most of the clarithromycin triple therapy comparator ranged were clinically unacceptable, ranging from 32% to 92%, with 76% below 85%. Comparative trials also typically do not take antimicrobial resistance or its effects on outcome into account. As such, the results of most clinical trials and meta-analyses fail to provide useful information or to provide material from which to derive meaningful guidance for the management of specific infections in specific patients. As noted above, this problem is a residual of the history of attempting to force an infectious disease into a gastroenterology mold.

The recent rapid increase in the availability of susceptibility testing has taken us the cusp of integrating susceptibility-based H. pylori therapy into our daily practice. We anticipate that practice will rapid evolve to a combination of use of proven locally highly effective empiric therapies and susceptibility-based therapy (Figure 1). The goal of this article is to review the issues involved in the choice of an effective therapy of patients with H. pylori infections and provide specific guidance that will reliably produce high cure rates. We begin with the problem of antimicrobial resistance.

Since the 1990s, different national and international guidelines for the management of patients with H. pylori infection have been introduced and periodically updated. Undeniably, recommendations on some issues are universally applicable to different geographic areas, such as those concerning the indications for treatment, or diagnostic procedures. For instance, H. pylori infection should be searched for in all patients with a peptic ulcer, irrespectively of the country where they are living. Likewise, the accuracy of noninvasive or invasive tests does not change among patients of different geographic areas. Therefore, guidelines on diagnosis and clinical issues may be applicable in all countries. In contrast, the efficacy of a therapy regimen may be affected by local or regional host/bacterial peculiarities. Consequently, recommendations on therapeutic approaches are more appropriately addressed in national rather than international guidelines, provided that data from national studies are considered.

Based on all these considerations, we aimed to examine the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, focusing our attention on first-line therapy recommendations for H. pylori eradication. Specifically, we considered European, NICE, Italian, Spanish American and Canadian guidelines for Western countries, and Asian, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese guidelines for Eastern countries.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^14f5aa64]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 1–4 for refractory Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection emphasize that the usual cause is antibiotic resistance and that providers should assess for other contributors including adherence and acid suppression. Providers should conduct a thorough review of prior antibiotic exposures and avoid clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens if there is prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone use, whereas resistance to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin is rare and these can be considered. Education and adherence support are advised by explaining the rationale for therapy, dosing instructions, expected adverse events, and the importance of completing the full course. If bismuth quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment, shared decision making should guide selection between levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple therapy with high-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin, or an alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as second-line options.

CQ12. What are the suitable treatment regimens for Chinese residents to eradicate H. pylori among family members?

Statement 12: The treatment regimens proposed by the 'Fifth National Consensus Report on the Management of Helicobacter pylori Infection' are suitable for H. pylori eradication among family members.

Evidence quality: high.

Recommendation strength: strong recommendation 78.9%, conditional recommendation 21.1%.

Consensus level: 94.7%.

Comments: In 2017, the Helicobacter pylori Study Group of Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, CMA, published its 'Fifth National Consensus Report on the Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection', which proposed seven different combinations of bismuth and PPI-containing quadruple treatment regimens (BQT) as the main empiric therapy to eradicate H. pylori. The course of treatment is 10 or 14 days (PPI+bismuth+two antibiotics). These regimens are currently commonly applied in clinical practice with high eradication rates(table 4). They are also suitable for family-based H. pylori eradication in the household. Infected family members should be offered a quadruple regimen with known high curative rate locally and low adverse drug reaction rate as recommended. Bismuth does not have drug resistance and is safe and convenient in short-term application. Therefore, unless there are competing considerations, the consensus recommends the empirical bismuth quadruple regimen to treat H. pylori infection. Its current eradication rate is above 85% and, in some instances, above 90% (table 4)

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 4: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). We advise against the use of clarithromycin in any treatment regimen unless there is evidence that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-sensitive strain of H. pylori; if susceptibility is not known and there is no history of macrolide use and no alternative first-line therapy is available, evidence supports a 14-day, twice-daily triple regimen that includes clarithromycin and amoxicillin with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) instead of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In prespecified analyses, vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapy was superior among clarithromycin-resistant strains (eradication rates by mITT 66% vs 32%, P < 0.0001) and in the entire study population (mITT 81% vs 69%, P < 0.0003); diarrhea (4%) and dysgeusia (4%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. A network meta-analysis reported vonoprazan-based triple therapy had 72% probability of being the most efficacious.

### One-day drug regimen eliminates H. pylori… [^dd69de2c]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Is a one-day treatment of Helicobacter pylori as effective as a seven-day regimen in patients with dyspepsia. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Synopsis: The researchers recruited 160 adult patients with dyspepsia who scored 3 or higher on the Glasgow Dyspepsia Severity Score and had a positive urea breath test, signifying the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive a four-drug cocktail for one day or treatment with three drugs for seven days. Allocation may not have been concealed from the enrolling researcher. The one-day regimen consisted of two 262-mg tablets of bismuth subsalicylate, 500 mg of metronidazole, and 2 g of amoxicillin.

The "cocktail" was taken four times during the course of the day, along with a one-time dose of 60 mg of lansoprazole. The control group took 500 mg of clarithromycin, 1 g of amoxicillin, and 30 mg of lansoprazole twice daily for seven days. Five weeks after treatment started, the urea breath test was readministered to the 150 patients who returned. Eradication rates were similar in the two groups: 95 percent in the one-day group, and 90 percent in the seven-day group. Treatment success rates also were similar between the two groups: the GDSS dropped an average of 7. 5 points in both groups. Side effects were tallied at the five-week follow-up rather than during or immediately after treatment and may not be accurate. Bottom Line: A four-drug, single-day treatment was as effective as seven days of treatment with three drugs in eradicating H. pylori and symptoms in patients with H. pylori-positive dyspepsia.

### Optimal duration of treatment regimens for H. pylori… [^fe74f150]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer When using proton pump inhibitor triple therapy, increasing the duration of treatment from seven to 10 days or from 10 to 14 days significantly increases the eradication of H. pylori. When using other treatment regimens, it is unclear whether increasing duration of treatment changes eradication rates. H. pylori eradication regimen. 1 This Cochrane review compared eradication rates for seven-, 10-, and 14-day regimens of four subtypes of PPI triple therapy. Thus, a PPI was added to each of the following antibiotic regimens: clarithromycin plus amoxicillin; clarithromycin plus a nitroimidazole; amoxicillin plus a nitroimidazole; or amoxicillin plus a quinolone. H. pylori eradication improves with a longer duration of PPI triple therapy. The number needed to treat for one additional H.

pylori eradication is 21 when treatment is lengthened from seven to 10 days; the NNT is 17 when increasing from 10 to 14 days, and 11 when increasing from seven to 14 days. H. pylori eradication regimens over the course of seven, 10, or 14 days: PPI plus bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; PPI plus three antibiotics; PPI plus one antibiotic; H 2 blocker plus bismuth salt plus an antibiotic; H 2 blocker plus two antibiotics; bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; and H 2 blocker bismuth quadruple therapy. The optimal treatment duration for PPI triple therapy is 14 days. This Cochrane review was unable to draw any conclusions about the optimal treatment duration or effectiveness of any alternative H.

pylori treatment regimens in comparison with the standard PPI triple therapy because of the paucity of data for alternative regimens.

### Helicobacter pylori: consensus and controversy [^cff95702]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the human stomach. Infection leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on properties of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. Eradication therapy is indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. H. pylori infections can be diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately 85% success by a variety of multidrug, 7-14-day regimens. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is affecting treatment effectiveness in the United States and abroad. A more complete understanding of the variation in H. pylori pathogenesis should lead to clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma.

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 5: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, concomitant therapy is not suggested over bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) (conditional recommendation; low quality evidence). Concomitant therapy consists of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole given twice daily for durations ranging from 5 to 14 days. A meta-analysis of 40 studies comprising 5,810 treatment-naive patients found no significant difference in eradication between BQT and concomitant therapy (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94–1.07), with overall ITT eradication 87.4% (709/904) for BQT and 85.2% (727/906) for concomitant therapy; a low-risk-of-bias subgroup showed BQT 88.2% (682/773) vs concomitant 84.5% (653/773) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09, P = 0.02). Adverse events were reported less commonly with concomitant therapy than with BQT (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.99). Given the lack of superiority and stewardship considerations, concomitant therapy is not a suggested option for treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection in North America.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: detection, investigation, and management [^1beb0da8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastritis and peptic ulcers and is associated with the development of gastric cancer. Approximately 50% of the world population is infected with H pylori, with the highest prevalence rates in developing countries. In the vast majority of individuals, infection is acquired during childhood with those of low socioeconomic means and having infected family members being at highest risk for early childhood acquisition. Definitive routes of transmission of the infection are unclear, with evidence suggesting oral-oral, gastric-oral, and fecal-oral routes. If untreated, H pylori infection is lifelong. Although clinical disease typically occurs decades after initial infection acquisition, children infected with H pylori may have gastritis, ulcers, mucosal-associated lymphoid type lymphoma, and, rarely, gastric atrophy with/without intestinal metaplasia (ie, both precursor lesions for gastric cancer). Controversy persists regarding testing for and treating H pylori, if found, in the large number of children who present with recurrent abdominal pain. Because young children (ie, younger than 5 years of age) who are treated and cured of their H pylori infection may be at risk for reinfection, the current recommendations do not recommend treatment unless an ulcer or gastric atrophy is present. However, despite the lack of clinical evidence, the trend is to more aggressively screen children for the presence of H pylori and to treat those children who are found to have the infection. H pylori infection can be eradicated by antimicrobial therapy plus a proton pump inhibitor, but no treatment regimen is 100% effective. Multiple drugs, frequent dosing, and length of treatment often contribute to poor patient compliance, and antibiotic eradication therapy is associated with increasing drug resistance.

### Chinese consensus report on family-basedInfection control and management (2021 edition) [^04fe04f9]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

CQ13. What is the management strategy in treating H. pylori infection among family members?

Statement 13: The concept of 'eradicating H. pylori at the first-time treatment' is applicable in the management of H. pylori infection among family members.

Evidence quality: high.

Recommendation strength: strong recommendation 86.8%, conditional recommendation 13.2%.

Consensus level: 94.7%.

Comments: The nature of H. pylori eradication is similar to the treatment of other commonly found pathogenic bacterial infections, but their characteristics are different. H. pylori eradication rates can be improved by using high-efficiency acid-suppressing PPIs to raise the stomach pH and therefore increase antibiotic bioavailability. In recent years, with widespread H. pylori eradication in many hospitals and clinics in China, the H. pylori resistance rate to antibiotics has been gradually increasing, which is accompanied with a decline in the empirical eradication rate. Failure of the first-time eradication may lead to the development of bacterial resistance and reduce the range of antibiotic options for future retreatment. Hence, successfully eradicating H. pylori infection in the first treatment is desirable.

H. pylori resistance to antibiotics is usually related to local bacteria resistance patterns and previous antibiotic usage. Before selecting an empirical treatment regimen, the cure rate, adverse drug reactions, convenience, accessibility, adherence and costs, along with the antibiotic resistance situation of the patient, should be evaluated to achieve the maximal therapeutic effect. It should also avoid misuse or unnecessary use of antibiotics. When treating H. pylori infection in children and adolescents, the safety and benefits of eradication should be assessed carefully based on individual infection history, antibiotic usage and disease status; doses of antibiotics should be adjusted according to body weight before eradication is implemented.

Regarding the efficacy of susceptibility-guided individualised treatment and empirical therapy in eradicating H. pylori infection, a recent Chinese study confirmed that susceptibility-guided individualised therapy and previously proven locally highly effective empiric therapy are highly and equally effective. However, for patients who have repeatedly failed eradication, individualised therapy guided by drug-sensitivity testing is recommended. In addition, if the patient's history of antibiotic use can be incorporated into the selection of empirical treatment regimen, it will help to increase the first-time H. pylori eradication rate and reduce the chance of developing drug resistance, and only therapies that are known to be highly effective locally should be used empirically.

Conclusion

H. pylori management has become increasingly challenging due to declining eradication success rates coupled with increasing antibiotic resistance, resulting in more H. pylori infections that are now refractory to first-line therapies. Accordingly, this CPU was developed to provide practitioners with practical advice on how to manage patients whose initial H. pylori treatment was unsuccessful. When considering the major public health implications associated with persistent H. pylori infection with respect to disease- and treatment-related complications and cost, there is a clear need to prioritize systematic approaches to improve rates of successful H. pylori eradication with the least number of therapeutic attempts.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^2724ef08]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Should antibiotics be repeated, especially after H. pylori eradication failure?

When a regimen has to be selected to treat H. pylori infection, we have several data that will aid us in suspecting resistance to a particular antibiotic, without the necessity of a culture. In naïve patients, a suggested strategy is to choose the best regimen for a population according to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. The effectiveness of a treatment for H. pylori can be predicted as long as its efficacy in resistant and susceptible strains and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance are known in the specific population. For this to be possible, epidemiological surveys evaluating resistances in each country or region should be conducted on a regular basis. Moreover, it is very important to ask patients about previous exposure to antibiotics, particularly macrolides and fluoroquinolones, for any reason, as this provides a proxy for underlying antibiotic resistance to H. pylori. Thus, in areas where H. pylori clarithromycin resistance is known to be low (< 15%) and in patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure (for any reason), clarithromycin triple therapy may still be a valid first-line treatment option.

Regarding rescue treatment, after failure of a first-line eradication regimen, the remaining H. pylori will show very high resistance to some (though not all) of the prescribed antibiotics. Resistance to amoxicillin and tetracycline is extremely rare, even after failure of treatment including these antibiotics. The same applies to bismuth: no in vitro resistance to this drug has been described. By contrast, after treatment failure, resistance to clarithromycin, quinolones and metronidazole reach virtually 100%. As the efficacy of clarithromycin- and quinolone-containing regimens is strongly affected by clarithromycin and quinolone resistance, repeating these drugs in rescue treatments is discouraged. Even if resistance to these antibiotics does not appear, it remains uncertain whether their re-administration is adequate, as they were not efficacious (for unknown reasons) for the first time. In fact, a major finding of a recent systematic review was that, even if the culture shows a clarithromycin-susceptible strain, repeating clarithromycin after a first treatment failure with this drug should be discouraged.

### Should quinolones come first in Helicobacter pylori therapy? [^2e971a2b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

New generations of fluoroquinolones, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and have been successfully introduced into the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Based on a large body of evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of levofloxacin- or moxifloxacin-containing proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) triple therapies in second-line or rescue treatment of H. pylori infection. The efficacy of standard PPI triple therapies has substantially declined during the last decade, mainly due to increasing resistance against the key antibiotics clarithromycin and metronidazole. Therefore, alternative strategies for first-line therapy of H. pylori infection have been evaluated in a considerable number of clinical trials including sequential regimens, nonbismuth quadruple regimens, and quinolone-containing PPI triple therapy regimens. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current body of evidence of levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-containing regimens in first-line treatment of H. pylori infection, and to discuss the risks and benefits of these strategies in the light of increasing resistance of H. pylori to quinolones.

### Practical aspects in choosing a Helicobacter pylori therapy [^fdc802dd]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cure rates greater than 90%-95% should be expected with an antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. Standard triple therapy does not guarantee these efficacy rates in most settings worldwide anymore. The choice of eradication regimen should be dictated by factors that can predict the outcome: (1) H. pylori susceptibility; (2) patients' history of prior antibiotic therapy; and (3) local data, either resistance patterns or clinical success. Currently, the preferred first-line choices are 14-day bismuth quadruple and 14-day non-bismuth quadruple concomitant therapy. Bismuth quadruple (if not used previously), fluoroquinolone-, furazolidone- and rifabutin-containing regimens might be effective rescue treatments.

Second-line therapies for H. pylori infection

A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing quadruple (or triple) therapy or a PPI-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy have been recommended as second-line treatment for H. pylori infection by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. Recently, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy and vonoprazan-based therapy have proposed to increase the eradication rate. Table 1 lists the regimens and durations of these recommended second-line therapies.

Table 1.
Regimens for second-line anti- H. pylori therapy.

To investigate the efficacies of current second-line eradication regimens, randomized controlled trials published in English language articles reporting the eradication rates of second-line anti- H. pylori therapy were eligible for literature search. The status of H. pylori infection before and after treatment should be verified by at least one of the following tests: urea breath test, rapid urease test, histology or culture. The post-treatment H. pylori status should be assessed at least 4 weeks after eradication therapies. Medical literatures were searched from PubMed (1 March 2013–1 March 2023). We identified the eligible literatures with the keywords of ' Helicobacter pylori ' or ' H. pylori ' or ' H pylori ', and 'therapy' or 'treatment'. 'Clinical trial' was set as filter. The titles and abstracts were screened by CAS and CBS to exclude irrelevant studies. The full articles of potentially eligible studies were further reviewed by CAS and CBS. Literatures published in the abstract form only were excluded. Studies that did not report the results according to the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were also excluded. Two investigators, CAS and CBS, reviewed the literatures under the above criteria independently using pre-designed data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with PIH to reach consensus. Figure 1 shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of the literature search. Table 2 summarizes the intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates of various H. pylori eradication regimens including standard bismuth quadruple therapy (tetracycline-metronidazole quadruple therapy), fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin triple therapy, fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, tetracycline-fluoroquinolone quadruple therapy, high-dose dual therapy, levofloxacin-based sequential therapy, tetracycline-metronidazole-amoxicillin concomitant therapy, furazolidone-tetracycline quadruple therapy, furazolidone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, amoxicillin-clarithromycin-metronidazole tetracycline quintuple therapy, and tetracycline-metronidazole-ofloxacin quintuple therapy.–

### Empiric quadruple vs. triple therapy for primary treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability [^b3ba1d6c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent treatment guidelines recommend two first-line therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection: proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole (quadruple therapy) or PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin (triple therapy). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these regimens as first-line treatment of H. pylori.

Methods

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ACP Journal Club, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, and abstracts from prominent gastrointestinal scientific meetings was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bismuth quadruple therapy to clarithromycin triple therapy were selected for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted data, using standardized data forms. Meta-analysis was carried out with the metan command in Stata 10.1. Funnel plots and subgroup analyses were carried out.

Results

Nine RCTs (N = 1,679) were included. Although dosing regimens of clarithromycin triple therapy were quite consistent between trials, dosing regimens varied considerably for bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy achieved eradication in 78.3% of patients, whereas clarithromycin triple therapy achieved an eradication rate of 77.0% (risk ratio (RR) = 1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.936–1.073). There was moderate heterogeneity and no evidence for significant publication bias. Subgroup analyses by study location, treatment duration, and study population did not account for the heterogeneity. There were no statistically significant differences in side effects yielded by quadruple vs. clarithromycin triple therapy (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.04–1.14).

Conclusions

Quadruple and triple therapies yielded similar eradication rates as primary therapy for H. pylori infection. Both therapies yielded suboptimal eradication rates. Patient compliance and side effects are similar for quadruple and triple therapies.

### Treatment options for patients with Helicobacter pylori infection resistant to one or more eradication attempts [^1a7ad798]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens fail to cure Helicobacter pylori infection in at least 10–23% of treated patients. Re-treatment strategies after initial failure remain poorly defined. Of the factors leading to eradication failure, patients' compliance, gender, primary resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole, and intragastric bacterial load appear to be the most important in determining treatment outcome. Empirical re-treatment should depend mainly upon the antibiotics initially used, as re-administration of the same compound (namely, metronidazole and clarithromycin) is not recommended. Quadruple therapy is usually suggested in this situation, but there is some reluctance to use it in clinical practice on account of the high number of tablets to be taken and concern about side-effects. The use of ranitidine bismuth citrate instead of a proton pump inhibitor plus a bismuth compound in triple second-line regimens has recently proven to be highly effective. Finally, rifabutin-based triple therapies have been shown to be a promising rescue strategy in patients who have failed two or more eradication attempts.

Future research priorities — Helicobacter pylori infection (North America): In preparing this CPG, the authors identified key knowledge gaps in the management of patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection or at risk for harboring H. pylori infection in North America, specifically, and these should be acknowledged as research priorities. Priorities include identifying which individuals in North America are most likely to benefit from opportunistic H. pylori testing (and subsequent treatment if positive) to prevent gastric cancer; conducting additional high-quality studies in North America that compare the effectiveness and tolerability of the newly approved and recommended therapies against older regimens; assessing whether replacing a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) with a PCAB in BQT or rifabutin triple therapy further improves efficacy and tolerability and optimizing PCAB antimicrobial dual therapy in North American populations to achieve consistently high eradication rates; addressing pharmacogenomic heterogeneity where the prevalence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms varies according to ancestry, including a higher prevalence of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers in people of Asian ancestry, and studying whether CYP2C19 testing or selection of non-CYP2C19 metabolized PPI or a PCAB should be considered and whether these options are cost-effective; leveraging antibiotic susceptibility testing as an individualized, precision approach, noting that key evaluations have not yet been evaluated in studies from North America and that this is an immediate research priority; and developing a national registry to track H. pylori antibiotic resistance rates and local eradication success rates with specific treatment regimens to support evidence-based treatment choices.

Helicobacter pylori infection — treatment-naive patients: In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) is recommended as a first-line treatment option (strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence). BQT typically comprises a bismuth salt, a nitroimidazole, tetracycline (which is preferred over doxycycline), and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). BQT is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration when prescribed separately in its 4 components, and Pylera is dispensed only as a 10-day regimen, whereas Helidac was initially approved with an H2-receptor antagonist for 14 days. We do not recommend the use of H2RAs in treatment regimens for H. pylori infection and do not recommend restricting treatment to those infected patients who have peptic ulcer; therefore, this preparation was not further considered.

### Efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the first-line regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5b6e89b7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is highly adapted for the colonization of the human stomach and has infected nearly half of the world's population, including ~700 million individuals in China. H. pylori infection plays an important role in upper digestive diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and deadly gastric adenocarcinoma. Successful eradication of H. pylori could markedly improve the patient's symptoms, attenuate the course of these diseases, and prevent gastric cancer.

Traditional triple therapy consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin (or metronidazole), and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) has been used worldwide as the first-line regimen to eradicate H. pylori for decades and achieved eradication rates of > 90% in the 1990s. However, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics especially clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, the success of clarithromycin triple therapy as well as several alternative regimens has rapidly declined. Toronto Consensus has opposed the use of sequential and hybrid therapies and did not recommend levofloxacin therapy as first-line therapies. At present, Maastricht V/Florence Consensus, Toronto Consensus, and American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline still all recommended clarithromycin triple therapy as one of the first-line regimen, limited to areas where clarithromycin resistance is < 15%. For areas of high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy (when bismuth is not available such as Taiwan) were favored. In China, resistance rates of clarithromycin range from 20% to 50%, therefore, bismuth quadruple therapy has been highly recommended as first-line therapy for H. pylori eradication according to the Fifth Chinese National Consensus Report. Despite the improvements in the eradication rate, quadruple therapy has limitations, including complex pharmaceutical composition, increasing side effects, and high cost.

Helicobacter pylori infection — guideline recommendations for treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients are as follows: In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) is recommended as a first-line treatment option (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence), rifabutin triple therapy is suggested as a first-line treatment option (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), dual therapy with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) and amoxicillin is suggested as a first-line treatment option (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence), and for unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence), while concomitant therapy is not suggested over bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality evidence). For treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested in those who have not previously received bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence), optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested after prior PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), rifabutin triple therapy is suggested after receipt of bismuth quadruple therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is suggested over quinolone-based therapy when optimized bismuth quadruple therapy has not been previously received (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence), and levofloxacin triple therapy is suggested in patients with known levofloxacin-sensitive H. pylori strains and when optimized bismuth quadruple or rifabutin triple therapies have previously been used or are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection, there is insufficient evidence from North America to recommend high-dose PPI or PCAB dual therapy (no recommendation; evidence gap), and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the use of probiotic therapy improves the efficacy or tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy (conditional recommendation; low quality of evidence).

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^490aa576]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 13: for those with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following unsuccessful eradication attempts, there is no current evidence-based guideline on appropriate follow-up. The IHPWG consensus is that endoscopic surveillance with ESGE-recommended mapping biopsies for precancerous changes should be considered at an interval of 5–10 years from last failed treatment

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Mainly due to poor patient compliance and the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, H. pylori treatment failure has become more common leading to challenges in H. pylori management. Over decades, H. pylori gastritis may progress through a cascade of precancerous stages from intestinal metaplasia, followed by dysplasia and finally carcinoma. Evidence-based recommendations on the management of persistent H. pylori infection following multiple eradication attempts are lacking. While biomarkers for precancerous changes are under investigation, none can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. The IHPWG consensus recommends endoscopic surveillance with the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/ management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach mapping biopsies for precancerous changes at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed H. pylori eradication attempt to monitor for signs of mucosal progression. In addition, the development of new symptoms at any stage during follow-up, especially any alarm symptoms, should trigger further assessment. Finally, the persistence of H. pylori infection should be considered as a relevant factor by any clinician prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or long-term PPIs.

Statement 14: as part of a quality assurance programme, Helicobacter pylori first-line, second-line and rescue therapy eradication rates should be locally monitored and audited as part of national and European registries

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

There are geographical variations in the prevalence of H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and resistance is a continuously evolving process. Therefore, resistance surveillance is recommended (see statement 6). Currently, there is no national program for longterm resistance surveillance in Ireland. Monitoring the eradication success to the various treatment regimens prescribed offers an additional and more widely accessible approach to select the most appropriate H. pylori therapies in each population. The IHPWG consensus is that practitioners should perform regular audits of H. pylori treatment outcomes and that the data should be shared by means of a national registry, as well as with the Hp-EuReg, to refine the best-practice recommendations for the management of H. pylori infection in Ireland over time.

Table 1. GRADE criteria — strength of recommendation and quality of evidence definitions are specified as follows: Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, whereas conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced; quality of evidence is graded as high ("We are very confident that the true effect closely aligns with that of the estimate of the effect."), moderate ("We have a moderate level of confidence in the estimate of effect. It is likely that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect."), low ("Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect could differ from the estimate of effect."), or very low ("We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.").

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

Helicobacter pylori infection — probiotics as adjuncts to eradication therapy: The benefits of probiotics seemed to be most profound in studies from China, and although data on adding probiotics to the efficacy and tolerability of H. pylori eradication therapy are promising, they should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than warranting a formal treatment recommendation. Several important practical uncertainties prohibit a formal recommendation for their routine use in North America, and studies from North America are clearly needed along with clarity on probiotic strains, dosages, durations, and combinations with antibiotics that might benefit H. pylori treatment efficacy and/or tolerability.

### H. pylori infection: ACG updates treatment recommendations… [^d4f3a6fc]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Bismuth quadruple therapy consists of a PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and a nitroimidazole for 10 to 14 days. It may be a particularly good option in patients with macrolide exposure or who are allergic to penicillin. Although metronidazole resistance impacts the effectiveness of this regimen, it is not nearly as profound as with clarithromycin triple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy should be strongly considered as first-line treatment where clarithromycin resistance is high or in patients with any previous macrolide exposure. SUGGESTED Sequential therapy consists of a PPI and amoxicillin for five to seven days followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and a nitroimidazole for five to seven days. Although 10 days of sequential therapy appears to be a viable alternative to 14 days of clarithromycin triple therapy, 10 days of sequential therapy has not been shown to be superior to 14 days of clarithromycin triple therapy.

Extending sequential therapy to 14 days may improve eradication rates, but more studies are needed. The complexity of sequential therapy may limit its use. The best options appear to be fluoroquinolone-containing sequential therapy or LOAD therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days or levofloxacin triple therapy for 14 days are the recommended salvage regimens. Other suggested regimens include concomitant therapy for 10 to 14 days, rifabutin triple therapy for 10 days, and high-dose dual therapy for 14 days. Clarithromycin triple therapy is not recommended for salvage therapy.
