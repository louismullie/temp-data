## Question

55 yo F with seizure history managed on phenytoin and fluoxetine presents with pneumonia; cultures pending, BP 118/70, HR 94, O2 sat 96% on 2L. She is NPO with mild dysphagia post-ictally. Resident orders IV levofloxacin for outpatient aspiration pneumonia coverage. Proceed with IV levofloxacin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV levofloxacin is appropriate for a 55-year-old woman with a seizure disorder on phenytoin and fluoxetine who presents with suspected aspiration pneumonia, and what safer alternatives and monitoring steps should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug–drug interaction risks, especially CYP2D6 inhibition by fluoxetine raising phenytoin levels. Then, I should verify QT prolongation risk with fluoxetine plus levofloxacin. Next, I will examine seizure threshold concerns with fluoroquinolones. After that, I need to check renal dosing and whether the proposed levofloxacin dose is appropriate. Finally, I will consider alternative antibiotics and outline a practical, safer plan with monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the CYP2D6 interaction. Fluoxetine is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and phenytoin is metabolized by CYP2D6, so coadministration can increase phenytoin plasma concentrations and precipitate toxicity; case reports and labeling document clinically significant phenytoin level elevations with fluoxetine, warranting close monitoring and dose adjustment if fluoxetine is continued [^57d2160e].

> Wait, let me verify the QT risk before concluding. Fluoxetine carries a labeled warning for QT prolongation and advises avoiding concomitant QT-prolonging drugs; levofloxacin is itself a QT-prolonging fluoroquinolone, and case reports describe marked QTc prolongation when combined with SSRIs, with torsades de pointes reported in the presence of additional risk factors; major cardiology guidance also lists levofloxacin among commonly used QT-prolonging agents, reinforcing caution in this setting [^9e3e6983] [^4bf21e17] [^b87c9ff4] [^1cc7fc29] [^c5825d7d].

> I need to check seizure risk next. Fluoroquinolones can lower the seizure threshold, and levofloxacin labeling lists seizures among adverse reactions; case literature documents levofloxacin-associated seizures even without prior epilepsy, with risk amplified by CNS disease, renal dysfunction, and interacting drugs, so adding levofloxacin to a patient with established seizures is risky unless clearly indicated and monitored [^d923f533] [^99560e04].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose and renal considerations. Standard IV levofloxacin dosing for community-acquired pneumonia is 750 mg daily for 5 days or 500 mg daily for 7–14 days, but dose reduction is required if creatinine clearance is below 50 mL/min; I do not have the patient's renal function here, so assuming normal renal function, the dose may be pharmacologically appropriate, yet that does not mitigate the interaction and proarrhythmic risks in this case [^c5ce0b89] [^9e1ccd6e] [^8c71b39b].

> Let me consider alternatives that avoid these hazards. Beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam are appropriate empiric choices for aspiration pneumonia and do not meaningfully affect CYP2D6, phenytoin levels, or the QT interval; if anaerobic coverage is desired, adding metronidazole or using ampicillin-sulbactam monotherapy is reasonable, and this approach aligns with IDSA guidance for CAP and aspiration syndromes while avoiding QT-prolonging fluoroquinolones in a high-risk patient [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the team insists on a fluoroquinolone? I should double-check relative QT risk. Among fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin has the lowest QT risk signal, though it still warrants caution with SSRIs; if a fluoroquinolone is absolutely necessary, ciprofloxacin would be preferable to levofloxacin, but even then, I would obtain a baseline ECG, correct electrolytes, and monitor closely, recognizing that avoiding the class altogether is safer in this patient [^587d0947] [^1cc7fc29].

> Next, I should review a practical, safer plan. I will hold levofloxacin, obtain a stat phenytoin level given the fluoxetine interaction, check electrolytes and renal function, and start ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam for aspiration pneumonia; if anaerobes are a concern, I will add metronidazole or use ampicillin-sulbactam alone, and I will reassess antibiotics when cultures return to narrow therapy [^notfound].

> I should confirm monitoring steps if fluoxetine is continued. Given the CYP2D6 inhibition, I will recheck phenytoin levels within 2–3 days and adjust the dose if toxicity is emerging, and I will maintain vigilance for neurotoxicity and arrhythmias; if any QT-prolonging agent is ultimately used, I will obtain a baseline and follow-up ECG and correct potassium and magnesium before initiation [^9e3e6983] [^1cc7fc29].

> In summary, I need to ensure we do not compound risks. The combination of fluoxetine and levofloxacin creates a high-risk pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic milieu for phenytoin toxicity and QT prolongation, and adding a fluoroquinolone in a patient with a seizure disorder further threatens seizure control; therefore, I recommend avoiding levofloxacin here and using a beta-lactam–based regimen with appropriate monitoring and follow-up labs [^57d2160e] [^9e3e6983] [^d923f533] [^4fa57258].

---

Do not use **IV levofloxacin** in this patient because of the **high risk of QT prolongation** from combining fluoxetine and levofloxacin [^9e3e6983] [^1cc7fc29], and the **potential for reduced seizure threshold** with fluoroquinolones in patients with seizure disorders [^99560e04] [^d923f533]. Use **alternative antibiotics** such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam, and monitor the ECG and electrolytes if fluoroquinolones are unavoidable [^1cc7fc29].

---

## Pharmacological concerns with levofloxacin in this patient

### Drug interaction: fluoxetine and levofloxacin

- **QT prolongation risk**: Fluoxetine prolongs the QT interval [^9e3e6983]; levofloxacin also prolongs the QT interval [^1cc7fc29], and their combination increases the risk of torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmias [^4bf21e17].

- **Clinical evidence**: Case reports describe significant QT prolongation and torsades de pointes with fluoxetine plus levofloxacin, particularly with additional risk factors (e.g. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, advanced age) [^4bf21e17] [^b87c9ff4].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The AHA/ACC/HRS guideline lists levofloxacin among QT-prolonging drugs and advises caution with concomitant QT-prolonging agents [^1cc7fc29] [^c5825d7d].

---

### Seizure threshold considerations

- **Seizure risk**: Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, can lower the seizure threshold, posing a risk in patients with seizure disorders [^99560e04] [^d923f533].

- **Clinical evidence**: Seizures have been reported with levofloxacin, even in patients without prior seizure history, and risk is higher with CNS disorders or interacting drugs [^99560e04].

- **Patient-specific risk**: This patient has a documented seizure disorder, further increasing susceptibility to fluoroquinolone-induced seizures.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert opinion **advise against routine use of fluoroquinolones** in patients with seizure disorders or when combined with QT-prolonging agents such as fluoxetine. The AHA/ACC/HRS guideline emphasizes **avoiding QT-prolonging combinations**, and IDSA guidance recommends **alternative agents** when QT risk or seizure risk is present.

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Given the risks, **consider the following alternatives**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | - Broad-spectrum coverage for aspiration pneumonia <br/> - No significant QT prolongation or seizure risk |
| Ampicillin-sulbactam | - Effective for aspiration pneumonia <br/> - No significant QT prolongation or seizure risk |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Broad-spectrum coverage <br/> - No significant QT prolongation or seizure risk |

---

## Monitoring and precautions if levofloxacin is deemed necessary

If no suitable alternatives exist and levofloxacin must be used, **take the following precautions**:

- **Baseline ECG**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG to assess baseline QTc [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Check and correct potassium and magnesium before and during therapy [^894a001b].

- **Cardiac monitoring**: Use continuous cardiac monitoring during administration [^notfound].

- **Seizure precautions**: Monitor closely for seizure activity and be prepared to manage seizures [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's seizure disorder and concomitant fluoxetine, **IV levofloxacin is contraindicated** due to the high risk of QT prolongation and lowered seizure threshold. Use alternative antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin-sulbactam, and if levofloxacin is absolutely necessary, implement strict ECG and electrolyte monitoring with seizure precautions.

### QTc prolongation associated with combination therapy of levofloxacin, imipramine, and fluoxetine [^4bf21e17]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report QTc interval prolongation associated with combination therapy including levofloxacin, imipramine, and fluoxetine.

Case Summary

A 49-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with fever, aches, and pains for the past 3 days. She was diagnosed and treated for pyelonephritis in the hospital. Therapy included intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg every 24 hours and ceftriaxone 2 g every 24 hours, along with her medications upon admission, including imipramine 50 mg at bedtime and fluoxetine 10 mg/day. She was discharged after 5 days and returned the next day with chest tightness and shortness of breath. Upon the second admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a QTc interval of 509 msec. Levofloxacin was discontinued and the QTc interval fell to 403 msec. The patient was discharged 3 days later and instructed to consult with her primary care physician about discontinuing imipramine.

Discussion

This adverse drug reaction is thought to be a pharmacodynamic additive effect among fluoxetine, imipramine, and levofloxacin. Fluoxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, and imipramine is metabolized by CYP2D6. Therefore, fluoxetine is able to increase the plasma concentrations of imipramine, leading to QT interval prolongation. Taken with imipramine, levofloxacin can lead to even greater prolongation of the QT interval. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, levofloxacin was possibly associated with cardiac arrhythmias in our patient.

Conclusions

The use of levofloxacin alone, or more often in concomitant therapy with other medications that are known to prolong the QT interval, may cause QT interval prolongation; however, additional studies/case reports are needed to validate this conclusion.

5.11 QT Prolongation

Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol,); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Consider ECG assessment and periodic ECG monitoring if initiating treatment with fluoxetine in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Consider discontinuing fluoxetine and obtaining a cardiac evaluation if patients develop signs or symptoms consistent with ventricular arrhythmia.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, 400 mg [^149974bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 QT Prolongation

Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin hydrochloride the mean (± SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (± 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (± 22) on Day 1 (n = 667) and 7 msec (± 24) on Day 3 (n = 667).

Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations:

- Known prolongation of the QT interval

- Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions

- Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia,

- Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia

- Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents

- Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants

Elderly patients using intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)].

In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded.

In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed.

7.2 Warfarin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S-warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13); Adverse Reactions (6.2); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.4 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Seizures associated with fluoroquinolones [^99560e04]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report two cases of seizures following administration of levofoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

Case Summary

A 75-year-old white woman admitted to the hospital was prescribed levofloxacin for ischemic toes. After receiving three doses of oral levofloxacin, the patient experienced a seizure. One month later, the patient was rechallenged with ciprofloxacin and again experienced a seizure. The patient was hypomagnesemic and had elevated serum creatinine at the time of both seizures, and was hyponatremic during the second seizure. A 74-year-old white woman admitted to the hospital was prescribed levofloxacin for bacterial pneumonia. After five doses, the patient experienced a seizure. The woman had no electrolyte imbalances at the time of the seizure and no history of a seizure disorder.

Discussion

Quinolone antibiotics vary in their ability to induce seizures, with trovafloxacin having the greatest potential and levofloxacin possibly having the least potential. Neither patient had a history of a previous seizure disorder. Electrolyte imbalances are common with previous reports of fluoroquinolone-induced seizures.

Conclusions

Although levofloxacin monotherapy has not been implicated in inducing seizures, it appears to be the causative agent in the second case. In the first case, the quinolones may have been a necessary, but not sufficient, cause in a patient with electrolyte abnormalities. Risk factors for fluoroquinolone-induced seizures may Include seizure history, electrolyte imbalances, dose unadjusted for renal insufficiency, and concomitant treatment with agents that lower the seizure threshold.

7.5 Theophylline

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for theophylline was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of theophylline on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, concomitant administration of other fluoroquinolones with theophylline has resulted in prolonged elimination half-life, elevated serum theophylline levels, and a subsequent increase in the risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions in the patient population. Therefore, theophylline levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made when levofloxacin is co-administered. Adverse reactions, including seizures, may occur with or without an elevation in serum theophylline levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

7.6 Cyclosporine

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for cyclosporine was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. However, elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported in the patient population when co-administered with some other fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin Cmaxand kewere slightly lower while Tmaxand t½were slightly longer in the presence of cyclosporine than those observed in other studies without concomitant medication. The differences, however, are not considered to be clinically significant. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required for levofloxacin or cyclosporine when administered concomitantly.

7.7 Digoxin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for digoxin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Levofloxacin absorption and disposition kinetics were similar in the presence or absence of digoxin. Therefore, no dosage adjustment for levofloxacin or digoxin is required when administered concomitantly.

7.8 Probenecid and Cimetidine

No significant effect of probenecid or cimetidine on the Cmaxof levofloxacin was observed in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. The AUC and t1/2of levofloxacin were higher while CL/F and CLRwere lower during concomitant treatment of levofloxacin with probenecid or cimetidine compared to levofloxacin alone. However, these changes do not warrant dosage adjustment for levofloxacin when probenecid or cimetidine is co-administered.

7.9 Interactions with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing

Some fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, may produce false-positive urine screening results for opiates using commercially available immunoassay kits. Confirmation of positive opiate screens by more specific methods may be necessary.

7.1 Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins

While the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of levofloxacin tablets with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamins preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacinadministration.

7.2 Warfarin

No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the post-marketing experience in patients that levofloxacinenhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

7.4 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^587d0947]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Additional risks/considerations — Clostridium difficile–associated disease and cardiotoxicity are highlighted. The incidence of C difficile–associated disease in children continues to increase across the United States, and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases notes that exposure to antimicrobial therapy is among the risks; current data suggest that clindamycin, oral cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolone-class antibiotics are associated with an increased risk of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired C difficile–associated disease. Cardiotoxicity relates to QT interval prolongation via the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) expressed by hERG. Moxifloxacin has the greatest risk to prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in patients with long QT syndrome, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, organic heart disease including congestive heart failure, those receiving an antiarrhythmic agent from class Ia or class III, those receiving a concurrent drug that prolongs the QT interval independently, and those with hepatic insufficiency–related metabolic derangements. Levofloxacin also appears to prolong the QT interval, although at a lower risk than moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin appears to confer the lowest risk, and no cases of cardiotoxicity or torsades de pointes in children associated with fluoroquinolones have been reported to date.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Levofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The mean ± SD pharmacokinetic parameters of levofloxacin determined under single and steady-state conditions following administration of the oral tablets, are summarized in Table 8.

Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Steady-state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once-daily dosage regimen. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 ± 1.4 and 0.5 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 8.6 ± 1.9 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily IV regimens were approximately 6.4 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 ± 4.1 and 1.3 ± 0.71 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively.

Absorption

Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ± 1.0 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ± 4.0 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food.

Emergency department phenytoin loading route — comparative considerations: In the nonemergency situation it is possible to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations after an oral loading dose; however, the time to reach therapeutic levels after oral loading is much longer than after IV loading; not possible to comment on the efficacy of oral compared with IV loading for preventing seizures since rate of seizure recurrence in the studies is low, and prevention of further seizures was not used as an outcome measure; there is no consensus if oral loading is best achieved with a single dose or in divided doses; low-quality studies suggest that IV loading may be associated with more frequent or severe adverse effects, which may depend on dose, concentration, and rate of administration.

### Torsades de pointes associated with fluoroquinolones: importance of concomitant risk factors [^b87c9ff4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

The fluoroquinolone antibiotics sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin have been reported to cause torsades de pointes. Pre-existing risk factors increase vulnerability to this life-threatening arrhythmia. In a 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and osteomyelitis, QTc interval prolongation (605 ms) and torsades de pointes developed after the initiation of levofloxacin, 250 mg intravenously once daily. The patient was hypokalemic and mildly hypomagnesemic before the initiation of levofloxacin and at the time of occurrence of torsades de pointes. The QTc interval decreased to 399 ms within hours of discontinuation of the levofloxacin, after which she had no further arrhythmias. In this and the majority of other published cases of fluoroquinolone-associated torsades de pointes, patients had at least 1 risk factor for the arrhythmia, and most had multiple risk factors. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be avoided whenever possible in patients with pre-existing risk factors for torsades de pointes.

2.1 Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function

The usual dose of levofloxacin injection is 250 mg or 500 mg administered by slow infusion over 60 minutes every 24 hours or 750 mg administered by slow infusion over 90 minutes every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1.

These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min, adjustments to the dosing regimen are required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

The dosage in pediatric patients ≥ 6 months of age is described below in Table 2.

*Due to Bacillus anthracis [see Indications and Usage (1.13)] and Yersinia pestis [see Indications and Usage (1.14)].

†Sequential therapy (intravenous to oral) may be instituted at the discretion of the physician.

‡Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis. This indication is based on a surrogate endpoint. Levofloxacin plasma concentrations achieved in humans are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]

§The safety of levofloxacin in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.9)]. Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk.

¶Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Yersinia pestis.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Adults with Renal Impairment

Administer levofloxacin injection with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced.

No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.

In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.

SAFETY AND PHARMACOLOGY

Fluoroquinolones have a long history of adverse effects with several of them being considered as class-related such as tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. As a result, all fluoroquinolones approved in the United States (including delafloxacin) carry a general boxed warning about these effects (significant decreases in blood sugar and certain mental health side effects have been added recently or will be soon). Both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are also concerned with rare but severe and permanent or long-lasting serious side effects (see, which led to the FDA statement that risks of fluoroquinolones may outweigh benefits for patients with mild infections such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Likewise, the EMA may reduce the indications of fluoroquinolones to "severe infections when other antibiotics cannot be used". Most of these class-related adverse effects and/or permanent effects were uncommon in the safety data bases of registration and post-marketing studies undertaken by or under the control of Industry (see, for example, the safety profile of moxifloxacin as compiled from such studies involving about 15 000 patients). The observation period in these studies is limited and they usually exclude patients with known risk factors. In this context, although the FDA label mentions that peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system effects have been observed with delafloxacin (also hypersensitivity, and Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea), these were not specifically observed or reported more frequently in the delafloxacin arm than in the comparator arm in the clinical trials published to date. The current developer of delafloxacin undertook a series of studies aimed at examining specific fluoroquinolone-related side effects. In this context, cardiac safety was examined in clinical models that showed that neither a therapeutic (300 mg administered by IV) nor a supratherapeutic (900 mg IV) dose of delafloxacin was associated with clinically meaningful disturbances in cardiac repolarization (as measured by the corrected QT [QTc] interval) under conditions in which moxifloxacin, used as comparator, gave an unambiguous signal demonstrwating that the study was adequately sensitive to assess QTc prolongation. Also, no relationship was reported between plasma concentrations and the placebo-corrected change from pre-dose baseline in the QTc (ΔΔQTcF). Because of concern about photosensitivity, commonly associated with a halogen substituent in position C8 (see for review), a study of the photosensitizing potential of delafloxacin to ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) and visible radiation was conducted in 52 healthy volunteers. Neither delafloxacin given for 7 days at 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day (0.22 and 0.44 times the approved recommended daily oral dosage, respectively, nor placebo demonstrated clinically significant phototoxic potential at any wavelengths tested (295 to 430 nm), including solar simulation. The active comparator (lomefloxacin, which possesses a fluorine substituent in C8) demonstrated a moderate degree of phototoxicity at UVA 335 nm and 365 nm and solar simulation wavelengths. Finally, significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely, which is a consideration when choosing non-fluoroquinolone alternatives such as macrolides.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^564a1bf9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### Parenteral to oral conversion of fluoroquinolones: low-hanging fruit for antimicrobial stewardship programs? [^2476d6ab]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate avoidable intravenous (IV) fluoroquinolone use in Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals.

Design

A retrospective analysis of bar code medication administration (BCMA) data.

Setting

Acute care wards of 128 VA hospitals throughout the United States.

Methods

Data were analyzed for all medications administered on acute care wards between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Patient-days receiving therapy were expressed as fluoroquinolone-days (FD) and divided into intravenous (IV; all doses administered intravenously) and oral (PO; at least one dose administered per os) FD. We assumed IV fluoroquinolone use to be potentially avoidable on a given IV FD when there was at least 1 other medication administered via the enteral route.

Results

Over the entire study period, 884,740 IV and 830,572 PO FD were administered. Overall, avoidable IV fluoroquinolone use accounted for 46.8% of all FD and 90.9% of IV FD. Excluding the first 2 days of all IV fluoroquinolone courses and limiting the analysis to the non-ICU setting yielded more conservative estimates of avoidable IV use: 20.9% of all FD and 45.9% of IV FD. Avoidable IV use was more common for levofloxacin and more frequent in the ICU setting. There was a moderate correlation between avoidable IV FD and total systemic antibiotic use (r = 0.32).

Conclusions

Unnecessary IV fluoroquinolone use seems to be common in the VA system, but important variations exist between facilities. Antibiotic stewardship programs could focus on this patient safety issue as a "low-hanging fruit" to increase awareness of appropriate antibiotic use.

TABLE 3
Treatment of patients of all ages and pregnant women with plague meningitis

Abbreviations: IV = intravenous; PO = per os.

Note: All oral antimicrobials recommended in these guidelines can be administered via alternative enteral routes (e.g. nasogastric tube and gastric tube) except for ciprofloxacin.

*Antimicrobials are not listed in order of preference within each category.

† Dual therapy with chloramphenicol plus moxifloxacin or levofloxacin should be used for initial treatment of patients with plague who present with symptoms of meningitis. If chloramphenicol is not available, a nonfluoroquinolone first-line or alternative antimicrobial for treatment of septicemic plague can be substituted (Table 1). Recommended treatment duration is 10–14 days.

§ For patients with secondary plague meningitis, chloramphenicol should be added to the patient's existing antimicrobial treatment regimen for plague. If chloramphenicol is not available, or clinicians would prefer to avoid using this drug in young children because of potential adverse effects, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin can be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen instead. After chloramphenicol, moxifloxacin, or levofloxacin have been added, the entire regimen of antimicrobials the patient is receiving for plague should be continued for an additional 10 days.

¶ Not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of plague. Chloramphenicol has been used off label for the treatment of naturally occurring plague. Large-scale distribution and use of these antimicrobials during a bioterrorism response might be under FDA-issued Emergency Use Authorization.

 At the time of publication, these antimicrobials might not be readily and consistently available in the United States because of limited production.

†† After clinical improvement, chloramphenicol can be reduced to a lower dose of 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours in adults and given orally. Serum concentration monitoring should be performed when available, especially in children (Source: Tunkel AR, Hartman BJ, Kaplan SL, et al. Practice guidelines for bacterial meningitis. Clin Infect Dis 2004;39:1267–84).

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^bf1c30f1]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Linezolid in monotherapy is an alternative agent. In animal models, the success rate of monotherapy appears inferior to a combination of rifampicin and linezolid. The combination therapy results in 75%–95% clearance of planktonic MRSA and a cure rate of 50%–60% with implants. Rifampicin however may reduce the levels of linezolid and may lead to subinhibitory concentrations. Further studies are needed regarding combination therapy with rifampicin and linezolid. If this regimen is used, it is important to check lactate and full blood counts weekly, as linezolid can cause severe reversible pancytopenia, lactate acidosis, and irreversible neurotoxicity.‬‬‬ It also interacts adversely with many psychiatric drugs risking hypertensive crises and serotonin syndrome (serotonin uptake inhibitors).

Monotherapy with fluoroquinolones is not recommended for staphylococcal infections because of the rapid emergence of resistance and high treatment failure rate. Moxifloxacin has a lower MIC for staphylococci than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In addition, it has the advantage that no dose adjustment is necessary in case of renal insufficiency. Studies have shown that moxifloxacin has a lower risk of emergence of antimicrobial resistance than other fluoroquinolones.– In addition, studies on tuberculosis have shown a lowering of moxifloxacin serum levels by 30% when used in combination with rifampicin. Wouthuyzen-Bakker et alobserved a success rate of 89% using a moxifloxacin/rifampicin combination in patients with early acute PJI caused by MSSA. More studies are necessary before recommending moxifloxacin/rifampicin as the preferred first-line per oral therapy.

The use of clindamycin in combination with rifampicin as an oral alternative is controversial. Bernard et al showed a dramatic reduction of clindamycin serum concentration when used in combination with rifampicin. Rifampicin is a potent cytochrome P450 inducer, while clindamycin is metabolized through CYP3A4, a member of this cytochrome P450 system and one of the main enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs. This interaction enhances the elimination of clindamycin in combination with rifampicin. However, since clindamycin can be given at a high dose (600–900 mg every 6–8 hours), therapy with this antibiotic may be sufficient.

### From repurposing to refinement: optimizing levofloxacin for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^53552e3e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This is a well-designed and carefully conducted study, but the authors' conclusion merits further consideration. First, the authors provide no evidence that the 750-mg regimen was inferior to the 1,000-mg regimen in any of the evaluated parameters, including time to culture conversion, MIC, ratio of AUC to MIC, and adverse events. Therefore, it would be more reasonable to conclude that a 750-mg dose remains a viable option, at least for lean patients.

Second, it is worth noting that QT interval prolongation (Fridericia-corrected QT interval > 450 ms) was more common among patients in the higher dose group in this study. As the authors acknowledge as a limitation, the drugs used alongside levofloxacin in their study are not those currently prioritized for MDR TB treatment. When combined with newer anti-TB drugs, QT interval prolongation could be more pronounced, as both bedaquiline and delamanid can also prolong the QT interval. Considering these factors, the study's findings supporting the use of a lower dose should be given greater significance.

In conclusion, the authors have conducted a well-designed study to determine the optimal dose of levofloxacin as an anti-TB drug. The study delivers a clear and straightforward message: for MDR TB treatment, a daily dose exceeding 1,000 mg of levofloxacin provides no additional benefit in terms of efficacy while increasing the risk of adverse effects. Levofloxacin, repurposed for MDR TB treatment, has now been refined for optimal dosing.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^4219b0f6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that doses of levofloxacin > 1,000 mg/d do not reduce time to culture conversion but do result in an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 AEs, with higher exposures also associated with slightly more QTcF prolongation. In our study, a dose of 750 mg was adequate to achieve the target AUC/MIC of 100. However, because there was no detectable difference in toxicity between doses of 750 mg/d and 1,000 mg/d and there is wide variability of AUCs achieved with oral levofloxacin, we conclude that a dose of 1,000 mg/d will most reliably achieve target levels without incurring unnecessary toxicity.

### Results from the IQ-CSRC prospective study support replacement of the thorough QT study by QT assessment in the early clinical phase [^467ad3c3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

The QT effects of five "QT-positive" and one negative drug were tested to evaluate whether exposure-response analysis can detect QT effects in a small study with healthy subjects. Each drug was given to nine subjects (six for placebo) in two dose levels; positive drugs were chosen to cause 10 to 12 ms and 15 to 20 ms QTcF prolongation. The slope of the concentration/ΔQTc effect was significantly positive for ondansetron, quinine, dolasetron, moxifloxacin, and dofetilide. For the lower dose, an effect above 10 ms could not be excluded, i.e., the upper bound of the confidence interval for the predicted mean ΔΔQTcF effect was above 10 ms. For the negative drug, levocetirizine, a ΔΔQTcF effect above 10 ms was excluded at 6-fold the therapeutic dose. The study provides evidence that robust QT assessment in early-phase clinical studies can replace the thorough QT study.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized patients with HIV — non-severe disease — has a recommendation that remains to administer either a beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting, and preferred agents are specified (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; azithromycin or clarithromycin; moxifloxacin or levofloxacin). If a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam, and IV penicillin is an acceptable option for treatment of pneumococcal disease in patients with HIV (BIII). In patients who are allergic to penicillin, an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) alone should be used (AI), and fluoroquinolone monotherapy should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy.

### Amiodarone hci [^1bf525c4]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Proarrhythmia

Like all antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone HCl injection may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation by amiodarone HCl injection of the QTc interval to 500 ms or greater. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving amiodarone HCl injection, torsade de pointes or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Patients should be monitored for QTc prolongation during infusion with amiodarone HCl injection. Combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapy that prolongs the QTc should be reserved for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent.

Fluoroquinolones, macrolide antibiotics, and azoles are known to cause QTc prolongation. There have been reports of QTc prolongation, with or without TdP, in patients taking amiodarone when fluoroquinolones, macrolide antibiotics, or azoles were administered concomitantly (see Drug Interactions, Other reported interactions with amiodarone).

The need to coadminister amiodarone with any other drug known to prolong the QTc interval must be based on a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits of doing so for each patient.

### Efficacy and safety of higher doses of levofloxacin for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial [^a42e9553]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Culture conversion was high and treatment failure rare, and therefore our study results are not inconsistent with the observation that a levofloxacin AUC during the most recent 24-hour dosing interval (AUC 0–24)/MIC of > 100 can be expected to be associated with a successful outcome of MDR-TB treatment with a levofloxacin-containing regimen. Notably, all patients receiving levofloxacin at any of the doses in our study were able to achieve this target when the MIC was ≤ 1.0 μg/ml (the usual range in M. tuberculosis isolates susceptible to levofloxacin). This is in contradiction to the report of Ghimire and coworkers, who concluded that doses of 1,000 mg/d did not consistently achieve this target. The fact that all of our study participants had an AUC 0–24 /MIC above this threshold indicates that an AUC 0–24 /MIC of > 100 was above the inflection point on the activity/concentration curve; this in turn implies that further increases in AUC may not offer additional clinical benefit in the range of MICs that are encountered with susceptible M. tuberculosis isolates. Had we included lower doses of levofloxacin in our study, we might have observed this inflection, but we truncated our dose range so that no participants received less than the recommended adult dose of ≥ 750 mg of levofloxacin for the treatment of TB.

We found a minimal increase in QTcF interval prolongation with higher exposures to levofloxacin: a ΔQTcF of 6.9 ms (95% CI, −4.0 to 17.9 ms) at 16 weeks between the lower and upper tertiles of AUC. This effect is less pronounced than with moxifloxacin, another member of the fluoroquinolone class. Formal QT prolongation studies have revealed substantial QT prolongation with moxifloxacin at 400 mg/d but none with levofloxacin at doses as high as 1,500 mg/d. This represents one of the advantages of levofloxacin, a safe, tolerable drug that can be safely used in combination with anti-TB agents that have QT-prolonging effects. Bedaquiline, one such drug, is part of every current WHO-recommended regimen for the treatment of MDR/rifampicin-resistant TB. Although a growing body of literature shows that bedaquiline-linked QT interval prolongations are rarely clinically important, even when bedaquiline is used in combination with delamanid, it will still be beneficial to patients and TB programs to minimize the additive cardiac toxicity risk conferred by companion drugs.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^bc507247]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage of Levofloxacin Tablets in Adult Patients with Creatinine Clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute

The usual dose of levofloxacin tablets is 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg administered orally every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1.

These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute. For patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min, adjustments to the dosing regimen are required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.2 Dosage of Levofloxacin Tablets in Pediatric Patients with Inhalational Anthrax or Plague

The dosage of levofloxacin tablets for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) and plague in pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater is described below in Table 2. Levofloxacin tablets cannot be administered to patients who weigh less than 30 kg because of the limitations of the available strength. Alternative formulations of levofloxacin may be considered for pediatric patients who weigh less than 30 kg.

2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Adults with Renal Impairment

Administer levofloxacin tabletswith caution in patients with renal impairment. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced in these patients.

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/minute.

Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.

2.4 Drug Interaction with Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins

Levofloxacin tablets should be administered at least two hours before or two hours after antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine chewable/buffered tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

2.5 Important Administration Instructions

Levofloxacin tablets can be administered without regard to food.

If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 8 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 8 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose.

QT prolongation.

Although initial publications suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease when compared with TCAs, many of the newer antidepressants are not exempt from the onset of heart disease. In a comprehensive review that analyzed the antidepressant-induced QT prolongation in people with psychiatric disorders, the authors found an increased mortality odds ratio of 2.11 with high doses of TCA and 2.78 in SSRI users compared with controls matching for age and sex.

The QT interval is the period between the onset of a Q wave and the end of a T wave on the electrocardiogram (EKG). By contrast, the corrected QT interval (QTc) refers to the QT after adjustment to baseline heart rate. An increased QT interval can be associated with a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as Torsade de Pointes. The risk of QT prolongation should be considered during the use of TCAs and in patients when using SSRIs. A meta-analysis found that among SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the agent most significantly associated with QTc prolongation.

A clinically consistent association with cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias has not been identified with the SNRIs. However, venlafaxine (in doses over 200 mg daily) and duloxetine have been associated with increases in diastolic blood pressure.

Although the risk of cardiovascular disease is not high in central neuromodulator users, they should be prescribed in the lowest doses required to be effective. An EKG should be considered to evaluate for QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias and must be done in the elderly population and patients with heart disease or concomitant treatment with drugs known to cause prolongation of the QTc interval. Examples include antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil, and diltiazem. In addition, noncardiovascular drugs such as ondansetron, macrolide, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and first-generation antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol, thioridazine, and sertindole should be considered. If the EKG confirms QT prolongation, stop the high-risk medication and restart treatment at a lower dose after a cardiac consult and then repeat the EKG.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride (Symbyax) [^57d2160e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam.

When concurrently administered with fluoxetine, the half-life of diazepam may be prolonged in some patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels.

Clozapine — Elevation of blood levels of clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.

Haloperidol — Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.

Phenytoin — Patients on stable doses of phenytoin have developed elevated plasma levels of phenytoin with clinical phenytoin toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine.

Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 — In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP2D6. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by this enzyme.

Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6 and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g. TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for a decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (including but not limited to, flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs).

### Interactions of the protease inhibitor, ritonavir, with common anesthesia drugs [^001e8bc2]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

5 OTHER IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILDREN

Children who present for anesthesia are often taking medications for concomitant pathology. The CYP 3A enzyme system is ubiquitous. Rifampicin, a potent CYP 3A inducer, decreased clearance of ritonavir by 35%. Carbamazepine is another strong inducer of CYP 3A enzyme activity. The implications of using ritonavir short‐term with a child taking long‐term carbamazepine, or other drugs that induce the CYP 3A (dexamethasone, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, rifampicin) are speculative. It could lead to both a risk of toxicity from an increased concentration of the anticonvulsant as well as a potential loss of virological response because of a competitive interaction. Phenytoin dose may require an increase in the presence of ritonavir, possibly attributable to CYP 2C9 inhibition.

Antibiotic (rifambutin, clarithromycin) and antifungal (ketoconazole) concentrations are increased in the presence of ritonavir, but ritonavir itself may be minimally affected by other CYP 3A inhibitors (e.g. efavirenz, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, fluoxetine) because of its high CYP 3A4 receptor affinity relative to these other drugs.

Drugs that are metabolized by CYP 1A2 (e.g. theophylline) or UGT (zidovudine, sulfamethoxazole) have minimal clinical effect from co‐administration of ritonavir because are they weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (minimal impact on ritonavir) and alternative clearance pathways are available for these drugs so reduction in drug exposure is not large. Use of some antiarrhythmics (flecainide, verapamil, quinidine, nifedipine) should be extremely cautious. Amiodarone, a drug that is known to be metabolized by CYP 3A has large volumes of distribution and low clearance, suggesting minimal impact from a 5‐day course of ritonavir for COVID‐19 on acute use of amiodarone.

### The use of an IV to PO clinical intervention form to improve antibiotic administration in a community based hospital [^7b1a8154]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobials are among the most commonly prescribed medications in acute care settings, with 50% of antimicrobial use deemed inappropriate. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) aim to optimize antibiotic use in order to improve patient clinical outcomes while minimizing unwanted effects of therapy including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the emergence of resistant organisms. Antimicrobial Stewardship involves a coordinated set of interventions that ensure patients who require antimicrobial therapy receive the most appropriate agent at the correct dose, by the correct route for the correct duration. This project focused on the appropriate conversion from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) antibiotics. The purpose of the project was to determine whether antibiotic prescribing patterns improved following the implementation of an IV to PO conversion clinical intervention form. A collaborative approach was used by an interprofessional team to review medical records and design a clinical intervention form that adheres to evidence-based guidelines to promote appropriate conversion for patients on intravenous antibiotics. Education efforts were made to inform health system staff about the goal of the intervention and to gather feedback for the improvement of the clinical intervention form. A five-week pilot intervention period trial was carried out with a specific focus on the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, specifically ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Data from the intervention phase, including overall antibiotic use, ratio of intravenous:oral antibiotic time and compliance with the clinical intervention form were assessed. The ratio of intravenous to oral fluoroquinolone use changed from 39.4% IV: 60.6% PO before the intervention, to 34.7% IV: 65.3% PO during the intervention, indicating an overall increase in the usage of oral fluoroquinolones during the intervention phase. In patients eligible to receive the clinical intervention form, physician compliance with the form was 50%. IV duration decreased by 42% in patients with physician compliance. Further refinement of this form and the process for implementation will further enhance the conversion of intravenous to oral therapy. Based on these findings and the lessons learned, this process will be considered for further refinements, spread, and sustainability.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^7adde50b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterial infections — activity, treatment duration, and safety are summarized as follows: Fluoroquinolones are active in vitro against mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and many nontuberculous mycobacteria, and prevailing evidence supports their use in children with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; however, regimens that include 1 to 2 years of fluoroquinolone for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis have not been prospectively studied in children. Extended administration in adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis has not shown serious adverse effects and there is no evidence to date suggesting differences in children, but an adult liver transplant series using levofloxacin reported tenosynovitis in 18% and noted additional risk factors for poor wound healing, including patients older than 60 years, corticosteroid use, and kidney, heart, or lung transplants.

### Special considerations for prophylaxis for and treatment of anthrax in pregnant and postpartum women [^222b16a7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Intravenous antimicrobial treatment for systemic anthrax with possible/confirmed meningitis — nonpregnant adults are treated with a bactericidal fluoroquinolone PLUS a bactericidal β-lactam PLUS a protein synthesis inhibitor, with these dosing options: ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8H OR levofloxacin 750 mg every 24H OR moxifloxacin 400 mg every 24H; for the β-lactam, for all strains or if susceptibility is unknown, meropenem 2 g every 8H OR imipenem† 1 g every 6H OR doripenem 500 mg every 8H, and for penicillin-susceptible strains, penicillin G 4 million units every 4H OR ampicillin 3 g every 6H; protein synthesis inhibitor options are linezolid‡ 600 mg every 12H OR clindamycin 900 mg every 8H OR rifampin§ 600 mg every 12H OR chloramphenicol¶ 1 g every 6–8 H. In pregnancy, ciprofloxacin is preferred, and at least one antibiotic with transplacental passage is recommended; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, meropenem, ampicillin, penicillin, clindamycin, rifampin. Duration of treatment is for 2–3 weeks until clinical criteria for stability are met, and patients exposed to aerosolized spores will require prophylaxis to complete an antimicrobial drug course of 60 d from onset of illness; for pregnant women, there is No change in duration. Safety notes include increased risk of seizures associated with imipenem/cilastatin treatment; linezolid should be used with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia, as it may exacerbate it, and linezolid use for > 14 d carries additional risk for Hematopoietic toxicity; rifampin is not a protein synthesis inhibitor but may be used in combination with other antimicrobials based on its in vitro synergy; chloramphenicol should be used only if other options are not available, due to toxicity concerns.

### Prescription and dispensation of QT-Prolonging medications in individuals receiving hemodialysis [^c6252475]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, the findings suggest that Medicare beneficiaries aged 60 years or older who have hemodialysis-dependent kidney failure were commonly prescribed QT-prolonging medications with known TdP risk by nonnephrology clinicians and that such prescriptions often originated from nonacute care settings. The findings also suggest that up to one-third of new-use prescriptions for the most commonly prescribed QT-prolonging medications were filled in the setting of concomitant use of a potentially interacting medication and that prescriptions for the medications with potential for interaction often originated from different prescribers.

Existing data demonstrate that individuals with dialysis-dependent kidney failure are prescribed QT-prolonging medications at higher rates than people without kidney failure and that patients receiving dialysis who have risk factors for drug-induced QT prolongation (ie, female sex, advanced age, comorbid heart failure, and concurrent use of ≥ 1 QT-prolonging medication) are exposed to medications with known TdP risk more often than individuals without such risk factors. Moreover, comparative safety studies of some QT-prolonging medications with known TdP risk (eg, citalopram, escitalopram, and levofloxacin) show that, compared with use of clinically relevant comparator medications, use of QT-prolonging medications with known TdP risk is associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death, a potential drug-related complication. Furthermore, prior studies have shown elevated sudden cardiac death risk when patients are prescribed QT-prolonging drugs in the setting of concomitant use of drugs with potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction. Together with our findings, these data underscore the importance of identifying strategies to mitigate unsafe medication-prescribing practices for people receiving hemodialysis.

### Centers for disease control and prevention expert panel meetings on prevention and treatment of anthrax in adults [2014] [^11dd7a3b]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Anthrax systemic disease — fluoroquinolone bactericidal component: intravenous ciprofloxacin is preferred as the primary bactericidal component, with levofloxacin and moxifloxacin considered equivalent alternatives; the fluoroquinolones have adequate central nervous system (CNS) penetration and there are no reports of natural resistance.
