## Question

Cause of chyle leak

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of chyle leak. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and core pathophysiology. Then, I should separate traumatic (especially iatrogenic) from non-traumatic etiologies. Next, I will detail high-risk operations and intraoperative risk factors, followed by non-traumatic causes such as malignancy and congenital/inflammatory diseases. After that, I should review predisposing and modulating factors, and address mimics and special considerations. Finally, I will synthesize an actionable hierarchical framework that clinicians can apply at the bedside while cross-checking key references along the way [^114ZWt51] [^115LZRJ7].

> Let me first confirm the definition and basic pathophysiology. Chyle leak is typically defined (post-pancreatic surgery by ISGPS, but broadly applicable in practice) as milky output from drains, wounds, or drain sites on/after postoperative day 3 with triglycerides ≥ 110 mg/dL (≥ 1.2 mmol/L), reflecting extravasation of intestinal lymph (chyle) due to disruption or obstruction of lymphatics, most notably the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct pathways [^1142P9NB] [^112aVrXc]. Hold on, I should verify the anatomic context: the cisterna chyli often lies between L1–L2 and drains to the thoracic duct, which has considerable anatomic variability — this variability increases procedural risk and influences leak patterns [^114ReEMq] [^114ZWt51].

> Next, I need to establish the broad etiological categories. The causes divide into traumatic (including iatrogenic) and non-traumatic groups; iatrogenic injuries during thoracic, abdominal, or head-and-neck surgery are the most frequent in modern practice, whereas non-traumatic causes typically reflect lymphatic obstruction or intrinsic disease (e.g., malignancy, congenital lymphatic anomalies, infections, inflammatory disorders), and a small proportion remain idiopathic [^114ZWt51] [^115LZRJ7]. Wait, let me verify the emphasis: multiple contemporary reviews concur that postsurgical injuries dominate incidence in tertiary surgical centers, reinforcing this framework [^114ZWt51].

> I will now examine traumatic/iatrogenic causes and their mechanisms. Mechanistically, direct injury or transection to the thoracic duct, cisterna chyli, or major tributaries during dissection leads to leaks; classic high-risk procedures include esophagectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), and neck dissections in the level IV basin where thoracic duct tributaries enter the venous confluence [^112aVrXc] [^114NbQGC]. Hmm, wait a minute — what are the reported rates? Esophagectomy series report chylothorax up to 3.9% in reviews, yet large single-center cohorts have reported incidences closer to 5%; this discrepancy likely reflects selection and definitional differences across datasets [^114ZWt51] [^112zaR6r] [^1149v5gP]. For PD, the leak often follows injury near the cisterna chyli or abdominal lymphatic trunks at the pancreatic head/neck region, consistent with the surgical field and lymphatic anatomy [^112aVrXc]. For neck surgery, chyle fistula risk rises with level IV dissection near the IJ–subclavian junction and is more frequent on the left due to the terminal thoracic duct anatomy — let me double-check the laterality in the prospective dataset before concluding [^114BiwHL] [^114ReEMq].

> Hold on, I should verify intraoperative and perioperative risk factors that modulate traumatic risk. Extensive lymphadenectomy increases lymphatic disruption risk in oncologic resections, and venous resection during PD consistently associates with higher odds of chyle leak, plausibly due to wider dissection planes and injury to central lymphatics; arterial resection has not shown the same signal, perhaps due to small numbers in cohorts [^114ZWt51] [^111bSmC9] [^114BBBYt] [^1142P9NB]. I need to check surgical approach: some national datasets signal that open PD correlates with increased leak, but this may reflect selection bias for more advanced disease; randomized and institutional series are conflicting, so I should be cautious about causality here [^114BBBYt]. Aortocaval (station 16b1) lymph node sampling/resection has also emerged as a risk factor in PD cohorts, consistent with proximity to central lymphatics [^1142P9NB] [^11785M4w]. For neck dissections, metastatic disease at the IJ–subclavian junction increases risk about fourfold, reinforcing that bulky nodal disease around terminal duct confluences predisposes to injury [^114BiwHL].

> Now, let me consider non-traumatic causes. Malignant obstruction is the leading non-traumatic etiology; I initially recalled that non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounts for ~50% of non-traumatic chylothoraces — wait, let me verify the reference code from the trace: it listed "e7b3b817", but the available citation is "e7b3c817", which indeed reports malignancy, especially NHL, as a major contributor, consistent with broader summaries [^116vWXXU] [^115LZRJ7]. Congenital/systemic lymphatic disorders such as primary lymphatic maldevelopment and pediatric congenital chylous effusions also present with spontaneous leaks, sometimes life-threatening if not rapidly recognized and treated by multidisciplinary teams [^1176F4Mg]. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis and yellow nail syndrome are classic systemic causes that reflect broader lymphatic pathology, with LAM identifiable by characteristic thin-walled cysts on HRCT [^114djMYP] [^115LZRJ7]. Infectious and inflammatory processes (e.g., tuberculosis, filariasis, pancreatitis, radiation, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) can obstruct or fibrose lymphatics; thoracic duct stenosis and even pregnancy-associated leaks are described, albeit infrequently and often in chyluria literature that still informs lymphatic pathobiology [^111QNM1q] [^115LZRJ7] [^116iji9w]. Finally, blunt thoracoabdominal trauma can rupture the thoracic duct outside the operating room setting and should be kept on the differential after high-energy injury [^116vWXXU] [^117AVjBq].

> Next, I should review predisposing and modulating factors that tip borderline injuries into clinically evident leaks. Obesity appears to predispose to high-output leaks, possibly via tissue fragility and challenging dissections in fatty planes; endocrine neck pathology with extensive level IV dissection and intraoperative chyle identification are additional signals of risk in the head-and-neck literature [^114ZeaGP]. Let me check patient factors outside neck surgery: male sex and age > 45 years associated with leaks after thyroid surgery even without lateral neck dissection, suggesting that host factors and central node counts matter when central compartment dissections are extensive [^114kWmJq]. In pediatric solid tumors, higher neuroblastoma stage correlates with postoperative chyle leak/ascites, consistent with more extensive nodal disease and dissections required [^113QgS7s]. I should also confirm treatment-related factors: early enteral feeding and high long-chain fat intake increase chyle flow and can unmask otherwise occult leaks after PD, whereas MCT-based regimens and dietary restriction are used therapeutically [^112dgrhN] [^111bSmC9]. Finally, variable ductal anatomy is common (normal pattern in only 40–60%), increasing the chance of unanticipated injury during extensive surgery around the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct [^114ReEMq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing mimics and measurement nuances. Propofol infusion lipemia can cause a transient milky appearance of blood and field fluid, mimicking chyle; confirming lipemia on blood sampling avoids mislabeling a chyle leak intraoperatively and prompts evaluation for propofol-related complications like pancreatitis [^115GtHeT]. I should double-check whether appearance alone is sufficient: newer data emphasize that large-volume triglyceride-rich drainage (≥ 300 mL/day) even without a milky appearance carries clinically significant consequences (e.g., prolonged post-op stay), arguing for attention to volume and biochemical confirmation rather than appearance alone [^111FnJE8].

> Let me reconsider one nuance about laterality in neck surgery before I synthesize. The prospective level IV neck dissection series reports 3.0% right and 6.2% left incidence, aligning with expected left-sided predominance due to terminal thoracic duct anatomy; their narrative note stating "especially on the right" appears inconsistent with their own tabulated data, so I will align conclusions with the left-sided predilection supported by the numbers and underlying anatomy [^114BiwHL] [^114ReEMq]. For completeness, rare settings like axillary dissections can cause chyle leaks, with some series noting all cases on the left, again consistent with overall left-sided terminal duct drainage into the subclavian vein [^112Z12uT].

> I will now synthesize a hierarchical, clinically actionable framework. Primary drivers: iatrogenic surgical injuries dominate in practice, especially after esophagectomy, PD, and level IV neck dissections where ductal trunks and tributaries are at risk; risk is magnified by extensive lymphadenectomy and venous resections in PD, and by bulky nodal disease at the venous confluence in the neck [^114ZWt51] [^112zaR6r] [^112aVrXc] [^114BiwHL] [^114BBBYt]. Secondary drivers: in non-surgical contexts, malignant obstruction (notably lymphoma) is most common, followed by congenital lymphatic disorders and infectious/inflammatory conditions that disrupt or scar lymphatic channels [^115LZRJ7] [^116vWXXU] [^1176F4Mg] [^111QNM1q]. Precipitating factors: early enteral feeding or high long-chain fat intake raise chyle flow/pressure, unmasking leaks that might otherwise be subclinical [^112dgrhN] [^111bSmC9]. Contributing factors: anatomic variability, obesity, and treatment effects (e.g., neoadjuvant targeted therapy altering tissue planes) lower the threshold for leakage under surgical stress [^114ReEMq] [^114ZeaGP] [^114B5LR7]. Special cases: non-iatrogenic blunt trauma and perioperative mimics (propofol lipemia) should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis and mismanagement [^117AVjBq] [^115GtHeT]. This synthesis reflects the observed epidemiology and anatomy-driven pathophysiology of "disruption + high flow = clinically evident leak", providing a practical map of causation for bedside and operative decision-making [^114ZWt51] [^111FnJE8].

Chyle leak is most commonly caused by **iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct or its tributaries during surgery** [^114rnw3G], particularly during neck dissection [^114BiwHL], esophagectomy [^115ydqrp], or pancreatic procedures [^114BBBYt]. Other causes include **trauma to the thoracic duct** [^114ZWt51], malignancy (notably lymphoma) [^116fC8xW], and congenital lymphatic anomalies [^1176F4Mg] [^114djMYP]. Risk increases with **extensive lymphadenectomy** [^112aVrXc], **vascular resection** [^114BBBYt], and **open surgical approaches** [^111NF4Kk]. Diagnosis and localization typically rely on **imaging such as lymphangiography** [^116c8GY2], CT, or MRI [^114djMYP].

---

## Anatomical basis of chyle leak

The **thoracic duct** [^114ReEMq] is the main lymphatic channel, transporting chyle from the intestines to the venous circulation. It originates from the cisterna chyli at the level of L1-L2 [^114ReEMq], ascends through the thorax, and drains at the venous junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins [^116fC8xW]. Injury or disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries results in **chyle leakage**.

---

## Traumatic causes

---

### Iatrogenic (surgical) trauma

- **Neck dissection**: Injury to the thoracic duct during cervical lymph node dissection is a common cause of chyle leak [^114BiwHL].
- **Esophagectomy**: Thoracic duct injury during esophageal surgery is a well-documented cause of chylothorax [^112zaR6r].
- **Pancreatic surgery**: Extensive lymphadenectomy or vascular resection during pancreatic surgery can disrupt abdominal lymphatics, leading to chyle leak [^1138wvLn].
- **Axillary lymph node dissection**: Rarely, chyle leak can occur after axillary node clearance in breast cancer surgery [^112Z12uT].

---

### Non-iatrogenic trauma

Blunt or penetrating chest or abdominal trauma can directly injure the **thoracic duct** [^114rnw3G], resulting in **chyle leak** [^116fC8xW].

---

## Non-traumatic causes

---

### Malignancy

A common non-traumatic cause is **lymphoma** due to lymphatic obstruction or infiltration [^114rnw3G]. Metastatic involvement of the lymphatic system can also lead to chyle leak [^116fC8xW].

---

### Congenital lymphatic anomalies

A congenital dilation of lymphatic vessels, **lymphangiectasia**, can lead to spontaneous chyle leak [^114djMYP]. A diffuse lymphatic malformation, **lymphangiomatosis**, can cause chronic chyle leakage [^1176F4Mg].

---

### Inflammatory or infectious conditions

Among infectious causes, **tuberculosis** can cause lymphatic obstruction resulting in chyle leak [^116fC8xW]. Granulomatous inflammation from **sarcoidosis** leads to lymphatic obstruction and chyle leak [^115LZRJ7].

---

## Risk factors associated with chyle leak

Several **risk factors** increase the likelihood of chyle leak:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Extensive lymphadenectomy | Increased risk due to disruption of lymphatic channels [^112aVrXc] |
| Vascular resection | Higher risk due to proximity to major lymphatic vessels [^112aVrXc] [^114BBBYt] |
| Open surgical approach | Greater risk compared to minimally invasive surgery [^112aVrXc] [^114BBBYt] |
| High tumor stage | Associated with increased risk in neuroblastic tumors [^113QgS7s] |
| Male sex and age > 45 years | Associated with increased risk in thyroid cancer surgery [^114kWmJq] |

---

## Diagnostic methods for identifying chyle leak

Accurate **diagnosis and localization** are essential for effective management:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Milky drainage from surgical wounds or drains, especially after initiation of enteral feeding, is suggestive of chyle leak [^114rnw3G].
- **Biochemical analysis**: Elevated triglyceride levels (> 110 mg/dL) and presence of chylomicrons in fluid samples confirm chyle leak [^1142P9NB].
- **Imaging techniques**: Lymphangiography, CT, MRI, and lymphoscintigraphy are valuable for localizing the site of leakage [^116c8GY2] [^112zbyRQ].

---

## Conclusion

Chyle leak is most commonly due to **iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct or its tributaries during surgery** [^114rnw3G], with other causes including trauma, malignancy, and congenital lymphatic anomalies. Risk factors include **extensive lymphadenectomy, vascular resection, and open surgical approaches** [^114BBBYt]. Accurate **diagnosis and localization** are essential for effective management [^116c8GY2].

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: a lymphatic leaks review [^114ZWt51]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system (LS) is susceptible to being affected by various diseases stemming from both malignant and benign origins. Among the primary causes of lymphatic leakages, congenital anomalies and traumatic injuries affecting the LS are prominent. Non-traumatic chyle leaks frequently result from processes causing lymphatic obstruction, such as malignant occlusion, lymphatic vessel abnormalities, systemic or congenital diseases, or idiopathic obstruction.

The most frequent causes of chyle leakage are iatrogenic injuries, mostly secondary to thoracic or abdominal surgery, with chylothorax rates as high as 3.9% after oesophagectomy. Typically, lymphatic leaks manifest in two scenarios: during surgical resections, particularly in oncological cases necessitating extensive lymphadenectomy, or in surgeries where the operative field intersects with major lymphatic vessels.

Traditionally, managing such complications leaned towards conservative measures. However, persistent lymphatic leaks often prompted recourse to aggressive open or laparoscopic surgical interventions, albeit with associated morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and patient recovery periods.

Initially, diagnostic procedures involved injecting blue dye between the toes, exposing a lymphatic vessel on the foot dorsum for cannulation after dissection, followed by ethiodized oil injection and serial radiography from the foot to the thorax to track contrast progression.

Conventional lymphangiography (LA) emerged as a diagnostic tool in the 1950s, but with the advent of advanced imaging modalities, its role has evolved significantly.

### Lymphangiography in the diagnosis and localization of various chyle leaks [^116c8GY2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Chyle leaks are rare entities infrequently encountered by most physicians. However, large centers providing advanced surgical care are inevitably confronted with chyle leaks as a complication of surgery, an extension of disease, or as a primary disorder. Regardless of the etiology, proper diagnosis and localization are paramount in the management of any chyle leak.

- **Materials and methods**: Here we present 16 patients with 17 chyle leaks (5 chyluria, 8 chylothorax, and 4 chylous ascites) who underwent bipedal lymphangiography (LAG) and postprocedure computed tomography (CT) imaging.

- **Results**: In each case, the source of the chyle leak was identified and properly localized to guide further treatment. Of the 16 patients who underwent LAG and postprocedure CT imaging, the initial LAG alone provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 4 patients (25%); the postprocedure CT imaging provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 6 patients (37.5%); and the two modalities were equal in diagnosing and localizing the chyle leak in the remaining 6 patients (37.5%).

- **Conclusion**: These cases highlight the unparalleled abilities of LAG and the added benefit of post-LAG CT imaging in the diagnosis and fine anatomic localization of chyle leaks. In addition, these cases demonstrate the retained utility of LAG in these investigations despite the development of alternative tests involving CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine imaging.

### Chyloptysis with chylopericardium, a rare case and mini-review [^114djMYP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chyloptysis is primarily diagnosed by lymphangiography, contrast lymphangiography, or MRI. Lymphangiography is recommended to identify the anatomy and site of the lymphatic leak. Lymphoscintigraphy, which is noninvasive, has historically been the imaging modality of choice. Contrast lymphangiography can be used to confirm anatomy, lymphangiectasia, and the site of the lymphatic leak; it is also helpful in planning surgical treatment. Three-dimensional MRI may offer extensive information about the anatomy of the lymphatic vasculature and the effects of lymphatic dysfunction on local structures and tissue composition. HRCT is the most sensitive modality to identify the characteristic pathognomonic features of LAM, which are pulmonary cysts ranging between a few millimeters and 1 centimeter in diameter with a thin wall and clear borders from the underlying normal parenchymal image, scattered evenly over all normal lung fields. Fat content should be tested on the bronchial casts or bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, a bronchoscopy should be performed to look for an irregular connection between the pulmonary and lymphatic systems.

- **Treatment**: Treatment for chyloptysis focuses on addressing the primary cause and decreasing chyle formation. In most patients, symptoms can be relieved by eliminating the underlying cause or bypassing the thoracic duct. A low-fat diet may also decrease the production of chyle. Management of the bronchial casts includes bronchoscopic extraction, which may minimize the occurrence of inflammation.

Chyloptysis is a rare but challenging condition requiring careful diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^114BBBYt]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Vascular resection and open surgery were identified as risk factors for chyle leak (CL) in the present study. Vascular resection is a commonly identified predictor and can easily explain the higher rate of CL. In an extensive operation, there is more risk of damage to the main abdominal lymphatic vessels. Only venous resections are identified as significant risk factors, while arterial resections are not, although there was only a limited number of arterial resections performed in this cohort, as shown by the broad confidence interval.

This study is the first to report on open surgery as a risk factor for CL. However, this may still be due to patient selection, as the literature is conflicting on this point. A single-center retrospective study investigating CL in open (n = 118) versus robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) (n = 165) found no effect of the surgical approach on CL (10.9% vs. 13.6%, P = 0.449).

In the four randomized trials on laparoscopic versus open PD, only the multicenter randomized LEOPARD-2 trial reported on the incidence of CL. A nonsignificant increase in CL after laparoscopic PD compared with open PD (n = 2/50 [4%] vs. n = 7/49 [14%], P = 0.09) was reported. In general, minimally invasive PD will be reserved for less advanced tumors without vascular contact. For example, during the period 2016 to 2019, the LEALAPS-3 multicenter training program for robot PD was performed in The Netherlands, where a BMI ≤ 35 kg/m² and no vascular involvement were eligibility criteria. This is also confirmed by our analysis, which shows a significant difference in preoperative conditions.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^112aVrXc]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Chyle leak (CL) is a well-known complication after abdominal surgery, caused by disruption of abdominal lymphatics. In pancreatic surgery, CL is mostly caused by a direct lesion of the main abdominal lymphatic vessels or the cisterna chyli, located at the level of the pancreatic head and neck. It has been suggested that the incidence of CL after pancreatic surgery may increase because of the increasing numbers of extended resections.

The rate of CL for pancreatic surgery in literature ranges from 0.6% to 16.3%. Unfortunately, these studies used different definitions for CL. In 2017, the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) published the consensus definition and classification of CL after pancreatic surgery, in which CL is defined as the output of milky-colored fluid from a drain, drain site, or wound on or after postoperative day 3 with a triglyceride content > 110 mg/dL (> 1.2 mmol/L). The classification divides CL into 3 grades of severity, wherein grades B and C have clinical consequences, such as nasoenteral nutrition and/or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), radiological interventions, and maintenance of surgical drains or drug treatment (such as somatostatin analogs). Grade C includes other invasive in-hospital treatments such as admission to the intensive care unit and/or mortality.

The ISGPS definition of CL has been validated in a monocenter retrospective study, which found a 3.5% rate of grade B/C CL but could not identify risk factors. In addition, a prospective monocenter study including 168 patients…

Chylous ascites

Similar to chylothorax, the aetiology of chylous ascites can be either traumatic or non-traumatic. Non-traumatic causes include inflammatory and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, filariasis, radiation, pancreatitis, and neoplasms like lymphoma. Traumatic or postoperative causes encompass blunt abdominal trauma, aortic surgery, and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, among others. Typically, management commences with a conservative approach. In severe cases, surgical alternatives may be considered.

Although interventional procedures have been documented for the management of chylous ascites, their effectiveness is lower than thoracic duct embolization for chylothorax. Approximately 55% of patients with chylous ascites experience lipiodol extravasation detected with lymphangiography, complicating the definition of the best treatment strategy. The success of lymphangiography and embolization is closely tied to the accurate representation of the leak. Several percutaneous procedures have been described in this clinical setting, including thoracic duct embolization, the BORALE technique, mesenteric lymphangiography, and interstitial embolization. When a lymphatic leak is not demonstrated following a groin lymph node injection, direct puncture of a mesenteric lymph node can be beneficial. Direct access to the leak, along with catheterization and embolization, or retrograde access with balloon occlusion and embolization, may also yield effective occlusion of the leak. Furthermore, in certain clinical scenarios, such as chylous ascites post-pancreatic or liver surgery, transhepatic lymphatic embolization may be considered.

### Iatrogenic chyloma in the neck: Lymphoscintigraphic findings [^114NbQGC]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic chyle leak with chyloma formation in the neck is a rare complication of neck dissection resulting from injury to the thoracic duct. We present the case of a 37-year-old woman who complained of left-sided neck swelling within days after total thyroidectomy and lateral neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated the chyle leak in the left cervical region, and subsequent aspiration of the left neck swelling showed radioactivity in the aspirate. After successful operative repair of the thoracic duct, the patient was able to undergo radioactive ablative thyroid treatment.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: a lymphatic leaks review [^114T9aA9]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphatic access (LA), either alone or in combination with embolization, serves as a viable diagnostic and/or treatment option for conditions such as chylothorax, chylous ascites, lymphoceles, and chylopericardium.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1142P9NB]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Data collected included patient characteristics (i.e. age, sex, BMI, preoperative resectability status, American Society of Anesthesiologists score), treatment characteristics (i.e. neoadjuvant therapy, surgical approach, hospital PD volume, vascular resection, additional organ resection, aortocaval lymph node resection), tumor characteristics (i.e. site of origin, postoperative malignant diagnosis, resection margin, lymph node status, number of lymph nodes resected), and postoperative outcomes (i.e. CL, POPF, bile leak, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, postoperative complications, pneumonia, wound infection, length of stay, in-hospital mortality).

Preoperative resectability was defined according to the DPCG criteria. Venous resections were reported according to the ISGPS classification of venous resections. Aortocaval lymph node resection was defined as the harvesting of the lymph node station 16b1, in the aortocaval window. Margin status was classified as microscopically radical resection (> 1 mm; R0) and microscopically irradical (≤ 1 mm; R1). Lymph node status was reported according to the TNM classification, eighth edition.

Pancreatic surgery–specific complications were all defined according to the ISGPS and the International Study Group of Liver Surgery definitions. CL was defined, according to the ISGPS definition, as the output of milky-colored fluid from a drain, drain site, or wound, on or after postoperative day 3, with a triglyceride content of ≥ 110 mg/dL or ≥ 1.2 mmol/L. These classifications divide complications into three categories.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^11785M4w]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Baseline characteristics were assessed using descriptive statistics. Results were reported as proportions for categorical variables, and as mean with standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Normally distributed data were compared using the Student's t test; categorical data were compared using the χ² test; and non-normally distributed data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between chyle leak (CL), length of stay, and in-hospital mortality, adjusted for previously identified risk factors such as age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, minimally invasive surgery, hospital volume, site of origin, post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF), delayed gastric emptying, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, pneumonia, and wound infection.

To identify potential risk factors for CL using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition, predictors related to patient and pathological characteristics, as well as hospital volume, were identified using univariable logistic regression models. Variables with a P value < 0.20 in univariable analyses were entered into the multivariable regression models, and backward step selection was used.

Two subgroup analyses were performed to identify risk factors:

- **First**: In patients diagnosed with malignancy, where neoadjuvant therapy, resection margin, and lymph node status were also considered.
- **Second**: In patients undergoing aortocaval lymph node sampling, to assess whether this was a risk factor for CL. Data on para-aortic lymph node resection were only registered for a subset of patients.

### Factors predisposing to chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without lateral neck dissection [^114kWmJq]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to assess the clinicopathologic features of patients with chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without lateral neck dissection and to evaluate the factors associated with chyle leakage.

- **Methods**: Of 3137 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 2006 and December 2007, 2314 patients (73.8%) satisfied our inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into those with (group I, n = 14) and without (group II, n = 2300) chyle leakage.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences between the two groups in clinicopathologic features, including age, body mass index, extent of thyroidectomy, pathologic type, tumor size, multiplicity, capsular invasion, and coexisting thyroiditis. In univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, age over 45 years, and the number of harvested central nodes were significantly associated with chyle leakage.

- **Conclusions**: If extensive central compartment node dissection is needed, meticulous dissection is required, especially in male patients and those aged over 45 years, even without lateral neck dissection.

### Recurrent chylothorax: A clinical mystery [^115LZRJ7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion is a common clinical problem, with an estimated 1–1.5 million new cases in the United States each year. It is defined as an excess of fluid in the pleural cavity resulting from an imbalance in pleural fluid production, absorption, or both. Chylothorax is a rare cause of pleural effusion that occurs due to thoracic duct damage, leading to chyle leakage from the lymphatic system into the pleural space. Chylothoraces contain a high concentration of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, lymphocytes, and immunoglobulins.

Iatrogenic injury from thoracic surgery is the most common traumatic cause, while non-traumatic causes include various etiologies such as malignancy, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, congenital duct abnormalities, and diseases of the lymph vessels, such as yellow nail syndrome and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Clinically, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough are the most common symptoms of chylothorax. Malnutrition from the loss of protein and immunosuppression from the loss of immunoglobulins into the pleural space might lead to weight loss and infections.

Imaging typically shows pleural effusion that is most often right-sided due to the anatomy of the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct crosses from the right to the left posterior mediastinum at the level of T5. Thus, damage to the duct above T5 typically leads to left-sided effusion, whereas damage below leads to a right-sided effusion.

Pleural fluid appearance might be the first clue to diagnosing chylothorax. The appearance of fluid from a chylothorax is typically milky. However, it can be serous or sanguineous.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^112eb7kA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The overall survival of patients is presented in Figure 1. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients without a chyle leak and those with a leak (median: 40 vs. 45 months; p = 0.58). Furthermore, in subgroup analysis by underlying tumor histology, there were no significant differences in survival in patients with and without a chyle leak for adenocarcinoma (median: 42 vs. 44 months; p = 0.90) and squamous cell carcinoma (median: 17 vs. 47 months; p = 0.31).

- **Figure 1**: Overall survival rates for patients undergoing esophagectomy developing chyle leak versus:
	1. No chyle leak
	2. No chyle leak in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma
	3. No chyle leak in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma

- **Table 2**: Median overall survival in all patients, and in patients affected by adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma according to whether there was no chyle leak or a chyle leak occurred. Note: NR indicates not reached.

On univariable analysis, age, poor and moderate tumor grade, positive margin status, positive lymphatic, vascular and perineural invasion, extracapsular spread, tumor regression grade 5, and stage III and IV disease were independent prognostic factors for long-term survival. Chyle leak was not a prognostic factor of survival on either univariable or multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI 95%] 0.67–1.45, p = 0.949; HR 1.09, CI 95% 0.73–1.63, p = 0.675).

On multivariable analysis, age, male sex, squamous cell carcinoma, and year of operation were also considered, but the text is incomplete.

### How we approach pediatric congenital chylous effusions and ascites [^1176F4Mg]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital lymphatic leak may develop in patients with maldeveloped lymphatics and result in life-threatening fluid and electrolyte imbalance, protein deficiency, and immunodeficiency. Rapid diagnosis and therapy are necessary to prevent these complications; however, the field lacks clinical trials to support standardized diagnostic treatment guidelines.

We present our multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of congenital lymphatic leak including chylous pleural effusions and ascites. Depending on the rate of lymphatic leak, therapy can range from observation with nutritional modifications to surgical and interventional procedures aimed at reducing lymphatic drainage. Modalities to image central and peripheral lymphatics have advanced considerably. Genetic variants and subsequent targets that drive lymphatic maldevelopment have expanded the repertoire of possible pharmacotherapeutic options.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^114B5LR7]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

In exploring other predisposing factors for recalcitrant thoracic duct injury, one must consider the effect of neoadjuvant DT therapy on post-surgical wound complications. Trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, is thought to antagonize wound healing through its anti-angiogenic properties. This has led to the recommendation to withhold it for 5–7 days preoperatively, with dabrafenib being continued until the day of surgery. In our patient's case, both DT therapies were stopped 7 days before surgery, which should theoretically minimize the risk of trametinib-mediated wound disruption. The rapidity of response to DT, rather than their direct biologic action, could have precipitated the refractory leak. The altered lymphatic drainage of the neck due to bulky compressive disease and its subsequent brisk resolution with BRAF-targeted therapy may have placed the thoracic duct and its tributaries in a vulnerable state.

Halawani et al. described what we believe is the first report of acute airway obstruction related to postoperative chyle leak. As in our case, their patient was also undergoing head and neck endocrine surgery, albeit for benign disease. Similarly, the development of an airway-threatening swelling began in the immediate postoperative phase (< 24 h). Unlike our case, however, simple suture ligation of a transected thoracic duct was sufficient to resolve the leak, and their patient was discharged home 3 days later.

The treatment of BRAF V600E-mutated ATC is rapidly changing. A once uniformly fatal disease is now showing promise in those afflicted with thi…

### Neck swelling 19 days after thyroidectomy: A case report of a rare chyle leak patient [^115tfVLr]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). High credibility.

The occurrence of chyle leak after neck dissection for thyroid carcinoma is uncommon, but it usually occurs within 1–10 days after surgery. We encountered a 30-year-old patient with a chyle leak 19 days after the operation for thyroid carcinoma. The initial symptom was swelling of the neck, which was quickly diagnosed as a chyle leak by puncture. This report describes the patient's presentation and discusses the conservative management of this complication. We highlight that more attention should be given to chyle leak in high-risk patients, and stricter dietary management for these patients after surgery may avoid this complication. In addition, timely diagnosis and rapid implementation of various conservative treatment measures play an important role in patient recovery.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: A lymphatic leaks review [^115CxNUG]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The lymphatic circulation plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance and supporting immune responses by returning serum proteins and lipids to the systemic circulation. Lymphatic leaks, though rare, pose significant challenges post-radical neck surgery, oesophagectomy, and thoracic or retroperitoneal oncological resections, leading to heightened morbidity and mortality. Managing lymphatic leaks necessitates consideration of aetiology, severity, and volume of leakage.

Traditionally, treatment involved conservative measures such as dietary restrictions, drainage, and medical management, with surgical intervention reserved for severe cases, albeit with variable outcomes and extended recovery periods. Lymphography, introduced in the 1950s, initially served as a diagnostic tool for lymphoedema, lymphoma, tumour staging, and monitoring chemotherapy response. However, its widespread adoption was impeded by alternative techniques like computed tomography, learning curves, and its associated complications. Contemporary lymphatic interventions have evolved, favouring nodal lymphangiography over pedal lymphangiography for its technical simplicity and reduced complexity.

Effective management of chylous leaks mandates a multimodal approach encompassing clinical evaluation and imaging techniques. In cases where conservative management proves ineffective, embolization through conventional lymphangiography by bipedal dissection or intranodal injection emerges as a viable option. This review underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating lymphatic leaks.

### Propofol lipemia mimicking chyle leak during neck dissection [^115GtHeT]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Propofol is an intravenous agent used in anesthesia. Lipemia is an uncommon adverse effect of propofol infusion.

- **Methods**: A patient undergoing neck dissection for chordoma developed intraoperative lipemia after prolonged propofol infusion.

- **Results**: Lipemia caused the blood in the surgical field to have a milky appearance resembling chyle, although no chyle leak was present. Lipemia was confirmed by drawing a blood sample and allowing it to stand, observing layering with a milky white upper layer. Analysis of a second blood sample revealed a high lipemic index.

- **Conclusions**: Lipemia, an uncommon adverse effect of propofol infusion, may cause blood to appear milky and be mistaken for a chyle leak in a dissected neck. Identifying lipemia is crucial due to the risk of acute pancreatitis, and it may indicate the early stage of propofol infusion syndrome.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^116vWXXU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is primarily reported due to malignancy, with approximately 50% of cases involving non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Traumatic thoracic injuries, including iatrogenic post-surgical injuries, account for about 25% of cases. Other iatrogenic complications, primarily related to central access catheters, constitute the remaining 25%. If not properly recognized and treated, this condition can lead to profound respiratory, nutritional, and immunological dysfunction, ultimately resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Available treatment modalities include conservative management with drainage and strict dietary regulation, or more invasive approaches such as thoracic duct ligation.

### Lymphatic embolization for the management of post-operative chyle leaks following solid tumor resection in pediatric patients [^1113FjUJ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Chyle leaks are a common post-operative complication following solid-tumor resection in pediatric patients. Treatments for persistent chyle leaks are limited, leading many patients to experience prolonged hospitalization, nutritional deficits, and/or delays in cancer therapies. Lymphatic embolization is an emerging treatment option for chyle leaks; however, limited reports exist of its use in pediatric populations.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients (< 18) who underwent lymphangiogram with intent for lymphatic embolization to manage chyle leaks following solid-tumor resection between 2017 and 2022.

- **Results**: Seven patients underwent a total of 11 attempted lymphatic embolization procedures after standard care treatments failed to resolve the leak. Lymphangiograms identified a chyle leak in 6 of 7 patients, and embolization had a technical success rate of 73%. The complication rate was 9%, and complications were limited to one episode of inadvertent gastric wall perforation that did not result in a gastric leak. Lymphatic embolization was ultimately associated with chyle leak resolution in 100% of patients within a median of 24 days; however, repeat embolization was required in 5 of 7 patients (83%).

- **Conclusion**: Lymphatic embolization appears to be a safe and effective treatment for persistent chyle leaks in pediatric patients, leads to a direct reduction in chyle output, and has high rates of technical and clinical success. Complete resolution of the chyle leak may require multiple embolization procedures.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^116A3K4v]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although rare, traumatic chylothorax can be a challenging entity to manage, especially in a patient with additional traumatic injuries. This case reflects a successful approach to the management of a traumatic chyle leak using drainage and strict dietary changes, which precluded the need for surgical intervention.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^113Jp9W3]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old gentleman presented with a rapidly enlarging right neck mass, dysphagia, and dysphonia. On flexible laryngoscopy, significant external compression of the airway was appreciated, and the right vocal cord was fixed. CT imaging revealed a large mass of the right thyroid gland encasing a portion of the common carotid artery and trachea and extending down to the anterior mediastinum with multiple adenopathy. Following needle biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with cT4N1bM1 BRAF V600E-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer.

After 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib (DT), near complete radiologic and metabolic resolution was obtained in the neck, and a complete response at distant sites was observed. At this time, following multidisciplinary team discussion, appropriate counseling, and informed consent, the patient elected for consolidative surgery. He underwent definitive locoregional control with a right hemithyroidectomy, right central, and bilateral modified radical neck dissections (MRND II-V).

Of note, the dissection planes were scarred akin to patients undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve was grossly involved by the tumor and was sacrificed. The internal jugular vein was thrombosed due to direct tumor invasion and was resected down to the jugular-subclavian junction. The sternocleidomastoid muscles were adherent to bulky nodal disease bilaterally and were partially resected. A small chyle leak was identified intra-operatively, after which the thoracic duct was clipped and suture-ligated with no evidence of leakage.

### Intractable chylous leak after radical esophagectomy treated with radiotherapy [^115SPnei]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Postoperative chylous leak after esophagectomy is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that results in hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, and immunologic deficiency. However, the management of postoperative chylous leak remains controversial. Following a diagnosis of esophageal cancer, a 64-year-old man was treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy, laparoscopic gastric tube formation, prophylactic thoracic duct ligation, and reconstruction with esophagogastrostomy at the neck level.

Massive postoperative drainage from the thorax and abdomen did not initially meet the diagnostic criteria for chylothorax, which was ultimately diagnosed 3 weeks after the operation. Despite various treatments, including total parenteral nutrition, octreotide and midodrine, reoperation (thoracic duct ligation and mechanical pleurodesis), and thoracic duct embolization, the chylous leak persisted. Finally, low-dose radiation therapy was administered with a daily dose of 2 Gy and completed at a total dose of 14 Gy. After this, the amount of pleural effusion gradually decreased over 2 weeks, and the last drainage tube was removed. The patient was alive and well at 60 months postoperatively.

Herein, we describe a patient with intractable chylous leak after esophagectomy, which persisted despite conservative treatment, thoracic duct ligation, and embolization, but was finally successfully treated with radiotherapy.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography plus computed tomography angiography for location of persistent idiopathic chyle leakage not detectable by ordinary contrast computed tomography [^111eN47C]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Chyluria is characterized by the passage of chyle in the urine, caused by the rupture of retroperitoneal lymphatics with leakage into the pyelocaliceal system, which gives the urine a milky appearance. The etiologies include thoracic duct stenosis, tuberculosis, cancer, trauma, pregnancy, and filariasis, or the cause may remain unclear. The result is the dilatation of distal lymphatics and the eventual rupture of lymphatic vessels into the urinary collecting system. Although rare, severe fluid and protein loss may lead to hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia in some patients.

Cystoscopy, lymphangiography (LPG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lymphoscintigraphy are used to diagnose and locate the origin of chyluria. Combining LPG with post-LPG CT imaging may enhance the ability to locate chyle leaks. MRI is contraindicated in patients with implanted metal devices. Some patients fail conservative management because their chyle leaks are not visualized by routine contrast CT, necessitating additional evaluation of the lymphatic system before initiating treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the value of unilateral LPG with post-LPG CT angiography (CTA) in chyluria patients who did not respond to conservative management due to chyle leaks being undetectable by ordinary contrast CT.

### Intractable chylous leak after radical esophagectomy treated with radiotherapy [^112TNhTr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The incidence of chylothorax after esophagectomy is low, and most studies are retrospective, leading to a lack of consensus on the optimal management of postoperative chylous leak. Power and his colleagues have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 studies to identify the optimal approach for managing chylous leaks following esophageal resection. Our case illustrates that various approaches, including conservative treatment (TPN, octreotide, and midodrine), reoperation (thoracic duct ligation and pleurodesis), lymphangiography, and thoracic duct embolization, as well as low-dose radiotherapy, can be attempted to treat postoperative chylothorax.

In our case, after 13 days of conservative treatments following the diagnosis of chylothorax — including oral midodrine, intravenous octreotide acetate, and NPO with TPN — the chylous leakage did not subside. Miao and his colleagues reported that in 11 of 34 patients (32%), conservative treatment (TPN, no enteral intake, and octreotide) failed to successfully stop the chylous leak. Surgical repair, including thoracic duct ligation (TDL) using VATS, is the next step to resolve chylothorax when conservative management has failed. In our patient, even after VATS thoracic duct ligation and pleurodesis, the daily volume of pleural effusion was approximately 1027 mL (range 820 to 1660 mL).

Five days after VATS thoracic duct ligation, lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization were performed twice, but no improvement was seen. Laparoscopic ligation of the cisterna chyli may have been another therapeutic option for our patient, but we did not attempt it.

### Postoperative chyle leak after major pancreatic resections in patients who receive enteral feed: Risk factors and management options [^111bSmC9]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chyle leak complicates 1.3–10.8% of pancreatic resections. Universal use of parenteral nutrition following pancreatic resection may reduce the incidence of chyle leak; however, this denies the majority of patients who do not develop chyle leak the benefits of enteral nutrition (EN). This study aimed to identify risk factors for chyle leak following pancreatic resection within a single institution where EN was used universally.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent pancreatic resection between January 2007 and December 2010 were identified retrospectively. The patients had been treated according to a common unit protocol of enteral feeding; those developing chyle leak were switched to a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) regimen. Clinical progress and recovery after surgery were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with chyle leak.

- **Results**: A total of 245 patients underwent major pancreatic resection (231 pancreatoduodenectomy, 14 total pancreatectomy). Chyle leak complicated 40 cases (16.3%). After multivariate analysis, both extensive lymphadenectomy (P = 0.002) and postoperative portal/mesenteric venous thrombosis (PVT) (P = 0.009) were independently linked with a higher incidence of chyle leak. The development of chyle leak was not associated with poorer survival or prolonged duration of hospital stay, but it was associated with a significantly increased duration of abdominal drainage and reduced likelihood of early hospital discharge (P = 0.026).

- **Conclusions**: Universal use of enteral feeding is associated with a high.

### Chylothorax: Aetiology, diagnosis and therapeutic options [^116fC8xW]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare condition that results from thoracic duct damage, leading to chyle leakage from the lymphatic system into the pleural space, usually on the right side. It has multiple aetiologies and is typically discovered after manifesting as a pleural effusion. Diagnosis involves measuring cholesterol and triglycerides in the pleural fluid. Complications include malnutrition, immunosuppression, and respiratory distress. Treatment may be either conservative or aggressive, depending on the clinical scenario. In this review, we discuss the aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chylothorax. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1, 1980, to February 28, 2008, were reviewed. Keywords searched were chylothorax, aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Intranodal lymphangiography with thoracic duct embolization for the treatment of chyle leaks after head and neck cancer surgery [^116xSrKa]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

Thoracic duct injury is a rare complication of head and neck surgery. Thoracic duct embolization (TDE) has been proposed to manage postoperative chyle leaks.

- **Methods**: Twelve patients who underwent lymphangiography for a chyle leak after head and neck surgery (M:F = 5:7, mean 55 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphangiographic findings, technical success, complications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: Chyle leak was identified and TDE attempted in 11 of 12 patients. Three patients required repeat TDE. The technical success of TDE was 86% (12/14). Clinical success for patients with technically successful TDE was 90% (9/10). The median time until drain removal was 2.1 days in nine patients with clinical success. Two major complications were encountered: chylothorax after initial TDE, requiring additional TDE and, in one case, surgical thoracic duct ligation.

TDE is a safe treatment for chyle leaks after head and neck surgery with high technical and clinical success rates.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^111wWKpb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Management of chyle leak**: Among patients who developed a chyle leak, 52% (n = 26) underwent surgical intervention. Identification and ligation of the thoracic duct were successful in 88.4% (n = 23) of patients. Two patients had a leak from both the thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli, requiring laparotomy and thoracotomy. One patient had a left chylothorax, and another had a bilateral chylothorax. The median time to surgery was 6 days (range 2–11), the median time in the CCU was 6 days (range 2–20), and the median length of hospital stay was 24 days (range 9–83). Three patients required a third-look for persistent chyle leak.

	- Non-surgical management was used on 48% (n = 24) of patients. Two patients required pleuro-peritoneal shunt insertion, while the remaining 22 patients received aggressive, conservative treatment with maintenance of the pleural drain until daily drainage was < 150 mL/day. The median hospital stay for these patients was 15 days (range 7–55). Parenteral or MCT feeding was adopted depending on the chyle leak daily output and the general condition of the patient. Decisions to use shunts were made on an individual patient basis; one patient had previously undergone unsuccessful attempts to ligate the duct at surgical intervention, while the other patient had a shunt inserted and then required a thoracotomy for bleeding. Early in this series, one patient developed Pneumocystis carinii-related pneumonia and required treatment with cotrimoxazole. It has subsequently become standard practice to commence cotrimoxazole once a chyle leak is recognized.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: a lymphatic leaks review [^114ReEMq]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The chyle cistern (CC) is commonly located between L1 and L2, parallel to and behind the inferior cava vein, joining the thoracic duct (TD) in the upper third of the abdomen, deep to the arcuate ligament. It is present in 65% to 85% of patients and its shape is variable: oval (50%), linear (40%), or round (10%) (Fig. 1a, b). It can measure up to 5 cm in length and have an average diameter of 6–7 mm. The intestinal, hepatic, and lumbar trunks drain lymph/chyle into the CC.

Cephalad and in the chest, the TD is located parallel and to the right of the oesophagus, crossing to the left at the approximate level of the middle third of the thoracic vertebral bodies, where it lies anterior to the intercostal branches of the thoracic aorta. Then, it rises to the dome pleura and drains into the left subclavian vein, next to the jugular subclavian confluence (Fig. 1d). The TD measures approximately 45 cm in length and 2–5 mm in diameter.

- **Anatomical variability**: The anatomy of the TD and CC is variable, with normal anatomy present in 40–60% of patients. There is a variable crossing level, a number of thoracic collaterals, which increase surgical complexity, and variability in the anatomy of venous-lymphatic anastomosis with the left subclavian vein. This anastomosis can be a single trunk with a big caliber or consist of several small vessels (Fig. 2a, b). These anatomic variants should be carefully considered when planning retrograde embolization.

### Modified blood patch used to treat a high output chyle leak after McKeown esophagectomy [^112qRBwf]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Chyle leaks after esophagectomy are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. High-output fistulas are particularly difficult to manage, as the likelihood of spontaneous closure with conservative management is low. Leaks that fail to resolve with conservative management are referred for thoracic duct ligation or embolization. Some patients, however, are not candidates for these procedures or have persistent output despite intervention. We report a case of a post-McKeown esophagectomy patient with a high-output chyle leak despite intraoperative thoracic duct ligation. Treatment was successful with a modified blood patch through a neck drain.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1174hSjN]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Given the very low rate of ISGPS grade C CL, the main question is whether the ISGPS classification of CL should be changed. The fact that grade C CL is extremely rare in both validation studies suggests that this part of the classification is not of additional value, but also confirms that CL mostly runs a relatively mild clinical course and rarely becomes life-threatening. Thus, it could be debated to redefine grade C. For example, percutaneous drainage and TPN could be classified as grade C, as this can be considered more invasive treatment than maintenance of surgical drains or nasoenteral nutrition with dietary restrictions. However, when assessing this point in relation to the other ISGPS definitions, such as delayed gastric emptying, TPN should remain as a grade B complication. Furthermore, in most other ISGPS classifications, grade A complications have very limited clinical consequences, and grade C complications reflect a life-threatening condition. The latter is clearly not the case in patients with CL and so justifies the type C definition. One could debate whether to leave out grade A altogether, as was done in the ISGPS definition of pancreatic fistula. Our group supports the notion that the low rate of grade C CL is actually reassuring, and this definition could remain intact to stay in line with other ISGPS definitions.

### Chyle fistula after neck dissection: An 8-year, single-center, prospective study of incidence, clinical features, and treatment [^114BiwHL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Chyle fistula is a relatively rare complication of neck dissection, and there is a lack of consensus regarding its incidence, risk factors, and management.

- **Methods**: Between 2007 and 2014, a total of 472 cases of neck dissection involving the level IV compartment were included in the study. The incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of chyle fistula were investigated, as well as the outcomes of conventional management and the use of octreotide injection in high-output chyle fistula.

- **Results**: The overall incidence of chyle fistula was 4.7% (22/472), with an incidence of 3.0% and 6.2% after right and left neck dissection, respectively. The presence of a metastatic lesion around the junction of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein was the only factor significantly associated with the development of chyle fistula (approximately fourfold higher risk) in univariate and multivariate analyses. In 22 cases of chyle fistula, the mean total drainage volume was 3226 mL during a mean 15.4 days of drain placement. Total parenteral nutrition for the management of chyle fistula was required in 16 cases. Nine (40.9%) of 22 cases experienced additional complications related to chyle fistula. Of the six high-output cases, four were managed with conservative methods plus octreotide injection, and three did not require surgery.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of chyle fistula after neck dissection was higher than expected, especially on the right side. Surgeons should pay greater attention to chyle fistula from preoperative evaluation to postoperative management.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^114ZeaGP]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Typically, the onset of a chyle leak coincides with the initiation of enteral feeds. In our patient's case, the rate of chyle extravasation and degree of mass effect were rather striking for a patient on a fluid diet. Even more so, the progression of swelling, despite the presence of two Jackson‐Pratt drains decompressing the neck, was equally unusual. What is more atypical is that the leak was not mitigated by local surgical intervention.

In retrospect, several risk factors rendered this patient at a particularly elevated risk of thoracic duct injury. First of all, he was overweight (pre-operative BMI 38.8 kg/m²). Obesity is a recognized risk factor for the development of high-output chyle leaks. Perhaps the strongest predictor of thoracic duct injury in his case, however, was the caudal and lateral extent of disease. In a review of 436 consecutive MRNDs by Dunlap et al, when controlling for the pathologic indication, chyle leak was found to be significantly more frequent in the endocrine group than in the non-endocrine group (7.7% vs. 1.1%, respectively, p = 0.003). The increased prevalence of level IV disease and extensive dissection typically required within the territory of the thoracic duct in endocrine pathology were hypothesized as potential explanations for this observation. Intraoperative identification of chyle was another statistically significant predictor of postoperative chyle leak in the same study (p = 0.027). This was despite the authors' efforts to immediately address the thoracic duct in those cases. Indeed, our patient combined all the aforementioned risk factors.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography plus computed tomography angiography for location of persistent idiopathic chyle leakage not detectable by ordinary contrast computed tomography [^116iji9w]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Chyluria can be confirmed by a urine chyle test. About 80% of patients respond to conservative management with a low-fat, high-protein diet or intraperitoneal injection of sclerotherapy, such as silver nitrate, povidone iodine, or dextrose; however, about 22% relapse within two years. Surgical intervention is needed for patients with severe chyluria, especially those who fail to respond to conservative management or experience short-term relapses. Successful surgery requires clear identification and accurate location of the site of chyle leakage, particularly the relationship between lymphatic vessels and the renal collection system or vascular system.

Imaging studies in patients with severe chyluria generally include cystoscopy and LPG. LPG is more successful than cystoscopy in detecting bilateral lymphatic renal pelvis fistulas. The appearance of LPG images in these chyluria patients was wire-like, with semicircular or coralline-shaped shadows primarily distributed in the renal pelvis and parenchyma. The renal hilus appeared distorted and dilated, lumbar or iliac lymph vessels could be seen, and occasionally, obviously dilated truncus lumbalis lymph vessels were observed. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT or MRI may be useful in locating lymphatic ducts and chyle leakage sites, but LPG remains the most widely used method.

Evaluation of abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphatic abnormalities, including lymphatic leaks, is carried out using MRI lymphography with heavily T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences. Nonenhanced MRI lymphangiography is considered a safe and effective technique for these evaluations.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^114zC2mR]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Radical two-field nodal dissection during esophagectomy is associated with an uncommon complication such as chyle leak, even with routine intraoperative identification and ligation of the thoracic duct. Chyle leak appears to have no long-term impact on patient survival. Early use of conservative treatment and, where appropriate, antimicrobial therapy, may address the issue of the many leaks observed; however, where high-volume leaks occur and persist, early surgical intervention is recommended. This study demonstrates that early surgical intervention for major chyle leaks is safe and effective.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^111NF4Kk]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as this is a retrospective study, there is a risk of selection bias; for instance, data on aortocaval lymph node sampling was only registered in a limited number of patients. Second, data on the management of CL (e.g. nasoenteral nutrition, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, or percutaneous drainage), on nutrition (e.g. early enteral feeding), variables predicting a course that requires an aggressive approach (e.g. lymphopenia), and some potential predictors in previous studies (e.g. portal/mesenteric thrombosis and operative time) are not registered in the DPCA and therefore not available for this analysis. Third, the intended extent of lymph node dissection is not available in the audit. Therefore, no distinction can be made between regular lymph node dissection and extended resection as a risk factor for CL. Strengths of this study include the large size, nationwide aspect, and the dedicated registration of CL according to the ISGPS definition within the registry.

In conclusion, this nationwide post hoc assessment of the prospectively maintained nationwide audit shows that the rate of CL according to the ISGPS B/C definition is 7.0%, with grade C being extremely rare (0.1%). The use of this definition is recommended for further studies to adequately compare results. Risk factors for CL should be considered in the postoperative follow-up period. Moreover, a future step would be to study strategies to prevent CL and, mostly, to achieve consensus about the treatment.

### Management of chyle leak post neck dissection: A case report and literature review [^1147NbaQ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chyle leakage post head-and-neck resection is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Management may be problematic and prolonged. Recently, thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct has emerged as a promising technique to definitively treat this difficult problem. We present a recent case of a hemimandibulectomy, radical modified neck dissection, and osseocutaneous fibular-free-flap complicated by a chyle leakage. The chyle leak was successfully treated with thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct. In light of our clinical experience and following a thorough literature review, we propose that complicated or high-output chyle leaks (> 1000 mL day⁻¹) should be treated with early thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^112zaR6r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Chyle leak is an uncommon complication following esophagectomy, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality; however, the optimal treatment for chylothorax is still controversial.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, management, and outcomes of chyle leaks within a specialist esophagogastric cancer center.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancers (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) between 1997 and 2017 at the Northern Oesophagogastric Unit were included from a contemporaneously maintained database. The primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes were overall complications, anastomotic leaks, and pulmonary complications.

- **Results**: During the study period, 992 patients underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancers, and 5% (n = 50) of them developed chyle leaks. There was no significant difference in survival in patients who developed a chyle leak compared with those who did not (median: 40 vs. 45 months; p = 0.60). Patients developing chyle leaks had a significantly longer length of stay in critical care (median: 4 vs. 2 days; p = 0.002), but no difference in total length of hospital stay.

- **Conclusion**: Chyle leak remains a complication following esophagectomy, with limited understanding of its pathophysiology in postoperative recovery. However, these data indicate chyle leak does not have a long-term impact on patients and does not affect long-term survival.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^113s4mSS]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Airway obstruction secondary to a chyle leak is an exceptionally rare phenomenon. Here, we describe this complication in a patient with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) undergoing consolidative surgery after BRAF‐targeted therapy.

A 55‐year‐old man presented with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. The work-up was consistent with metastatic unresectable BRAF V600E‐mutant ATC. After a remarkable response to neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, he underwent curative-intent surgery with a right hemithyroidectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Within 48 hours, he developed an expanding left neck mass with laryngeal obstruction due to a chyle leak.

Despite surgical repair and maximal medical therapy, the leak persisted, necessitating thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct. Final pathology showed a completely excised residual tumor. The patient remains disease-free on long-term dabrafenib and trametinib.

BRAF‐directed therapy has transformed the care of patients with mutated ATC. As more patients undergo consolidative surgery, increased vigilance is paramount in minimizing complications and their associated morbidity.

### Spontaneous cervical chyle fistula: A case report [^113VoTgj]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

Cervical chylous fistulae are rare complications that usually occur from iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct. There have been no reported cases of spontaneous chyle leaks in surgically naïve necks.

- **Methods**: Case report.

- **Results**: A 50-year-old female presented with progressive left neck swelling without fever, dyspnea, or dysphagia. Imaging demonstrated extensive infiltrative changes of the left neck with retropharyngeal fluid extending into the strap musculature and the mediastinum. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed posterior pharyngeal wall edema. The differential diagnosis included abscess versus necrotizing fasciitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and she was taken to the OR for neck exploration. Intraoperatively, milky fluid was present around the carotid sheath and in the retropharyngeal space. Fluid analysis demonstrated chylomicrons and triglycerides > 2,400 mg/dL. Repeat imaging of the neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal malignancy or obstructive masses. A lymphangiogram showed dilated lymphatic vessels near the cervical thoracic duct. On post-operative day four, the patient was taken back to the OR for thoracic duct ligation and biopsy of nearby tissue. Pathology demonstrated benign lymph nodes with dilated sinusoids. A low-fat diet was started, and she was discharged home on hospital day nine. She has followed up regularly with no signs of recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: A cervical chylous fistula usually results from iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a spontaneous cervical chyle leak.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^115ydqrp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical technique, en bloc ligation and excision of the thoracic duct was standard practice within this cohort of patients. The aim of this procedure is to reduce the incidence of chyle leak, which is a potential risk with a radical lymphadenectomy. The efficacy of routine ligation has been described by Dougenis et al, who reported a significant decrease in the incidence of chylothorax when routine ligation was undertaken (2.1% vs. 9%), while Merigliano et al. reported no further cases of chyle leak in 106 patients after instituting this policy. However, it has been suggested that active attempts to identify and ligate the thoracic duct may in fact lead to its damage. This was evaluated by Lin et al, who compared routine versus selective ligation of the thoracic duct and used preoperative oral ingestion of olive oil to stimulate chyle production in the group undergoing selective ligation. They found that selective ligation led to a significantly lower incidence of chyle leak after esophagectomy.

Diagnostic criteria for chyle leak vary between series, with some electing to include only patients with high-volume, biochemically confirmed leaks. The Esophageal Complications Consensus Group (ECCG) categorized chyle leak according to volume and intervention, which graded the level of severity. Only 1% of patients (23% of those who developed a chyle leak) were in the most severe group requiring intervention or surgical treatment. In the present series, all patients with chyle drainage totaling > 500 mL/24 h were included, as were all patients where there were concerns regarding…

### Multimedia article. Prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation for postsurgical chylothorax [^112CdA9a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Chylothorax after complex abdominal and thoracic procedures remains a challenging complication with a mortality rate reaching 50% if untreated. Iatrogenic trauma accounts for almost 20% of all chyle leaks, with esophagectomy being the most common iatrogenic cause. Consequences of an ongoing chyle leak include dehydration, malnutrition, and immunocompromise.

- **Methods**: When nonoperative management techniques fail, prompt ligation of the thoracic duct at the diaphragmatic hiatus should be attempted. The authors present prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation performed for two patients after laparoscopic transthoracic esophagectomy and revision paraesophageal hernia repair.

- **Results**: The prone position for thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation offers several benefits to the surgeon. Gravity retracts the lung anteriorly, exposing the diaphragmatic hiatus. Single-lumen endotracheal intubation combined with low-pressure carbon dioxide insufflation efficiently collapses the lung to create ample working space. For the two reported patients, only three trocars were necessary to complete suture ligation of the thoracic duct via the right chest. Both patients had complete resolution of their chylothorax and recovered uneventfully. Based on this experience, the authors currently advocate for early thoracoscopic treatment to save costs and reduce morbidity.

- **Conclusions**: The authors believe prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation offers significant advantages to the patient by preventing the dangerous consequences of a chyle leak in a timely, minimally invasive fashion.

### Drainage volume after pancreaticoduodenectomy is a warning sign of chyle leakage that inversely correlates with a diagnosis of pancreatic fistula [^112dgrhN]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chyle leakage is a rare complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and its association with pancreatic fistula has not been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, management, and risk factors of chyle leakage after PD; determine if there is a relation between chyle leakage and the diagnosis of pancreatic fistula; and predict chyle leakage with drainage volume early.

A total of 222 patients underwent PD or pylorus-preserving PD. We used the clinical database registry system of the Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System, to establish a retrospective cohort with clinicopathologic data.

Altogether, 24 patients (10.8%) developed chyle leakage. Chyle leakage was identified at a median of 5 days after surgery and a mean of 2 days after enteral intake. The mean drain triglyceride level was 315 mg/dl. Early enteral intake was independently associated with chyle leakage. Chyle leakage was inversely correlated with a diagnosis of pancreatic fistula with marginal significance (odds ratio 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.09). The receiver operating characteristic curve of the volume on postoperative day 4 demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.740 (p = 0.0001). Drainage > 335 mL indicated possible chyle leakage.

Chyle leakage after PD is associated with early enteral intake. It was inversely correlated with a diagnosis of pancreatic fistula because of the dilution effect of drainage volume on the concentration of drained amylase.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^116FdFfr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The principles of conservative management of chyle leak include reduction of chyle flow, drainage of the pleural cavity for chylothorax, nutritional support, and the prevention of septic complications. Immunosuppression is problematic, particularly in those who have a prolonged chyle leak. The opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis carinii on a background of massive chylous ascites has been previously reported and prompted the introduction of routine prophylactic antimicrobials in cases of chyle leak. The two other series detailing rates of infective complications have reported increased rates, particularly rates of respiratory infections in patients with chyle leaks. In the present series, the rates of wound and respiratory complications were not significantly raised in patients with chyle leak compared to the other group; however, prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole is employed as standard in patients with a chyle leak and low lymphocyte count.

In recent years, there has been a move towards earlier surgical intervention for postoperative chyle leak. Cerfolio suggested reoperation when drainage volumes exceeded 1000 mL/day for 5 days, while Alexiou et al. suggested reoperation for those with high output chylothorax not settling following a week of conservative management. For very high-volume leaks (> 2000 mL/day), early surgery after only 2 days of conservative treatment has been proposed, while Merrigan et al. advocate reoperation immediately after the diagnosis has been made. An advantage of early reoperation is the opportunity to repair the leak before the patient becomes significantly compromised.

### Lymphangiography for thoracic duct interventions [^112zbyRQ]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Lymph leaks resulting in chylous pleural effusions can be life-threatening. Minimally invasive thoracic duct embolization and disruption have been gaining acceptance as first-line treatment for these leaks. This review discusses the techniques for both pedal and intranodal lymphangiography in detail. It also explores the use of lymphangiography as a means of targeting a retroperitoneal lymphatic to facilitate thoracic duct interventions for chyle leaks. Finally, outcomes and adverse events pertaining to these thoracic duct interventions are discussed.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1138wvLn]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

**Results**: Overall, 2,186 patients underwent PD between 2017 and 2019. After excluding 27 patients with missing data on CL, the final cohort consisted of 2,159 patients. In this cohort, 46.1% were female and the mean age was 67.1 years (SD = 10.4). Of all included patients, 9.8% received neoadjuvant therapy, 20.4% underwent minimally invasive PD, and 16.4% of procedures included a vascular resection.

### Risk factors, manifestations, and implications of chyle leak following pancreatic surgery: The volume may outweigh the milky appearance of the drainage in a chyle leak [^111FnJE8]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

To identify the risk factors, manifestations, and clinical implications of chyle leak (CL) after pancreatic surgery, data from patients who underwent the surgery between January 2019 and July 2023 were retrieved from an institutional database. The risk factors, manifestations, and clinical impact of CL were analyzed to reappraise the International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition and classification of CL.

The risk factors, clinical scenarios, and management of CL after pancreatic surgery remain controversial. Of the 1,063 patients enrolled, 117 (11.0%) developed CL, including 33 grade A and 84 grade B. A minimally invasive approach (OR: 3.087, 95% CI: 1.790–5.236, P < 0.001) and maximum daily drainage volume (OR: 1.004, 95% CI: 1.003–1.005, P < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for CL. Three hundred ninety-six patients (37.3%) presented with triglyceride (TG)-rich (≥ 1.2 mmol/L) drainage without a milky-colored appearance.

Patients with large-volume (≥ 300 mL/day) TG-rich but non-milky drainage (n = 72) had a significantly longer postoperative stay compared to patients with small-volume (< 300 mL/day) (n = 324, median, 19 days vs. 14 days, P < 0.001); the stay was comparable to patients with large-volume (≥ 300 mL/day), TG-rich, and milky drainage (n = 74, median, 19 days vs. 22 days, P = 0.126).

Minimally invasive approach and daily maximum drainage volume were independent risk factors for CL in this cohort.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^115ftCcX]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

An iatrogenic chyle leak is a well-documented complication of neck surgery, particularly during dissection of the level IV nodal basin, with a risk of thoracic duct injury varying between 2% and 8%. Chyle extravasation carries significant morbidity to the patient, including the risk of metabolic disturbances, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, immunosuppression, and local wound complications. In this report, we present an atypical case of acute upper airway obstruction due to a chyle leak, occurring 48 hours following a right hemithyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) in a patient treated with neoadjuvant dabrafenib/trametinib. Despite emergent intubation and exploration with ligation of thoracic duct tributaries, the high-output chyle leak persisted, necessitating thoracoscopic duct clipping. Although only one other documented case of chyle leak-related airway obstruction is reported, this is the first report of a high-output chyle leak in a patient with ATC.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^111SKM8r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although most cases of traumatic chylothorax can be managed non-operatively, the need for surgical intervention in the subset of patients with associated thoracic fractures is higher and approaches 50 percent. Indications for surgical intervention include:

- **Excessive leak**: For greater than five days, which for adults is > 500 ml/day and for children > 10 ml/kg/day or > 100 ml/day for each year of age.
- **Conservative therapy failure**: Any volume of output for greater than 14 days would indicate failure of conservative therapy and the need for surgical intervention as well.

Conservative treatment of chylothorax begins with prompt drainage via tube thoracostomy and dietary manipulation. The goal of dietary manipulation is to dramatically decrease lymph production since sixty percent of the dietary fat is absorbed by the lymphatic system, and approximately 1500 to 2000 mL of lymph is produced daily. This can be accomplished by completely bypassing the lymphatic circulation with Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) or by strict dietary manipulation based on a very low fat diet. We chose the latter to avoid some of the known infectious complications associated with TPN, especially in this high-risk patient with multi-system trauma. With either approach, the volume status, electrolyte abnormalities, and nutritional parameters of the patient should be followed closely, and aggressive replacement of nutritional losses of fat-soluble vitamins and proteins should be carried out.

A diet strategy to limit chyle production involves avoidance of long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), however, are absorbed directly into the portal circulation, bypassing the lymphatic system, which makes them a viable option in dietary management.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^117AVjBq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare form of pleural effusion that can be associated with both traumatic and non-traumatic causes. Thoracic duct ligation is often the treatment of choice in postsurgical patients; however, the optimal treatment of this disease process after traumatic injury remains unclear. We present a rare case of a thoracic duct injury secondary to a blunt thoracic spine fracture and subluxation, which was successfully treated non-operatively.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old male presented as a tier one trauma code due to an automobile versus bicycle collision. His examination and radiographic work-up revealed fractures and a subluxation at the third and fourth thoracic spine levels resulting in paraplegia. He also sustained bilateral hemothoraces secondary to multiple rib fractures. Drainage of the left hemothorax led to the diagnosis of a traumatic chylothorax. The thoracic spine fractures were addressed with surgical stabilization, and the chylothorax was successfully treated with drainage and dietary manipulation.

- **Conclusions**: This unusual and complex blunt thoracic duct injury required a multidisciplinary approach. Although the spine injury required surgical fixation, successful resolution of the chyle leak was achieved without surgical intervention.

### Chylopericardium following esophagectomy: a case report and systematic review [^1148mji3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Chylopericardium is a rare disorder that can occur either as a primary (idiopathic) condition or, more commonly, as a secondary condition resulting from injury to the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct serves as a conduit for transporting chyle from the intestinal tract and closely passes by the pericardium as it travels from the cisterna chyli to the jugular and subclavian veins. Any disease capable of compressing, obstructing, or rupturing the thoracic duct and its branches can be the underlying cause of chylopericardium. The most common secondary causes include trauma, cardiac surgery, and congenital lymphangiomatosis. However, chylopericardium following esophagectomy is an exceedingly rare occurrence, with only a few cases having been previously reported.

The pathogenesis of post-surgical chylopericardium is not entirely clear. The prevailing theory suggests that the primary mechanism involves a direct injury to the thoracic duct and mediastinal lymphatic vessels. This injury can result in the establishment of a communication between the lymphatic system and the pericardium, leading to the leakage of chyle into the pericardial cavity. Additionally, if there is an obstruction or disruption of the thoracic lymphatic ducts, this can lead to a significant increase in intraductal pressure, causing a reflux of lymphatic fluid back into the pericardial space. In situations where chylopericardium is a consequence of direct injury, it may precipitate a specific point source leakage of chyle.

### Management of high-output chyle leak after harvesting of vascularized supraclavicular lymph nodes [^113yrux9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Vascularized lymph node transfer is a physiological microsurgical technique used for the treatment of lymphedema. As this technique is becoming more common, it is essential to be aware of all potential complications associated with the procedure and to know how to avoid and manage them when they occur. The authors recently encountered a complication after supraclavicular vascularized lymph node transfer that had not been previously reported. A patient developed a recalcitrant high-output (> 500 ml/day) chyle leak at the neck donor site following the harvest.

In this article, the authors share their experience with a massive chyle leak and review management strategies to effectively avoid and treat this potentially dangerous complication. This review is timely and important because the procedure is increasingly being offered to patients. Surgeons performing these procedures should be familiar with effectively managing this potentially dangerous complication.

### Multidisciplinary management of chylothorax [^114rnw3G]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Chylothorax, the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, is usually caused by the disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries. Etiologies are broadly divided into traumatic, including postsurgical, and nontraumatic, most commonly in the setting of malignancy. The management of chylothorax largely depends on the cause and includes dietary modification and drainage of the pleural space. A definitive intervention, whether surgical or a percutaneous lymphatic intervention, should be considered in patients with a persistently high volume of chylous output and in those with a prolonged leak, before complications such as malnutrition ensue. No methodologically robust clinical trials guiding management are currently available. In this article, we review the literature and propose a stepwise, evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothorax.

### Chyle leak after axillary node clearance in breast cancer surgery-a rare complication and a proposed management strategy from the British and Italian experience [^112Z12uT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Chyle leak after axillary surgery is a rare complication characterized by a lack of consensus and management guidelines. This study aimed to present the experiences of two centers in managing chyle leaks after axillary node clearance for breast cancer. Furthermore, the authors provide a review of its pathophysiology and clinical diagnostic methods. They compare management approaches for the axilla with those for other locations.

- **Methods**: A multicenter case series descriptive analysis of chyle leak after breast cancer axillary node clearance was performed between January 1, 2013, and May 31, 2020.

- **Results**: The center in the United Kingdom and the center in Italy performed 655 and 4969 axillary node clearances, respectively. Four patients experienced chyle leaks. All leaks were associated with left-sided surgery (three patients had level 3 clearances with mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstructions; one patient had level 2 clearance with therapeutic mammoplasty). All leaks appeared within three days post-surgery, with a duration ranging between 11 and 29 days. The maximum daily output was 600 mL. All leaks were managed conservatively with nutritional team support and close drainage monitoring. The management strategy included a low-fat diet, a high-protein diet, total parenteral nutrition, medium-chain triglyceride supplements, and other elements. No negative effects on oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgery wound healing were observed, and there were no delays in adjuvant treatment.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of chyle leak after breast cancer axillary node clearance was 0.

### Incidence and risk factors for chyle leaks after neuroblastic tumor resection: A systematic review of published studies [^113QgS7s]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Chyle leakage and ascites after surgical resection of neuroblastic tumors may delay the start of chemotherapy and worsen prognosis. Previous studies have reported a highly variable incidence, and risk factors remain largely unknown. This study aims to analyze the true incidence of chyle leaks and ascites and seeks to identify risk factors and optimal treatment strategies.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Literature reviews, case reports, and non-English papers were excluded. Data were extracted independently following paper selection by two authors.

- **Results**: The final analysis yielded 15 studies with a total of 1,468 patients. Chylous ascites was recorded postoperatively in 171 patients (12%). Most patients experiencing chyle leaks were successfully treated conservatively with drainage, bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide in variable combinations. Seven out of 171 patients (4%) required operative exploration to control troublesome persistent chyle leaks. In risk factor analysis, a higher tumor stage was significantly associated with the risk of chyle leak (P < 0.0001); however, no correlation was observed with adrenal versus non-adrenal tumor location, INRG risk groups, and tumor laterality.

- **Conclusion**: Chyle leakage after surgery for neuroblastic tumors is a common morbid complication occurring in approximately 12% of patients. Higher INSS tumor stage portends greater risks. Conservative therapy strategies appear successful in the majority of cases. To avert this complication, meticulous mesenteric lymphatic ligation is recommended.
