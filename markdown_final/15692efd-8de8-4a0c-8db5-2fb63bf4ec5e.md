## Question

why is cortisol low in secondary adrenal insufficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why cortisol is low in secondary adrenal insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about normal HPA axis physiology and feedback. Then, I should verify what specifically fails in secondary adrenal insufficiency and the common causes. Next, I will examine how chronic ACTH deficiency leads to adrenal cortical atrophy and impaired cortisol synthesis, followed by a careful review of the biochemical phenotype, including DHEAS. After that, I should review diagnostic testing and its pitfalls, including standard- vs low-dose ACTH, ITT, and metyrapone, and I need to check assay-related issues and thresholds. Finally, I will connect these mechanisms to clinical risk and management, including stress dosing and replacement strategies.

> Let me first confirm the physiological baseline. Cortisol production depends on hypothalamic CRH stimulating pituitary ACTH, which in turn provides both acute secretagogue and chronic trophic support to the adrenal zona fasciculata; cortisol then feeds back negatively to the hypothalamus and pituitary, setting the diurnal rhythm with a pre-awakening peak.

> Now, what actually fails in secondary adrenal insufficiency? I need to ensure I'm precise here: the defining defect is inadequate pituitary ACTH secretion, most commonly from exogenous glucocorticoid suppression; other causes include pituitary disease, post-surgical or radiation injury, apoplexy, infiltrative disease, and immune checkpoint inhibitor–related hypophysitis leading to central AI or isolated ACTH deficiency [^113AsZ6c] [^115o1UQo] [^116NWcxD].

> I will now examine the adrenal consequences. Chronic ACTH deficiency removes the trophic drive required to maintain zona fasciculata mass and enzymatic capacity; over time the cortex atrophies, reducing both basal and stress-responsive cortisol output. Initially I might be tempted to say the adrenal cannot respond to ACTH at all, but wait, let me verify that nuance: in early or partial secondary AI, a supraphysiologic 250 μg ACTH bolus can transiently overcome some atrophy and yield a seemingly "normal" peak, which underscores the timing- and dose-dependence of the response and the risk of false reassurance with the standard test [^113AsZ6c] [^111dPRCw] [^111prZaP].

> Next, I should review the biochemical fingerprint. Basal morning cortisol production is inappropriately low for time of day, often clearly low when ≤ 5 μg/dL, indeterminate in the 5–18 μg/dL range, and rarely near-normal early on; DHEAS, another ACTH-dependent adrenal androgen, tends to be low and can aid interpretation, with a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEAS making clinically significant AI unlikely. Hold on, I should verify assay and context: time-of-day, acute stress, CBG alterations, and method-specific cutoffs all matter, so any single threshold must be interpreted in clinical context [^1135iuNx] [^116RrjWS] [^114WaFdC] [^111r3g3a].

> Let me consider the diagnostic tests and their pitfalls. The standard 250 μg cosyntropin test is convenient but can miss early secondary AI because it tests adrenal reserve to a pharmacologic ACTH surge rather than the integrity of the entire axis; lower-dose 1 μg protocols are often more sensitive for central AI, although literature is mixed, and both should be interpreted against an accepted reference standard when possible. I should double-check the so-called gold standards: the insulin tolerance test and the overnight metyrapone test probe the axis upstream and are more sensitive but less practical and carry safety considerations. I need to ensure I state the controversy: some data favor the low-dose ACTH test, others do not, and assay cutoffs further complicate interpretation, so clinical pre-test probability and safety must guide test selection and sequencing [^111prZaP] [^112cSssQ] [^113AsZ6c] [^111sbwED] [^111dPRCw].

> Hold on, I should verify assay and threshold nuances before drawing conclusions. Morning cortisol cutoffs vary by assay and context; immunoassays vs LC-MS/MS yield different reference intervals, and circadian disruption, estrogen-induced CBG elevation, and hypoalbuminemia can bias results. Practical algorithms often use morning cortisol as a first pass, with values ≥ about 10–13 μg/dL frequently excluding AI by contemporary immunoassays, whereas very low values prompt treatment and/or dynamic testing; however, I need to check local cutoffs and methods to avoid misclassification [^111r3g3a] [^1162vUxs] [^117TyPBt].

> But wait, what are the clinical implications of these mechanisms? Patients may appear well at baseline because low but stable cortisol can suffice for routine activities; however, during illness, surgery, or trauma, the absent ACTH drive and atrophic adrenal cortex cannot mount an adequate response, precipitating hypotension, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and crisis. Management centers on physiologic glucocorticoid replacement in stable periods and stress dosing during intercurrent illness, with typical guidance to double to hydrocortisone 40 mg/day divided when ill without hemodynamic instability, alongside education on sick-day rules and crisis prevention [^114WaFdC] [^113RVW44] [^112xJ9A1].

> Final cross-check and synthesis: cortisol is low in secondary adrenal insufficiency because pituitary ACTH deficiency removes the trophic and secretagogue stimulus needed to sustain zona fasciculata structure and function, producing adrenal cortical atrophy and impaired cortisol synthesis; this contrasts with primary AI, where the adrenal itself is destroyed and ACTH is high. I should confirm that this pathophysiology aligns with the diagnostic pitfalls and clinical risks outlined above, which it does, and the cited data support each step from cause to consequence to management [^113AsZ6c] [^1169LDxb] [^113AsZ6c].

Cortisol is low in secondary adrenal insufficiency because **pituitary ACTH deficiency** leads to **adrenal atrophy** [^113DWPmy] and impaired cortisol synthesis [^113AsZ6c]. The pituitary fails to provide adequate ACTH, so the adrenal cortex **cannot maintain normal cortisol output**, especially under stress [^114WaFdC]. This ACTH deficiency is most often due to pituitary tumors, surgery, radiation, or chronic glucocorticoid use, and the resulting low cortisol can cause fatigue, hypoglycemia, and adrenal crisis if untreated [^113AsZ6c] [^111Ncj1V].

---

## Physiological basis of cortisol production

The hypothalamus secretes CRH, which stimulates pituitary ACTH secretion; ACTH in turn drives adrenal cortisol synthesis [^112LBu1Z]. Cortisol then suppresses both CRH and ACTH via **negative feedback** to maintain homeostasis [^111wuWdn].

---

## Pathophysiology of secondary adrenal insufficiency

Secondary adrenal insufficiency arises from **pituitary ACTH deficiency**, leading to reduced adrenal stimulation and cortisol output [^113DWPmy] [^113ADgBo]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Pituitary ACTH deficiency**: Tumors, surgery, radiation, or infiltrative disease reduce ACTH [^113AsZ6c].
- **Adrenal atrophy**: Chronic ACTH deficiency causes zona fasciculata atrophy and impaired cortisol synthesis [^113DWPmy].
- **Impaired stress response**: The adrenal cortex cannot mount an adequate cortisol response to stress [^112zdxsi].

---

## Clinical implications of low cortisol levels

In secondary adrenal insufficiency, low cortisol leads to:

- **Fatigue and weakness**: Reduced gluconeogenesis and energy availability [^1169LDxb].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Impaired glucose production [^111Ncj1V].
- **Hyponatremia**: Increased ADH and water retention [^111LrPaQ].
- **Adrenal crisis**: Life-threatening hypotension and shock under stress [^113RVW44].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on:

- **Morning cortisol and ACTH**: Low cortisol with low or inappropriately normal ACTH suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111r3g3a].
- **ACTH stimulation test**: Blunted cortisol rise indicates adrenal atrophy from chronic ACTH deficiency [^111prZaP].
- **Insulin tolerance test**: Gold standard for central adrenal insufficiency [^114WaFdC].

---

## Management strategies

Glucocorticoid replacement with **hydrocortisone or prednisone** restores cortisol levels [^1152153f]. Doses should be increased during intercurrent illness or surgery to prevent crisis [^113RVW44]. Management should also address the underlying cause, such as treating pituitary tumors or other etiologies [^113AsZ6c].

Cortisol is low in secondary adrenal insufficiency because **pituitary ACTH deficiency** leads to adrenal atrophy [^113DWPmy] and impaired cortisol synthesis, causing significant clinical consequences if not recognized and treated [^113ADgBo].

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being the most serious and potentially life-threatening. It may occur in isolation or, more commonly, as part of more widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstration of subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24), or in the setting of acute illness. The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized for the patient and clinical scenario.

A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate for making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus- and assay-dependent, and normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of potential pitfalls of the test used.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113AsZ6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). High credibility.

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use.

- **Causes of central hypoadrenalism**: Other causes include organic pituitary injury, tumors, and infections such as tuberculosis or HIV. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and lymphocytic hypophysitis also contribute.

Interrogation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example, a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. In other situations, a low morning cortisol level in an at-risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed.

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones, with GH being the most commonly affected pituitary hormone, followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in the loss of ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). However, ACTH can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations, such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism is crucial as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

### Secondary hypoadrenalism [^113DWPmy]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) is a clinical disorder that results from hypothalamic or hypophyseal damage or from prolonged administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Since glucocorticoids are widely used for a variety of diseases, the prevalence of SAI is far higher than primary adrenal insufficiency. Although the presentation of adrenal insufficiency may be insidious and difficult to recognize, appropriate adrenocortical hormone replacement can lead to a normal quality of life, and longevity can be achieved.

The spectrum of adrenal insufficiency ranges from overt adrenal crises to subtle dysfunctions in asymptomatic patients who may be at risk of developing acute adrenal insufficiency, as their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis cannot appropriately react to stress. Thus, the identification of patients with subtle abnormalities of the HPA is mandatory to avoid this life-threatening event under stressful conditions.

The optimal tests and testing sequence for adrenal insufficiency are still a matter of debate. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) could be considered the gold standard, as it tests the whole HPA axis; however, there are cases where some patients pass the ITT but fail the ACTH test. Various alternatives to the ITT, including the standard cosyntropin stimulation test (SST) and low-dose SST, have been proposed since the adrenal gland in SAI loses the capacity for a prompt response to ACTH stimulation. The standard ACTH dose, but not the 1 microgram dose, increases adrenal blood flow, which may contribute to producing an early cortisol response.

### Performance of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and baseline cortisol in assessing adrenal insufficiency [^116RrjWS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency (AI) often requires complex testing, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a promising marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function; however, its diagnostic performance has not yet been evaluated in a large-scale study.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of DHEAS and baseline cortisol in assessing AI.
- **Design**: Single-center retrospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: Referral center.
- **Patients**: Adults who underwent Cosyntropin stimulation testing (CST) between 2005 and 2023 and had DHEAS measured within 3 months prior to CST.
- **Main outcome measures**: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for DHEAS and baseline cortisol. Prevalence of AI based on various DHEAS and baseline cortisol concentrations.

Among 1135 patients, 195 (17.2%) had AI. Both baseline cortisol and DHEAS independently had good diagnostic performance with AUROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.77–0.84) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.85), respectively. The time of CST performance had no significant effect on the diagnostic accuracy of baseline cortisol, while recent glucocorticoid use decreased the diagnostic performance of DHEAS (AUROC 0.72 vs. 0.83). Only 1.2% of patients with baseline cortisol ≥ 10 mcg/dL had AI based on CST. Among patients with baseline cortisol between 5–9.9 mcg/dL, only 1.3% had AI if DHEAS was ≥ 60 mcg/dL. Conversely, the majority (72.2%) of patients with both baseline cortisol < 5 mcg/dL and DHEAS < 25 mcg/dL were found to have AI.

In conclusion, DHEAS has good diagnostic performance in assessing AI.

### Opdivo [^116NWcxD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opdivo can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold Opdivo depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- **Opdivo as a single agent**: Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 1% (20/1994) of patients receiving Opdivo as a single agent, including Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.6%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to the permanent discontinuation of Opdivo in 0.1% and withholding of Opdivo in 0.4% of patients. Approximately 85% of patients with adrenal insufficiency received hormone replacement therapy. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 90% (18/20) of patients with adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 35% of the 20 patients. Of the 8 patients in whom Opdivo was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 4 reinitiated Opdivo after symptom improvement, and all required hormone replacement therapy for their ongoing adrenal insufficiency.

- **Opdivo with ipilimumab**: Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg: Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 8% (35/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC receiving Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (2.4%), and Grade 2 (4.2%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency led to the permanent discontinuation of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 0.4% and withholding of Opdivo with ipilimumab in 2% of patients.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning the tapering of corticosteroids, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend offering any of the following to patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent who are aiming to discontinue corticosteroid therapy:

- **Continued gradual taper**: In conjunction with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Testing**: With a morning serum cortisol.

### The low-dose ACTH test does not provide a useful assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in secondary adrenal insufficiency [^112cSssQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

The 1 microgram ACTH stimulation test has been introduced to improve the sensitivity of ACTH as a test of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). This study aims to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the "low-dose" 1 microgram ACTH (LDACTH) test and the "standard dose" 250 microgram ACTH (SDACTH) test with the overnight metyrapone test (OMT), which assesses the entire HPAA.

- **Design**: A prospective evaluation of the performance of SDACTH and LDACTH screening tests was conducted in a diverse cohort of patients with possible adrenal insufficiency, as routinely encountered in clinical practice, using the OMT as the reference method.

- **Patients**: A total of 51 patients (26 with asthma on inhaled glucocorticoids, nine with hypopituitarism, three with hypothyroidism, one with hyponatraemia, one with Crohn's disease, one with encephalitis, and 10 with non-specific symptoms) each underwent SDACTH, LDACTH, and OMT tests in random sequence at least one week apart.

- **Measurements**: Blood samples were collected for plasma cortisol levels at 0 and 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 1 microgram and 250 micrograms of ACTH. Metyrapone 30 mg/kg body weight was taken orally at midnight, and plasma samples were taken for measurement of 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol the next morning between 08:00 and 09:00 hours. The OMT was deemed abnormal when both 11-deoxycortisol and cortisol levels were less than 200 nmol/l.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity at an empirical "normal" plasma cortisol threshold value of 500 nmol/l were 67% and 100% for the SDACTH test, and 73% and 81% for the LDACTH test, respectively.

### Corticotropin tests for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal insufficiency: A metaanalysis [^111prZaP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of tests for detecting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal insufficiency (HPAI) is controversial. Our objective was to compare standard-dose and low-dose corticotropin tests for diagnosing HPAI.

- **Data sources**: We searched the PubMed database from 1966–2006 for studies reporting diagnostic value of standard-dose or low-dose corticotropin tests, with patient-level data obtained from original investigators.

- **Study selection**: Eligible studies had more than 10 patients. All subjects were evaluated because of suspicion for chronic HPAI, and patient-level data were available. We excluded studies with no accepted reference standard for HPAI (insulin hypoglycemia or metyrapone test) if test subjects were in the intensive care unit or if only normal healthy subjects were used as controls.

- **Data extraction**: We constructed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves using patient-level data from each study and then merged results to create summary ROC curves, adjusting for study size and cortisol assay method. Diagnostic value of tests was measured by calculating area under the ROC curve (AUC) and likelihood ratios.

- **Data synthesis**: Patient-level data from 13 of 23 studies (57%; 679 subjects) were included in the metaanalysis. The AUC were as follows: low-dose corticotropin test, 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.89–0.94), and standard-dose corticotropin test, 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.74–0.84). Among patients with paired data (seven studies, 254 subjects), diagnostic value of low-dose corticotropin test was superior to standard-dose test.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^1169LDxb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI), first described by Thomas Addison in 1855, is characterized by inadequate hormonal production by the adrenal gland. It can be classified as primary, due to destruction of the adrenal cortex, or secondary/tertiary, due to a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone or its stimulation by corticotropin-releasing hormone. In Addison's time, this was an invariably fatal condition, with most patients dying within a few years of diagnosis. However, the discovery of cortisone in the 1940s not only improved the life expectancy of these patients but also had a dramatic effect on their overall quality of life.

The diagnosis is easily confirmed by demonstrating inappropriately low cortisol secretion; however, it is often delayed by months, and many patients present with acute adrenal crisis. Sudden withdrawal from chronic glucocorticoid therapy is the most common cause of AI. Currently, there remains a wide variation in the management of this condition across Europe. Since primary AI is a relatively rare condition, most medical specialists will only manage a handful of these patients in their careers. Despite numerous advances in recent years, there is currently no curative option, and modern cortisol replacement regimens fail to adequately mimic the physiological cortisol rhythm. Several new approaches, including allograft of adrenocortical tissue and stem cell therapy, are being attempted but remain largely experimental.

### Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency: Which test is best — the 1-microg or the 250-microg cosyntropin stimulation test [^117LRMPg]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To review the available literature on the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) for the diagnosis of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency in both nonstressed and acutely ill patients, we performed a MEDLINE search of all English-language literature published between 1965 and 2007, in which the 1-microg and the 250-microg CSTs were compared in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

The majority of published evidence suggests that the 1-microg CST is more sensitive than the 250-microg CST for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency in nonstressed patients. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the low-dose CST is unlikely to add any diagnostic sensitivity to the high-dose CST. In critically ill patients, the 1-microg test is also likely to be more sensitive than the 250-microg test when an appropriate cutoff value is used (25 microg/dL).

The 1-microg CST with a cortisol level determined at 30 minutes after stimulation, using a cutoff level of 18 to 20 microg/dL in nonstressed patients and less than 25 microg/dL or an increment of less than 9 microg/dL from baseline in critically ill patients, is the best test currently available for establishing the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Approach to the patient with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^11347Xd2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by exogenous glucocorticoid suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is the most prevalent form of adrenal insufficiency. The condition is important to diagnose given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis and impact on patients' quality of life. The diagnosis is made with a stimulation test such as the ACTH test. Until now, testing for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency has often been based on clinical suspicion rather than routinely, but accumulating evidence indicates that a significant number of cases will remain unrecognized.

During ongoing oral glucocorticoid treatment, or initially after withdrawal, approximately 50% of patients have adrenal insufficiency. However, outside clinical studies, 1% or less of patients have adrenal testing recorded. More than 70% of cases are identified during acute hospital admission, where the diagnosis can easily be missed because symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are nonspecific and overlap those of the underlying conditions.

Treatment of severe glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should follow the principles for treatment of central adrenal insufficiency. The clinical implications and thus the indication to treat mild to moderate adrenal deficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal have not been established. Additionally, the indication of adding stress dosages of glucocorticoid during ongoing glucocorticoid treatment remains unclear. In patients with established glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, there are high rates of poor confidence in self-management and delays in response to treatment.

### Diagnostic predicament of secondary adrenal insufficiency [^111dPRCw]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To propose an approach for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI), we present two clinical cases along with a review of the literature.

- **Methods**: We describe two patients who were initially thought to have a normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis based on their response to the high-dose (250 microg) cosyntropin stimulation test (HST), using a cutoff value of 20 microg/dL. The first patient had undergone resection of a 4-cm pituitary tumor a few months prior, and the second patient exhibited hyponatremia with empty sella syndrome. Despite these initial findings, both patients showed strong clinical evidence suggestive of secondary AI. Upon further testing using the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the first patient and the overnight metyrapone test (OMT) in the second, a diagnosis of secondary AI was confirmed. We reviewed relevant literature to evaluate the utility of different tests for diagnosing secondary AI.

- **Results**: An 8 AM serum cortisol value below 5 microg/dL or above 13 microg/dL and a stimulated cortisol level below 16 microg/dL on both the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (LST) and the HST, as well as above 22 microg/dL on the LST and above 30 microg/dL on the HST, can effectively predict the functional status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in chronic secondary AI. Values that fall between these cutoff points may require further assessment with the OMT or ITT based on clinical suspicion.

- **Conclusion**: We recommend a three-step diagnostic approach, starting with the 8 AM basal cortisol determination, in conjunction with additional testing as necessary, to accurately diagnose secondary AI.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency [^112LBu1Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The cosyntropin stimulation test is the initial endocrine evaluation of suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Purpose**: To critically review the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test for evaluating adrenal insufficiency.

- **Data sources**: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to 2002 for all English-language papers related to the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Study selection**: Studies with fewer than 5 persons with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or with fewer than 10 persons as normal controls were excluded. For secondary adrenal insufficiency, only studies that stratified participants by integrated tests of adrenal function were included.

- **Data extraction**: Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from all studies that provided sensitivity and specificity data for 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests; these curves were then compared by using area under the curve (AUC) methods. All estimated values are given with 95% CIs.

- **Data synthesis**: At a specificity of 95%, sensitivities were 97%, 57%, and 61% for summary ROC curves in tests for primary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), secondary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), and secondary adrenal insufficiency (1-microg cosyntropin test), respectively. The area under the curve for primary adrenal insufficiency was significantly greater than the AUC for secondary adrenal insufficiency for the high-dose cosyntropin test (P < 0.001), but AUCs for the 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests did not differ significantly.

### Employing a results-based algorithm to reduce laboratory utilization in ACTH stimulation testing [^114oSEyD]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

The High Dose Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Stimulation Test is the gold standard for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency. Normal adrenal function is defined as a peak cortisol response to pharmacologic stimulation with cosyntropin of ≥ 18 μg/dL. Our practice was to obtain cortisol levels at 0, 30, and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. Once a value of ≥ 18 μg/dL is obtained, adrenal insufficiency is ruled out, and there is little diagnostic utility in subsequent stimulated levels.

- **Methods**: We aimed to decrease laboratory utilization by developing a results-based algorithm in the electronic medical record (EMR). Cortisol levels were analyzed at the 0 and 60-minute samples; then an EMR discern rule automatically generated an order to analyze the 30-minute sample if the 60-minute cortisol level was subnormal.

- **Results**: Exclusion of adrenal insufficiency was achieved using one stimulated cortisol level in 8% of cases prior to algorithm development. After several plan-do-study-act cycles, 99% of normal tests were performed using only one stimulated cortisol level.

- **Conclusions**: This laboratory-based algorithm resulted in reduced laboratory utilization and aligned our practice with the recommendations of the Pediatric Endocrine Society. Similar algorithms could be created for other dynamic tests to reduce unnecessary laboratory utilization.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113RVW44]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

As discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2, patients need to be educated on stress dosing of glucocorticoids to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae. Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuing glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in patients who have not undergone biochemical testing to confirm recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis, mortality is increased, particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy.

Therefore, patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and who are under minor stress (e.g. fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability, without evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (such as vomiting or diarrhea), or undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia, will require coverage with a stress dose of oral glucocorticoids. As a general guide, see Table 8. The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiology. Patients should receive double the physiological replacement dose, which is hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split into three doses: 20 mg on rising, 10 mg at midday, and 10 mg at 5 PM. In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested.

### Bavencio [^114oWk9q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Bavencio has been associated with both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. For instances of Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, it is recommended to initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement, as clinically indicated. Bavencio should be withheld depending on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.6% (11/1854) of patients receiving Bavencio, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. In 0.1% of cases, adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of Bavencio, and in another 0.1%, it necessitated withholding the medication.

Systemic corticosteroids were required for all (11/11) patients experiencing adrenal insufficiency, though this condition resolved in only 18% (2/11) of patients. Neither of the 2 patients for whom Bavencio was withheld for adrenal insufficiency resumed treatment with Bavencio.

Bavencio is also known to cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, which can present with acute symptoms related to mass effects, such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can lead to hypopituitarism. Hormone replacement should be initiated as clinically indicated, and Bavencio should be withheld or permanently discontinued based on the severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Immune-mediated pituitary disorders were reported in 0.1% (1/1854) of patients receiving Bavencio, classified as a Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reaction. Hypopituitarism did not result in withholding Bavencio for this patient, and systemic corticosteroids were not required.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis in the emergency department [^111Ncj1V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Due to the range of symptoms and variable clinical courses and etiologies, it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and manage.

- **Objective**: This narrative review discusses the evaluation of an adult patient at risk for a new diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the management of a patient with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.

- **Discussion**: A new presentation of adrenal insufficiency can range from nonspecific, minor symptoms including fatigue to a life-threatening adrenal crisis with hemodynamic instability. Due to the variety of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed. Those with known adrenal insufficiency are at risk for adrenal crisis, which may occur due to a variety of triggers. Initial evaluation includes assessment for the underlying etiology or concomitant condition, laboratory analysis, and imaging, when clinically indicated. Although not necessary for evaluation in the emergency department setting, the diagnosis is confirmed by specific testing, such as the cosyntropin stimulation test. The mainstay of treatment in adrenal crisis is hydrocortisone, intravenous fluid, glucose repletion, and treatment of the underlying acute trigger.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinicians must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage those with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111LrPaQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A low serum cortisol level, such as morning cortisol of 10.9 mcg/dL, is recommended by some experts to exclude adrenal insufficiency in cases of hyponatremia, based on prospective data. Depending on the etiology and clinical presentation, a cortisol level greater than 300 nmol/L may still be inappropriate for a patient under physiological stress. Thus, this threshold does not definitively exclude pathology. It is unclear whether more subtle hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis insufficiency causes hyponatremia. Those with a morning cortisol level less than 300 nmol/L (< 10.9 mcg/dL) may proceed to further evaluation with ACTH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations, the European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposition.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111sbwED]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The CRF test has been proposed for the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency and for distinguishing between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency. CRF (100 mcg) is injected intravenously, and ACTH and cortisol are measured every 15 minutes for 90 minutes. Patients with secondary adrenal failure have low ACTH levels that fail to respond to CRF, whereas patients with tertiary (hypothalamic) failure show a prolonged and exaggerated rise in ACTH levels following CRF. The CRF test is not widely used to assess the HPA axis due to its unacceptably low sensitivity.

- **Overnight metyrapone test**: The overnight metyrapone test assesses the negative feedback rather than stress-related cortisol responses by utilizing the capacity of metyrapone to inhibit 11β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, thereby stimulating ACTH production and consequently increasing 11-deoxycortisol levels. While some studies have reported the metyrapone test to be reliable, other authors have raised concerns about its sensitivity and specificity when using the traditional post-metyrapone 11-deoxycortisol level > 200 nmol/L to define normality. The diagnostic accuracy of the metyrapone test can be improved by integrating cortisol and ACTH levels with 11-deoxycortisol measurements. Nevertheless, the assay for 11-deoxycortisol is a manual assay and is not available in most laboratories, which limits the use of this test particularly as a first-line assessment of the HPA axis.

### Residual endogenous corticosteroid production in patients with adrenal insufficiency [^117JzTdz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare precursors of endogenous corticosteroid production in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Twenty patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and matched controls, along with 19 patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency, participated in this ancillary analysis of two different studies. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency were on stable hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy. Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency received two different doses of hydrocortisone in a randomized crossover study. The main outcome measures were concentrations of precursors of cortisol and aldosterone, measured by LC‐MS/MS.

Compared to controls, progressively lower concentrations of the glucocorticoid precursors 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone were found in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency on a lower hydrocortisone dose, secondary adrenal insufficiency on a higher hydrocortisone dose, and primary adrenal insufficiency, respectively. Half of the primary adrenal insufficient patients showed evidence of residual endogenous cortisol or aldosterone synthesis, as determined by quantifiable 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone concentrations.

In secondary adrenal insufficient patients with higher endogenous cortisol production, as indicated by 11-deoxycortisol concentrations above the median, no increased cortisol exposure was observed by both plasma pharmacokinetic parameters.

When interpreting the values of morning cortisol measurement, it is essential to consider that several factors can affect the results. Cortisol production is influenced by the sleep-wake cycle, with cortisol secretion reaching its peak just minutes before waking up. Thus, morning serum cortisol can appear falsely low in individuals with disrupted circadian rhythms, such as night shift workers, those experiencing jet lag, and individuals with severe insomnia. In addition, serum cortisol concentrations can be elevated in patients with increased cortisol-binding globulin, as seen during pregnancy and in women on oral estrogens. By contrast, serum cortisol concentrations can be decreased in patients with low albumin and cortisol-binding globulin, such as in hypoalbuminemic states like advanced cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition, as well as prolonged critical illness.

The interpretation of serum cortisol varies depending on the assays used. Available techniques for measuring serum cortisol, listed from least to most accurate, are immunoassays using polyclonal antibodies, immunoassays using a more specific monoclonal antibody to cortisol, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For example, in a large study of patients undergoing a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, baseline cortisol that excluded adrenal insufficiency varied between 336 nmol/L (12.2 μg/dL) and 506 nmol/L (18.3 μg/dL) when measured by three different immunoassays. Most prior studies used different forms of immunoassays rather than mass spectrometry-based assays. Therefore, it is important to highlight that, ideally, physicians should be familiar with these variances to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Guy57]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prior studies have shown that adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after glucocorticoid cessation due to the slow recovery of adrenal cortisol production. Persistent impairment of cortisol secretion beyond four years suggests that recovery of adrenal function is very unlikely, and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued. Additional regular testing beyond four years may not be helpful but can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

- **Assessment and treatment**: The panel suggests that patients with persistent adrenal insufficiency while on a physiologic daily dose equivalent of glucocorticoids for longer than one year should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist to assess for underlying causes of adrenal insufficiency other than glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (e.g. pituitary causes). Patients who experience an adrenal crisis while on glucocorticoids should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone. Furthermore, it is necessary to provide education to these patients regarding the adjustment of glucocorticoid substitution therapy doses during stressful situations to prevent adrenal crises or manage them.

- **Recommendation 2.12**: We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

- **Physiological rationale**: Secretion of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone is largely regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and potassium levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1152153f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, particularly concerning the corticotropin stimulation test, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of the standard dose test over other existing tests. For adults and children aged 2 years and older, a dose of 250 mcg should be used. For infants, 15 mcg/kg is recommended, and for other children under 2 years of age, a dose of 125 mcg is suggested. Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes are indicative of adrenal insufficiency.

### Evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients: Disease state review [^114WCf4X]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The definition of normal adrenal function in critically ill patients remains controversial, despite a large body of literature. This review explores the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients while discussing the authors' personal approach to patient management.

- **Methods**: Extensive literature review, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience were utilized.

- **Results**: A decrease in cortisol breakdown, rather than an increase in cortisol production, has been suggested as the main contributor to elevated cortisol levels in critically ill patients. The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency has multiple pathophysiologic flaws and is not supported by evidence. Patients with septic shock who are pressor-dependent or refractory to fluid resuscitation may receive a short course of hydrocortisone regardless of their serum cortisol levels or their response to a cosyntropin stimulation test (CST). Patients without septic shock who are suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should have their random cortisol levels measured. In patients with low and near-normal cortisol-binding proteins, a serum cortisol of 1.8 μg/dL is pertinent, although further studies are needed to define a normal range in critically ill patients based on both the severity and duration of illness.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualized for each patient and the results interpreted within the clinical context, understanding potential pitfalls of the test used. An alternative test should be performed if the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high. Clinical vigilance is required, and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally, and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress dose glucocorticoids during illness only.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, specifically concerning indications for testing, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend being aware of the potential for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients with any of the following:

- **Or recent use of non-oral corticosteroid formulations**: Presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Simultaneous use of multiple corticosteroid formulations**.

- **Use of high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids**.

- **Use of inhaled or topical corticosteroids for more than 1 year**.

- **Have received intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the previous 2 months**.

- **Receiving treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors**.

### Cortisol in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115qodaY]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can occur due to dysfunction of the adrenal gland (i.e. primary insufficiency), pituitary gland (i.e. secondary insufficiency), or hypothalamus (tertiary insufficiency). Although comparatively low cortisol values, relative to an adrenal standard or in response to ACTH stimulation, may indicate adrenal insufficiency, diagnosis typically requires both clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Nevertheless, individuals with blunted cortisol responses that do not yet meet criteria for adrenal insufficiency continue to show increased morbidities in mental and physical health.

Qualitative findings on cortisol levels relative to an adrenal standard in this review were inconsistent, with approximately 5% to 65% of participants with SCD displaying low cortisol on at least one occasion. However, these studies used several benchmarks to calculate the incidence rate, despite previously published guidelines suggesting that morning serum cortisol of < 165 nmol/L is the standard cutoff for primary adrenal insufficiency, and serum cortisol of < 100 nmol/L is the cutoff for secondary adrenal insufficiency. Newer research now suggests assay-specific cutoffs.

Finally, findings from this review suggest that ACTH-stimulated cortisol does not differ from that of healthy controls. Future research investigating ACTH response in SCD should consider using more sensitive methodologies and newer guidelines related to adrenal insufficiency diagnoses. In addition, it will be important to clarify SCD-specific mechanisms of adrenal response patterns to determine if, and how, hemolysis and ischemia affect these responses.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, specifically with respect to confirmation of recovery, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend considering referral to an endocrinology specialist for patients who are attempting to discontinue glucocorticoids but have not shown recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis within one year while on a physiological daily dose equivalent.

### Isolated corticotrophin deficiency [^114WaFdC]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) is a rare disorder characterized by secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI) with low or absent cortisol production, normal secretion of pituitary hormones other than ACTH, and the absence of structural pituitary defects. In adults, IAD may appear following a traumatic injury or lymphocytic hypophysitis, the latter possibly due to autoimmune etiology. Conversely, a genetic origin may come into play in neonatal or childhood IAD.

Patients with IAD usually fare relatively well during unstressed periods. However, intervening events may spark an acute adrenal crisis presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as asthenia, anorexia, unintentional weight loss, and a tendency towards hypoglycemia. Blood chemistry may reveal mild hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and normal-high potassium levels, mild anemia, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia. Morning serum cortisol below 3 microg/dl is virtually diagnostic for adrenal insufficiency, whereas cortisol values between 5–18 microg/dl require additional investigations.

- **Diagnostic tests**: The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the gold standard. However, when contraindicated, high or low dose-ACTH stimulation test with serum cortisol determination provides a viable alternative. Plasma ACTH concentration and prolonged ACTH infusion tests are useful in the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Treatment**: For some patients with mild, near-to-asymptomatic disease, glucocorticoid replacement therapy may not be required except during stressful events. For symptomatic patients, replacement doses, such as a mean daily dose of 20 mg, are recommended.

### Rates of adrenal insufficiency using a monoclonal vs. polyclonal cortisol assay [^112svzQ9]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency relies on clear cut-offs and accurate measurement of cortisol levels. Newer monoclonal antibody assays may increase the rate of diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. For example, if traditional cortisol cut-off levels of 18 mcg/dL fell, diagnosis rates shifted from 74% in 2016 (20 out of 27 tests) to 29% in 2017 (11 out of 38 tests).

The change in cortisol assay substantially increased the number of patients diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency following 1 mcg Cosyntropin stimulation testing. Standardization of cortisol assays and diagnostic criteria is critical for accurate diagnosis.

### Basal cortisol in relation to metyrapone confirmation in predicting adrenal insufficiency after pituitary surgery [^113RgFEp]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

Pituitary surgery can lead to post-surgical adrenal insufficiency, necessitating glucocorticoid replacement and causing a significant disease-related burden. At our center, in patients not receiving hydrocortisone replacement before surgery, an early morning plasma cortisol concentration is measured using a cut-off value of 450 nmol/L three days after surgery (POD3). This measurement is used to guide the need for hydrocortisone replacement until dynamic confirmatory testing with metyrapone is conducted. The aim of this study was to critically assess the currently used diagnostic and treatment algorithm in patients undergoing pituitary surgery at our pituitary reference center.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients with a POD3 plasma cortisol concentration of 200 nmol/L or less. The median cortisol concentration for patients with a metyrapone test result suggesting adrenal insufficiency was 360 nmol/L, and for patients with metyrapone test results excluding adrenal insufficiency, it was 357 nmol/L (Sensitivity 100%, Specificity 31%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 32%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 100%). This reflects a 28% reduction in the need for hydrocortisone replacement compared to the currently used cortisol cut-off value of 450 nmol/L.

### The long-term predictive accuracy of the short synacthen (corticotropin) stimulation test for assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [^111xChpP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The high-dose short Synacthen (corticotropin) test (SST) is widely used to investigate suspected secondary adrenal insufficiency, but concern remains about falsely reassuring results.

Our objective was to evaluate the long-term safety of the SST. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcome in 178 patients who achieved 30-min cortisol values in the lowest 15th percentile of normal healthy responses. Thirty patients were later excluded because of missing case notes (20 patients) or unsubstantiated pituitary pathology (10 patients). The remaining 148 patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, patients with cortisol response between the 5th and 15th percentiles of normal response (551–635 nmol/liter, 98 patients); and Group 2, patients with borderline response between the 2.5th and 5th percentiles (510–550 nmol/liter, 50 patients). Patients did not receive routine glucocorticoid therapy, but those in Group 2 were advised to take hydrocortisone in case of intercurrent illness.

The median follow-up period from the initial SST was 4.2 years (range, 4 months to 7 years). A total of 137 patients showed no clinical or biochemical evidence of adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. Of the remaining 11 patients, seven became hypoadrenal after subsequent pituitary surgery or radiotherapy. One patient in group 1 developed adrenal insufficiency at 2 years, and one patient in group 2 developed adrenal insufficiency at 6 months. The other two patients in group 2 had clinical diagnostic uncertainty.

The high-dose SST is safe for use in evaluating secondary adrenal insufficiency, with the majority of patients not developing adrenal insufficiency during follow-up.

### Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency [^116JCXoB]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal failure and the indications for corticosteroid therapy in critically ill patients are controversial. This controversy is fueled by the complexity of the issues and the paucity of data from high-quality clinical trials. Nevertheless, while the use of high-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS failed to improve outcomes and was associated with increased complications, an extended course of stress-dose corticosteroids has been reported to increase the occurrence of ventilator-free days and survival in select groups of ICU patients. These patients typically have an exaggerated proinflammatory response.

Until recently, the focus on the exaggerated proinflammatory response that characterizes critically ill patients with systemic inflammation has been on the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal failure. However, experimental and clinical data suggest that glucocorticoid tissue resistance may also play an important role. This complex syndrome is referred to as critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) and is defined as inadequate corticosteroid activity for the severity of the illness of a patient. The paper reviews cortisol physiology, CIRCI, and the role of corticosteroid therapy in critically ill patients.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is for these patients to continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some of the cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy.

- **Rationale**: Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior.

- **Dynamic testing options**: These include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less results that are reliable in patients on a shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy.

- **Labor-intensive tests**: The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115YL4Q1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of a morning cortisol level of less than 140 nmol/L in combination with ACTH. This is suggested as a preliminary test indicative of adrenal insufficiency when a corticotropin stimulation test is not feasible.

### Adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill: A new look at an old problem [^112zdxsi]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Stress from many sources, including pain, fever, and hypotension, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the sustained secretion of corticotropin and cortisol. Increased glucocorticoid action is an essential component of the stress response, and even minor degrees of adrenal insufficiency can be fatal in the stressed host. HPA dysfunction is a common and underdiagnosed disorder in the critically ill. We review the risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and management of HPA dysfunction in the critically ill.

The recommendations are categorized as "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for weak recommendations. The quality of evidence is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations based on good clinical practice and the experience of the working group are acknowledged as "good clinical practice" and are not formally graded. Recommendations not based on evidence or good clinical practice are ungraded (also see "Methods" section).

- **General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education**:
	- R 1.1: We recommend that, in general, patients on or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need evaluation by an endocrinology specialist.
	- R 1.2: We recommend that clinicians administering glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (Good clinical practice).
	- R 1.3: We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (Good clinical practice).

- **Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**:

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including comorbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency, or by the medical context, such as the training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

- **Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation**: Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until the recovery of the HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to the recommendations.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced endocrinopathies: Assessment, management and monitoring in a comprehensive cancer centre [^116hPS1n]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency rarely occurs in patients on ICIs and usually develops after several months of treatment. The range for developing adrenal insufficiency varies widely from weeks to more than 12 months. The symptoms may be nonspecific and include abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. Its prevalence may be underestimated due to concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids or the coexistence of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis has been reported in some cases, with hyponatremia being the main sign.

In our study, none of the patients developed primary adrenal insufficiency. This may be due to concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids, failure to screen all patients with a cortisol morning test regularly, the low incidence of primary adrenal insufficiency with ICI therapy, or irAE occurring after finishing treatment. Therefore, it is important to screen patients with AM cortisol and, if suspecting primary adrenal insufficiency, to continue workup with ACTH, electrolytes, renin, and aldosterone every 1–2 cycles. This should be followed by screening cortisol every 3–6 months once treatment is stopped to detect adrenal insufficiency and prevent adrenal crisis.

- **Clinical question III**: What is the diagnostic accuracy of a morning cortisol value vs 250 μg ACTH (1–24)-test in diagnosing glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value vs 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test. Of note, in the studies of Sagar et al. and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay.

In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed ACTH (1–24)-test. The results of the study by Sbardella et al. showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24)-test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported. Debono et al. found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors).

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Due to the ease and convenience of testing, combined with experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after withholding the glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. This test should be conducted only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (e.g. prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose).

Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including the measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, the 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, the overnight metyrapone test, and the insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited. Importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes.

Assessment should be conducted at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids, excluding dexamethasone. It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency. Yet, even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. This is due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency.

### Evaluating the low-dose ACTH stimulation test in children: Ideal times for cortisol measurement [^112d7tnr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be diagnosed with the low-dose ACTH stimulation test (LDST), with protocols for cortisol sampling timing varying, most commonly at 30 minutes after stimulation.

- **Objectives**: To determine optimal times to draw cortisol levels and factors predicting timing of peak cortisol levels in children undergoing LDST.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review of LDSTs between February 2014 and September 2017.

- **Setting**: The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.

- **Patients**: Patients aged 3 months to 20 years who underwent LDSTs.

- **Intervention**: LDSTs were performed with cortisol levels measured at 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after administering 1 μg cosyntropin. Cortisol values below 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) indicated AI.

- **Main outcome measures**: The incremental value of testing cortisol at 15 or 60 minutes, in addition to the standard 30-minute sample, was estimated.

Results found that a total of 221 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 9.7 years and 32% being female. Peak cortisol levels at 15, 30, and 60 minutes were 19%, 67%, and 14%, respectively. Testing at 15 or 60 minutes, in addition to the standard 30-minute test, would prevent one false positive LDST result for every 24 (95% CI, 13 to 46) or 55 (95% CI, 22 to 141) patients. Of the 122 patients who passed the LDST, discontinuing the 15- and 60-minute samples would have resulted in misdiagnosis for 12 patients (9.8%). Independent predictors of peak cortisol timing included glucocorticoid exposure, age, and body mass index z scores.

In conclusion, although the majority of patients peak 30 minutes after cosyntropin administration, the…

### Residual endogenous corticosteroid production in patients with adrenal insufficiency [^116Y1ZnM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare precursors of endogenous corticosteroid production in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Design**: Twenty patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and matched controls, along with nineteen patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency, participated in this ancillary analysis of two different studies.

- **Patients and measurements**: Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency were on stable hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy. Those with secondary adrenal insufficiency received two different doses of hydrocortisone in a randomized crossover study. **Main outcome measures were** concentrations of precursors of cortisol and aldosterone, measured by LC-MS/MS.

- **Results**: Compared to controls, there were progressively lower concentrations of the glucocorticoid precursors 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency on lower hydrocortisone dose, and those with secondary adrenal insufficiency on higher hydrocortisone dose, and primary adrenal insufficiency, respectively. Half of the primary adrenal insufficient patients showed evidence of residual endogenous cortisol or aldosterone synthesis, as determined by quantifiable 11-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone concentrations. In secondary adrenal insufficient patients with higher endogenous cortisol production, indicated by 11-deoxycortisol concentrations above the median, no increased cortisol exposure was observed, both by plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and 24-hour measurements.

### Keytruda [^115o1UQo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Immune-mediated endocrinopathies, such as adrenal insufficiency, can occur with the use of Keytruda. Keytruda may cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, it is essential to initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. The continuation of Keytruda should be determined by the severity of the condition [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Adrenal insufficiency was observed in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients treated with Keytruda. This included Grade 4 (< 0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were necessary for 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal insufficiency, and most of these patients continued on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resulted in the permanent discontinuation of Keytruda in less than 0.1% (1) of patients, and in withholding Keytruda in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who had Keytruda withheld were able to restart the treatment after their symptoms improved.

Keytruda can also cause immune-mediated hypophysitis, which may manifest with acute symptoms due to mass effect, such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can lead to hypopituitarism. Hormone replacement should be initiated as indicated. Keytruda should be withheld or permanently discontinued based on the severity of hypophysitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Utility of salivary cortisol and cortisone in the diagnostics of adrenal insufficiency [^117TyPBt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The standard cosyntropin stimulation test is the most commonly used dynamic test for adrenal function, whether primary, secondary, or tertiary. The principle of the cosyntropin test involves stimulating the adrenal cortex by injecting a synthetic analogue of ACTH (ACTH 1–24) called cosyntropin. The test should be performed with the patient in a supine position, and the cortisol response is measured 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous (IV) injection. When analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a normal response is defined as serum cortisol (s-cortisol) levels above 412 nmol/L after 30 minutes and 485 nmol/L after 60 minutes. Patients on oral estrogens risk false-positive test results due to increased cortisol binding globulin (CBG) levels. Basal morning s-cortisol levels and home waking saliva (sa)-cortisone sampling are good alternatives to the cosyntropin test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency.

Salivary cortisol (sa-cortisol) measurements are commonly used in diagnosing Cushing syndrome, but their role in diagnosing adrenal insufficiency (AI) remains to be established. The correlation between s-cortisol and sa-cortisol is very high, extending to dynamic diagnostic tests such as the dexamethasone suppression test and the cosyntropin stimulation test. Indeed, the correlation between s-cortisol and sa-cortisone is even more pronounced, likely due to the extensive expression of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD type 2) in the salivary glands.

### Adrenal function and dysfunction in critically ill patients [^111wuWdn]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Critical illnesses are characterized by increased systemic cortisol availability, which is a vital part of the stress response. Relative adrenal failure, later termed critical-illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI), is a condition in which the systemic availability of cortisol is assumed to be insufficiently high to face the stress of the illness and is most typically thought to occur in the acute phase of septic shock. Researchers suggested that CIRCI could be diagnosed by a suppressed incremental cortisol response to an injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone, irrespective of the baseline plasma cortisol. This concept triggered several randomized clinical trials on the impact of large stress doses of hydrocortisone to treat CIRCI, which gave conflicting results. Recent novel insights into the response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to acute and prolonged critical illnesses challenge the concept of CIRCI, as currently defined, as well as the practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. In this review, these novel insights are integrated within a novel conceptual framework that can be used to re-appreciate adrenocortical function and dysfunction in the context of critical illness. This framework opens new avenues for further research and for preventive and/or therapeutic innovations.

### Basal cortisol in relation to metyrapone confirmation in predicting adrenal insufficiency after pituitary surgery [^116wfw6X]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

Pituitary surgery can lead to post-surgical adrenal insufficiency with the need for glucocorticoid replacement, resulting in a significant disease-related burden. For patients not receiving hydrocortisone replacement before surgery at our center, an early morning plasma cortisol concentration with a cut-off value of 450 nmol/L, 3 days after surgery (POD3), is used to guide the need for hydrocortisone replacement until dynamic confirmatory testing using metyrapone is performed. This study aimed to critically assess the currently used diagnostic and treatment algorithm in patients undergoing pituitary surgery in our pituitary reference center.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients with a POD3 plasma cortisol concentration. Hypocortisolemia was defined as a concentration of 450 nmol/L or lower on the day of metyrapone testing. In the cohort, metyrapone confirmed secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) in 21% of patients with a POD3 cortisol level ranging from 200–450 nmol/L. The median serum cortisol level on the day of confirmed SAI (defined as 11-deoxycortisol < 200 nmol/L) was 357 nmol/L, with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 31%, positive predictive value of 32%, and negative predictive value of 100%. This approach results in a 28% reduction in the need for hydrocortisone replacement compared to the currently used cortisol cut-off value of 450 nmol/L.

- **Conclusion**: Early metyrapone testing offers a more precise assessment for guiding glucocorticoid replacement therapy after pituitary surgery.

Regarding the medical management of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, particularly in the context of tapering corticosteroids, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend considering a switch from long-acting corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, to shorter-acting corticosteroids, like hydrocortisone or prednisone, when the use of long-acting corticosteroids is no longer necessary.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: The added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^1135iuNx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To review the biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we examined relevant literature, including our own data, on various biochemical tests utilized to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are helpful only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated, whereas baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are beneficial only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are particularly valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level of this steroid is not adequate by itself for establishing the diagnosis. However, a normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measuring baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. Additionally, determining plasma levels of aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. A random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both) aids in ruling out the diagnosis.

Summary of methods used for guideline development

The methods used for establishing the guideline have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions (see below), followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded (see below).

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences, including patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, and feasibility of implementation. The recommendations are worded as "recommend" (strong recommendation) or "suggest" (weak recommendation). The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policymakers, and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation, while for a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not. Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions (see "Clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and definition of endpoints" section). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the committee members were included but not formally graded.

### Recorlev [^113LpEp7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Recorlev lowers cortisol levels and may lead to hypocortisolism with the potential for life-threatening adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was observed in 7% of patients during the clinical program of Recorlev [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Lowering of cortisol levels can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and dizziness. Significant lowering of serum cortisol levels may result in adrenal insufficiency, which can be manifested by hypotension, abnormal electrolyte levels, and hypoglycemia.

Hypocortisolism may occur at any time during Recorlev treatment. Evaluate patients for precipitating causes of hypocortisolism, such as infection or physical stress. Regularly monitor 24-hour urine free cortisol, morning serum or plasma cortisol, and the patient's signs and symptoms during Recorlev treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Decrease the dosage or temporarily discontinue Recorlev if urine free cortisol or morning blood cortisol levels fall below the target range, there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels, or if signs and/or symptoms consistent with hypocortisolism are reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Stop Recorlev and administer exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy if morning serum or plasma cortisol levels are below the target range and signs and/or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism, are present. After Recorlev discontinuation, cortisol suppression may persist beyond the 4- to 6-hour half-life of Recorlev.

If treatment is interrupted due to hypocortisolism, re-init…

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1142FRtj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration are likely to experience more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients who exhibit features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course due to glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

Slowly decreasing the glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients who have undergone curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, baseline clinical severity scores were associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose fell below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess. This assessment may also be applied to patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids to determine the proper tapering speed — slower for those with high clinical severity scores and more rapid for those with lower scores. In patients experiencing severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower taper, it may be necessary to temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose.

### Clinical utility of stimulation tests in infants with suspected adrenal insufficiency (AI) [^11295UQQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in infants can be difficult. While a low random cortisol can signal AI, often confirmatory tests are required when clinical suspicion is strong but the cortisol levels are equivocal. Several studies have demonstrated that in sick preterm infants, there is relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) defined as an inadequate cortisol production relative to the degree of stress or illness, a condition which can last for several weeks, while in term infants the adrenal axis is mature at birth.

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation tests have been validated in infants in several studies. In light of recent reports of false-negative results of stimulation tests, it is imperative to highlight the pitfalls of these tests. The purpose of this communication is to bring attention to the accuracy of timing of these tests in infants.
