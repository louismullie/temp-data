## Question

Vulvular lentigo vs melanoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate "vulvar lentigo" (most plausibly vulvar melanosis or genital lentigines) from vulvar melanoma and to outline an evidence-based diagnostic and management pathway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and taxonomy so I don't conflate benign entities with melanoma. Then, I should verify the key elements of clinical history and examination that increase suspicion for malignancy. Next, I will review dermoscopic features and their limitations, followed by when and how to biopsy. After that, I need to examine histopathologic criteria that separate melanosis/lentigines from melanoma and note pitfalls such as lichen sclerosus. Finally, if melanoma is confirmed, I should confirm staging, imaging, nodal assessment, surgical margins, and systemic therapy, and close with multidisciplinary care and follow-up considerations, including prognosis and patient counseling.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "vulvar lentigo" is not a standard diagnostic label and can mislead decision-making. Wait, I should verify whether this refers to vulvar melanosis (genital melanosis/lentiginosis) or to genital lentigines, both generally benign, versus true melanoma. Vulvar melanosis represents benign basal keratinocyte hyperpigmentation with little to no melanocytic proliferation and typically accounts for most pigmented vulvar lesions, whereas genital lentigines are benign melanocytic proliferations that may look worrisome clinically but lack malignant cytology on histology [^1126Qxbg] [^114A7ZU3]. In contrast, vulvar melanoma is a malignant melanocytic neoplasm with invasive potential and poorer outcomes compared to cutaneous melanoma, comprising about 1% of melanomas in women and 5% of vulvar cancers, with markedly lower 5‑year OS than cutaneous melanoma, so I need to be cautious not to under-triage suspicious lesions [^112ep4QA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — clinical context matters. I should confirm features in the history that raise concern: documented change in size, shape, or color; bleeding, ulceration, or pain; and relatively rapid evolution are red flags for melanoma, whereas benign melanosis often remains stable or changes slowly over years. The ABCDE criteria still help in the vulva: asymmetry, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter greater than around 6 mm, and evolution should all be assessed carefully during examination, even though small melanomas can occur and benign lesions can be large in mucosal sites [^113558Ps] [^116m5BxQ]. Let me think about prevalence too, because pigmented vulvar lesions are common in up to 10% of women, which explains why diagnostic anxiety is frequent, yet most are benign, emphasizing the need for a measured but vigilant approach [^113tP4Fq].

> I will now examine the expected clinical morphologies so I can anchor suspicion appropriately. Vulvar melanosis typically appears as single or multiple asymptomatic macules or patches of variable size and shades of brown, sometimes asymmetric with indistinct borders, often on the labia minora, and can slowly enlarge over time without malignant transformation. Conversely, vulvar melanoma more often presents as a pigmented plaque or nodule with asymmetry, border irregularity, multicolor hues, and symptoms when advanced; the mean size at diagnosis is large due to delay, with frequent ulceration or bleeding when thicker, underscoring the diagnostic challenge [^1126Qxbg] [^113558Ps] [^112ep4QA].

> Next, I should review dermoscopy, but wait, I need to remind myself that dermoscopy on mucosal sites has limitations and overlap with benign lesions. Features favoring benignity include homogeneous or parallel/ring-like/globular-like/reticular-like patterns, whereas vulvar melanoma is frequently asymmetric in structure and color and may show blue-white veil or blue-gray areas, structureless zones, irregular dots/globules, atypical vessels, and a multicomponent pattern. The International Dermoscopy Society notes that blue, gray, or white color plus a structureless zone yields high sensitivity but imperfect specificity, so dermoscopy cannot reliably exclude melanoma and should guide, not replace, biopsy decisions [^117DN4Ao] [^111qxQYJ] [^111F2zty].

> I need to ensure the threshold for biopsy is appropriate. Given the overlap of patterns and the consequences of delay, biopsy is mandatory for lesions with concerning clinical or dermoscopic features, or when there is evolution or diagnostic uncertainty. Let me double-check technique: for small lesions, excisional biopsy is preferred to assess architecture and depth; for large lesions, a targeted punch of the thickest/darkest or most atypical area is reasonable. For multiple lesions, I should map meticulously, documenting clock-face position and distances, and include the lesional edge when possible to capture background dermatoses that may confound interpretation per BGCS recommendations [^111bkeam] [^111qxQYJ] [^116HroZk] [^115zbJDG].

> Now, histopathology is the gold standard, but I should confirm key distinctions and pitfalls. Vulvar melanosis shows increased basal melanin with normal or only slightly increased melanocytes, lacking atypia or pagetoid spread, sometimes with pigment incontinence and dermal melanophages. Genital lentigines show a benign increase in melanocytes without significant cytologic atypia; nests may be irregular but should not show malignant features. In contrast, melanoma displays atypical melanocytic proliferation with architectural disorder, pagetoid spread, cytologic atypia and mitoses, and possibly ulceration; immunohistochemistry with S-100, Melan-A/MART-1, and HMB-45 supports lineage and can highlight pagetoid extension, especially when architecture is distorted by inflammation or sclerosis [^114A7ZU3] [^113yWowf] [^111Aa1g9].

> But wait, what if lichen sclerosus is present — doesn't that complicate things? Yes, I should double-check for LS because it can produce worrisome clinical and histologic changes, including pigment incontinence, atypia of entrapped melanocytes, and disrupted nests that mimic melanoma; in such settings, careful clinicopathologic correlation and, at times, additional levels or ancillary stains are necessary. Although there are rare reports of melanoma arising with LS, vulvar pigmented lesions in LS are overwhelmingly benign, so I must avoid overcalling melanoma while not missing it [^111Aa1g9] [^114A7ZU3].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost labeled "melanoma in situ (lentigo maligna type)" on the vulva as if LM were a typical vulvar entity. Hold on, I should verify: lentigo maligna classically arises on chronically sun-damaged head and neck skin, not the vulva, so applying the LM label to a vulvar in situ melanoma is a mistake. Let me correct that and refer to it simply as melanoma in situ of the vulva; LM is a distinct subtype tied to photo-damage and not a genital lesion, even though its diagnostic framework and management principles for in situ disease inform margin considerations elsewhere [^113yWowf] [^113Z56SN].

> If melanoma is confirmed, I need to ensure proper staging and imaging. I should use AJCC 8th edition cutaneous melanoma criteria rather than FIGO, as AJCC better predicts outcomes in vulvar melanoma, with T category driven by Breslow thickness and ulceration, and preoperative imaging commonly recommended due to frequent advanced presentation. MRI helps define local extent for surgical planning, while CT or PET-CT evaluates nodal and distant disease, with BGCS endorsing combined MRI and CT and PET-CT selectively in vulvar melanoma [^113N6RFo] [^116drHbt] [^1148o3aF].

> I should confirm regional nodal evaluation strategy next. Sentinel lymph node biopsy should generally be offered to clinically node-negative patients as a reliable staging method, recognizing practice variability by T stage and site, and that macrometastatic sentinel disease warrants completion inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy per ESGO. For midline tumors, I need to ensure bilateral sentinel node mapping and proceed with contralateral dissection if only unilateral mapping is achieved, ideally aligned with melanoma MDT input per BGCS and ESGO guidance [^112V33UG] [^117DriZ8] [^112hJwE1] [^114STniq].

> Now, surgery for the primary must be precise yet conservative. I should target an R0 resection with the least radicality feasible, applying standard Breslow-based clinical margins used for cutaneous melanoma: 0.5–1 cm for in situ disease, 1 cm for invasive lesions up to 1 mm, 1–2 cm for 1.01–2 mm, and 2 cm for thickness greater than 2 mm, modified as needed for anatomic function. Let me reconsider the extent of resection: more radical vulvectomy does not improve survival over wide local excision but increases morbidity, so conservative, margin-adequate excision is preferred in vulvar melanoma [^112V33UG] [^111uLx2t] [^114jVAtH] [^111pHLSD].

> Next, I should review adjuvant and systemic therapy. For resected node-positive disease, checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab or pembrolizumab are reasonable by extrapolation from cutaneous melanoma, acknowledging the limited mucosal subset data. Given the relatively high prevalence of c-KIT mutations in vulvar melanoma compared to cutaneous disease, KIT-targeted agents like imatinib may be considered in refractory or advanced settings when mutations are present, whereas BRAF/MEK combinations are reserved for the smaller subset with BRAF mutations. For advanced or unresectable disease, anti–PD-1 therapy is a first-line option, with case-based evidence even supporting neoadjuvant use when mutilating surgery is anticipated and declined, though multidisciplinary review is essential [^115q1grh] [^111WQ18h] [^112jpv5k] [^114xZVhe].

> For benign diagnoses, I need to ensure management is proportionate. Stable, classic vulvar melanosis or genital lentigines can be observed with photographic documentation; excision may be offered for diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms, or patient preference. If lichen sclerosus coexists, I should treat it per guidelines and maintain a low threshold for rebiopsy of changing areas, as LS can cloud clinical and histologic interpretation; more broadly, clinicians should keep a low threshold for biopsy of atypical pigmented vulvar lesions given the diagnostic difficulty at this site [^113ibWDy] [^111Aa1g9] [^115DCYVy] [^1126Qxbg].

> I should confirm prognostic counseling and follow-up. Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, and particularly nodal status drive outcomes in vulvar melanoma, with the number of positive nodes being a dominant predictor. Urethral involvement has been associated with higher mortality and local recurrence risk, underscoring the need for careful pathologic assessment of margins and adjacent structures. Survival remains inferior to cutaneous melanoma even when matched, so vigilant surveillance and prompt evaluation of new or recurrent pigmented vulvar lesions are warranted [^112tyzsy] [^112NcLtg] [^117EteiW] [^114rApDK].

> Finally, I need to ensure multidisciplinary coordination and documentation. Management should occur in collaboration with gynecologic oncology and melanoma multidisciplinary teams, with clear biopsy mapping and site documentation for multifocal disease to guide treatment and surveillance. Tumor board review is particularly important for advanced presentations and when contemplating neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy or complex reconstructions, helping to balance oncologic control with function and quality of life [^116HroZk] [^116GjR35] [^114STniq].

Vulvar lentigo and melanoma can look similar, but key differences guide diagnosis and management. Vulvar lentigo is **benign** and typically presents as stable, symmetric, uniformly pigmented macules with regular borders and no dermal invasion. In contrast, **vulvar melanoma is malignant**, often asymmetric with irregular borders, variegated color, and potential for invasion and metastasis [^113558Ps]. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathology; any atypical or evolving lesion should be biopsied to exclude melanoma [^113ibWDy] [^116HroZk].

---

## Clinical features

### Vulvar lentigo

- **Appearance**: Flat, symmetric macules with uniform light to dark brown pigmentation and regular borders.
- **Symptoms**: Typically asymptomatic, stable over time, and non-evolving.
- **Location**: Commonly on labia minora, labia majora, and vestibule.
- **Dermoscopy**: Homogeneous pigmentation, parallel or ring-like patterns, and absence of atypical vascular structures [^117DN4Ao].

---

### Vulvar melanoma

- **Appearance**: Asymmetric lesions with irregular borders, variegated color (brown, black, blue, gray, white, red), and possible ulceration or bleeding [^113558Ps].
- **Symptoms**: May present with pruritus, pain, bleeding, or ulceration, especially in advanced stages [^113558Ps].
- **Location**: Frequently involves labia minora, clitoris, and periurethral area [^111pHLSD].
- **Dermoscopy**: Asymmetry, blue-white veil, irregular dots/globules, atypical vessels, and multicomponent patterns [^111qxQYJ] [^111F2zty].

---

## Histopathological differences

| **Feature** | **Vulvar lentigo** | **Vulvar melanoma** |
|-|-|-|
| Melanocyte proliferation | - Mild <br/> - Basal layer <br/> - No atypia | - Atypical melanocytes <br/> - Pagetoid spread <br/> - Dermal invasion |
| Cytologic atypia | Absent | Present |
| Dermal invasion | Absent | Present |
| Mitotic activity | Absent | Present |
| Immunohistochemistry | - S-100: negative or weak <br/> - HMB-45: negative <br/> - Melan-A: negative | - S-100: positive <br/> - HMB-45: positive <br/> - Melan-A: positive |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical examination**: Assess asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter, and evolution (ABCDE criteria) [^116m5BxQ].
- **Dermoscopy**: Identify atypical features suggestive of melanoma [^111qxQYJ].
- **Biopsy**: Perform excisional or punch biopsy [^111bkeam] for definitive diagnosis [^113ibWDy]; include lesion edge [^115zbJDG] and document mapping [^116HroZk].
- **Histopathology**: Evaluate melanocyte proliferation, cytologic atypia, dermal invasion, and mitotic activity [^112tyzsy].
- **Immunohistochemistry**: Use S-100, HMB-45, and Melan-A to differentiate benign from malignant lesions [^113yWowf].

## Management strategies

### Vulvar lentigo

For vulvar lentigo, **observation** involves no treatment with regular follow-up to confirm stability, and **patient education** should emphasize its benign nature and warning signs of malignant transformation [^115DCYVy].

---

### Vulvar melanoma

Wide local excision with clear margins (≥ 1 cm), according to Breslow thickness, is recommended [^112V33UG], and **sentinel lymph node biopsy** [^114UjXi5] should be performed for invasive melanoma to assess regional metastasis. **Adjuvant therapy** may include immunotherapy (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or targeted therapy (BRAF/MEK inhibitors) for advanced disease [^115q1grh], and **follow-up** requires regular surveillance for recurrence or metastasis [^1121TtA8].

---

## Prognosis

Vulvar lentigo has an **excellent prognosis** with no risk of metastasis or recurrence if correctly diagnosed, whereas **Vulvar melanoma** carries a poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior and a high risk of recurrence and metastasis; 5-year survival is ~47% [^112ep4QA] [^114rApDK].

---

## Clinical pitfalls and challenges

Clinical and histopathological overlap can lead to misdiagnosis, and melanoma is often diagnosed late because early features are subtle [^111F2zty]. Biopsy is essential for **definitive diagnosis**, and clinicians should maintain a low threshold for sampling suspicious lesions [^115DCYVy]. Vulvar lentigo is a benign, stable lesion with uniform pigmentation and no invasion, whereas vulvar melanoma is malignant, asymmetric, and invasive; **histopathology is essential** for diagnosis, and any atypical or evolving lesion should be biopsied to exclude melanoma [^113ibWDy].

### Clinical and dermoscopic features of vulvar melanosis over the last 20 years [^1126Qxbg]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Vulvar melanosis is a common pigmentary change accounting for most pigmented vulvar lesions. It presents as single or multiple asymptomatic macules or patches of varying size and color that may be asymmetric with poorly defined borders. The differential diagnosis of melanocytic lesions includes melanoma, which creates anxiety for patients and the physicians who diagnose and treat the condition. To evaluate the clinical and dermoscopic features of vulvar melanosis and their changes over time, a cohort study was conducted.

In this study, patients with vulvar melanosis were recruited and followed up in the Department of Dermatology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy, between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2019. Data on patient characteristics and on both the clinical and dermoscopic features of the vulvar lesions were collected. Each lesion was photographed clinically and dermoscopically at initial evaluation and at annual follow-up visits.

The main outcomes and measures focused on the clinical, dermoscopic, and histopathologic features of vulvar melanosis and their changes over time. This cohort study included 129 women (mean age at diagnosis, 46 years [range, 19–83 years]) with vulvar melanosis. A total of 87 patients (67%) with vulvar melanotic lesions were premenopausal, and 84 patients (65%) had received some type of hormone therapy. The most frequent location for vulvar melanosis was the labia minora (55 [43%]), followed by the labia majora (33 [26%]).

In 39 of 129 cases (30%), the lesions increased in size and changed over time.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^111qxQYJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The introduction of dermoscopy as a diagnostic tool and the development of several algorithms have improved the early detection of cutaneous malignant melanoma over recent years. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma, studies on the dermoscopy of vulvar melanomas (VMs) are limited by small case numbers.

- **Dermoscopy features**: Table 2 summarizes the dermoscopy features of VMs from a total of 38 patients identified in the literature. The most common features were asymmetry of structure and color (91.7%), blue-white veil or blue-gray areas (68.4%), structureless areas (47.4%), irregular dots and globules (42.1%), atypical vessels (42.1%), irregular network or atypical patterns (34.2%), and reticular depigmentation (16.7%). The characteristic dermoscopy features in VM are shown in Fig. 3.

- **Study findings**: A retrospective study by the International Dermoscopy Society evaluated the application of dermoscopy for genital lesions and suggested that the presence of a blue, gray, or white color plus a structureless zone had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 82.2% to detect a melanoma. Ferrari et al. proposed that a multicomponent pattern, composed of irregular brown-black dots, blue-white veil, atypical vessels, and reticular depigmentation, appears to be characteristic features for VMs.

However, there remains a significant overlap between benign and malignant lesions, and a biopsy should be performed in all suspicious lesions for a definitive diagnosis. Particularly with larger or multiple lesions, meticulous mapping of the biopsy site is mandatory, noting the position on the clock face with distance from the midline and vaginal opening.

Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Melanoma in situ is a condition where a wide local excision with 1 cm free surgical margins is recommended. Melanoma in situ is rarely seen in the vulva and appears to progress gradually to invasive melanoma. In some reports, an association with lichen sclerosus is detected during the in situ phase, which usually disappears at later invasive stages.

An excisional biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosis in small lesions, with complete excision and depth to rule out invasion. A punch biopsy can also be used for large lesions, targeting the thickest area of the lesion. A wide local excision with 1 cm free surgical margins is considered curative, and there is no need for lymph node assessment. Prognosis is usually excellent, being slightly better for melanoma in situ developing from melanocytic nevi compared with those de novo.

Only one study reported details of patients with vulvar melanoma in situ. The study evaluated 394 patients with a median age of 63. The 5-year overall survival rate was 74.4%. Vulvar melanoma in situ and invasive melanoma show worse overall survival compared with non-vulvar melanomas.

### Thin vulvar melanoma: A challenging diagnosis. Dermoscopic features of a case series [^111F2zty]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Vulvar melanoma (VM) is rare and often diagnosed late. Dermoscopy may aid in its recognition, differentiating VM from other, more common vulvar lesions, such as melanosis and naevi. However, little is known about the dermoscopic features of thin VM.

- **Aim**: To retrospectively analyse a series of histopathologically diagnosed thin VMs and to highlight their most suggestive dermoscopic features.

- **Methods**: A multicentre, retrospective study was conducted, including histopathologically proven thin VMs, either intraepidermal or with Breslow thickness ≤ 0.5 mm, diagnosed during the period 2016–2018. We particularly focused on their dermoscopic characteristics to highlight the most suggestive dermoscopic diagnostic clues.

- **Results**: In total, 14 cases of early-stage VM were included, in women with a mean age at diagnosis of 64.86 years. The most frequently affected sites were the labia minora. Of these, 11 cases were unifocal. Dermoscopy most often revealed structureless areas, grey globules and areas, irregular black-brown dots, blue and white structures, and red areas.

- **Conclusions**: In our experience, early-stage VM often exhibits dermoscopic features that are more typical of thicker cutaneous melanomas. Dermoscopy may provide useful clues for the prompt diagnosis of thin VM.

### Prolonged evolution of a lentigo maligna [^113Z56SN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lentigo maligna (LM) is a melanocytic lesion which is a potential precursor to melanoma, often exhibiting a prolonged intraepidermal growth phase before evolving into lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM). LM is also noted for its tendency to locally recur after treatment. We present a patient who had a persistent LM on her left cheek which, despite multiple excisions, persisted and transformed into a partially amelanotic LMM roughly three decades later. Our patient's course was also notable for this melanoma recurring at the edge of, and subsequently migrating into, a previously placed skin graft.

### Vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma: An epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic review [^113tP4Fq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pigmented vulvar lesions are present in approximately 1 in 10 women and include melanocytic and nonmelanocytic proliferations. Vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma are particularly challenging due to the similarity of their clinical and/or histopathological presentation. As a result, they are often difficult to diagnose, which may result in patient and physician anxiety and can lead to unnecessary, potentially disfiguring surgical procedures. Because it is often detected late, vulvar melanoma carries a poor prognosis with associated significant morbidity and mortality, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and treatment.

In this review, we analyze the distinct epidemiologic, clinical, and histopathologic characteristics of vulvar nevi, melanosis, and melanoma, discuss treatment options, and propose a practical, systematic approach to facilitate the formulation of a differential diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management.

Pigmented lesions represent an enormous range of conditions, from benign to malignant tumors, and from infectious to post-inflammatory. These lesions are much less easily diagnosed on anogenital skin, and clinicians should have a low threshold for biopsy confirmation of diseases not classic in appearance.

### Cancer of the vulva: A review [^1123LgQw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Vulvar cancers, although rare, are becoming an increasingly serious threat to women's health. Cancer of the vulva accounted for 0.3% of all new cancers in the United States in 2019, with 6,070 newly diagnosed cases. This review details the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of vulvar malignancies.

- **Objective**: To review cancer entities of the vulva, including vulvar intraepithelial neoplasms, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and adenocarcinomas.

- **Materials and methods**: Literature review using PubMed search for articles related to cancer of the vulva.

- **Results**: Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasms represent premalignant precursors to SCC of the vulva. There are several different histopathologic subtypes of SCC, and treatment is dependent on characteristics of the primary tumor and lymph node involvement. Melanoma is the second most common cancer to affect the vulva, and staging is based on tumor, node, and metastatic spread.

- **Conclusion**: Vulvar malignancies are rare, and diagnosis is dependent on biopsy and pathologic evaluation. Treatment for vulvar malignancies depends on histopathologic diagnosis but ranges from wide local excision with or without lymph node biopsy or dissection to radiation therapy with chemo- or immunotherapy. Overall survival varies by diagnosis.

### Does the morphology of cutaneous melanoma help to explain the international differences in survival? Results from 1 578 482 adults diagnosed during 2000–2014 in 59 countries (CONCORD-3) [^1113wmx5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Our population‐based study confirms these findings. The multivariable analysis of data from four population‐based registries with complete information on stage and morphology highlights a much higher excess risk of death for nodular or acral lentiginous melanoma than for superficial spreading melanoma, after controlling for major confounders. Sex, age, and stage at diagnosis only partially explain the higher risk of death for nodular and acral lentiginous subtypes. The different magnitude of the excess hazard ratios in Germany, Spain, and Norway may be due to the low baseline hazard for superficial spreading melanoma in Germany, where national skin cancer screening for people aged 35 years or more who have health insurance was introduced in 2008. This may have improved early detection of the generally slow-growing, less aggressive superficial spreading melanomas.

Our study has also shown that while 5-year survival from cutaneous melanoma in Eastern Europe has been increasing in recent years, survival continues to lag behind the rest of Europe for each morphological subtype of melanoma. A study of seven common malignancies diagnosed in Europe during 2000–2007 found that late stage at diagnosis alone did not explain the lower survival for melanoma of the skin in Eastern Europe. In the study, data on stage at diagnosis in Eastern European countries were available only for Russia and Slovakia, where the proportion of metastatic disease (6% and 7%) was higher than in Norway (2%) and Denmark (3%) (data not shown). More detailed information on morphology would have helped in understanding these disparities fully.

### Topical imiquimod and in situ vulvar melanoma: A promising therapy [^116NFjT7]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

In gynecologic diseases, imiquimod is often used as an off-label treatment. In selected cases, it can be considered an alternative therapeutic choice to avoid repeated and mutilating surgery. Several clinical trials have shown promising results in human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. The complete response rate for imiquimod-treated women with HPV-related vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia ranges from 35% to 81%, from 2 to 6 months after treatment. Different treatment schedules and heterogeneous populations included in the trials could explain the different response rates. A long-term follow-up at 7.2 years reported a persistent complete clinical response (CCR) in eight of nine patients who had responded to topical 5% imiquimod treatment.

Imiquimod has also been shown to be a safe, conservative treatment option for in situ vulvar Paget's disease with minimal adverse effects. Although surgical resection represents the gold standard of therapy, considering Paget's disease growth pattern with occult intradermal spread, surgical resection margin results are often involved. Thus, incomplete resection might lead to multiple and destructive surgeries. Topical 5% imiquimod minimized the morbidity of repeated surgery, achieving a CCR of 22% to 90% of cases. The treatment regimen varies among studies, from one to five applications weekly, according to patients' tolerability. Based on this data, imiquimod should be applied for at least 16 weeks.

In the last fifteen years, topical 5% imiquimod has been increasingly used as an adjuvant or complementary treatment post-surgery, finding a wide acceptance.

### Does the morphology of cutaneous melanoma help to explain the international differences in survival? Results from 1 578 482 adults diagnosed during 2000–2014 in 59 countries (CONCORD-3) [^111W18UW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, superficial spreading melanoma was the second most common histological subtype, accounting for 36% of all cases. It comprised more than half of the patients in Denmark, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Nodular melanoma represented 7% of all cases in North America and Asia, 9% in Oceania, and 13% in Central and South America. In Europe, 12% of cases were identified as nodular melanoma, with higher proportions in the Czech Republic, Ireland, Norway, Romania, Slovakia, and Sweden. About 6% of adults were diagnosed with lentigo maligna melanoma, ranging from 2% in Asia to 8% in Oceania.

Acral lentiginous melanoma was very rare in North America, Europe, and Oceania, with less than 2% of all cases. However, the proportion was higher in Central and South America, exceeding 10% in Colombia, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, and Martinique, as well as in Asia, exceeding 10% in Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. Less than 1% of patients were diagnosed with desmoplastic melanoma. The proportion of patients diagnosed with other morphological subtypes was higher than 20% in Estonia, Italy, and Latvia.

Age-standardized 5-year net survival varied widely across world regions. It ranged from 85% to 89% in Oceania and North America during 2010–2014 and was higher than 80% in all Western European countries, with a range of 54% to 79% in Eastern Europe.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^113558Ps]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Clinically, vulvar melanomas (VMs) may remain oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic as flat or raised pigmented lesions during the early disease stages. Amelanotic melanomas account for only 2% of all VMs. At the time of diagnosis, lesions present with a mean size of 3 cm (standard deviation ± 4 cm) and may be associated with pruritus, ulceration, or bleeding — symptoms that typically occur in advanced stages of melanoma.

Differential diagnoses of pigmented vulvar lesions include genital nevi, vulvar melanosis, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, and pigmented seborrheic keratosis. Differentiating VMs from benign vulvar lesions is often challenging and sometimes impossible based on clinical judgment alone. The "ABCDE" rule may aid as a simple guide for a first assessment of pigmented lesions: "A" stands for asymmetry, as most melanomas are asymmetrical; "B" stands for border, as melanomas typically exhibit an irregular border, while nevi typically have a smoother border. "C" stands for color, as benign moles are often unicolor brown, whereas multiple colors, including different shades of brown, black, blue, white, or red, are typically a sign of malignancy. "D" stands for diameter, and lesions greater than 6 mm should raise awareness. "E" stands for elevation or evolving, and any change in shape, size, structure, color, or symptoms is a potential indicator of malignancy.

### Comparison of surgical margins for lentigo maligna versus melanoma in situ [^116KHXgf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have shown that a 5-mm surgical margin is inadequate for excision of melanoma in situ. Some studies have suggested that a wider margin is needed only for the lentigo maligna subtype.

- **Objective**: To compare subclinical extension of lentigo maligna with that of melanoma in situ, and to investigate the effect of other factors on the extent of subclinical extension.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected series of noninvasive melanomas was studied. Original pathology reports were used to identify lentigo maligna and compare data for that subtype with data for the remaining melanomas in situ.

- **Results**: A total of 1506 lentigo maligna cases and 829 melanomas in situ were included. To obtain a 97% clearance rate, both lentigo maligna and melanoma in situ required a 12-mm margin on the head and neck and a 9-mm margin on the trunk and extremities. Only 79% of lentigo maligna and 83% of melanoma in situ were successfully excised with a 6-mm margin (P = 0.12). Local recurrence was identified in 0.26% (5 facial, 1 scalp, and 1 acral), with a mean follow-up time of 5.7 years.

- **Limitations**: Margins less than 6 mm were not studied. The diagnosis of lentigo maligna was not used consistently by all dermatopathologists. The degree of surrounding photodamage was not assessed.

- **Conclusion**: Subclinical extensions of lentigo maligna and melanoma in situ are similar. Standard surgical excision of all melanoma in situ subtypes, including lentigo maligna, should include at least 9 mm of normal-appearing skin, which is similar to the amount recommended for early detection.

### Rare vulvar malignancies; incidence, treatment and survival in the Netherlands [^114rApDK]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

To describe trends in incidence, treatment, and survival of patients with basal cell carcinomas and melanomas of the vulva, as well as to compare survival of vulvar and cutaneous melanoma patients, all women with a vulvar malignancy between 1989 and 2012 were selected from the Dutch Cancer Registry (n = 6436). Standardized incidence rates, estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and 5-year relative survival rates were calculated for basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and melanomas. Patients with vulvar melanomas were matched to women with cutaneous melanomas based on the period of diagnosis, age, Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration, lymph node status, and distant metastases. Differences in survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test.

- **Results**: 489 women were diagnosed with a BCC and 350 with a melanoma of the vulva. The EAPC in incidence for melanomas was 0.2% and 1.1% for BCCs. Eighty-six percent of patients with BCC underwent surgical treatment in 1989–2006, and 95% in 2005–2012. Forty-five percent with BCC and 79% with melanoma were treated in a referral center. Five-year relative survival for BCCs was 100%, and for melanomas, survival increased from 37% (95% CI 28–47%) in 1989–1999 to 45% (95% CI: 37–54%) in 2000–2012. Five years after diagnosis, survival of women with vulvar melanoma was 15% lower compared to matched cutaneous melanoma patients (p = 0.002).

- **Conclusion**: No trends in age-adjusted incidence have been observed, but more patients with BCC received surgical treatment over time. Having had vulvar BCC did not affect life expectancy.

The ESGO 2023 guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for the medical management of vulvar cancer, especially concerning the treatment of recurrent disease. The guidelines emphasize the importance of performing a thorough vulvar examination, including biopsies of all suspicious areas, before initiating treatment for recurrent disease. Additionally, it is recommended to obtain imaging studies such as ultrasound, MRI, and/or CT (or 18F-FDG-PET-CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In cases where nodal or distant recurrence is suspected, a biopsy should be performed if feasible.

### Lentigo maligna: Melanoma in situ on chronically sun-damaged skin [^1122hQLA]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cutaneous primary invasive malignant melanoma is often classified by its histologic appearance. Major recognized histologic subtypes of melanoma include superficial spreading, lentigo maligna melanoma, nodular, and acral lentiginous. More recently, studies have shown that most primary invasive melanomas harbor nonrandom genetic or biochemical aberrations that correlate with anatomic site or with the amount of cutaneous exposure to sunlight. It is generally accepted that most primary invasive melanomas are preceded by an intraepidermal atypical melanocytic proliferation that lacks invasive capability (melanoma in situ).

- **Objective**: To focus on lentigo maligna, the preinvasive/in situ form of melanoma located on chronically sun-damaged skin.

- **Data sources**: Review of the literature and the authors' personal experiences.

- **Conclusions**: A better understanding of the earliest stage of melanoma progression, including the contribution of chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation, may lead to improved classification schemes that guide more effective targeted or personalized therapies for patients.

### Vulvar cancer, version 1.2017, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116MXW7b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Low credibility.

Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecologic malignancy, with 90% of cases being predominantly squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). These can arise through both human papilloma virus (HPV)-dependent and HPV-independent pathways. The NCCN Vulvar Cancer panel is an interdisciplinary group of representatives from NCCN Member Institutions, consisting of specialists in gynecological oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Vulvar Cancer provide an evidence- and consensus-based approach for the management of patients with vulvar SCC. This manuscript discusses the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for diagnosis, staging, treatment, and follow-up.

### Extracutaneous melanomas: A primer for the radiologist [^1134oJYW]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Mucosal melanomas include head and neck, vulvovaginal, anorectal, and urinary tract melanomas. More than 50% of cases of mucosal melanoma arise from head and neck mucosal surfaces. The nasal cavity is the most common head and neck site for mucosal melanoma, followed by the oral cavity. Less frequent sites in the head and neck region include the pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus. Clinically, mucosal melanomas arising from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses present with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and anosmia. Oral mucosal melanoma is frequently detected as mucosal pigmentation, bleeding, or ulceration. The genital tract is the most common site of mucosal melanoma in females, responsible for more than 50% of cases. In females, the vulva is the most common site for genitourinary melanoma, followed by the vagina. Anorectal mucosal melanoma represents approximately 0.05% of all colorectal malignancies. The rectum is the most common site (42%), followed by the anal canal (33%), and overlapping areas (25%). HIV infection increases the risk of anorectal melanoma.

In 2010, the AJCC developed a specific TNM staging system for head and neck mucosal melanoma. According to the AJCC, staging of mucosal melanomas of the head and neck is done according to the tumour, node, and metastasis (TNM) classification, with disease confined to the mucosa designated as T3 to reflect their aggressiveness. Contrary to head and neck mucosal melanoma, there is no universal staging system for anorectal and vaginal melanoma.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^111Aa1g9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vulvar melanosis can result from chronic disease. Genital lentiginosis frequently presents with dark brown-black macules with variegated pigmentation and irregular borders. Genital nevi may occasionally exhibit similar characteristics, particularly in the context of chronic inflammation and lichen sclerosus (LS). Histologic examination can easily differentiate mucosal lentiginosis from melanoma. However, melanocytic nevi superimposed on a background of anogenital LS, both clinically and histologically, may mimic malignant melanoma. Clark et al. reported that more than one-third of genital nevi sent to them in consultation (20/56) had previously been misdiagnosed as melanoma.

Histologic interpretation is particularly difficult in the setting of LS, when papillary dermal melanocytes entrapped in sclerosis often display cytologic atypia, and the lymphocytic infiltrates can disrupt dermal nests. Carlson et al. identified ten melanocytic lesions clinically suspected to be malignant melanoma or atypical melanocytic nevi arising in anogenital LS of the vulva and perineum. The suggestive clinical symptoms or signs were irregular borders, a black clinical appearance, recent growth, and/or recent onset of pruritus. Melanocytic proliferations arising in LS were interpreted histologically as junctional melanocytic nevi (five cases), compound melanocytic nevi (three cases), intradermal melanocytic nevi (two cases), or malignant melanoma (one case).

Single cases of vulvar melanoma in the setting of LS have been described, but they are a rarity. Vulvar pigmented lesions associated with LS are almost always benign.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^112V33UG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The primary treatment modality for localized melanoma is surgical excision. In cutaneous melanoma, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend surgical margins depending on tumor thickness (based on category I evidence): 0.5–1 cm for melanoma in situ, 1 cm for invasive melanoma with a Breslow's thickness ≤ 1 mm, 1–2 cm for Breslow 1.01–2 mm, and 2 cm for Breslow > 2 mm. Noteworthy, these are based on measured clinical margins taken at the time of surgery and not gross or histologic margins, as measured by the pathologist. The same margins must apply for VM. However, in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, margins may be modified to accommodate individual anatomic or functional considerations, which may be considered in VM in terms of preservation of continence and sexual function. Although urinary incontinence has been reported after surgical resection of vulvar cancer, a partial resection of 1–1.5 cm of the distal urethra, if required for a complete excision, does not appear to be associated with an increased risk for urinary incontinence. The GOG-73 trial, the only prospective study on VM performed at the time of writing, and retrospective data indicate that more radical vulva surgeries such as primary vulvectomy are not associated with a better oncologic outcome compared with a local excision using the margins above but are associated with an increased complication rate.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be offered to all women with VM and clinically unsuspicious nodes if indicated.

### Melanoma of the vulva and vagina: Principles of staging and their relevance to management based on a clinicopathologic analysis of 85 cases [^112tyzsy]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary melanomas of the vulva and vagina are rare, which has made it difficult to develop evidence-based guidelines for their management. By analyzing a large series of patients with vulval and vaginal melanomas, this study sought to document the most common presenting features, identify clinical and pathologic predictors of outcome, and provide management guidelines.

- **Methods**: A clinicopathologic analysis of 85 patients with primary melanomas of the vulva or vagina diagnosed and treated at Melanoma Institute Australia and associated units in Sydney, Australia, between 1960 and 2011 was performed. Predictors of disease-free and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) were determined.

- **Results**: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage 0-II had a significantly better MSS (5Y MSS = 63.6%, n = 59) compared with those with stage III disease (5Y MSS = 0%, n = 12, p < 0.001). Tumor thickness, ulceration status, and pathologic clearance margin were significant predictors of MSS. Disease-free survival was predicted by these factors and additionally by tumor mitotic rate.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study provide evidence to support the appropriateness of utilizing the AJCC (7th edition) cutaneous melanoma staging system for vulval and vaginal melanomas. Detection and removal of these melanomas at an early stage with pathologically confirmed clear margins confers the best chance of cure.

### Malignant melanoma of the vulva and vagina: A US population-based study of 1863 patients [^1162cLr6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Primary malignant melanoma of the vulva (VuM) and vagina (VaM) represent an important subgroup of malignancies with significant differences in terms of biology and treatment compared with the more common and well-described squamous cell carcinoma. Important differences also exist in terms of anatomic considerations and surgical approach compared with other melanomas. Traditionally, VuM and VaM were categorized as mucosal melanoma; however, this has been questioned by recent studies examining the molecular characteristics of these lesions, which showed that melanomas of the female genital tract differ in terms of mutational characteristics from mucosal and cutaneous melanomas. It has therefore been suggested that VuM and VaM represent a unique subclass.

The literature on female genital melanoma is scarce. At the time of writing, there is only one prospective study following 71 women with VuM who underwent radical (hemi-)vulvectomy. Retrospective series suggest that the prognosis and survival are significantly worse compared with cutaneous melanoma.

Staging for VuM has been extrapolated from cutaneous melanoma, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system is now being used instead of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification. However, it remains unclear whether this accurately reflects the behavior of VuM. While surgery remains the primary treatment modality, the US Food and Drug Administration approval of checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy has drastically changed the medical management of advanced and metastatic melanoma.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^115q1grh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Although the sample size of the studies was limited, the authors observed that most of the responders harbored c-KIT mutations located on exons 11 and 13. In our literature review, 85.7% of c-KIT mutations found in vulvar melanomas were located in these exons (Fig. 1 A). Other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been used include sunitinib, dasatinib, and sorafenib.

With BRAF mutations being relatively rare, targeted treatment with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors plays a less important role in vulvar melanomas (Table 1). The recently published American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines on systemic therapy, however, suggest that a combination therapy with the BRAF/MEK inhibitors dabrafenib/trametinib, encorafenib/binimetinib, or vemurafenib/cobimetinib may also be offered in BRAF-mutant mucosal melanomas.

Data regarding adjuvant treatment in mucosal melanomas remain scarce. Most clinical trials on adjuvant therapy in melanoma, including the EORTC-18071 and Keynote-054 protocols, have either excluded mucosal melanoma or did not further specify melanoma subtypes. The CheckMate-238 trial included 29 patients with mucosal melanomas, of whom 16 received nivolumab, but the study was not sufficiently powered to show differences in the subgroups.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines suggest that patients with mucosal melanomas should be offered the same therapies recommended for cutaneous melanomas. Nivolumab or pembrolizumab should thus be offered to patients with resected stage IIIA/B/C/D BRAF wild-type vulvar melanomas, while either of those two agents or the combination of dabrafenib/trametinib may be recommended.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis of lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma, facts and an opinion [^112rwcv7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

Lentigo maligna/lentigo maligna melanoma (LM/LMM) affects chronically sun-damaged skin of the head and neck with a slow radial growth phase. It is characterized by predominantly lentiginous proliferation of small, but atypical melanocytes with occasional upward scatter in an atrophic epidermis. It is not uncommon for pathologists to receive partial or scouting biopsies to assess for LM, making the interpretation of symmetry and circumscription of the lesions challenging. Therefore, both cytologic and architectural criteria should be taken into consideration to render an accurate diagnosis of melanoma. Moreover, pathologists should be vigilant to avoid missing invasion, as this can change the treatment plan and prognosis.

Herein, we aim to discuss important pitfalls in the diagnosis of LMM and its invasive component. Some of these caveats involve differentiating between true invasion versus adnexal involvement by the in situ component or an incidental intradermal nevus, detection of microinvasion and multifocal invasion, and recognition of desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma component.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^112jpv5k]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

By definition, melanomas are cancers arising from melanocytes. The pathogenesis of vulvar melanoma (VM) remains largely unknown. Unlike cutaneous melanomas, VMs are unrelated to chronic sun exposure and damage from ultraviolet light. Chronic dermatoses, such as lichen sclerosus, have been discussed as potential risk factors based on findings from a population-based study, but this warrants validation in larger-scaled and prospective studies.

Molecular characterization of VMs may shed more light on the carcinogenesis. The mitogen-associated protein kinase pathway is a signaling pathway that is commonly activated in malignant melanomas. The c-KIT gene encodes KIT (CD117), which is a class III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase and is expressed in a variety of cells. While c-KIT mutations are rare in cutaneous melanomas, 21.6% of women with VMs harbor a c-KIT mutation. The high rate of c-KIT mutations appears to be characteristic for VMs, which also distinguishes them from vaginal melanomas.

In one of the largest series, Hou et al. noted that c-KIT was the only molecular marker of interest that varied significantly between vulvar and vaginal sites, with 27% of vulvar samples harboring the mutation compared with only 8% of vaginal samples. Similarly, Omholt et al. reported eight c-KIT mutations in 23 women with VM versus no mutations in seven women with vaginal melanomas.

### Vulvar melanoma: a report of 20 cases and review of the literature [^116VwD7j]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Vulvar melanoma is the second most common vulvar malignancy and represents a significant women's health issue.

- **Objective**: To report experience with 21 cases of vulvar melanoma in 20 patients and to review the literature about the condition.

- **Methods**: Parameters retrospectively reviewed included age at diagnosis, family history of melanoma, location on the vulva, atypical nevi, Breslow depth, ulceration status, histologic pattern, presenting signs and symptoms, and the results of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Molecular characterization of the melanocortin type 1 receptor was performed in 1 patient.

- **Results**: A family history of cutaneous melanoma was present in 15% of cases. The mean Breslow depth was 2.8 mm (range, 0.0–11.0 mm). Ten patients successfully underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, results of which were positive in 2 (20%). Reported for the first time is that one patient had a germline mutation in the melanocortin type 1 receptor.

- **Conclusion**: Vulvar and cutaneous melanoma behave similarly despite their unique pathogeneses. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be performed successfully for vulvar melanoma.

### Genital lentigines and melanocytic nevi with superimposed lichen sclerosus: a diagnostic challenge [^114A7ZU3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Benign pigmented lesions of the genitalia, such as genital lentigines and melanocytic nevi, often display clinical and histopathologic features highly suggestive of malignant melanoma (MM). Superimposed changes of lichen sclerosus (LS) may cause significant concern and lead to an erroneous diagnosis of MM.

- **Objective**: This study was performed to assess the clinicopathologic characteristics of genital lentigines and melanocytic nevi with associated LS.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of 5 cases.

- **Results**: Histopathologic sections of the 2 cases of genital lentigines with changes of LS showed a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate and pigment incontinence with melanophages in a fibrosed papillary dermis. These features are reminiscent of completely regressed MM. The 3 cases of genital melanocytic nevi with superimposed LS were sharply circumscribed and relatively symmetric, but revealed confluent nests varying in size and shape, along with pagetoid upward spread of melanocytic nests and single melanocytes. Changes of LS extended beyond the melanocytic proliferation.

- **Conclusion**: Genital lentigines and melanocytic nevi with associated LS may exhibit features that mimic MM.

### Melanoma of the lower genital tract: Prognostic factors and treatment modalities [^114cAxkj]. Gynecologic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Primary melanomas originating from the gynecological tract are rare and aggressive cancers. The vulva is the most frequent site (70%), followed by the vagina and more rarely the cervix. The clinical outcome of patients with female genital tract melanoma is very poor, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 37–50% for vulvar, 13–32% for vaginal, and approximately 10% for cervical melanoma. In this systematic review, we analyzed the pathogenesis and the different factors influencing the prognosis of melanomas in the lower genital tract, with particular emphasis on biologic variables that may influence new therapeutic approaches. We evaluated the different treatment modalities described in the literature to offer a possible algorithm that may assist clinicians in diagnosing and treating patients with these uncommon malignancies.

### Features of pigmented vulval lesions on dermoscopy [^117DN4Ao]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The dermoscopic criteria for benign and malignant lesions on the vulva are not well established due to the lack of large series of such lesions. Melanoma should always be included in the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions on the vulva, especially when they are wide or of recent onset. Elsewhere on the skin, dermoscopy plays an important role in the selection of suspicious pigmented lesions, as well as in the selection of the best site to perform the biopsy.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the dermoscopic patterns observed in pigmented lesions of the vulva.

- **Methods**: We analyzed a nonselected consecutive series of 68 histopathologically proven cases comprising five melanomas, 16 naevi, 20 lentigos, 12 benign vulval melanoses, 11 cases of postinflammatory pigmentation, three pigmented cases of usual vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), and one seborrhoeic keratosis seen at our institution. The dermoscope was covered by translucent disposable food wrap and/or antibacterial gel to prevent possible transmission of infections. Descriptive statistics were performed using multiple correspondence analysis.

- **Results**: The parallel (37%), ring-like (9%), homogeneous (22%), globular-like (13%), and reticular-like (6%) patterns were observed on benign lesions (naevi, lentigo, vulval melanosis, and postinflammatory pigmentation). The cerebriform pattern (6%) was observed only on VIN and seborrhoeic keratosis. The multicomponent pattern (6%) was associated with melanoma (60%). In cases of melanoma, we also occasionally observed an irregular pattern, a whitish or blue-whitish veil.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^113N6RFo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

If vulvar melanoma (VM) is confirmed on biopsy, staging should be based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system instead of the FIGO staging system used for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, as the AJCC has been found to be a better predictor of survival in the prospective GOG-73 study and this was recently confirmed by a large population-based study. The AJCC staging system is currently in its eighth edition, and the staging of the primary tumor (T category) is based on Breslow's thickness and the presence/absence of ulceration. Histologic grading is not used in melanomas, but the lesion is classified into one of the histopathologic subtypes: superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, acral lentiginous, and desmoplastic. Women with superficial spreading VM appear to have a better prognosis compared with those with nodular melanomas.

Because of the often advanced disease stages, pre-operative imaging is recommended. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to delineate the disease extent and for surgical planning. Computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography may be used for the evaluation of regional and/or distant metastases.

### Does the morphology of cutaneous melanoma help to explain the international differences in survival? Results from 1 578 482 adults diagnosed during 2000–2014 in 59 countries (CONCORD-3) [^1152hWR4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Stage at diagnosis is recognized as the most important predictor of survival. Age at diagnosis is also a prognostic factor, and several studies have shown much higher survival for younger patients. However, the prognostic role of morphology in cutaneous melanoma is controversial. Traditionally, melanomas of the skin have been classified into three fairly well-defined subgroups, characterized by different patterns of growth: superficial spreading and lentigo maligna melanoma, which is characterized by a long period of superficial growth; nodular melanoma, which is more likely to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin if not removed; and acral lentiginous melanoma, which mostly develops on the extremities but displays similar biological behavior to that of nodular melanoma.

Despite the advent of high-resolution genomics and other proposed approaches for the classification of melanocytic tumors, the diagnosis of the different subtypes should continue to be based on the pathologist's interpretation of the histology and how it fits into the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors, commonly known as the WHO 'Blue Books'. However, the morphological classification has not been considered useful for prognostic purposes because of the commonly held view that the clinical development of all melanomas is similar, whatever the histological subtype. They spread horizontally within the epidermis and then extend vertically into the dermis, converging in their biological behavior once they metastasize.

### Lentigo maligna and superficial spreading melanoma are different in their in situ phase: an immunohistochemical study [^113kECv5]. Human Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical and pathologic observations have prompted the categorization of malignant melanoma into four subtypes. Although some authorities challenge the value of this classification, it is generally accepted that lentigo maligna (LM), or melanoma on sun-damaged skin, has a different biological behavior than superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), at least in the early stage of its evolution. To characterize some aspects of this different behavior, the in situ phase of SSM and LM was studied using immunohistochemical methods.

Seventeen cases of SSM in situ and thirteen cases of LM were chosen for the study. All cases qualified with strict histologic criteria. Sections from these lesions were stained with antibodies against HMB-45 antigen, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and factor VIII. Semiquantitative analysis was performed. Cases classified as either LM or SSM corresponded well to the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics as described in the literature; that is, LM appeared in older patients and occurred mostly on the face, whereas SSM occurred mostly on the trunk and lower limbs.

Although no difference in HMB-45 stain was observed, melanocytes of SSM showed greater proliferative activity, as reflected by PCNA stain (P < 0.02) and higher levels of bFGF (P < 0.001), than melanocytes of LM. More blood vessels were counted under SSM than under LM (P < 0.05). These results are in accordance with the biological behavior of SSM and LM, that is, the longer in situ phase of the latter. bFGF is both a growth factor.

### Cancer of the vulva: 2021 update [^111pHLSD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

Vulvar melanoma is the second most common vulvar malignancy, although it is a very rare tumor with an incidence of 0.1 in 100,000. Mucosal melanomas, found on the vulva and in the vagina, have a poor prognosis with a 15% five-year survival rate; their cause and genetics differ from cutaneous melanomas. Any pigmented vulvar lesion should be biopsied or excised for diagnosis, unless it has been present and unchanged for some time. The majority of vulvar melanomas involve the clitoris or labia minora.

There is a lack of consensus on the staging of mucosal melanomas, although most prefer to use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system, which includes the Clark level, Breslow thickness, ulceration, and spread. The Clark or Breslow modifications of the staging system — as included in the AJCC system and based on depth of invasion — should be used for the staging of these lesions rather than the FIGO staging system, since the former is the only system prospectively proven to be correlated with recurrence and survival.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for vulvar melanomas. Lesions should be treated by radical wide local excision, with margins around the lesion of at least 1 cm. The trend leans toward more conservative resection of vulvar melanomas because no survival difference has been found in patients undergoing local excision versus those with radical vulvectomy. The role of lymph node dissection is also controversial and, at the time of writing, no survival advantage has been shown for inguinal lymphadenectomy.

### Vulvar melanoma: Review of diagnosis, staging, and therapy [^117Pcvzb]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to update, assimilate, and bridge the contemporary literature on vulvar and cutaneous melanoma regarding diagnosis, staging, and therapy, providing a useful clinical reference for managing and counseling affected patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A computerized search for reports in the literature up to June 2003 was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases. A multidisciplinary approach was utilized to evaluate the available data and formulate conclusions.

- **Results**: More than 300 reports were reviewed. The diagnosis, staging, and therapy aspects of vulvar melanoma are summarized.

- **Conclusions**: Vulvar melanoma represents a subtype of cutaneous melanoma, with similar prognostic and staging factors. The most recent American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma is applicable to vulvar melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable method for staging the regional lymph node basin in vulvar melanoma. Standardized documentation of clinical and histopathologic parameters is necessary to standardize the grouping of cases for future comparison studies.

### Urethral involvement is associated with higher mortality and local recurrence in vulvar melanoma: a single institutional experience [^117EteiW]. Human Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

Vulvar malignant melanoma (VMM), although uncommon, comprises 5–10% of all vulvar malignancies. Local control is notoriously poor in VMM with recurrence rates of 30–50% compared with approximately 3% in cutaneous melanomas. We studied clinicopathologic features of 37 women with VMM, after reviewing three decades of clinical follow-up data in our institutional databases. Most patients were Caucasian (n = 35) with an average age at diagnosis of 60.6 years (range 23–83). The most common subtype was mucosal lentiginous melanoma (n = 25).

We compared Kaplan-Meier survival curves of 31 patients defined by clinical and microscopic attributes using exact log-rank tests. Younger patients at diagnosis (23–64 years), those with thin melanomas (≤ 1 mm), and those with Clark's level II or III tumors had better 5-year survival rates than older patients (65–83 years), those with thick melanomas (> 1 mm), and those with Clark's level IV or V, respectively (P ≤ 0.05) by exact log-rank test.

Local recurrence of melanoma occurred in 15 patients. Nine patients (24%) had eventual urethral involvement by malignant melanoma, and this feature was associated with significantly shorter survival (P = 0.036). Patients with urethral involvement had shorter median time to death and worse 5-year survival rates. Given that spread to the urethra is common in VMM and urethral recurrence is also associated with mortality, pathology excision specimens should be carefully reviewed with attention to urethral involvement as a potentially important prognostic factor.

### Lentigo maligna: Review of salient characteristics and management [^113yWowf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lentigo maligna is a melanocytic neoplasm often regarded as 'melanoma in situ', which may progress to lentigo maligna melanoma. It clinically presents as a pigmented, asymmetric macule that originates on the head and neck, spreading slowly. The preferred method for diagnosing lentigo maligna is an excisional biopsy. Histology reveals proliferation of atypical melanocytes at the epidermal-dermal junction in small nests or single cells.

- **Differential diagnosis**: This includes solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, lichen planus-like keratosis, pigmented actinic keratosis, and melanocytic nevus.
- **Stains used in diagnosis**: Hematoxylin and eosin, HMB-45, MART-1/Melan-A, Mel-5, and S-100.
- **Surgical excision**: The preferred treatment for lentigo maligna.
- **Second-line techniques**: These include medical (topical imiquimod) and destructive therapy.

### Malignant melanoma of the vulva and vagina: A US population-based study of 1863 patients [^112XsEg1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

	- A total of 1910 women with vulvar melanoma (VuM) or vaginal melanoma (VaM) were identified in the SEER-18 population meeting the above described criteria; 47 cases were excluded from further analysis because they did not meet the International Association of Cancer Registries criteria and were metastases, recurrences, or extensions from a different primary tumor. There were 1863 cases included for further analysis comprising 1400 VuM and 463 VaM. This represents 1.0% (1863/177,807) of all malignant melanomas in women, 5.3% (1400/26,250) of all vulvar malignancies, and 5.5% (463/8409) of all vaginal malignancies in the SEER-18 population.

- **Patient characteristics**:

	- Patient demographics differed significantly between VuM and VaM. The median age difference was 3 years, and women with VuM were diagnosed at a younger age compared with women with VaM; 14.7% and 28.3% of women with VuM and VaM were non-white, respectively (p < 0.001). Significantly more cases of VaM were diagnosed in advanced-stage disease (i.e. regional or distant) compared with VuM (46.5% vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001). The AJCC stages were reported in 634 cases of VuM, distributed as follows: stage I: 34.9%, stage II: 34.4%, stage III: 24.0%, and stage IV: 6.8%; VaM was only staged as local, regional, and distant. No surgery was performed in 16.2% of women with VuM, including 16 cases with local destructive procedures, whereas 47.1% of women with VaM did not undergo surgery, including eight cases with local destructive procedures (p < 0.001). Only 564/1067 (52.9%) of women with non-metastatic VuM undergoing surgery and 7…

### In vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy of benign lentigines: Comparison to conventional histology and in vivo characteristics of lentigo maligna [^1169dRm9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

An important challenge facing clinicians is recognizing and distinguishing benign pigmented lesions from cutaneous melanoma. Lentigines are a type of benign pigmented lesion that can resemble melanoma. Physician diagnostic accuracy is less than perfect, prompting research into noninvasive technology such as reflectance mode in vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM).

- **Objectives**: Our aims were twofold: to describe the in vivo characteristics of benign lentigines with reflectance CSLM and to compare them with histopathology; and to contrast the in vivo CSLM differences of lentigines, lentigo maligna, and lentigo maligna melanomas.

- **Methods**: Patients with a suspect pigmented lesion were prospectively recruited to undergo CSLM before biopsy. Lentigo simplex, solar lentigo, or malignant melanoma, lentigo maligna type, were included in the study. Images were qualitatively described and compared with histopathologic findings.

- **Results**: Ten patients, whose lesions included six lentigines and four lentigo malignas, were examined with CSLM. Distinct architectural and cytologic features were noted in benign lentigines compared with melanomas. The most striking finding in lentigines was observed at the dermoepidermal junction. In all cases of lentigines, there was an increase in the density of dermal papillae surrounded by a bright monomorphic layer of cells. Distinct patterns were noted, as these papillae assumed irregular geometric shapes or formed papillary projections with a rim of bright, highly refractile, monomorphic, and cytologically benign-appearing cells.

### Trends in sentinel lymph node evaluation for vulvar melanoma in the United States from 2012 to 2018 [^111Dkgq6]. Gynecologic Oncology (2025). High credibility.

To describe trends in the type of lymph node assessment for vulvar melanoma over time and factors associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), this retrospective cohort study examined patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) with vulvar melanoma from 2012 to 2018. The study abstracted information on the type of lymph node evaluation, demographic and clinical characteristics, and characteristics of the treating institution. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were utilized to evaluate predictors of SLNB compared to inguinofemoral lymph node dissection (IFLD) and no lymph node evaluation.

A total of 1,828 patients with vulvar melanoma were identified. Of those, 925 (50.6%) underwent lymph node evaluation: 357 (38.6%) with SLNB alone, 97 (10.5%) with SLNB and IFLD, and 471 (50.9%) with IFLD alone. Significant predictors of SLNB use in univariate analyses included year of diagnosis, age, T stage, insurance status, facility type, and facility volume. In multivariate analysis, age, year of diagnosis, T stage, and facility type remained significant. SLNB was most often performed for T1 and T2 lesions (31.3% and 36.2%, respectively), while only 19.6% of T3, 1.3% of T4, and 25.8% of those with unknown T stage underwent SLNB. Survival outcomes were similar regardless of the mode of lymph node assessment but were worse in those who received no assessment.

Practice in the United States for lymph node evaluation in vulvar melanoma differs from the recommended guidelines for cutaneous melanomas by T stage. Updated guidelines for vulvar melanoma are necessary.

### Pigmented seborrheic keratoses of the vulva clinically mimicking a malignant melanoma: a clinical, dermoscopic-pathologic case study [^111jeHL1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis is generally clinical, but distinguishing between pigmented seborrheic keratosis and malignant melanoma can be challenging in certain cases. Dermoscopy may enhance the early diagnosis of vulvar melanoma and aid in the preoperative classification of pigmented lesions at this location. We report the first case of a pigmented seborrheic keratosis of the vulva clinically mimicking a malignant melanoma, with dermoscopic features investigated alongside their pathological correlates. Dermoscopically, our case shows the absence of comedo-like openings and the presence of the pseudo-network. Therefore, dermoscopy is a useful method for the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions, even in the vulva.

### Controversies in acral lentiginous melanoma [^113ktEde]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a subtype of melanoma initially described only two and a half decades ago but is well-recognized by dermatologists today. However, several areas of controversy surround this entity.

- **Objective**: The primary aims of this article are to review the literature, highlight recent advances, and review some of the ongoing controversies in ALM.

- **Methods**: A review of the English language literature was performed.

- **Results**: Controversy continues to surround ALM, particularly regarding diagnostic histologic and clinical criteria. This leads to difficulties when reviewing studies that evaluate the epidemiology, etiology, and prognosis of ALM.

- **Conclusion**: Progress in understanding ALM requires the development of standardized diagnostic criteria.

### Excision guidelines and follow-up strategies in cutaneous melanoma: Facts and controversies [^111TBhSb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The ongoing increase in melanoma incidence throughout Caucasian populations worldwide raises the question of an economic and efficient management of primary melanoma and follow-up. The primary treatment of cutaneous melanoma is surgical excision. An excision biopsy is recommended, with safety margins of 1 cm for tumor thickness up to 2 mm and 2 cm for a higher tumor thickness, which should be applied at the primary excision or in a two-step procedure. When dealing with facial, acral, or anogenital melanomas, micrographic control of the surgical margins may be preferable to allow reduced safety margins and conservation of tissue.

Whereas the treatment for primary melanoma is accepted worldwide, follow-up strategies for melanoma patients are discussed controversially, and so far, no international consensus has been reached.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^112ep4QA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

One in 41 women (2.4%) will develop a malignant melanoma at some point during their life, making it the sixth most common cancer in women in the United States. Vulvar melanomas (VMs) account for 1% of all melanomas in women and 5% of all vulvar malignancies. The majority of VMs are diagnosed in postmenopausal women, with the median age at diagnosis being 68 years; however, VMs have also been reported in children. Strikingly, up to 10% of women have pigmented vulvar lesions; obviously, the majority of these are benign. Nevertheless, considering the advanced stage and melanoma size at diagnosis and the associated poor prognosis, there is room for improvement in early detection and treatment initiation.

While the overall mortality rate of cutaneous melanoma has dropped by 7% annually over the last five years, this improvement does not apply to VMs. For all stages combined, the five-year overall survival rate for cutaneous melanoma is 92%, compared to only 47% for VM, with no significant improvement over time. These somber statistics may be partially explained by the delayed diagnosis compared to cutaneous melanomas. A recent US population-based study of 1,863 women revealed that 38% of women with staged VM had advanced disease at diagnosis, with regional involvement and/or distant metastases. The mean size of the primary tumor at diagnosis was 31 mm, and more than 46% had a Breslow's thickness greater than 2 mm. This places them at very high risk, and large single-center series suggest that 52–63% of non-metastatic patients will eventually develop distant metastases.

### Mohs micrographic surgery for the treatment of lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma: An outcomes study [^113f3rGq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lentigo maligna (LM), a type of melanoma in situ (MIS), usually develops on sun-damaged skin in the elderly. If left untreated, it may advance to the point of dermal invasion, developing into lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM). While surgeons have achieved robust clinical outcomes for LM treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), performing this treatment for LMM remains controversial and is not standard amongst all Mohs surgeons.

- **Objective**: We examined survival outcomes in LM/LMM cases treated with MMS and wide local excision (WLE).

- **Methods**: Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (NCI SEER) program, collected from 2000–2019, was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with microscopically confirmed diagnosis of LM/LMM who received surgical treatment with MMS or WLE were included. The effect of different surgery types on melanoma survival was evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 22,852 LM/LMM cases performed during the years 2000–2019 were considered for analysis. There were no significant differences in disease-specific survival comparing WLE to MMS.

- **Conclusion**: Our research hints at the utility of MMS for LM/LMM. We encourage practitioners to consider MMS for the management of LM/LMM when appropriate.

### Long-term response of vulvar mucosal melanoma treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab [^114xZVhe]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A 59-year-old menopausal woman without children was referred by a gynecologist for a pigmented vulvar lesion. Physical examination revealed a pigmented ulcero-budding lesion on the labia minora, clitoris, and urethral meatus (Fig 1). The lesion was painful and associated with leucorrhea. The lymph nodes were free. A histological study of a cutaneous biopsy sample showed a mucosal lentiginous melanoma type, ulcerated, with a Clark level IV, a Breslow thickness of 4 mm, without regression, and a mitotic rate of 2/mm². The tumor was of the entire thickness of the biopsy sample. Immunohistochemistry was positive for melanin-A and PS100.

No mutation was found in the 28-gene next-generation sequencing panel analyzed, including BRAF mutation. No distant lymph node or visceral metastasis was observed with a brain and thoracic-abdominal-pelvis computed tomography scan. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a 3-cm vulvar mass invading the urethra. A complete tumor resection was proposed by total vulvectomy with urethral sacrifice and urinary bypass. This mutilating surgery was refused by the patient.

Collaborative decision-making led to a treatment plan of systemic treatment by neoadjuvant anti–programmed death-1 (anti–PD-1). The patient received her first monthly 480-mg nivolumab infusion in April 2020. Three months after initiating treatment, pain disappeared and physical examination showed partial regression of the tumor. After the third neoadjuvant nivolumab injection, complementary surgery was proposed but was again refused by the patient.

### Topical imiquimod and in situ vulvar melanoma: A promising therapy [^112Hk4yX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: A 66-year-old patient, previously treated at our clinic for perianal squamous cell carcinoma with radiotherapy, presented with a nodular lesion on the right labium major. The patient underwent surgical excision, and histopathology revealed an invasive melanoma with a 5-mm Breslow thickness. Consequently, a wide excision of the right labium major and an inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Histology indicated residual foci of in situ melanoma in the surgical specimen and no nodal involvement. Five months later, several hyperpigmented macules developed on the right labia. Dermoscopic examination showed brown macules with homogeneous and structureless pigmentation. Five 3-mm punch biopsies confirmed in situ vulvar melanoma in all sites.

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Due to the extensive area involved and disease multifocality, the treatment approach was evaluated within a multidisciplinary tumor board. The patient, refusing further surgical procedures, began treatment with topical 5% imiquimod cream, initially applied two times per week, then increased to three times per week after one month. The patient completed a 16-week course, albeit with interruptions due to significant local side effects such as redness and irritations. Additionally, the patient experienced flu-like symptoms, which were managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, resulting in symptom improvement.

### Prognostic indicators in melanoma of the vulva [^112NcLtg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2000). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of clinical-pathologic variables in melanoma of the vulva. From 1979 through 1995, 40 women with a diagnosis of vulvar melanoma underwent radical surgery. Patient age, tumor size and site, histologic type, ulceration, tumor thickness, lymph node status, and number of positive lymph nodes were assessed for prognostic significance by multivariate analysis.

Tumor thickness was a significant predictor of lymph node involvement, but not of survival. The most powerful predictors of survival by multivariate analysis were the lymph node status (P = 0.002) and the number of positive lymph nodes (P = 0.00003). The number of positive lymph nodes represents the strongest prognostic factor in melanoma of the vulva. Because of the lack of effective adjuvant therapies, such prognostic indicators might be used to define the timing and extent of the surgical approach.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^1121TtA8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of primary cutaneous melanoma has been increasing dramatically for several decades. Melanoma accounts for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths, but treatment is nearly always curative with early detection of the disease. In this update of the guidelines of care, we discuss the treatment of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, including:

- **Biopsy techniques**: Discussing lesion specimens clinically suspicious for melanoma and offering recommendations for the histopathologic interpretation of cutaneous melanoma.

- **Laboratory and imaging tests**: Offering recommendations for their use in the initial workup of patients with newly diagnosed melanoma and for follow-up of asymptomatic patients.

- **Treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma**: Providing recommendations for surgical margins and briefly discussing nonsurgical treatments.

- **Sentinel lymph node biopsy**: Discussing its value and limitations and offering recommendations for its use in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.

### Label-free imaging of female genital tract melanocytic lesions with pump-probe microscopy: A promising diagnostic tool [^115xspoK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Malignant melanoma of the vulva accounts for 2% to 7% of all melanomas in women and is the second most common malignancy afflicting the region. Similar to other cutaneous melanomas, melanomas of genital mucosal tissue originate from melanocytes in the basal layer; however, various studies have found important biological differences. For example, vulvar melanoma is a multifocal disease, often subclinical, with a high recurrence rate (30%–50%) that is associated not with inadequate surgical control but rather from not-well-understood disorders of the melanocytes in the genital squamous epithelium. Vulvar melanomas are also highly metastatic and have a worse prognosis than other cutaneous melanomas, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 40% to 60%. Furthermore, differentiating melanoma from benign lesions in the vulva is critical because of the difficulty involved in performing local excisions and the risk of complications that can lead to sexual or urinary dysfunction. For these reasons, vulvar melanomas require different considerations for diagnosis and treatment compared with other melanomas.

Identification of this disease can be complicated by a number of benign melanocytic proliferations, including melanotic macules and atypical genital nevi (AGN). Melanotic macules are highly pigmented macules, typically large (> 5 cm), with irregular borders that commonly develop in multiples. These lesions can be clinically indistinguishable from melanomas, and a biopsy must be performed to confirm their diagnosis. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that melanotic macules are ext.

### Vulvar melanoma: Molecular characteristics, diagnosis, surgical management, and medical treatment [^111WQ18h]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Ten percent of all women have pigmented vulvar lesions. Fortunately, most of these are benign, but 1% of all melanomas in women affect the vulva. While the mortality rate of cutaneous melanoma has dropped by 7% annually during the last 5 years, the prognosis of vulvar melanoma remains dismal: the 5-year overall survival rate is 47% compared with 92% for cutaneous melanoma. The evidence suggests that this likely results from a combination of delayed diagnosis and different tumor biology, treatment strategies, and treatment response.

Although many landmark trials on checkpoint inhibitors included mucosal and vulvar melanomas, the results were often not reported separately. Post-hoc analyses indicate overall response rates between 19 and 37% for checkpoint inhibitors. A recently published retrospective study on vulvar melanomas suggests an objective response in 33.3%, with a similar safety profile to cutaneous melanoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be considered in refractory disease if a c-KIT mutation is present.
