## Question

When should a patient cardioverted with Afib?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to cardiovert a patient with atrial fibrillation, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and immediate cardioversion. Then, I should verify duration thresholds and anticoagulation requirements. Next, I will examine the TEE-guided pathway versus conventional anticoagulation. After that, I need to choose between electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion and optimize technique. Finally, I should confirm post-cardioversion anticoagulation, special populations, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the highest priority: hemodynamic instability. If the patient is unstable with hypotension, ischemia, pulmonary edema, or shock attributable to AF, I should not delay immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion; I need to ensure energy delivery is synchronized to the QRS to avoid inducing VF, and I should start therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as possible without delaying the life-saving intervention, then continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after conversion [^114C7n2g] [^112DEh1K] [^115MiMED] [^114JeqJh].

> Wait, let me verify the duration threshold for anticoagulation before elective cardioversion. For AF of 48 hours or longer, or of unknown duration, I should ensure at least 3 weeks of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or obtain imaging to exclude left atrial/appendage thrombus before cardioversion; DOACs are acceptable alternatives to VKAs for this purpose, and the rationale reflects elevated thromboembolic risk around cardioversion and delayed recovery of atrial mechanical function [^114a2Nao] [^1114beyh] [^115YwNv5] [^111tGoXH].

> Hold on, I should verify the TEE-guided pathway as an alternative. If precardioversion anticoagulation has not been given for at least 3 weeks, TEE can be used to exclude thrombus; if no thrombus is seen, cardioversion can proceed with therapeutic anticoagulation initiated and continued for at least 4 weeks, whereas if thrombus is present, I should delay cardioversion, anticoagulate for 3–6 weeks, and repeat TEE to confirm resolution before proceeding [^111XyJA1] [^115zqwaZ] [^1166nw74].

> I need to check the approach for short-duration AF. For AF clearly less than 48 hours, immediate cardioversion without prolonged precardioversion anticoagulation is generally acceptable, but I should start anticoagulation at presentation and continue for at least 4 weeks after conversion; importantly, risk is not homogeneous even under 48 hours, and higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores correlate with higher thromboembolic risk, so I should individualize decisions and consider imaging in higher-risk patients even when duration is under 48 hours [^116Dvx1X] [^111XyJA1] [^114Vm94J].

> Let me consider the "wait-and-see" strategy for recent-onset, stable AF. A delayed approach with initial rate control and deferred cardioversion if AF persists beyond 48 hours is noninferior to immediate cardioversion for achieving sinus rhythm at 4 weeks, with spontaneous conversion common; this supports shared decision-making when symptoms are tolerable and there is no instability [^111ybWC3] [^112QjBhM].

> Next, I should review modality selection. Electrical cardioversion is more effective and faster than pharmacologic cardioversion, making it preferred in unstable patients and reasonable as first-line in stable patients; pharmacologic cardioversion is an alternative when electrical cardioversion is not feasible or as an initial attempt in selected stable patients, recognizing lower efficacy and the need for monitoring for proarrhythmia [^114z1UZd] [^111pjzec] [^1148fAKR].

> I will now examine electrical cardioversion technique. I should confirm synchronized delivery and visually verify synchronization before each shock; for elective DCCV, an initial biphasic energy of at least 200 J improves first-shock success, and if the initial shock fails, I should optimize pad position (anterior-posterior often favored for longer-duration AF), consider higher energy, and use antiarrhythmic pretreatment to facilitate success; in obesity or refractory cases, manual pressure augmentation or dual-defibrillator techniques may help [^112DEh1K] [^112BvycQ] [^111pV5Xi] [^112rC6mY] [^112DsVww].

> Let me think about pharmacologic options and timing. Ibutilide and propafenone/flecainide are effective for recent-onset AF, with propafenone/flecainide most useful in structurally normal hearts and when combined with AV nodal blockade; amiodarone is slower to convert (often 8–12 hours) but is preferred in structural heart disease, heart failure, or ischemia; I should double-check for QT prolongation and drug interactions before choosing agents with torsades risk [^1137Z9YZ] [^115puGtm] [^1112u9AW] [^11181GGm].

> I should confirm post-cardioversion anticoagulation. Regardless of baseline stroke risk, therapeutic anticoagulation should continue for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion because of transient atrial mechanical dysfunction and early recurrence risk; beyond 4 weeks, I need to reassess long-term anticoagulation using CHA2DS2-VASc and bleeding risk, continuing therapy for those with thromboembolic risk factors [^114JeqJh] [^113MueRZ] [^116vKSco].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy, synchronized DCCV is safe for mother and fetus when indicated; in postoperative AF persisting beyond 48 hours without anticoagulation, I should image for LAA thrombus before cardioversion; in patients with pre-excitation/WPW and instability, immediate DCCV is indicated; in those with implanted devices, cardioversion is safe with appropriate pad placement and device interrogation afterward [^117Vxqzv] [^117JLsFJ] [^11377DFj] [^113WFqaF].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical decision algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Assess stability first; if unstable, immediate synchronized DCCV with urgent anticoagulation and at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation after. If stable, determine duration; if ≥ 48 hours or unknown, ensure 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or TEE to exclude thrombus before cardioversion; if < 48 hours, proceed with immediate cardioversion plus anticoagulation started at presentation and continued for at least 4 weeks, with heightened caution and consideration of imaging if CHA2DS2-VASc is ≥ 2 or onset is uncertain [^112rC6mY] [^111XyJA1] [^114Vm94J].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 48-hour rule was absolute for omitting precardioversion anticoagulation; I should correct that. Emerging data show thromboembolic risk rises with longer time-to-cardioversion even within 48 hours, particularly when CHA2DS2-VASc is high, so I should individualize and not rely solely on a strict 48-hour cutoff; guidelines increasingly emphasize risk stratification and imaging in higher-risk patients even with short AF duration [^114Vm94J] [^1135AUNG] [^111igjcQ].

> I should double-check that I have addressed recurrence and maintenance therapy. Recurrence after cardioversion is common, and early recurrence clusters in the first weeks; prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy can be considered in selected patients, but rhythm-control drugs have trade-offs, and many patients ultimately require rate-control strategies with appropriate anticoagulation based on stroke risk rather than repeated cardioversions [^1157WEdH] [^11181GGm] [^116DFXb1].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Immediate synchronized DCCV for instability; for stable patients, use duration to guide anticoagulation and consider TEE to expedite safe cardioversion; electrical cardioversion is more effective but pharmacologic options are reasonable in selected settings; post-conversion anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks is mandatory; and shared decision-making about timing and modality, including a delayed strategy when appropriate, aligns with contemporary evidence and guidelines [^114C7n2g] [^114a2Nao] [^114z1UZd] [^111ybWC3].

Cardioversion is indicated for atrial fibrillation (AF) when the patient is **hemodynamically unstable** (hypotension, ischemia, or acute heart failure) [^114C7n2g], in which case **immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion** is required [^111X6Aht]. For stable patients, cardioversion is appropriate when **symptoms persist despite rate control** or when **AF duration is < 48 hours** with low thromboembolic risk; if AF is ≥ 48 hours or duration is unknown, cardioversion requires ≥ 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or TEE to exclude thrombus [^114a2Nao] [^111XyJA1]. Pharmacologic cardioversion is reasonable for recent-onset AF [^1113Lbbc], but electrical cardioversion is preferred for faster, more reliable restoration of sinus rhythm [^114z1UZd].

## Indications for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation

### Hemodynamically unstable patients

In hemodynamically unstable patients, **immediate cardioversion** is indicated for AF with hypotension, ischemia, or acute heart failure [^114C7n2g] [^111X6Aht]. The **method of choice** is synchronized electrical cardioversion to rapidly restore sinus rhythm and stabilize hemodynamics [^114z1UZd].

---

### Hemodynamically stable patients

In hemodynamically stable patients, **symptom relief** is appropriate when AF causes significant symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness) despite rate control [^111M6fEV]. Early rhythm control is also indicated for **recent-onset AF** (< 48 hours) with low thromboembolic risk [^114Vm94J] [^111XyJA1].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

### Anticoagulation requirements

- **AF duration ≥ 48 hours or unknown**: ≥ 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or TEE to exclude thrombus before cardioversion [^114a2Nao] [^111XyJA1].
- **AF duration < 48 hours**: anticoagulation at presentation and continue ≥ 4 weeks after cardioversion [^116Dvx1X] [^114JeqJh].
- **TEE-guided strategy**: alternative to pre-cardioversion anticoagulation; if no thrombus, proceed with cardioversion and anticoagulate ≥ 4 weeks [^115zqwaZ] [^117B8fBv].

---

### Special considerations

- **Implanted devices**: cardioversion is safe with appropriate precautions [^113WFqaF].
- **Pregnancy**: cardioversion is safe for mother and fetus [^117Vxqzv].
- **Postoperative AF**: cardioversion with antiarrhythmic therapy if poorly tolerated; image if AF > 48 hours without anticoagulation [^117JLsFJ] [^116chuoS].

## Methods of cardioversion

| **Method** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Electrical cardioversion | - Hemodynamic instability <br/> - Symptomatic AF <br/> - Failed pharmacologic cardioversion | - Rapid <br/> - High success <br/> - Immediate sinus rhythm | - Sedation/anesthesia <br/> - Procedural risks |
| Pharmacologic cardioversion | - Recent-onset AF <br/> - Stable patients | - Non-invasive <br/> - No sedation | - Lower success <br/> - Proarrhythmic risk <br/> - Delayed effect |

---

## Risks and complications

- **Thromboembolism**: stroke/systemic embolism if anticoagulation is inadequate [^114Vm94J].
- **Proarrhythmia**: torsades de pointes with antiarrhythmics [^1113Lbbc].
- **Procedural risks**: sedation-related complications, skin burns, arrhythmias [^112DsVww].

---

## Post-cardioversion management

Continue **anticoagulation** for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion, then tailor to stroke risk [^114JeqJh] [^113MueRZ]. Monitor for **recurrence**, as it is common; consider antiarrhythmic therapy or ablation if it recurs [^1157WEdH] [^1139pN8w].

---

Cardioversion is indicated for AF in **hemodynamically unstable patients** or in **stable patients with persistent symptoms** or recent-onset AF with low thromboembolic risk. Anticoagulation is essential for AF ≥ 48 hours or unknown duration, and the method should be individualized based on clinical context and patient preferences.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter — pericardioversion anticoagulation: Anticoagulation is recommended for 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion for patients with AF of unknown duration or with AF for more than 48 h, and when acute AF produces hemodynamic instability, immediate cardioversion should not be delayed, but intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous injection of a low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated before cardioversion. Pooled data indicate that 98% of clinical thromboembolic events occur within 10 d, supporting administration of an anticoagulant for at least 4 wk after cardioversion and that continuation for a considerably longer period may be warranted even after apparently successful cardioversion. In a multicenter randomized study (n = 1222), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided and conventional strategies using anticoagulation 3 wk before and 4 wk after cardioversion showed comparably low risks of stroke (0.81% with the TEE approach and 0.50% with the conventional approach). For patients with atrial flutter undergoing cardioversion, anticoagulation should be considered with either strategy, and anticoagulation can be beneficial according to the recommendations as for patients with AF.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion — effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

### Is discharge to home after emergency department cardioversion safe for the treatment of recent-onset atrial fibrillation? [^114Nox4b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recent-onset atrial fibrillation, defined as a first detected or recurrent episode of atrial fibrillation lasting less than 48 hours, is a commonly encountered dysrhythmia in the emergency department (ED). Cardioversion of stable patients in the ED with recent-onset atrial fibrillation without antecedent anticoagulation would allow for these patients to be discharged directly to home. We searched the literature to determine whether any studies have investigated the safety of this management strategy and identified five that addressed this question. These studies are reviewed herein; importantly, not one ED patient who was cardioverted in any of the five studies suffered a thromboembolic event - the feared complication responsible for most of the controversy surrounding the ED management of atrial fibrillation. According to the available evidence, we conclude that it would be within the standard of care to discharge home stable patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation after cardioversion in the ED with adequate follow-up. It should be noted that although this strategy is safe and effective, the return visit rate for relapsed atrial fibrillation is 3% to 17%, and patients should be made aware of this possibility.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — antiarrhythmic pretreatment around cardioversion and safety: Antiarrhythmic medications may be initiated out of hospital or in hospital immediately prior to direct-current cardioversion, but risks include paradoxically increasing the defibrillation threshold with flecainide, accelerating the ventricular rate when class IA or IC drugs are given without an atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agent, and inducing ventricular arrhythmias. Prophylactic drug therapy to prevent early recurrence of AF should be considered individually for each patient; pretreatment with pharmacological agents is most appropriate in patients who fail to respond to direct-current cardioversion and in those who develop immediate or subacute recurrence of AF. In patients with late recurrence and those undergoing initial cardioversion of persistent AF, pretreatment is optional. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended in conjunction with a second cardioversion attempt, particularly when early relapse has occurred, whereas additional cardioversion, beyond a second attempt, is of limited value and should be reserved for carefully selected patients; infrequently repeated cardioversions may be acceptable in patients who are highly symptomatic upon relapse to AF.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — Goals and endpoints for pharmacological therapy: "Whether paroxysmal or persistent, AF is a chronic disorder, and recurrence at some point is likely in most patients". Pharmacological therapy "is indicated in patients who have troublesome symptoms related to paroxysmal AF or recurrent AF after cardioversion who can tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs and have a good chance of remaining in sinus rhythm over an extended period". Study endpoints and quality vary: "The number and quality of studies with each drug are limited; endpoints vary", and "because of clustering of recurrences in the first few weeks after cardioversion, the median time to first recurrence detected by transtelephonic monitoring may not differ between 2 treatment strategies". Importantly, "Recurrence of AF is not equivalent to treatment failure", and "Underlying heart disease or extracardiac disease is present in 80% of patients with persistent AF". Trials "included few patients at risk of drug-induced HF, proarrhythmia, or conduction disturbances".

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112rC6mY]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) — key recommendations are as follows: In patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm. In patients with AF who are hemodynamically stable, electrical cardioversion can be performed as an initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion. In patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion, energy delivery should be synchronized to the QRS to reduce the risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). For elective electrical cardioversion in AF, use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as initial energy can be beneficial to improve success of the initial electrical shock. When AF duration is longer or the initial shock is unsuccessful during elective cardioversion, optimization of electrode vector, use of higher energy, and pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can facilitate success. In patients with obesity and AF, manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy may be beneficial to improve success of electrical cardioversion.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, pharmacological cardioversion, indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering pharmacological cardioversion as an alternative to electrical cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with AF or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) hemodynamically stable — planned cardioversion algorithm outlines that " ≥ 3 wk duration of therapeutic anticoagulation before cardioversion or preprocedural imaging to exclude intracardiac thrombus before cardioversion (1)"; if "Uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation ≥ 3 wk confirmed?" then "Proceed with cardioversion on therapeutic anticoagulation (1)". If not, evaluate "AF duration < 48 h"; for AF ≥ 48 h, "Precardioversion imaging evaluation to exclude intracardiac thrombus (1)". For short-duration AF, "Even when reported AF < 48 h, consider imaging evaluation to exclude intracardiac thrombus (2b)", guided by "Is patient at elevated thromboembolic risk?" If imaging finds thrombus, "Anticoagulate for at least 3–6 wk and repeat imaging to confirm resolution of thrombus before cardioversion (1)". For low-risk patients with very brief AF, "For patients with low thromboembolic risk and AF duration < 12 h, the benefit of precardioversion imaging to exclude intracardiac thrombus is uncertain (2b)".

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114z1UZd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — electrical and pharmacological cardioversion overview is described as follows: Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control and can be achieved electrically or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and efficacy, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, and cardioversion should also be considered for hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In stable AF, both electrical and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and efficacious; electrical cardioversion is more effective than pharmacological cardioversion alone but involves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anticoagulation apply to both pharmacological and electrical cardioversion.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Prevention of thromboembolism during cardioversion in atrial fibrillation — For atrial fibrillation (AF) of 48-h duration or longer or unknown duration, anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after cardioversion. For AF of more than 48-h duration with hemodynamic instability requiring immediate cardioversion, heparin should be administered concurrently by an initial intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion to prolong activated partial thromboplastin time to 1.5 to 2 times the reference control value; thereafter, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) should be provided for at least 4 wk, and limited data support subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin in this indication. For AF of less than 48-h duration associated with hemodynamic instability, cardioversion should be performed immediately without delay for prior initiation of anticoagulation. During the first 48 h after onset of AF, the need for anticoagulation before and after cardioversion may be based on the patient's risk of thromboembolism. As an alternative to preprocedural anticoagulation, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to search for thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA); if no thrombus is identified, cardioversion is reasonable immediately after unfractionated heparin with activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5 to 2 times the control value until a vitamin K antagonist achieves an INR equal to or greater than 2.0, followed by oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) for at least 4 wk. For patients with thrombus identified by TEE, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is reasonable for at least 3 wk prior to and 4 wk after restoration of sinus rhythm.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: the 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^111M6fEV]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Integrated AF care aligned with patient needs

Once AF is diagnosed, patients should be offered treatment in five domains:
acute haemodynamic stabilisation in haemodynamically unstable patients (eg, by cardioversion, rate control, circulatory support, etc);
detection and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions;
stroke risk assessment and oral anticoagulation in patients with AF at risk for stroke;
rate control therapy in patients with elevated ventricular rates during AF;
rhythm control therapy in patients who remain symptomatic on rate control therapy.

Optimal management of patients with AF requires input from different medical specialties and professions. Integrated care models should be considered for all patients with AF, supporting shared decision-making and empowering patients to own their care, providing support where needed and giving access to all specialist treatment options when appropriate (figure 1). Such care models will require close cooperation between AF specialists, stroke physicians, AF surgeons, general cardiologists and general practitioners. In addition, continued high-quality care may need further support from allied healthcare professionals, patients, and family members.

### Personalized medicine and atrial fibrillation: will it ever happen? [^115itojk]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In many ways, as with most areas of clinical medicine, the management of patients with AF is already personalized. Prescription of thromboembolism prophylaxis regimens is tailored for each patient. Bedside stroke and bleeding risk prediction rules are available to help clinicians decide whether to prescribe aspirin or systemic anticoagulants. Cardioversions, antiarrhythmic therapy, and ablation for AF are variably prescribed depending on patient symptoms. When choosing which systemic anticoagulants or antiarrhythmic medications to prescribe, clinicians consider comorbidities, drug efficacy, adverse effects, contraindications, pharmacologic interactions, and cost. Ablation procedures for patients with persistent AF are more extensive than for those with paroxysmal AF.

Despite the personalized nature of AF management, care of patients with AF is challenging owing to the complexity of the arrhythmia. Patient management is limited by unpredictable recurrence and progression of AF, differing susceptibilities to stroke and heart failure, and variable treatment responses. These challenges are opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic innovation, and represent areas where genetic medicine might facilitate clinical management. Two promising areas for the near-term application of genetic information in AF include pharmacological management and risk prediction (Table 2).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

### Is early cardioversion for atrial fibrillation safe in patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast? [^115AGJgj]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The 2006 American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with atrial fibrillation state "For patients with no identifiable thrombus in the left atrium (LA) or left atrial appendage (LAA), cardioversion (CV) is reasonable immediately after anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin. Thereafter, continuation of oral anticoagulation is reasonable for an anticoagulation period of at least 4 weeks". For patients with thrombus identified by transesophageal echocardiography, guidelines recommend therapeutic oral anticoagulation for 3 weeks prior to and 4 weeks after elective cardioversion. Patients with spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) identified by TEE have a high risk of thromboembolic events,1–8 however, the guidelines do not address whether patients with SEC without thrombus can be safely cardioverted. This paper reviews the literature describing the pathogenesis of SEC, how it is detected, and whether elective cardioversion is safe. On the basis of our review, we believe that the risk of cardioembolic stroke after cardioversion of a patient with SEC is low, regardless of anticoagulation. The safe conclusion is that patients with SEC on TEE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation prior to cardioversion if possible and early cardioversion is not contraindicated.

### Case studies with the experts: management decisions in atrial fibrillation [^112jtifC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF, held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111tGoXH]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pericardioversion anticoagulation rationale — early experience and trial data support timing and modality: "This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, multicenter ACUTE… study of patients with > 2 days' duration of AF". "Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs", and "Cardiac computed tomography… has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus". Justification includes that anticoagulation is continued "for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion", with risks driven by "elevated thromboembolic risks… high early recurrence of AF, and observation of atrial dysfunction 2–5 days". Risks are "elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion", with recovery of atrial systole "over the ensuing 1 month".

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^116fK9eo]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (> 48 h or unknown duration) — elective electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion: we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation (adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist [VKA] therapy, target INR range 2.0–3.0, low-molecular-weight heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses, or dabigatran) for at least 3 weeks before cardioversion or a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion, rather than no anticoagulation (Grade 1B). We recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of the baseline risk of stroke (Grade 1B), and decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Early or delayed cardioversion in recent-onset atrial fibrillation [^111ybWC3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation commonly undergo immediate restoration of sinus rhythm by pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. However, whether immediate restoration of sinus rhythm is necessary is not known, since atrial fibrillation often terminates spontaneously.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with hemodynamically stable, recent-onset (< 36 hours), symptomatic atrial fibrillation in the emergency department to be treated with a wait-and-see approach (delayed-cardioversion group) or early cardioversion. The wait-and-see approach involved initial treatment with rate-control medication only and delayed cardioversion if the atrial fibrillation did not resolve within 48 hours. The primary end point was the presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks. Noninferiority would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the primary end point in percentage points was more than -10.

Results

The presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks occurred in 193 of 212 patients (91%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 202 of 215 (94%) in the early-cardioversion group (between-group difference, -2.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -8.2 to 2.2; P = 0.005 for noninferiority). In the delayed-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm within 48 hours occurred spontaneously in 150 of 218 patients (69%) and after delayed cardioversion in 61 patients (28%). In the early-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm occurred spontaneously before the initiation of cardioversion in 36 of 219 patients (16%) and after cardioversion in 171 patients (78%). Among the patients who completed remote monitoring during 4 weeks of follow-up, a recurrence of atrial fibrillation occurred in 49 of 164 patients (30%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 50 of 171 (29%) in the early-cardioversion group. Within 4 weeks after randomization, cardiovascular complications occurred in 10 patients and 8 patients, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients presenting to the emergency department with recent-onset, symptomatic atrial fibrillation, a wait-and-see approach was noninferior to early cardioversion in achieving a return to sinus rhythm at 4 weeks.

### What characterizes episodes of atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion? Experience from patients with an implantable atrial cardioverter [^114jwCzE]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms. Asymptomatic episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are, however, more common than symptomatic episodes. The aim of the study was to investigate whether episodes of atrial fibrillation for which the patient requires cardioversion differ from those in which the patient does not seek this therapy.

Methods

We studied 21 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with an implanted atrial cardioverter. The device displayed intracardiac electrograms from episodes of atrial fibrillation in which the patient received cardioversion and from episodes that did not lead to a hospital visit or cardioversion. The heart rate (mean, highest, and lowest) and the degree of ventricular interval irregularity were analyzed with these electrograms.

Results

There were 132 episodes of atrial fibrillation available for analysis, of which 73 led to cardioversion and 58 did not. Episodes leading to hospital/clinic visits and therapy had a higher maximum ventricular rate (130 vs 115/min, P = 0.0004) than episodes that did not cause the patients to seek therapy. This difference in heart rate was most prominent at the beginning of the episode, but tended to become more similar during the episode. There were no differences in ventricular cycle length irregularity between the 2 types of episodes. Moreover, treated episodes also had a significantly longer duration (mean duration 33 vs 9 hours, P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Episodes of atrial fibrillation that cause the patient to seek cardioversion are characterized by a high initial ventricular rate and a longer duration than those that go untreated.

Atrial fibrillation cardioversion (documented duration 48 h or less) — elective cardioversion: we suggest starting anticoagulation at presentation (low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin at full venous thromboembolism treatment doses) and proceeding to cardioversion rather than delaying cardioversion for 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we recommend therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C), and decisions about long-term anticoagulation after cardioversion should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — recurrence and predictors: An AFFIRM substudy found that with AF recurrence, if one is willing to cardiovert and continue or change the antiarrhythmic drug, about 80% of all patients will be in sinus rhythm by the end of 1 y. Most patients with AF, except those with postoperative or self-limited AF secondary to transient or acute illness, eventually experience recurrence, and risk factors for frequent recurrence of paroxysmal AF (more than 1 episode per month) include female gender and underlying heart disease. In one study of patients with persistent AF, the 4-y arrhythmia-free survival rate was less than 10% after single-shock direct-current cardioversion without prophylactic drug therapy, with predictors of recurrences including hypertension, age over 55 y, and AF duration longer than 3 mo. Serial cardioversions and prophylactic drug therapy resulted in freedom from recurrent AF in approximately 30% of patients, and with this approach predictors of recurrence included age over 70 y, AF duration beyond 3 mo, and HF; other risk factors include LA enlargement and rheumatic heart disease.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^116ZA3Mo]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two conditions that are likely to dominate the next 50 years of cardiovascular (CV) care. Both are increasingly prevalent and associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. They are closely inter-related with similar risk factors and shared pathophysiology. Patients with concomitant HF and AF suffer from even worse symptoms and poorer prognosis, yet evidence-based evaluation and management of this group of patients is lacking. In this review, we evaluate the common mechanisms for the development of AF in HF patients and vice versa, focusing on the evidence for potential treatment strategies. Recent data have suggested that these patients may respond differently than those with HF or AF alone. These results highlight the clear clinical need to identify and treat according to best evidence, in order to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce the huge burden that HF and AF are expected to have on global healthcare systems in the future. We propose an easy-to-use clinical mnemonic to aid the initial management of newly discovered concomitant HF and AF, the CAN-TREAT HFrEF + AF algorithm (Cardioversion if compromised; Anticoagulation unless contraindication; Normalize fluid balance; Target initial heart rate < 110 b.p.m.; Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone modification; Early consideration of rhythm control; Advanced HF therapies; Treatment of other CV disease).

### Risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack in patients with a diagnosis of resolved atrial fibrillation: retrospective cohort studies [^112WxTUQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with a fivefold increase in risk of stroke. Treatment with anticoagulants reduces the risk by about two thirds.

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is categorised into three subtypes: paroxysmal if normal rhythm is restored spontaneously; persistent if the episode lasts more than seven days or is terminated earlier using drug or direct current cardioversion; and permanent if cardioversion fails to restore normal heart rhythm. Catheter or surgical ablation may be used when cardioversion fails or there is evidence of an underlying electrophysiological disorder.

Atrial fibrillation can be characterised as resolved once normal rhythm is restored, but subsequent recurrence is possible after spontaneous resolution or cardioversion. Similarly, long term success rates of ablation might be as low as 20%. Patients in whom atrial fibrillation is considered resolved might in fact have paroxysmal or persistent subtypes, or atrial fibrillation that might recur. Such patients might remain at an increased risk of stroke and continue to benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis.

In the United Kingdom no clear guidance exists on how to treat patients with resolved atrial fibrillation. In clinical guidelines commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, patients with resolved atrial fibrillation are not explicitly mentioned, although for patients who have undergone ablation, the guidelines briefly state that the authors "believe that common clinical practice is to continue to treat patients in accordance with their pre-ablation stroke risk score". In England, however, patients with a record of resolved atrial fibrillation are excluded from the Quality and Outcomes Framework atrial fibrillation register, a scheme that incentivises appropriate management of patients with atrial fibrillation in primary care; guidance issued by NHS England states that patients with resolved atrial fibrillation should be "removed from the register" — the implication being that these patients do not require further monitoring or anticoagulant treatment. European, Canadian, and US guidelines make no reference to patients with resolved atrial fibrillation; however, while noting a lack of evidence, they do recommend that anticoagulant treatment be continued after cardioversion or after ablation in patients at high risk of stroke.

### Role of transesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation [^114XyfiS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Electrical cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently performed to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac performance. Patients undergoing cardioversion are treated conventionally with therapeutic anticoagulation for three weeks before and four weeks after cardioversion to decrease the risk of thromboembolism. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided strategy has been proposed as an alternative that may lower stroke and bleeding events. Patients without atrial cavity thrombus or atrial appendage thrombus by TEE are cardioverted on achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation, whereas cardioversion is delayed in higher risk patients with thrombus. The aim of this review is to discuss the issues and controversies associated with the management of patients with AF undergoing cardioversion. We provide an overview of the TEE-guided and conventional anticoagulation strategies in light of the recently completed Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) clinical trial. The two management strategies comparably lower the patient's embolic risk when the guidelines are properly followed. The TEE-guided strategy with shorter term anticoagulation may lower the incidence of bleeding complications and safely expedite early cardioversion. The inherent advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are presented. The TEE-guided approach with short-term anticoagulation is considered to be a safe and clinically effective alternative to the conventional approach, and it is advocated in patients in whom earlier cardioversion would be clinically beneficial.

Internal atrial defibrillators — A transvenous atrial cardioverter delivering a 3/3-ms biphasic waveform shock required relatively high energy in persistent atrial fibrillation (mean 3.5 J). An implantable device with atrial sensing/cardioversion and ventricular sensing/pacing was evaluated in 290 patients with mean left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 50% who had not responded to 4 antiarrhythmic drugs; across 614 AF episodes treated with 1497 shocks (mean 2.4 shocks per episode), conversion to sinus rhythm was 93%. These units accurately record AF and provide valuable measurement of AF control, but patient tolerability limits routine use because most patients find discharge energies over 1 J uncomfortable and the mean cardioversion threshold is approximately 3 J, making such devices unacceptable for routine clinical use.

### Emergency medicine considerations in atrial fibrillation [^113gtyu4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal heart rhythm which may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. Emergency physicians play a role in diagnosing AF, managing symptoms, and lessening complications from this dysrhythmia.

Objective

This review evaluates recent literature and addresses ED considerations in the management of AF.

Discussion

Emergency physicians should first assess patient clinical stability and evaluate and treat reversible causes. Immediate cardioversion is indicated in the hemodynamically unstable patient. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society provide recommendations for management of AF. If hemodynamically stable, rate or rhythm control are options for management of AF. Physicians may opt for rate control with medications, with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers the predominant medications utilized in the ED. Patients with intact left ventricular function should be rate controlled to < 110 beats per minute. Rhythm control is an option for patients who possess longer life expectancy and those with AF onset < 48 h before presentation, anticoagulated for 3–4 weeks, or with transesophageal echocardiography demonstrating no intracardiac thrombus. Direct oral anticoagulants are a safe and reliable option for anticoagulation. Clinical judgment regarding disposition is recommended, but literature supports discharging stable patients who do not have certain comorbidities.

Conclusion

Proper diagnosis and treatment of AF is essential to reduce complications. Treatment and overall management of AF include rate or rhythm control, cardioversion, anticoagulation, and admission versus discharge. This review discusses ED considerations regarding AF management.

### Strategies for optimizing efficacy of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^114yjQ4t]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Direct current cardioversion (DCCV) is a cornerstone in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is the quickest way to convert AF to sinus rhythm. Overall, the procedure is effective and safe, but the efficacy of DCCV can be reduced due to modifiable and non-modifiable patient characteristics, or procedural factors. Additionally, inadequate preparation, such as a lack of QRS-synchronization or omitting preprocedural imaging of the left atrial appendage (LAA), could lead to significant harm. This manuscript discusses a brief history of electrical cardioversion, the currently available cardioverter settings/configuration with the highest success rate, the common barriers to successful cardioversion, strategies to overcome these barriers, and suggested protocols to ensure a high level of patient safety.

Cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) of short duration — risk stratification within < 48 hours: The safety of cardioversion without further assessment of or periprocedural anticoagulation in patients with AF duration of < 48 hours has been challenged, with concerns that emerging data demonstrate that thromboembolic risks in patients with < 48 hours of AF were not homogeneously low. Time to cardioversion > 12 hours has been reported as an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications. In a single-center observational study of AF cardioversion with < 48 hours duration, no thromboembolic events were observed in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1 or in patients with postoperative AF, but differential thromboembolic rates were noted in CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2. Larger studies similarly demonstrated that among patients with < 48 hours of AF, postcardioversion thromboembolic risks increased with increasing CHA2DS2-VASc.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter — rhythm control emphasizes that severely haemodynamically compromised atrial fibrillation (AF) patients "should undergo emergency external electrical cardioversion", whereas in haemodynamically stable AF patients elective cardioversion is performed to improve symptoms with the mode "based on the clinical setting". Electrical cardioversion is described as having a "greater immediate success rate… and shorter hospitalization", while pharmacological cardioversion may avoid general anaesthesia/deep sedation and "may prevent early AF recurrence". Observational data report pharmacological cardioversion use "in > 50% of patients" with paroxysmal (52.1%) or persistent AF (65.2%). Controlled trials show spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) within 48 h in 76–83% of recent-onset AF cases (10–18% within 3 h; 55–66% within 24 h). Reported pharmacological cardioversion success rates "range from 10% to 80%, depending on AF duration".

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

Atrial fibrillation — urgent cardioversion in hemodynamic instability: For patients with AF and hemodynamic instability undergoing urgent cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic), we suggest that therapeutic-dose parenteral anticoagulation be started before cardioversion, if possible (Grade 2C), but that initiation of anticoagulation must not delay any emergency intervention (Grade 2C). After successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm, we suggest therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm rather than no anticoagulation, regardless of baseline stroke risk (Grade 2C). Decisions about anticoagulation beyond 4 weeks should be made in accordance with our risk-based recommendations for long-term antithrombotic therapy in section 2.1.

### Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^115zwGjK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, increases the risk of cognitive impairment, and adversely affects cardiovascular haemodynamics. Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation has been in use since the 1960s; the rationale is that restoration of sinus rhythm improves cardiovascular haemodynamics, reduces the risk of stroke, and obviates the need for long-term anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter on the annual risk of thromboembolic events, strokes and mortality (primary outcomes measures), the rate of cognitive decline, quality of life, the use of anticoagulants and the risk of re-hospitalisation (secondary outcome measures) in adults (> 18 years) with acute, paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and any aetiology.

Search Strategy

One reviewer searched the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register (2000 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980 to December 2000), CINAHL (1982 to November 2000) and proceedings of the American College of Cardiology (published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology 1983 to 2000). Reference lists of articles were searched. Personal contact was made with experts in the field. A second reviewer handsearched proceedings of the British Cardiac Society (published in British Heart Journal (1980 to 1995) and in Heart (1995 to May 2001); proceedings of the European Congress of Cardiology and meetings of the Joint Working Groups of the European Society of Cardiology (published in European Heart Journal 1983–2000); scientific sessions of the American Heart Association (published in Circulation 1990–2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trial or controlled clinical trials of electrical cardioversion plus 'usual care' versus 'usual care' only, where 'usual care' included any combination of the following: anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs and drugs for 'rate control', in adults (> 18 years) with acute, paroxysmal or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and any aetiology.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned to extract study data onto data extraction forms. The planned analysis was by the statistical package in RevMan.

Main Results

No completed randomised trials or controlled clinical trials of electrical cardioversion were found. Two ongoing trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There were no data from completed randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials to either support or refute the use of electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. Randomised trials of electrical cardioversion are required.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^116DQwQX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Current Guideline Recommendations

Current AF guidelines all recommend 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation with oral anticoagulation therapy (VKA, DTI, or FXa inhibitors) before cardioversion. 5, 20, 24, 25, 26 When early cardioversion is required, all guidelines recommend TEE to exclude the presence of left atrial thrombus. However, when addressing how soon after initiation of anticoagulation cardioversion is safe, ambiguity emerges among the guidelines. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS), and CHEST guidelines recommend attainment of "therapeutic" parenteral anticoagulation before cardioversion. 5, 20 The CHEST guidelines suggest that oral DTI and oral FXa inhibitors may be suitable for cardioversion with no recommendation on timing of doses precardioversion other than to state that dabigatran achieves steady state in 2 to 3 days. 5 It is important to note that only dabigatran and rivaroxaban were FDA‐approved therapies at the time the CHEST guidelines were constructed and these agents were not well studied in the setting of cardioversion. The European Heart Rhythm Association guideline states "anticoagulation with heparin or oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitors should be initiated as soon as possible" without giving a minimum time frame before cardioversion. 24 Similarly, the AHA Scientific Statement on Management of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors in the Acute Care and Periprocedural Setting do not provide a minimum time frame or number of doses of anticoagulant before cardioversion. 27 Finally, the European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of oral DTI and FXa inhibitors and Canadian guidelines both recommend a single dose of either a parenteral anticoagulant or oral DTI or oral FXa inhibitor anticoagulant before cardioversion. 25, 26 The European Heart Rhythm Association recommends the oral DTI/oral FXa inhibitor anticoagulant be administered at least 4 hours before cardioversion, whereas the Canadian guidelines do not specify timeline between administration and cardioversion (Table 1).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — post-cardioversion electrical remodeling and atrial function change over defined timeframes: prolonged AF disturbs atrial contractile function and recovery can be delayed for days or weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm, which affects anticoagulation decisions, and prolonged AF may also lengthen sinus node recovery time. Reversal of electrical remodeling varies by atrial region, with the effective refractory period of the lateral right atrium increasing within 1 h after cardioversion while that in the coronary sinus was delayed for 1 wk, and another study reporting recovery of normal atrial refractoriness complete within 3 to 4 d with no interregional difference thereafter.

### Atrial fibrillation is associated with higher overall mortality in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tBqeM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been shown to reduce sudden cardiac death and improve survival when used as primary prevention in selected heart failure (HF) patients with left ventricular dysfunction and secondary prevention in patients who survive previous cardiac arrest or have sustained ventricular tachycardia. 1 ICD exerts this benefit by successfully detecting and terminating life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias and thereby preventing sudden cardiac death. However, it is extremely important for the ICD device to precisely distinguish between atrial and ventricular arrhythmias before delivering a shock, given that inappropriate ICD shock therapy for atrial arrhythmias wrongly detected as ventricular arrhythmias is a common adverse event in patients with ICD. 2

The rate of ICD implantation has increased in recent years; however, whether ICD is placed for primary or secondary prevention, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequently found supraventricular arrhythmia in these patients. Nonetheless, whether AF, which is an independent predictor of mortality in the general population, 3 heralds worse outcomes in patients with ICD is not fully established.

Previously published studies are contradictory and offer little insight. 4, 5, 6 Therefore, the aim of this meta‐analysis is: (1) to determine whether mortality benefit of ICD is similar in patients with AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and (2) whether AF is an independent predictor of appropriate shock therapy.

### Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation: a contemporary viewpoint [^113gV4WY]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation is important. This review consists of three parts: chronic anticoagulation, anticoagulation for cardioversion, and a brief comment on anticoagulation around the time of left atrial radiofrequency ablation. The risk stratification scheme of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ESC) guidelines for chronic anticoagulation is briefly reviewed. Although there are several other similar schemes, they are not identical. The key point is the balance between benefit and risk. Some emerging controversies are outlined. Two specific questions explored are: is well-controlled hypertension a risk factor, and does paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confer the same risk as continuous atrial fibrillation? Differences in the risk of bleeding while taking a vitamin K antagonist noted in recent compared with older data are discussed. Risk of bleeding in the elderly and combined antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist and an antiplatelet agent in high-risk patients are briefly discussed. Recent failures of studies attempting to find a suitable alternative to vitamin K antagonists are outlined. The treatment guidelines for anticoagulation for cardioversion are briefly reviewed. The risk of thromboembolism according to international normalized ratio and use of low-molecular-weight heparin as an alternative to warfarin are discussed. Anticoagulation before and after left atrial radiofrequency ablation is empirical, and long-term anticoagulation seems advisable for high risk patients at the present time. The two most pressing needs for further investigation are (1) clarification, simplification, and consolidated of risk stratification schemes and treatment recommendations and (2) discovery of alternatives to warfarin.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^112HEtzn]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

When we analysed patients who received pharmacological or direct current cardioversion, we found that the event rates for non-haemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism, and major bleeding within the first year of cardioversion were similar in the two groups. After adjusting for known confounders, we found no significant difference in mortality rates. The low number of events made it difficult to obtain robust hazard ratio estimates to compare cardioversion type effects on other outcomes.

Strengths and limitations of the study

One strength of the GARFIELD-AF registry is the large study sample with patients represented from many countries, which improves generalisability to real world clinical practice. Data in the registry are observational and non-randomised, and for any comparisons the data had to be adjusted for potential confounding baseline factors. Cardioversion was not randomised and the rationale for varying treatment decisions is unknown; although robust statistical methods were used to account for differences between groups, the potential for residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Although several possible confounders were included in the propensity score weighting scheme, we were not able to account for factors such as healthier lifestyle, better surveillance, and adjunctive treatment. Other unrecognised factors might also have influenced the results and the application of falsification endpoints to check for residual confounding was not deemed feasible with the available recorded outcomes.

Information on type of cardioversion was only available from the follow-up forms and the modality is therefore not known for all cardioversions performed. Data on success and duration of a successfully restored sinus rhythm were not obtained. The precise treatment given for pharmacological cardioversion was not collected.

The decision to separate baseline cardioversions from follow-up cardioversions at 48 days was based on the requirement of previous anticoagulation treatment, and therefore this was an arbitrary choice. The analysis and the comparison between cardioversion and no cardioversion were applied to this group. Therefore, the results presented in this study might not be generalisable to patients with longer duration of atrial fibrillation. In the cardioversion type analysis, event rates were too low to calculate adjusted hazard ratios for non-fatal events. Therefore, differences in the baseline risk profile between the two groups should be taken into account when interpreting the results.

Clinical event rates were evaluated after two years in the cardioversion versus no cardioversion analysis and after one year when analysing the type of cardioversion. A longer observation time would be valuable when assessing the long-terms effects of the different interventions.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: state of the art [^11736o7w]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Predominantly a disease of advancing age, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Its prevalence is rising as the proportion of elderly people in the population continues its inexorable rise. Without more effective therapeutic interventions, AF-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality will also continue to rise. Antiarrhythmic drugs are an essential tool in the management of AF and may be used as premedication before cardioversion; together with cardioversion to help or assist cardioversion; or given afterward to prevent recurrence. If AF recurs after one or two cardioversions, then it is usual to adopt a rate control strategy; highly symptomatic patients who fail cardioversion may benefit from ablation therapy. We are already on the threshold of a large expansion in the use of ablation therapy, a strategy that has potential to deliver dramatic improvements in outcome. Not only can AF be cured by ablative therapy, but there is also evidence that it confers functional improvement as well. It will not, however, be appropriate for all AF patients and pharmacological therapies will continue to have an important place in the management of AF. The plethora of antiarrhythmic drugs currently available for the treatment of AF is a reflection that none is wholly satisfactory, each having limited efficacy combined with poor safety and tolerability. Improved class III antiarrhythmic agents, such as dronedarone; new classes of antiarrhythmic agents, such as atrial repolarization delaying agents; and upstream therapies dealing with substrate represent potential sources of new pharmacological therapies for AF.

### A review of factors associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm after elective electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation [^116q5zJq]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart-rhythm disorder, affecting about 1.5% to 2% of the population with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity due to stroke, thromboembolism, and heart failure. If the conversion back to sinus rhythm does not happen spontaneously, pharmacological or electrical cardioversion (ECV) is the next available treatment options for some patients. However, the long-term success following ECV is variable. This review describes the factors that are associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm following ECV and proposes a clinical strategy based on the available evidence.

Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation — synchronization, energy strategy, and electrode orientation — is specified as follows: Electrical cardioversion for AF should be synchronized with the QRS complex because unsynchronized or inappropriately synchronized cardioversion can induce VF if delivered during the vulnerable T wave; the synchronization feature must be turned on and visually confirmed before each shock attempt. In a randomized study of 279 patients undergoing synchronized direct current cardioversion with biphasic waveform, first shock success was higher with maximum‑fixed energy (75% compared with 34% for low‑escalating energy group). In the RAFF2 study of recent‑onset, hemodynamically stable AF, an initial biphasic 200 J shock with up to 3 consecutive shocks allowed achieved conversion to sinus rhythm in 176 of 192 (92%) patients. Regarding electrode vectors, when energy output is optimized and AF is of recent onset, either vector orientation may be reasonable, but for longer duration AF the anterior‑posterior orientation may be favorable. Increased body weight has been associated with reduced success of electrical cardioversion; alternatives in refractory cases include the use of 2 defibrillators simultaneously, effectively doubling delivered energy.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^116DFXb1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

After anticoagulation treatment for stroke prevention has been prescribed to appropriate patients (those with increased risk of stroke), there are two main treatment approaches for atrial fibrillation. One approach is to try and restore sinus rhythm, which can be achieved by direct current or pharmacological cardioversion. Rhythm control can potentially relieve symptoms and prevent progression of atrial fibrillationand left atrial remodelling. The other treatment option is to allow atrial fibrillation to continue but to control the ventricular rate (rate control). Several randomised controlled trials have shown that this treatment strategy is non-inferior to rhythm control when considering endpoints such as stroke rates and mortality. Previous studies also indicate that rates of hospital admission for rate control are lower than those for rhythm control. Guidelines in Europe and America support both strategies but stress the need for better knowledge about their efficacy and safety. However, the recently reported Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4)showed that early rhythm control was superior to guideline mandated management, which consisted largely of rate control until or unless symptoms became refractory.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF (GARFIELD-AF) is a worldwide prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The registry includes information on baseline patient characteristics, rate of interventions such as cardioversions, and clinical outcomes. Only patients with first time onset of atrial fibrillation within six weeks were included, and so a high proportion might be eligible for an early rhythm control strategy. These data assess the use of cardioversion in daily clinical practice and might provide important information for clinicians treating patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of patients who received cardioversion treatment at baseline versus those who did not, and to assess types of cardioversion performed. We also describe the associations between cardioversion and clinical outcomes in a large dataset of patients presenting with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation classification — types and definitions (Table 1) specify episode- and pattern-based categories for use around ablation. An atrial fibrillation episode is defined as AF documented by ECG monitoring with a duration of at least 30 seconds or, if shorter, present continuously throughout the tracing. Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF (≥ two episodes) that terminates spontaneously within 7 days, and episodes of AF of < 48 hours' duration terminated with electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion should also be classified as paroxysmal AF episodes. Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond seven days, and episodes cardioverted after ≥ 48 hours of AF but prior to 7 days should also be classified as persistent AF episodes. Longstanding persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than 12 months' duration. The term permanent AF is not appropriate in patients undergoing catheter or surgical ablation of AF; if a patient previously classified as having permanent AF is to undergo catheter or surgical ablation, the AF should be reclassified. It is recognized that patients may have both paroxysmal and persistent AF; a patient's AF type should be defined as the most frequent type of AF experienced within six months of an ablation procedure, and continuous AF is AF that is documented to be present on all ECG monitoring performed during a defined period of time; additionally, we recommend that the term 'chronic AF' not be used in the context of patients undergoing ablation of AF.

Clinical Implications

When used as pretreatment for a minimum of 3 weeks before cardioversion — the conventional or delayed cardioversion strategy — DTI and FXa inhibitors are noninferior VKA therapy in NAVF. When initiated acutely among anticoagulation‐naïve patients (with or without TEE depending on duration of AF), pharmacologic data and some outcome data provide guidance for safe use. Dabigatran, which displays the greatest accumulation over time and has the least amount of data to support an early cardioversion strategy, should be administered for at least 48 to 72 hours, achieving steady‐state concentrations before cardioversion. Rivaroxaban, which displays little to no accumulation over time and has the widest breadth of data to support an early cardioversion strategy, can have cardioversion performed at least 4 hours after the initial dose. Apixaban, which displays modest accumulation over time that appears to be overcome by giving a loading dose, has the most recent data and largest cohort to support an early cardioversion strategy. Apixaban should be administered for at least 48 to 72 hours, achieving steady‐state concentrations if the standard dose is utilized before cardioversion or if cardioversion is performed at least 2 hours after a loading dose (10 or 5 mg for those meeting standard requirements for dose adjustment). Finally, edoxaban, which displays little to no accumulation over time and has the largest, randomized, prospective trial to date, can have cardioversion performed at least 2 hours after the initial dose.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in atrial fibrillation — diagnostic role and cardioversion guidance — indicates that TEE is a sensitive and specific technique for detection of left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, permits superior evaluation for other causes of cardiogenic embolism and measurement of LA function, and identifies features associated with thromboembolism, including thrombus, reduced flow velocity, spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC) in the LA or LAA, and atheromatous disease of the aorta. Detection of LA/LAA thrombus stands as a contraindication to elective cardioversion of AF, the absence of a detectable thrombus does not preclude stroke after cardioversion in the absence of anticoagulation therapy, and a TEE‑guided strategy for elective cardioversion yielded comparable thromboembolism and death outcomes to conventional anticoagulation for 3 w before and 4 w after cardioversion.

### DC cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department: improving specialist protocols for the generalist [^115pJWCc]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, with a prevalence in the general population of approximately 1%. It accounts for at least 3% of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure, with a steadily increasing 10% of all UK emergency admissions related to AF or atrial flutter.

NHS England provides guidance for AF as an 'ambulatory care sensitive condition', that is, a condition where appropriate management in the acute setting can reduce the need for hospital admission. Indeed, many patients presenting with AF or flutter with symptoms or uncontrolled ventricular rate can be safely treated in the ED with a synchronised direct current (DC) cardioversion, an electric shock therapy which, if successful, restores a normal sinus heart rhythm and allows discharge home from the ED. This treatment has been shown to be safeand effective, and should be encouraged, where local services allow.

A key consideration at the time of DC cardioversion is the need to anticoagulate to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. Although it has long been established that a new-onset AF or atrial flutter within 48 hours is likely safe to cardiovert, new data have raised questions about the role of postprocedural anticoagulationand this is reflected in the latest European and British guidelines — with the decision to anticoagulate based on the patient's individualised thromboembolic risk, using the 'CHADsVASc' risk score. Within our own institution, we sought to assess and improve the proportion of ED cardioversions which adhered to this updated guidance to improve compliance with best practice and maximise patient safety.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided cardioversion process — A TEE-guided approach with abbreviated anticoagulation before cardioversion is an alternative to the conventional approach of using a minimum of 3 weeks therapeutic precardioversion anticoagulation. Under a TEE-guided strategy, patients receive anticoagulation and once therapeutic, undergo screening TEE; if thrombus is seen in either atrial appendage or atrium at the time of TEE, cardioversion is postponed, and if no thrombus is seen, the patient proceeds immediately to cardioversion; a TEE-guided strategy requires an experienced echocardiographer because accurate visualization of thrombus may be operator dependent.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^113y1CQm]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants among patients undergoing cardioversion: the importance of timing before cardioversion [^116KeCGu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The ENSURE‐AF (Edoxaban versus enoxaparin‐warfarin in patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation) trial published in October 2016 was the first multinational, randomized, open‐label, prospective trial of an oral FXa inhibitor versus conventional therapy of enoxaparin‐warfarin in patients who were undergoing electrical cardioversion. 47 The study population comprised patients with NVAF, the duration of which was no shorter than 48 hours and no longer than 12 months, in whom an electrical cardioversion was planned. A total of 2199 patients were enrolled, the largest published, prospective, randomized trial to date. Patients were stratified into 2 cardioversion approaches — a TEE‐guided stratum (1192 patients, 589 on edoxaban) and a non‐TEE‐guided stratum (1016 patients). Within each stratum patients were randomly assigned to either edoxaban 60 mg daily (30 mg for CrCl 15–50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or concurrent use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors) or enoxaparin‐dose‐adjusted warfarin with warfarin dose adjusted to maintain an INR of 2 to 3. In the TEE‐guided stratum, a TEE and electrical cardioversion had to be performed within 3 days of randomization; patients with an INR < 2 were given a minimum of 1 dose of enoxaparin and warfarin before cardioversion and patients assigned to edoxaban were given a minimum of 1 dose at least 2 hours before cardioversion. In both groups, anticoagulation was continued for 28 days postcardioversion. Of note, 100% of patients in the early cardioversion group had TEE performed. In the non‐TEE‐guided stratum, patients were anticoagulated with warfarin (with the addition of enoxaparin for patients with an INR < 2 until INR was therapeutic) or edoxaban for a minimum of 21 days before electrical cardioversion. Median time to cardioversion was 2 days in the TEE stratum and 23 days in the non‐TEE stratum. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite end point of SSE, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and the primary safety outcome was the composite end point of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding — both assessed 30 days after cardioversion. The combined primary efficacy end point in the overall population (TEE guided and non‐TEE guided groups) was not different between the edoxaban group and the enoxaparin‐warfarin group (0.46% versus 1%, odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.12–1.43). The combined primary safety end point in the overall population was not different between the edoxaban group and the enoxaparin‐warfarin group (1.5% versus 1.02%, odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 0.64–3.55). End points were evenly distributed in the TEE‐guided stratum and non‐TEE‐guided stratum groups. Unlike trials of oral DTI and other oral FXa inhibitors, the ENSURE‐AF did not reduce time to cardioversion compared with warfarin. Similar to other prospective trials, the ENSURE‐AF was limited by an open‐label design (Table 3).

### Management of recent-onset sustained atrial fibrillation: pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies [^115fsHyb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recent studies have highlighted significant variations in the management of recent-onset sustained atrial fibrillation (AF). We aim to provide a succinct and clear management algorithm for physicians treating patients with recent-onset sustained AF.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of the literature on the management of recent-onset sustained AF with focus on studies reporting cardioversion of AF, antiarrhythmic agents, and anticoagulation. We also reviewed recent practice guidelines on AF management.

Findings

This review provides a guide on a tailored management approach of patients with recent-onset sustained AF. After initial detailed clinical assessment, optimal rate and rhythm control options can be provided, depending on hemodynamic stability, duration of AF episode, and AF stroke risk. Issues surrounding electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion are discussed in detail. We emphasize the importance of thromboembolic risk assessment and appropriate anticoagulation surrounding the point of cardioversion. Last, we highlighted the need for appropriate specialized follow-up care after acute AF management.

Implications

Despite the highly heterogeneous clinical presentations, management of recent-onset sustained AF must include stroke risk assessment, appropriate anticoagulation, and follow-up care in all patients beyond optimum rate and rhythm control strategies.

### Cardioversion… [^115w36wA]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

These are connected by cables to a machine which has the combined functions of an ECG display screen and the electrical function of a defibrillator. A synchronizing function allows the cardioverter to deliver a reversion shock, by way of the pads, of a selected amount of electric current over a predefined number of milliseconds at the optimal moment in the cardiac cycle which corresponds to the R wave of the QRS complex on the ECG. Timing the shock to the R wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle, which could induce ventricular fibrillation. If the patient is conscious, various drugs are often used to help sedate the patient and make the procedure more tolerable. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or unconscious, the shock is given immediately upon confirmation of the arrhythmia.

When synchronized electrical cardioversion is performed as an elective procedure, the shocks can be performed in conjunction with drug therapy until sinus rhythm is attained. After the procedure, the patient is monitored to ensure stability of the sinus rhythm. Synchronized electrical cardioversion is used to treat hemodynamically unstable supraventricular tachycardias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It is also used in the emergent treatment of wide complex tachycardias, including ventricular tachycardia, when a pulse is present. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are treated with unsynchronized shocks referred to as defibrillation. Electrical therapy is inappropriate for sinus tachycardia, which should always be a part of the differential diagnosis. Medication Various antiarrhythmic agents can be used to return the heart to normal sinus rhythm.

Pharmacological cardioversion is an especially good option in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset. Drugs that are effective at maintaining normal rhythm after electric cardioversion can also be used for pharmacological cardioversion. Class II agents are beta blockers which inhibit SA and AV node depolarization and slow heart rate. They also decrease cardiac oxygen demand and can prevent cardiac remodeling. Not all beta blockers are the same; some are cardio selective while others are non-selective. Beta blockers that target the beta-1 receptor are called cardio selective because beta-1 is responsible for increasing heart rate; hence a beta blocker will slow the heart rate. Class III agents: amiodarone and sotalol are effective class III agents.

Ibutilide is another Class III agent but has a different mechanism of action. It has been shown to be effective in acute cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Class IV drugs are calcium channel blockers. They work by inhibiting the action potential of the SA and AV nodes. If the patient is stable, adenosine may be used for restoration of sinus rhythm in patients with macro-reentrant supraventricular tachycardias. It causes a short-lived cessation of conduction through the atrio-ventricular node breaking the circus movement through the node and the macro-reentrant pathway restoring sinus rhythm. The anesthesiology team will then administer a general anesthetic in order to ensure patient comfort and amnesia during the procedure. Opioid analgesics (e.g.

### Cardioversion for atrial fibrillation | NEJM resident 360… [^112vajky]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published January 5, 2022 As a cardiology fellow, I receive consultation requests for management of atrial fibrillation on a daily basis from both inpatient and outpatient settings. AF accounts for 0. 5% of U. S. emergency department visits, and our ED colleagues commonly ask whether a patient should undergo cardioversion, admission, or both. Patients may present with acute symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations, and exertional fatigue or even with congestive heart failure. Others may be asymptomatic and have had AF detected incidentally in the outpatient office. For symptomatic patients, restoration of sinus rhythm via cardioversion can quickly resolve symptoms, but cardioversion is by no means a benign process. At my institution in the U. S., electrical cardioversion is generally the preferred method, and the requirement for sedation comes with its own cost and risk.

Alternatively, pharmacologic cardioversion still requires the expertise and availability of a cardiologist and the resources for monitoring afterwards. We know that regardless of cardioversion methods, the procedure can trigger thromboembolic complications in the absence of anticoagulation, even if duration of AF is short. Although cardioversion may be an effective solution for acute-onset AF, it only addresses one moment in the management of what is often a chronic condition. Many patients develop self-limited episodic AF before progressing to recurrent and more–persistent disease. For a first episode, rates of spontaneous conversion of AF to sinus rhythm are quite high. Given the costs and risks of cardioversion and uncertain long-term benefits, investigators of the RACE 7 ACWAS trial examined whether delaying cardioversion in the acute management of symptomatic AF is as effective and safe as immediate cardioversion in the ED.

They compared a wait-and-see approach with an immediate cardioversion approach on presentation to the ED. The wait-and-see approach was found to be noninferior to immediate cardioversion for the primary outcome of sinus rhythm 4 weeks later. Further observations from the trial confirmed that recent-onset AF is indeed paroxysmal: 69% of patients in the delayed-cardioversion group had spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm within 48 hours and 29% of patients in the early-cardioversion group had recurrent AF within 4 weeks of the index visit. Overall, both approaches were safe with timely administration of anticoagulation to high-risk patients. The following NEJM Journal Watch summary provides more details of the trial and findings.

For achieving sinus rhythm within 4 weeks and avoiding cardiovascular complications, immediate cardioversion in the emergency department was no better than cardioversion at 48 hours. Atrial fibrillation is a common presentation in the emergency department, but it's not always clear whether a patient with new-onset AF should undergo cardioversion immediately or be allowed some time for spontaneous conversion. Patients with marked AF symptoms certainly have no luxury to wait, but what about patients whose symptoms are less dramatic. At two EDs in the Netherlands, investigators randomized 437 adults with hemodynamically stable, symptomatic AF of recent onset to undergo cardioversion either early or after a delay. The primary analysis included 427 patients. About 40% were taking an anticoagulant at enrollment; another 29% started anticoagulation during the index visit.

### Time to cardioversion for acute atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic complications… [^1135AUNG]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Nuotio I, Hartikainen JEK, Grönberg T, Biancari F, Airaksinen KEJ. Time to Cardioversion for Acute Atrial Fibrillation and Thromboembolic Complications. JAMA. 2014; 312: 647–649. doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.3824 In 1995, practice guidelines recommended a limit of 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation for cardioversion without anticoagulation. 1–3 Whether the risk of thromboembolic complications is increased when cardioversion without anticoagulation is performed in less than 48 hours is unknown. In the retrospective Finnish CardioVersion study, 4 all patients with a primary diagnosis of AF, aged 18 years or older, with successful cardioversion in the emergency department within the first 48 hours of AF, and residence in the catchment areas of Turku and Kuopio university hospitals from 2003 to 2010 and Pori central hospital during 2010 were included.

Clinical details and the occurrence of thromboembolic complications within 30 days after cardioversion were retrospectively collected from medical reports. The primary outcome, a thromboembolic event, was defined as a clinical stroke or systemic embolism confirmed by computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, surgery, or autopsy. Time to cardioversion was determined as the difference between the beginning of arrhythmic symptoms to the exact time of cardioversion. If the duration of arrhythmia was uncertain, the cardioversion was excluded. Procedures were divided into groups according to the time to cardioversion: less than 12 hours, 12 hours to less than 24 hours, and 24 hours to less than 48 hours. The protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the National Institute for Health and Welfare, with a waiver of informed consent.

Bivariable comparisons between groups were performed with the χ2 test, the Fisher exact test, or the Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with a repeated-measures model was conducted to evaluate risk factors for thromboembolic complications, including comparisons between groups 2 and 1 and between groups 3 and 1. Clinical features with independent predictive value for thromboembolic complications were used as covariates in the multivariate analysis based on our previous work. 4 Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.
3. Two-sided differences at P <. 05 were considered significant. Of 2481 patients with acute AF, 5116 successful cardioversions were performed without anticoagulation. The mean age was 61. 0 years, 1638 were female, and 2434 had more than 1 risk factor for stroke. Thirty-eight thromboembolic events occurred in 38 patients; 31 were strokes. The incidence of thromboembolic complications increased from 0. 3% in group 1 to

1. 1% in group 3. The incidence of thromboembolic complications according to the time to cardioversion in subgroups is presented in Table
2. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, time to cardioversion longer than 12 hours was an independent predictor for thromboembolic complications. Stroke is the most serious complication of AF. After the recommended 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation, the stroke risk in elective cardioversion of AF ranges from 0. 3% to
0. 8%. 1 In our study, the risk of thromboembolic complications was 0. 7% when cardioversion was performed without anticoagulation within 48 hours of AF onset.

### The duration of anticoagulation after electrical cardioversion… [^114N8Qhe]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend four weeks of anticoagulation after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. Berger and Schweitzer pooled the data from 32 studies to assess the timing of embolic complications following cardioversion and to examine whether four weeks of anticoagulation are warranted after electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Studies were included if they contained at least 10 patients who underwent electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter and if the interval between electrical cardioversion and the occurrence of embolic events was clearly stated. An embolic event occurred after cardioversion in 92 of the 4, 621 patients.

The underlying cardiovascular or systemic disorder that predisposed to atrial fibrillation or flutter included rheumatic heart disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, alcohol abuse, aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse and thyrotoxicosis. Seventeen patients had no underlying heart disease and were classified as having lone atrial fibrillation. The embolic event occurred in three patients who had atrial fibrillation for no longer than two days before cardioversion. The interval between cardioversion and the thromboembolic event ranged from less than one day to 18 days.

Of the 92 events, 75 occurred within three days of cardioversion, 88 within one week and 90 within 10 days of cardioversion. In the two remaining patients, embolic episodes occurred on the 15th day and the 18th day after cardioversion. The authors conclude that since embolic episodes rarely occurred more than 10 days after electrical cardioversion, two weeks of anticoagulant therapy might be sufficient in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter. They also suggest that even shorter periods of anticoagulation might be a consideration in patients at high risk of bleeding complications.

### Cardioversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation… [^114fyyWg]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation include palpitations and poor cardiac performance, with resultant worsening of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and possible sudden death. Patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are usually admitted to the hospital for evaluation of cardiac pathology and to monitor for complications. Anti-arrhythmic therapy may require extended cardiac monitoring because of proarrhythmic complications. Cardioversion is generally safe if patients present within 48 hours of the start of atrial fibrillation. With a longer duration of symptoms, patients should undergo three weeks of anticoagulation therapy before cardioversion is attempted. Recently, the need for hospitalization in low-risk patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation has been questioned. Michael and associates reviewed the postcardioversion management of low-risk patients who presented with symptoms of atrial fibrillation lasting for less than 48 hours.

During the 18-month study period, 168 low-risk patients made 289 visits to the emergency department. Atrial fibrillation was one of the discharge diagnoses in all of the study subjects. The average age of the participants was 64 years. Seventy-two percent had a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Seventy-five percent of the patients who received medication to control heart rate had a rate reduction to less than 120 beats per minute, with diltiazem providing the highest rate of success and adenosine and digoxin being least helpful. Ninety of 180 attempts at chemical cardioversion were successful. Intravenous procainamide was used in 98 percent of these cases. Ninety-nine percent of the patients who had a successful chemical cardioversion were discharged home from the emergency department. Eighty patients underwent electric cardioversion; in most of these patients, chemical cardioversion had failed. Patients who were successfully converted were discharged home.

Ten percent of patients unexpectedly returned to the emergency department within seven days, although none of the patients had complications associated with cardioversion. The authors conclude that, assuming patients presenting with new-onset atrial fibrillation are at low risk, most patients treated in the emergency department with either heart rate control, chemical cardioversion or electric cardioversion do not require hospitalization. Rates of short-term complications appear to be very low, but long-term complications require further study.
