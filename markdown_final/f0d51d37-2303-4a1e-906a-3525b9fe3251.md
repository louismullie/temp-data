## Question

Bicarbonate level in ohs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the bicarbonate level in OHS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what OHS stands for and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the guideline-recommended bicarbonate threshold and how it is used in screening versus diagnosis. Next, I will review the pathophysiology explaining why bicarbonate rises in OHS. After that, I should check the diagnostic performance of bicarbonate at the 27 mmol/L cutoff. Finally, I will consider exceptions, alternative thresholds, and how to integrate bicarbonate with other clinical data to guide testing and management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. OHS stands for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, defined by BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², daytime arterial PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg, and exclusion of other causes of hypercapnia; approximately 90% of patients have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea, and the prevalence is roughly 1 in 160 adults with obesity, so I need to keep that epidemiologic context in mind when interpreting a single bicarbonate value [^116WWKfK].

> Now, I should verify the guideline-recommended bicarbonate threshold. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2019 clinical practice guideline recommends using a serum bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L as a screening threshold in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when the pretest probability of OHS is low to moderate (about ≤ 20%); if bicarbonate is < 27 mmol/L, OHS is very unlikely and clinicians can often avoid arterial blood gas testing, whereas if bicarbonate is ≥ 27 mmol/L, confirmatory ABG should be obtained to document daytime hypercapnia and a sleep study arranged if hypercapnia is confirmed [^115wfRvo] [^111JCJA5] [^113ixi7v].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance at that cutoff so I don't overstate it. Pooled analyses show bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L has sensitivity around 86% and specificity around 77% for OHS, with a very high negative predictive value (about 99%) when pretest probability is ≤ 20%, which supports its use to rule out OHS in low-risk patients. However, the positive predictive value is modest and varies with prevalence, underscoring that an elevated bicarbonate is not diagnostic by itself and requires confirmatory ABG [^115tXu9x].

> Hold on, I should also review the pathophysiology to ensure the threshold makes physiologic sense. Chronic nocturnal hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis, which triggers renal retention of bicarbonate as metabolic compensation. Over time, this compensatory bicarbonate elevation helps defend pH but also blunts ventilatory drive, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates hypercapnia, which is why a modestly elevated bicarbonate can be a marker of chronic ventilatory control dysfunction in obesity-related respiratory failure [^111VUGBZ] [^111VUGBZ].

> But wait, what if the pretest probability is high. I need to ensure I don't apply the screening threshold inappropriately. For patients with high suspicion of OHS (for example, very symptomatic with BMI > 40 kg/m²), the ATS recommends going straight to arterial blood gas to confirm daytime hypercapnia rather than relying on serum bicarbonate, because bicarbonate lacks sufficient specificity in this context and delaying ABG could miss the diagnosis [^111GMg9t] [^113GZf7r] [^114QdVcj].

> I should double-check whether lower bicarbonate thresholds have been proposed for earlier detection of sleep-related hypoventilation. Recent diagnostic accuracy studies suggest that a bicarbonate around 25.9–26.5 mmol/L may better detect nocturnal hypoventilation in obesity and related populations, but sensitivity remains only moderate and a normal bicarbonate does not exclude sleep hypoventilation. Thus, bicarbonate should be interpreted alongside clinical features, oximetry, and, when indicated, nocturnal capnography or polysomnography [^116Kfk43] [^112vGv9D] [^111uwkYo].

> Let me consider practical integration with other tools. In obese patients with suspected OSA, combining clinical screening instruments such as STOP-Bang with bicarbonate modestly improves specificity for moderate-to-severe OSA, but this does not substitute for confirming hypercapnia when OHS is suspected. Ultimately, guideline-concordant care uses bicarbonate to triage who needs ABG, then confirms OHS with PaCO2 and proceeds to PAP therapy and weight-loss strategies, including bariatric surgery when appropriate, to achieve sustained weight loss of 25–30% that can resolve OHS [^113Mv7Nd] [^115wfRvo] [^111xbD2V].

> In summary, I should confirm that the key takeaway is precise: in OHS, a serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L is the ATS-endorsed screening threshold that should prompt confirmatory arterial blood gas testing for daytime hypercapnia when pretest probability is low to moderate, whereas bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L makes OHS very unlikely and can often obviate ABG. However, in high-suspicion patients, proceed directly to ABG, and remember that bicarbonate reflects renal compensation to chronic ventilatory dysfunction rather than serving as a standalone diagnostic test [^115wfRvo] [^111GMg9t] [^115tXu9x].

The bicarbonate level in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is typically **elevated to 27–32 mmol/L** due to renal compensation for chronic hypercapnia [^111GMg9t]. This elevation reflects **metabolic alkalosis** from increased renal bicarbonate reabsorption and is a hallmark of OHS [^111VUGBZ]. A serum bicarbonate **≥ 27 mmol/L** is recommended to screen for OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing, especially when pretest probability is low to moderate [^111GMg9t] [^115tXu9x]. If bicarbonate is ≥ 27 mmol/L, confirmatory arterial blood gases are indicated to document daytime hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg) and exclude other causes of hypercapnia [^111GMg9t] [^111JCJA5].

---

## Pathophysiology of elevated bicarbonate in OHS

OHS arises from **chronic hypoventilation** due to obesity-related respiratory mechanics and impaired ventilatory control, often with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^112RsMiy]. Chronic hypoventilation leads to CO2 retention (hypercapnia), which triggers renal compensation: increased bicarbonate reabsorption and generation to stabilize pH, producing metabolic alkalosis [^114KJ8K4]. Over time, sustained hypercapnia and elevated bicarbonate blunt ventilatory drive, worsening hypoventilation and creating a vicious cycle [^112RsMiy].

---

## Typical bicarbonate levels in OHS

In OHS, serum bicarbonate is typically **27–32 mmol/L**, reflecting renal compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis [^111GMg9t]. This range is higher than the normal adult bicarbonate level of 22–28 mmol/L and is a useful clinical marker of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure [^115tXu9x].

---

## Clinical significance of bicarbonate levels in OHS

Bicarbonate levels are **clinically significant** in OHS because they:

- **Reflect chronic hypercapnia**: Elevated bicarbonate indicates chronic CO2 retention and renal compensation [^114KJ8K4].

- **Guide diagnosis**: Bicarbonate helps identify patients who may have OHS and need further evaluation [^111GMg9t].

- **Inform management**: Bicarbonate trends can monitor response to therapy (e.g. positive airway pressure, weight loss) [^1138aFtL].

---

## Diagnostic utility of bicarbonate in OHS

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) provides **clear guidance** on using bicarbonate to screen for OHS:

- **Screening threshold**: Serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L is recommended to screen for OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing, especially when pretest probability is low to moderate [^111GMg9t] [^115tXu9x].

- **Confirmatory testing**: If bicarbonate is ≥ 27 mmol/L, obtain arterial blood gases to confirm daytime hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg) and exclude other causes [^111GMg9t] [^116WWKfK].

- **High pretest probability**: If suspicion is high (e.g. BMI > 40 kg/m² with symptoms), measure PaCO2 directly rather than relying on bicarbonate alone [^111GMg9t] [^114QdVcj].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While bicarbonate is useful, **limitations remain**:

- **False positives**: Elevated bicarbonate can occur in metabolic alkalosis from other causes (e.g. diuretic use, vomiting) [^116y1Yuf].

- **False negatives**: Early or mild OHS may have normal bicarbonate; clinical suspicion should guide testing [^116Kfk43].

- **Individual variability**: Renal compensation varies, so bicarbonate levels can differ among patients with similar hypercapnia severity [^112RsMiy].

---

## Clinical management implications

Recognizing elevated bicarbonate in OHS has **important management implications**:

- **Positive airway pressure (PAP)**: CPAP or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is first-line therapy to improve ventilation and reduce CO2 retention [^111xbD2V] [^1138aFtL].

- **Weight loss**: Sustained weight loss (25–30% of body weight) is recommended to achieve resolution of OHS [^111xbD2V].

- **Monitoring**: Serial bicarbonate and arterial blood gases can track response to therapy and guide adjustments [^1138aFtL].

## Bicarbonate levels in OHS

| **Bicarbonate level (mmol/L)** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| < 27 | OHS unlikely | - Continue routine care <br/> - Consider other diagnoses if symptomatic |
| 27–32 | Suggests OHS | - Confirm with arterial blood gases <br/> - Initiate PAP therapy if hypercapnia confirmed |
| > 32 | Severe OHS likely | - Urgent arterial blood gases <br/> - Initiate PAP therapy <br/> - Consider intensive weight loss interventions |

---

The bicarbonate level in OHS is typically **27–32 mmol/L**, reflecting renal compensation for chronic hypercapnia. A bicarbonate level ≥ 27 mmol/L is a useful screening marker for OHS, but confirmatory arterial blood gases are required to diagnose OHS definitively [^111GMg9t].

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^116Kfk43]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Bicarbonate above the upper limit of normal is used as an indicator of sleep-related hypoventilation in patients with diseases frequently associated with hypoventilation, such as obesity or neuromuscular diseases.

Research Question

The aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of bicarbonate from daytime arterial blood gas analysis for sleep-related hypoventilation measured via transcutaneous nocturnal capnometry.

Methods

In a diagnostic accuracy study, the sensitivity and specificity of bicarbonate concentration for detecting nocturnal hypoventilation were tested using a receiver operating curve (ROC) and logistic regression analysis in patients undergoing both an in-laboratory sleep study with transcutaneous capnometry and daytime arterial blood gas analysis.

Results

In 510 patients (mean ± SDage 52 ± 15 years, BMI 34 ± 10kg/m 2), the area under the ROC curve for bicarbonate (HCO 3-) and median nocturnal tcpCO 2 ≥ 50mm Hg (45% yes, 55% no) was 0.70 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.75). Sensitivity of HCO 3- of 26.5mmol/L and 27.0mmol/L was 61.0% and 54.1%, specificity 71.3% and 79.6%, and the likelihood ratio for sleep-related hypoventilation (median tcpCO 2 ≥ 50mm Hg) 2.1 and 2.6. HCO 3- was significantly higher in those with (n = 231, 27.6 ± 3.0mmol/L) versus without (n = 279, 25.8 ± 1.9mmol/L) sleep-related hypoventilation (p < 0.001). Increasing awake HCO 3- was associated with a higher likelihood of nocturnal hypoventilation (OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.5), p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The sensitivity of elevated bicarbonate from awake arterial blood gas analysis using common cut-off values such as 27mmol/L is only moderate, and bicarbonate as an integral part of the assessment of sleep hypoventilation (likelihood ratio) must be interpreted in the context of other assessments. A normal bicarbonate does not rule out sleep hypoventilation.

### Targeting germinal matrix hemorrhage-induced overexpression of sodium-coupled bicarbonate exchanger reduces posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus formation in neonatal rats [^1127GF77]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The present study aims to determine whether GMH‐induced or iron trichloride (FeCl 3)–induced iron overload decreases IRP1 and IRP2 expressions and increases NCBE expression for possible roles in CSF production and development of PHH. We hypothesize that iron overload decreases IRP1/IRP2 and increases NCBE expression, while increasing CSF production and PHH. Our results confirm our hypotheses and suggest a noncanonical relationship between decreased IRP1/IRP2 levels and increased NCBE levels. Our findings suggest that combined iron chelation and slc4a10 knockout may be effective in decreasing CSF production and hydrocephalus formation in patients with GMH.

### Value of biomarkers in the prediction of shunt responsivity in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^114H4w1e]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

No single biomarker demonstrated a strong predictive value for shunt responsiveness. Biomarkers alone have poor predictive value for shunt responsiveness. In contrast, clinical factors are stronger predictors, suggesting that patient history and clinical assessment (e.g. the iNPH scale) provide more reliable diagnostic information. Combining biomarkers with clinical factors did not enhance prediction.

### Vascular hyperpermeability as a hallmark of phacomatoses: is the etiology angiogenesis related to or comparable with mechanisms seen in inflammatory pathways? Part II: angiogenesis-and inflammation-related molecular pathways, tumor-associated macrophages, and possible therapeutic implications: a comprehensive review [^113rayJC]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

Phacomatoses are a special group of familial hamartomatous syndromes with unique neurocutaneous manifestations as well as characteristic tumors. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representatives of this family. A vestibular schwannoma (VS) and subependymal giant cell tumor (SGCT) are two of the most common intracranial tumors associated with these syndromes, related to NF2 and TSC, respectively. These tumors can present with an obstructive hydrocephalus due to their location adjacent to or in the ventricles. Remarkably, both tumors are also known to have a unique association with elevated protein concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sometimes in association with a non-obstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus. Of the two, SGCT has been shown to be associated with a predisposition to CSF clotting, causing a debilitating recurrent shunt obstruction. However, the exact relationship between high protein levels and clotting of CSF remains unclear, nor do we understand the precise mechanism of CSF clotting observed in SGCT. Elevated protein levels in the CSF are thought to be caused by increased vascular permeability and dysregulation of the blood-brain barrier. The two presumed underlying pathophysiological processes for that in the context of tumorigenesis are angiogenesis and inflammation. Both these processes are correlated to the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway which is tumorigenesis related in many neoplasms and nearly all phacomatoses. In this review, we discuss the influence of angiogenesis and inflammation pathways on vascular permeability in VSs and SGCTs at the phenotypic level as well as their possible genetic and molecular determinants. Part I described the historical perspectives and clinical aspects of the relationship between vascular permeability, abnormal CSF protein levels, clotting of the CSF, and communicating hydrocephalus. Part II hereafter describes the different cellular and molecular pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation observed in both tumors and explores the existing metabolic overlap between inflammation and coagulation. Interestingly, while increased angiogenesis can be observed in both tumors, inflammatory processes seem significantly more prominent in SGCT. Both SGCT and VS are characterized by different subgroups of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs): the pro-inflammatory M1 type is predominating in SGCTs, while the pro-angiogenetic M2 type is predominating in VSs. We suggest that a lack of NF2 protein in VS and a lack of TSC1/TSC2 proteins in SGCT significantly influence this fundamental difference between the two tumor types by changing the dominant TAM type. Since inflammatory reactions and coagulation processes are tightly connected, the pro-inflammatory state of SGCT may also explain the associated tendency for CSF clotting. The underlying cellular and molecular differences observed can potentially serve as an access point for direct therapeutic interventions for tumors that are specific to certain phacomatoses or others that also carry such genetic changes.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113QabwN]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — key knowledge gaps for identifying patients at highest risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications are framed as questions, including: "Can we risk stratify patients for perioperative complications related to OSA or OHS?", whether "there any safe threshold of opioid therapy in patients identified as high risk of having OSA or OHS", which "clinical or physiologic markers (serum bicarbonate, troponin levels, preoperative inflammatory markers, etc.)" predict opioid sensitivity or complications, whether "particular physiologic endotypes of OSA" predict these risks, whether "assessments in postanesthesia care unit (PACU) provide additional value in reducing adverse outcomes upon discharge", and whether "polysomnography (PSG) or ambulatory studies" help "to predict which patients may be at increased risk after surgery and help to direct management".

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^112HcoT4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111zE1HP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, more specifically with respect to blood gas analysis, ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having OHS. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of OHS. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of OHS is very unlikely in these patients.

### Sodium bicarbonate for control of ICP: a systematic review [^116DfEXv]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate for intracranial pressure (ICP) reduction in patients with neurologic illness.

Methods

Data sources: articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to April 2015), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers independently extracted data including population characteristics and treatment characteristics. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education methodology.

Results

Our search strategy produced a total 559 citations. Three original articles were included in the review. There were 2 prospective studies, 1 randomized control trial and 1 single arm, and 1 retrospective case report. Across all studies there were a total of 19 patients studied, with 31 episodes of elevated ICP being treated. Twenty-one of those episodes were treated with sodium bicarbonate infusion, with the remaining 10 treated with hypertonic saline in a control model. All elevated ICP episodes treated with sodium bicarbonate solution demonstrated a significant drop in ICP, without an elevation of serum partial pressure of carbon dioxide. No significant complications were described.

Conclusions

There currently exists Oxford level 4, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education D evidence to support an ICP reduction effect with intravenous sodium bicarbonate in TBI. No comments on its impact in other neuropathologic states, or on patient outcomes, can be made at this time.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^116f3UJa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies suggest a potential role for bicarbonate therapy in the recovery phase of DKA. After volume resuscitation, bicarbonate is regenerated, but may be offset by development of hyperchloremia, as ketoacids are preferentially excreted over chloride anions. In addition, patients with persistent kidney injury and reduced production of renal bicarbonate may theoretically benefit from bicarbonate administration to correct this relative bicarbonate deficiency. Two adult RCTs found quicker reversal of acidosis with bicarbonate therapy at 2 h, but this benefit was not sustained beyond 2 h. There were no significant differences in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, tissue oxygenation, or cerebrospinal fluid acidosis, but increased rates of hypokalemia. Finally, two studies found paradoxical worsening of ketonemia with bicarbonate therapy, theorized to be due to augmented hepatic ketogenesis.

Recommendation

Sodium bicarbonate therapy in the initial resuscitation or recovery phase of DKA is not recommended and may cause harm in pediatric patients, although data in patients with severe acidosis (pH < 7.0) and hyperkalemia are lacking (Level of evidence: B).

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^112nqP6w]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Apnea testing — pre-test PaCO2 and pH targets and chronic hypercarbia handling (Recommendation Statements 24a–24c). Clinicians must ensure that patients have normal PaCO2 (35–45 mm Hg) and pH (7.35–7.45) levels before apnea testing, provided the patient is not known to be hypercarbic at baseline (Level A). If a patient is known to have chronic hypercarbia, and the patient's chronic baseline level is known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's chronic baseline level (Level B). If a patient is known or suspected to have chronic hypercarbia but the patient's chronic baseline PaCO2 level is not known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's estimated chronic baseline. However, in this circumstance, if apnea is present, clinicians should perform ancillary testing in addition (Level A).

+) and bicarbonate ions. Sodium is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion it may be converted to carbonic acid and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide excreted by the lung. In contrast, the conventional expression of exposure, i.e., ppm X min, fails to take volume inhaled and body weight into account. Five dogs received no intervention and served as controls. Fourteen dogs received basic therapy of oral cortisone and NaHCO3 plus 100% O2 for 30 min after the exposure period. Because of the untoward response, expiratory resistance was discontinued and not used in other experiments. PGE2-hi, iv for 90 min. PGE1-lo, iv for 90 min. At the end of the study, all lungs were excised, examined and prepared for light microscopy. We found that EI, which varied among subjects because of spontaneous variations of VI during exposure, correlated significantly with the changes in base deficit induced by phosgene inhalation. We also found that the change in minute ventilation, delta VI X kg-1, correlated significantly with changes in lung compliance, peak flow and base deficit. Evaluation of the various therapeutic modalities revealed the following: Immediate therapy with O2 is vital and FiO2 of 0. 4 to
0. 5 is sufficient.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^115uKjaC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

### Chronic meningitis presenting with acute obstructive hydrocephalus [^113aLtq9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 24-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department unresponsive with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4 and evidence of brainstem herniation. She was intubated and hyperventilated. Computed axial tomography scan of the brain demonstrated four-chamber hydrocephalus. Continued hyperventilation and mannitol diuresis were sufficient to arrest the impending herniation while emergent ventriculostomy was arranged. The patient recovered without sequelae and ultimately received a diagnosis of chronic idiopathic meningitis. This case highlights a rarely diagnosed disorder that presented with an acutely life threatening condition.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — cerebrospinal outflow resistance (R0) and shunt response: In patients with suspected iNPH, those with elevated R0 are probably more likely to respond to shunting than those without elevated R0 (1 Class I study and multiple consistent Class II studies), but lower R0 does not preclude shunt responsiveness.

### British thoracic society guideline for diagnosing and monitoring paediatric sleep-disordered breathing [^111SS8a9]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (CO2 monitoring), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain a blood gas measurement for confirmation if CO2 measurements are inconsistent with the clinical picture. Recalibrate the transcutaneous CO2 monitor, and consider checking and changing the sensor head membrane if the problem is not resolved.

### Pseudohypobicarbonataemia [^117CpYhf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) is obtained to assess acid-base disturbances, measure arterial oxygen (PO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2). ABG uses blood gas analysers, which have electrochemical sensors, to calculate plasma bicarbonate (HCO3), from the pH, PCO2 and PO2. Bicarbonate levels can also be measured on routine electrolyte studies such as the basic metabolic panel (BMP) or comprehensive metabolic panel. These methods typically use enzymatic/electrode methods to calculate bicarbonate levels. Generally, there is an acceptable correlation between the bicarbonate measurement from blood gas and from metabolic panel. Rarely, there is a discrepancy. The following is a case of pseudohypobicarbonataemia, where BMP consistently showed hypobicarbonataemia and ABG revealed normal levels.

Shunt component selection — an updated review yielded 71 new studies, with 20 selected for full text and 13 excluded; studies reported that valve type had no impact on shunt survival and did not influence risk of shunt failure, and therefore there is no new evidence to support a change in the original guidance recommendations.

### Independent associations between arterial bicarbonate, apnea severity and hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea [^111BiZFv]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large cross sectional study of a predominantly male clinical sleep apnea cohort, we established an independent association between wake arterial StHCO 3 - concentration and the intensity of sleep apnea. In addition, there was an independent association between StHCO 3 - and hypertension as well as daytime office DBP. Our data suggest that mechanisms related to acid-base balance may link to the expression of OSA and its cardiovascular sequels. Given the strong inter-correlation between StHCO 3 - and CA activity we speculate that CA activity is involved in blood pressure regulation in OSA patients.

Elevated StHCO 3 - concentration has been used as marker for hypercapnia in patients with respiratory disorders such as obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and pre-clinical OHS. The association between StHCO 3 - and OSA is less well studied. In this study we excluded patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and OHS based on information of a gold- standard evaluation of respiratory function and a blood gas analysis. Our data unequivocally demonstrated a dose dependent association between OSA and daytime arterial StHCO 3 - concentration in this group of patients without a chronic respiratory disorder. Although the magnitude of the StHCO 3 - elevation across the spectrum of OSA severity may be considered as rather limited, the association was statistically significant and remained after extensive control of important confounders. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate this association in a well characterized clinical OSA cohort. The exact mechanism behind this finding in OSA remains unknown. Severe OSA may lead to mild nocturnal hypercapnia. The long term effect of OSA on PCO 2 (i.e. StHCO3 -) is determined by the net change of CO 2 over each cycle of apnea/hyperventilation and asymmetry in how the rise and fall of CO 2 affects the kidney. It is likely that changes of CA activity can modulate the transition of obstructive apnea/ventilation cycle and influence the increase in StHCO3 -. We therefore propose that transient hypercapnic episodes during sleep in patients with more severe OSA lead to increased renal reabsorption of StHCO 3 - and/or that a chronic increase of StHCO 3 - production is induced by high or possibly even up-regulated CA activity.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111dJYTF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with hypoventilation syndrome (evaluation), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is very unlikely in these patients.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) — efficacy of ventricular shunting: The 3 identified studies with higher than Class IV evidence were consistent with a benefit of ventricular shunting for iNPH, but there is a decrease of response after 6 months, and fewer than half of patients were considered to be improved in all presenting iNPH symptoms after 18 months. Although the vast majority of other published studies has reported clinical improvement of iNPH after ventricular shunting, none to date has been designed to provide high-level evidence of efficacy, and the use of ventricular shunting for iNPH is based largely on uncontrolled observational studies of clinical response.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^115noTQg]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus — predictors and testing: Predictors of success included elevated R0, impaired cerebral blood flow reactivity to acetazolamide (by SPECT), and positive response to either external lumbar drainage or repeated lumbar punctures. Age may not be a prognostic factor, and data are insufficient to judge efficacy of radionuclide cisternography or aqueductal flow measurement by MRI. Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated R0 and their families that they have an increased chance of response to shunting (Level B).

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111xbD2V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The purpose of this guideline is to optimize evaluation and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified and prioritized five clinical questions. The panel performed systematic reviews of available studies (up to July 2018) and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations. All panel members discussed and approved the recommendations. Recommendations: After considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that: 1) clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS, 2) stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP), 3) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea, 4) patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo), and 5) patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery). Conclusions: Clinicians may use these recommendations, on the basis of the best available evidence, to guide management and improve outcomes among patients with OHS.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115wfRvo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline on obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — after considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS. We suggest that stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP). We suggest that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea. We suggest that patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo). We suggest that patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery).

### Population pharmacodynamic model of bicarbonate response to acetazolamide in mechanically ventilated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^1174vD8A]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

### Effect of arterial blood bicarbonate (HCO) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-bang questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea [^113fpobM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Analytical methods

All patients received PSG monitoring, blood gas analysis, and completed the ESS, SBQ, and Berlin questionnaires. According to AHI and symptoms, the patients were divided into the non-OSA group or the OSA group, and the latter group was further divided into mild (5 times/h ≤ AHI ≤ 15 times/h), moderate (15 times/h < AHI ≤ 30 times/h), and severe (AHI > 30 times/h). Patients were divided into two groups according to the SBQ: the high-risk OSA group (STOP-Bang questionnaire score ≥ 3 points) and low-risk OSA group (STOP-Bang questionnaire score < 3 points). Patients were divided into two groups according to ESS: ESS ≥ 9 was classified as high-risk for OSA, and ESS < 9 was classified as low-risk for OSA. According to the Berlin questionnaire, the patients were divided into two groups: positive for the high-risk OSA group and negative for the low-risk OSA group. A correlation analysis between HCO 3 − concentration and AHI, LSAO2, MSAO2, CT90%, AHT%, MAD, and HAD was carried out to judge the correlation degree, and the diagnostic value of HCO 3 − concentration on OSA was analyzed and evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the three kinds of questionnaires for screening OSA were compared. Then, the diagnostic value of the STOP-Bang questionnaire score alone and SBQ combined with the HCO 3 − concentration for OSA was further compared.

Statistical methods

SPSS19.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. Patient information was analyzed by descriptive statistics. The normal distribution data is represented by ± s, and the non-normal distribution data is represented by the median (M) and the interquartile range (P75–P25). Correlation analysis was conducted between the HCO 3 − concentration and AHI, CT90%, AHT%, MAD, and HAD, and the correlation coefficients were calculated. Then, calculation was done for the degree of sensitivity, specific diagnostic test evaluation of the four tables, and sensitivity to the specific degrees of comparison between different methods using the matching χ2 test (with P < 0.05 for the difference being statistically significant). The optimal truncation value of the HCO 3 − concentration for the diagnosis of OSA was analyzed by Youden index. A ROC curve was used to compare the scores of SBQ alone and the diagnostic value of SBQ combined with HCO 3 − concentration for OSA.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115JV683]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^114ZFUvR]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^1138aFtL]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study is the only randomised clinical trial to date comparing two alternative treatment strategies in patients with OHS who do not have concomitant severe OSA. The main results can be summarised as follows: (1) PaCO 2 and serum bicarbonate improved significantly more in the NIV group than in the control group (ie, lifestyle changes); (2) the improvement in PaCO 2 with NIV treatment was partially independent of NIV compliance, although overall compliance with NIV was high in our cohort (mean 6 hours/night); and (3) AHI and nocturnal oxygenation improved significantly with NIV treatment relative to the control group. Our study is clinically relevant because the few randomised clinical trials performed to date in patients with OHS have focused on the phenotype that has concomitant severe OSA. Our randomised clinical trial has provided clear evidence that NIV is superior to lifestyle changes in this phenotype of patients with OHS and severe OSA. Our present findings are in line with three prior small clinical series of patients with OHS without severe OSA treated with NIV. Moreover, the degree of improvement in daytime PaCO 2 observed in our study was similar to prior studies that enrolled mostly patients with OHS and concomitant severe OSA, including our recently reported largest clinical trial of OHS patients with severe OSA.

### Use of acetazolamide to decrease cerebrospinal fluid production in chronically ventilated patients with ventriculopleural shunts [^1112vaST]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Acetazolamide (ACTZ), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been shown to decrease cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production in both in vivo and in vitro animal models. We report two children with hydrocephalus who experienced multiple shunt failures, and who had externalised ventriculostomy drains (EVD) prior to ventriculopleural shunt placement. The effects of increasing doses of ACTZ on CSF production and subsequent tolerance to ventriculopleural shunts were evaluated. The patients had a 48% and a 39% decrease in their EVD CSF output when compared to baseline with maximum ACTZ dose of 75 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively (p < 0.05). This is the first report of change in CSF volume in children after extended treatment with ACTZ. ACTZ treatment in mechanically ventilated paediatric patients with hydrocephalus may improve tolerance of ventriculopleural shunts and minimise respiratory compromise. Potassium and bicarbonate supplements are required to correct metabolic disturbances.

### Is serum bicarbonate level associated with negative outcomes in pediatric patients? a retrospective cohort study [^1115JPxp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Early identification of children at risk for adverse outcomes is important. Serum bicarbonate is easily collected and widely available. We described the relationship between bicarbonate and adverse outcomes in children presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 17 years from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011, who had a serum bicarbonate measured in the ED. Primary outcome was the predictive ability of bicarbonate for the individual components of the composite outcome that included at least one of the following: intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, inotropic support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or death. Secondary outcome was the relationship between bicarbonate level of greater and less than 13 mEq/L and the composite outcome.

Results

We reviewed 16,989 charts, of which 432 had an adverse outcome. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that a bicarbonate level of less than 18.5 mEq/L predicted inotropic support with an area under the curve of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.77; P < 0.001) and death with an area under the curve of 0.75 (CI, 0.66–0.85; P < 0.001). Significantly more patients with bicarbonate level of less than 13 mEq/L had at least 1 adverse outcome compared with those with bicarbonate level of greater than 13 mEq/L (4.4% vs 2.5%, P = 0.001), odds ratio 1.96 (95% CI, 1.3–2.97).

Conclusions

Among children presenting to the ED, bicarbonate level of 18.5 mEq/L had fair specificity in predicting inotropic support and death. Negative outcomes are significantly associated with bicarbonate level of less than 13 mEq/L. Bicarbonate should routinely be measured in children at risk of clinical deterioration.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111GMg9t]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome — American Thoracic Society diagnostic recommendation: The panel suggests that clinicians should measure PaCO2 in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are strongly suspected of having OHS, and it suggests using a serum bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with low to moderate probability of OHS (e.g. BMI 30–40 kg/m2). In this group, a bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L precludes the need for an arterial blood gas, whereas a bicarbonate level ≥ 27 mmol/L should trigger clinicians to measure PaCO2 as a confirmatory diagnostic test, especially when the pretest probability of OHS is 10 to 20% (generally a BMI > 35 kg/m2). A formal statement specifies, "we suggest measuring Paco2, rather than using serum bicarbonate or Spo2, to diagnose" in those strongly suspected.

### Population pharmacodynamic model of bicarbonate response to acetazolamide in mechanically ventilated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^111cHpur]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

ACET dosing in COPD patients

Using this pharmacodynamic model, we assessed the effect of ACET administered once daily on serum HCO 3 - levels under various conditions of serum chloride level and coprescription of furosemide or glucocorticoids (Figures 3A, B and 3C). According to our model, a higher ACET dosage is required to reduce serum HCO 3 - concentration > 5 mmol/L in the presence of high levels of serum chloride or coprescription of systemic corticosteroids or furosemide.

Figure 3
Model-predicted effect of 125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg or 1, 000 mg of acetazolamide. Shown are the effects of acetazolamide (ACET) administered once daily on serum bicarbonate in the presence of (A) low or high levels of serum chloride, (B) coprescription or not of 20 to 160 mg/day furosemide or (C) coprescription or no coprescription of 1 mg/kg/day systemic cortocosteroids. Modelization of ACET pharmacodynamics was derived from 68 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients during the weaning period with metabolic alkalosis (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at ICU admission was standardized at 50 and is shown in all parts of the figure). A higher ACET dosage is required to reduce serum bicarbonate concentrations > 5 mmol/L when high chloride or coprescription of systemic corticosteroids or furosemide occurs.

### Sodium bicarbonate lowers intracranial pressure after traumatic brain injury [^115jzwUi]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertonic saline is routinely used to treat rises in intracranial pressure (ICP) post-traumatic head injury. Repeated doses often cause a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. We investigated the efficacy of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate as an alternative method of lowering ICP without generating a metabolic acidosis.

Methods

We prospectively studied 10 episodes of unprovoked ICP rise in 7 patients treated with 85 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in place of our usual 100 mL 5% saline. We measured ICP and mean arterial pressure continuously for 6 h after infusion. Serum pH, pCO(2), [Na(+)], and [Cl(-)] were measured at baseline, 30 min, 60 min and then hourly for 6 h.

Results

At the completion of the infusion (t = 30 min), the mean ICP fell from 28.5 mmHg (± 2.62) to 10.33 mmHg (± 1.89), P < 0.01. Mean ICP remained below 20 mmHg at all time points for 6 h. Mean arterial pressure was unchanged leading to an increased cerebral perfusion pressure at all time points for 6 h post-infusion. pH was elevated from 7.45 ± 0.05 at baseline to 7.50 ± 0.05, P < 0.01 at t = 30 min, and remained elevated. Serum [Na(+)] increased from 145.4 ± 6.02 to 147.1 ± 6.3 mmol/l, P < 0.01 at t = 30 min. pCO(2) did not change.

Conclusions

A single dose of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate is effective at treating rises in ICP for at least 6 h. Serum sodium was raised but without generation of a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Effect of arterial blood bicarbonate (HCO) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-bang questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea [^113Xu6RS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the effect of arterial bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Methods

A total of 144 patients with suspected OSA were included. Polysomnograms (PSG) and blood gas analysis were performed, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), STOP-Bang questionnaire, and Berlin questionnaire were completed. The correlation between the arterial HCO 3 - concentration, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), and other related indicators was analyzed. The scoring results of the ESS, SBQ, and Berlin questionnaire were compared with the PSG results, and the sensitivity and specificity were calculated in the form of a four-cell table. The changes in the sensitivity and specificity of OSA screening after SBQ alone and combined with HCO 3 - concentration were compared, and ROC curves were drawn.

Results

Arterial HCO 3 - concentration was positively correlated with AHI (r = 0.537, P < 0.001). The ratio of HCO 3 - concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L in the non-OSA group was significantly lower than that in the OSA group (25.0% VS 80.8%, P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the SBQ was higher than that of the ESS (97.5% VS 81.7%, P < 0.001) and the Berlin questionnaire (97.5% VS 79.2%, P < 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the specificity of the three scales (25%, 37.5%, 37.5%). A combined SBQ score ≥ 3 and HCO 3 - concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L showed increased specificity and decreased sensitivity compared with an SBQ score ≥ 3 alone, with a corresponding AUC of 0.771 (P < 0.01) and 0.613 (P > 0.05), respectively.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of the SBQ was better than that of the Berlin questionnaire and ESS. After combining arterial blood HCO 3 - concentration, the SBQ questionnaire increased the specificity of OSA prediction and decreased the sensitivity, which improved the accuracy of screening.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and postsurgical outcomes in a bariatric surgery cohort [^116kEStB]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with OHS tend to have a poor prognosis, as shown in multiple epidemiological studies. Such patients may be at risk of postoperative respiratory failure due to concerns about extubating patients with hypercapnia. In addition, exercise tolerance may be impaired in OHS, perhaps as a function of underlying pulmonary hypertension. As a result, diet and exercise may not be as feasible in OHS patients compared to individuals without OHS perhaps effecting postoperative weight loss. Clinical experience by our obesity medicine and bariatric surgery teams indeed suggested that weight loss was attenuated. The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea was a risk factor for perioperative complications of bariatric surgery, but the impact of OHS was not evaluated to our knowledge.

Based on this conceptual framework, we sought to test the hypothesis that elevated bicarbonate (as a possible surrogate for obesity hypoventilation syndrome) was a marker of a poor prognosis for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We examined both in-hospital complications based on length of stay and longer-term outcomes based on net weight loss at 1 year. We used a cohort that we have developed for this purpose and with which we have previously assessed preoperative questionnaires for sleep apnea. Contemporary data are imperative to draw meaningful conclusions since patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the modern era have lower body mass indices and fewer comorbidities than prior years, in part due to emphasis on prevention rather than treatment of obesity-related complications.

### Intracranial pressure and ventricular expansion in hydrocephalus: have we been asking the wrong question? [^1175pfUM]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

The force that enlarges the cerebral ventricles and deforms the brain in hydrocephalus remains unclear. It is still widely thought to be elevated intraventricular pressure developing behind an obstruction to the flow of CSF. This view has led to the prediction that a large pressure difference should exist between the ventricles proximal to the obstruction and the subarachnoid space of the cerebral convexity distal to the obstruction. Yet measurements have shown consistently that such transmantle pressure differences are either small or absent. We propose a theory that reconciles the view that hydrocephalus is caused by obstruction to the flow of CSF with the observed absence of large pressure gradients across the cerebral mantle. Obstruction to CSF flow produces only a small pressure gradient — usually less than 1 mm Hg — that is sufficient to overcome the added resistance to flow and thereby to balance the absorption of CSF with its production. This mini-gradient is the effective force that initiates and sustains ventricular enlargement. It can coexist either with high or with normal intracranial pressure. The level of intracranial pressure is determined by the efficiency with which increments of ventricular pressure are transmitted through the parenchyma to the outer surface of the brain. In the presence of a rigid skull some transmission is required by basic laws of Newtonian mechanics. The efficiency of transmission depends primarily on the elastic properties of the brain. If the brain is relatively incompressible, transmission is efficient and high intracranial pressure is required to maintain the mini-gradient between the ventricles and the subarachnoid space, resulting in tension hydrocephalus. If the brain is more compressible, the parenchyma attenuates any increase of intraventricular pressure, reducing transmission to the outer surface. Intracranial pressure need not rise above normal levels to maintain the mini-gradient, leading to normal pressure hydrocephalus. The theory explains why tests measuring CSF resistance have limited diagnostic usefulness in hydrocephalus. It also predicts that very small stresses are sufficient to produce large deformations of the brain if these are allowed to occur slowly.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114wNWKK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential Harm from Bicarbonate Administration

Although it may seem intuitive to treat all metabolic acidoses with bicarbonate supplementation, there are several ways that sodium bicarbonate administration can potentially cause harm. Excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate has been associated with decreased availability of oxygen at the tissue level due to a leftward shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Although rare, aggressive bicarbonate therapy may result in alkalemia, causing increased binding of calcium to albumin, leading to a drop in ionized calcium levels and subsequent depressed cardiac contractility and hypotension. In addition, due to the hyperosmolar nature of the solution sodium load associated with these preparations, patients may experience fluid shifts, notably pulmonary and cerebral edema. It is also important to note that the use of sodium bicarbonate relies on the ability of the patient to have effective ventilation. The bicarbonate anion combines with hydrogen ions to ultimately form CO 2. If minute ventilation is restricted, preventing adequate exhalation of CO 2, excessive administration of sodium bicarbonate may inadvertently cause hypercarbia and paradoxically lower the pH. Peripheral vein thrombophlebitis is another potential cause of iatrogenic complications from rapid administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, particularly in situations with faulty peripheral intravenous catheters, although recent data suggest that lower concentrations may not cause localized injury.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^114KJ8K4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### What we should know about the cellular and tissue response causing catheter obstruction in the treatment of hydrocephalus [^111t9fC1]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of hydrocephalus by cerebrospinal fluid shunting is plagued by ventricular catheter obstruction. Shunts can become obstructed by cells originating from tissue normal to the brain or by pathological cells in the cerebrospinal fluid for a variety of reasons. In this review, the authors examine ventricular catheter obstruction and identify some of the modifications to the ventricular catheter that may alter the mechanical and chemical cues involved in obstruction, including alterations to the surgical strategy, modifications to the chemical surface of the catheter, and changes to the catheter architecture. It is likely a combination of catheter modifications that will improve the treatment of hydrocephalus by prolonging the life of ventricular catheters to improve patient outcome.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113ixi7v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) outpatient evaluation — Ambulatory stable obese patient with suspected OHS: in the outpatient setting, the panel recommends performing a measurement of arterial blood gases (ABG) to confirm daytime hypercapnia for patients with high pretest probability of OHS (for example, very symptomatic patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2) and assessing serum bicarbonate for moderate or low pretest probability (for example, a BMI of 30–40 kg/m2). When the bicarbonate level is ≥ 27 mmol/l, the panel recommends a confirmatory ABG and a sleep study; if the serum bicarbonate level is < 27 mmol/L, OHS is highly unlikely, after which sleep study/PAP titration follows when hypercapnia is confirmed.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) recommendations — Clinicians may choose to offer shunting as a treatment for patients with iNPH in order to treat their subjective symptoms of iNPH and gait (Level C). Because there is a risk of significant AEs, the risks and benefits of the procedure should be carefully weighed (Level B). Clinicians should inform patients with iNPH with elevated R o that they have an increased chance of responding to shunting compared with those without such elevation (Level B). Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH that an abnormal CSF-IT or a positive response to repeated TTs increases the chance of response to shunting (Level C). Clinicians may counsel patients with iNPH and their families that increasing age does not necessarily decrease the chance of a shunt being successful (Level C). Clinicians may counsel patients with suspected iNPH and with impaired CBF reactivity to acetazolamide, measured by SPECT, that they are probably more likely to respond to shunting (Level C).

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111JCJA5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — screening in obese adults with sleep-disordered breathing: For high pretest probability, we suggest measuring PaCO2 rather than serum bicarbonate or SpO2 to diagnose OHS (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). For low to moderate probability (< 20%), we suggest using serum bicarbonate to decide when to measure PaCO2: in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L, clinicians might forego PaCO2 measurement, whereas in those with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L, clinicians might need to measure PaCO2 to confirm or rule out OHS (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence). Using a 27-mmol/L threshold in obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L accounted for 64–74% and ≥ 27 mmol/L for 26–36% of obese patients with OSA. We suggest that clinicians avoid using SpO2 during wakefulness to decide when to measure PaCO2 until more data become available (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence).

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^112vGv9D]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy of a bicarbonate cut-off of 27 mmol/L for sleep hypoventilation in obesity and in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)

The sensitivity to detect a median nocturnal tcpCO 2 > 50 mm Hg and AASM sleep hypoventilation with a bicarbonate of ≥ 27.0 mmol/L in obesity (n = 313) was 50.0% and 42.9%, respectively. The positive (and negative) likelihood ratio for a median nocturnal tcpCO 2 > 50 mmHg and AASM sleep hypoventilation was 3.1 and 3.7 (0.6 and 0.6), respectively. This was comparable for the obese subgroup without OSA. The best estimated HCO 3- cut-point for AASM sleep hypoventilation in the obese was 25.9 mmol/L (compared with 27.3 mmol/L in the non-obese). The sensitivity of bicarbonate of ≥ 27.0 mmol/L in obesity for daytime hypoventilation (p a CO2 ≥ 6 kPa, OHS) was 78.3%.

In patients with OSA defined by an AHI ≥ 10 /h (n = 258, 73% obese), the sensitivity of a bicarbonate of ≥ 27.0 mmol/L for a median nocturnal tcpCO 2 > 50 mm Hg and AASM sleep hypoventilation was 54.3% and 43.3%. These numbers were similar in moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥ 15 /h) and in severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 /h).

Diagnostic accuracy of a bicarbonate cut-off of 27 mmol/L for sleep hypoventilation in neuromuscular disease (NMD)

In the NMD group, the sensitivity of bicarbonate ≥ 27.0 mmol/L for a median nocturnal tcpCO 2 > 50 mm Hg and AASM sleep hypoventilation was 63.8% and 57.3%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratio at this bicarbonate cut-off for a median nocturnal tcpCO 2 > 50 mm Hg were 2.1 and 0.5 and for AASM sleep hypoventilation 2.0 and 0.6.

Use of bicarbonate in obesity to screen for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and sleep hypoventilation

In a study of obese individuals with OSA and a high prevalence of hypercapnia during the day (OHS with severe OSA in 20%), the AUC of bicarbonate for detecting OHS (not sleep hypoventilation) was 0.85, and a bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L had a sensitivity for detecting OHS of 92%. In another study, the sensitivity of serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L for OHS was 76.6% (AUC 0.77). Two other studies used arterial or arterialised capillary standard bicarbonate of ≥ or > 27 mmol/L and found a sensitivity for OHS with daytime hypercapnia of 88% and 86%, respectively. However, in these studies, the serum bicarbonate cut-off was used to screen for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (to decide in whom a more invasive arterial puncture should be performed to confirm the diagnosis) and not for the earlier stage of sleep hypoventilation. Whether an elevated BE value from arterial blood gas analysis in the absence of hypercapnia is part of the spectrum of obesity-related respiratory failure (precursor to OHS) was tested in a sample of obese individuals who were categorised into three groups: normal BE level (< 2 mmol/L) and paCO 2 (≤ 6 kPa), elevated BE level (≥ 2 mmol/L) and normal paCO 2, and elevated BE level and elevated paCO 2 (> 6 kPa). The authors found that the ventilatory response (low hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory response) in those without hypercapnia but with elevated BE was closer to OHS than to obese with normal BE, and they concluded that this group of patients represents 'early OHS', a group of eucapnic obese with reduced ventilatory response. This group was later classified as stage II hypoventilation in obesity in an ERS task force statement.

### Simple, easily memorised "rules of thumb" for the rapid assessment of physiological compensation for respiratory acid-base disorders [^1117gApU]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter" for home oxygen, metabolic acidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, tuberous sclerosis complex, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Fournier's gangrene, colonic volvulus, foreign body ingestion, botulism, status epilepticus, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetic ketoacidosis, near-drowning, inhalation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiac arrest, sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, influenza virus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, COVID-19 infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia and blood gas analysis.

The Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Interpreter analyzes arterial blood gas results, including pH, PaCO₂, and HCO₃⁻, to assess acid-base status, oxygenation, and ventilation. It aids in diagnosing respiratory, metabolic, and mixed acid-base disorders, guiding clinical management in acute and chronic conditions.

The Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter analyzes three key parameters: arterial pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) levels to assess acid-base balance in the body. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parameters**
- **Arterial pH**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. A normal range is between 7.35 and 7.45.
- **PaCO₂**: The pressure exerted by carbon dioxide in the blood, typically between 35–45 mmHg. If measured in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.5.
- **HCO₃⁻**: The concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, with a normal level around 24 mmol/L.

2. **Determine Acid-Base Status**
- If pH is normal (7.35–7.45), the status is "Normal".
- If pH is less than 7.35, "Acidosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ > 45, it suggests "Respiratory Acidosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≤ 45, it suggests "Metabolic Acidosis".
- If pH is greater than 7.45, "Alkalosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ < 35, it suggests "Respiratory Alkalosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≥ 35, it suggests "Metabolic Alkalosis".

3. **Calculate Expected Values for Compensation**
- For "Respiratory Acidosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 + (PaCO₂ - 40) / 10.
- For "Respiratory Alkalosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 - (40 - PaCO₂) / 5.
- For "Metabolic Acidosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 - (24 - HCO₃⁻) × 1.2.
- For "Metabolic Alkalosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 + (HCO₃⁻ - 24) × 0.7.

4. **Determine Compensation Level**
- "Uncompensated" indicates no significant correctional changes.
- "Partially Compensated" is considered if deviation from expected values is moderate (≤ 5 units).
- "Fully Compensated" is concluded with minimal deviation (≤ 2 units) from expected values.

5. **Interpretation and Breakdown**
- The analysis concludes with indicating if there's an acidosis or alkalosis, its type, and compensation level.
- Interpretation provides insights, suggesting chronic conditions if compensation is partial or full.
- A breakdown of calculations includes expected vs. actual values for HCO₃⁻ and PaCO₂.

This interpretation aids healthcare providers in understanding whether the body's compensatory mechanisms are effectively mitigating the imbalance, helping diagnose underlying conditions like respiratory or metabolic dysfunctions.

### Evaluation and treatment of respiratory alkalosis [^111gRCV3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is the most frequent acid-base disturbance encountered in clinical practice. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, for whom the degree of hypocapnia directly correlates with adverse outcomes. Although this acid-base disturbance often is considered benign, evidence suggests that the alkalemia of primary hypocapnia can cause clinically significant decreases in tissue oxygen delivery. Mild respiratory alkalosis often serves as a marker of an underlying disease and may not require therapeutic intervention. In contrast, severe respiratory alkalosis should be approached with a sense of urgency and be aggressively corrected.

### Cotransporter-mediated water transport underlying cerebrospinal fluid formation [^114go6iE]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In support of the proposed importance of NKCC1 in CSF production, a recent report convincingly demonstrated hyperactivation of NKCC1 by inflammatory markers in the CSF in an animal model of intraventricular hemorrhage. This condition is well-known to promote posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in patients, and the increased NKCC1 activity in the animal model yielded bumetanide-sensitive ventriculomegaly. NKCC1, via its direct contribution to brain water accumulation, thus represents a promising pharmacological target in brain pathologies involving disturbed water dynamics and increased intracranial pressure, the lack of which precludes efficient pharmacological treatment of a range of patients.

Taken together, our results challenge the general conception that simple, passive movement of water suffices to support the high CSF production rate. NKCC1-mediated cotransport of water ultimately provides a molecular mechanism by which the CSF production can take place independently of an osmotic gradient in a manner dictated by the prevailing ion gradients, generated and maintained by the concerted action of the Na + /K + -ATPase and the wealth of other ion transporters and channels expressed in choroid plexus. While the present study addressed the molecular mechanisms of fluid flow from the choroidal epithelial cell to the ventricle, future studies must delineate the transport mechanisms underlying ion and fluid flow across the basolateral membrane. Of immediate interest in this context is the orchestrated synergy between several bicarbonate transporters, the expression of which is illustrated in Fig. 7b.

### Cerebrospinal fluid hypersecretion in pediatric hydrocephalus [^1148F8LK]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Hydrocephalus, despite its heterogeneous causes, is ultimately a disease of disordered CSF homeostasis that results in pathological expansion of the cerebral ventricles. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus is inadequate but evolving. Over this past century, the majority of hydrocephalus cases has been explained by functional or anatomical obstructions to bulk CSF flow. More recently, hydrodynamic models of hydrocephalus have emphasized the role of abnormal intracranial pulsations in disease pathogenesis. Here, the authors review the molecular mechanisms of CSF secretion by the choroid plexus epithelium, the most efficient and actively secreting epithelium in the human body, and provide experimental and clinical evidence for the role of increased CSF production in hydrocephalus. Although the choroid plexus epithelium might have only an indirect influence on the pathogenesis of many types of pediatric hydrocephalus, the ability to modify CSF secretion with drugs newer than acetazolamide or furosemide would be an invaluable component of future therapies to alleviate permanent shunt dependence. Investigation into the human genetics of developmental hydrocephalus and choroid plexus hyperplasia, and the molecular physiology of the ion channels and transporters responsible for CSF secretion, might yield novel targets that could be exploited for pharmacotherapeutic intervention.

### Vascular hyperpermeability as a hallmark of phacomatoses: is the etiology angiogenesis comparable with mechanisms seen in inflammatory pathways? Part I: historical observations and clinical perspectives on the etiology of increased CSF protein levels, CSF clotting, and communicating hydrocephalus: a comprehensive review [^116ofQqj]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

Phacomatoses are a special group of familial hamartomatous syndromes with unique neuro-cutaneous manifestations as well as disease characteristic tumors. Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are representatives of this family. Vestibular schwannoma (VS) and subependymal giant cell tumor (SGCT) are two of the most common intracranial tumors associated with NF2 and TSC, respectively. These tumors can present with obstructive hydrocephalus due to their location adjacent to or in the ventricles. However, both tumors are also known to have a unique association with an elevated protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sometimes in association with non-obstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus (HCP), the causality of which has been unclear. Furthermore, SGCTs have repeatedly been shown to have a predisposition for CSF clotting, causing debilitating obstructions and recurrent malfunctions in shunted patients. However, the exact relation between high protein levels and spontaneous clotting of the CSF is not clear, nor is the mechanism understood by which CSF may clot in SGCTs. Elevated protein levels in the CSF are thought to be caused by increased vascular permeability and dysregulation of the blood-brain barrier. The two presumed underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for that, in the context of tumorigenesis, are angiogenesis and inflammation. Both mechanisms are correlated to the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway which is a major tumorigenesis pathway in nearly all phacomatoses. In this review, we discuss the influence of angiogenesis and inflammation on vascular permeability in VSs and SGCTs at the phenotypic level as well as their possible genetic and molecular determinants. Part I describes the historical perspectives and clinical aspects of the relationship between vascular permeability, abnormal CSF protein levels, clotting of the CSF, and communicating HCP. Part II describes different cellular and molecular pathways involved in angiogenesis and inflammation in these two tumors and the correlation between inflammation and coagulation. Interestingly, while increased angiogenesis can be observed in both VS and SGCT, inflammatory processes seem more prominent in SGCT. Both pathologies are characterized by different subgroups of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM): the pro-inflammatory, M1 type is predominating in SGCTs while pro-angiogenetic, M2 type is predominating in VSs. We suggest that lack of NF2 protein in VS and lack of TSC1/2 proteins in SGCT determine this fundamental difference between the two tumor types, by defining the predominant TAM type. Since inflammatory reactions and coagulation processes are tightly connected, a "pro-inflammatory state" of SGCT can be used to explain the observed associated enhanced CSF clotting process. These distinct cellular and molecular differences may have direct therapeutic implications on tumors that are unique to certain phacomatoses or those with similar genetics.

### Evaluation of the ventriculocholecystic shunt-an overview of present practice in adult and pediatric hydrocephalus [^113iFBKr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Physiology of gallbladder shunting

There are several aspects that need to be taken into consideration in relation to the underlying physiology governing a proper functioning of a VCS. This involves the mechanisms of storing and secreting the excess fluid in the gallbladder, the size of the gallbladder, the intracholecystic pressure, the intraventricular pressure, the difference between the two, and the volume of CSF coming through the shunt.

The gallbladder provides the secretion of bile necessary in gastrointestinal processes. Bile originates in the hepatocytes and consists mainly of water (95%) and only a small proportion is represented by bile salts, cholesterol, amino acids, phospholipids, bilirubin, and steroids. In the case of a cholecystic shunt, the gallbladder is also responsible for eliminating CSF, done through the relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi.

In the case of the peritoneum or the pleura, the principle is to allow the absorption of CSF, whereas for the gallbladder, the main process is storing fluids in order to secrete them in another compartment from where they are later eliminated. The urinary bladder uses the same mechanism in the ventriculovesical shunt, but the difference is that the gallbladder can also absorb certain elements such as water, electrolytes and other organic substances, whereas the urinary bladder is impermeable. Despite this constituting a minor advantage, the patency of a VCS should rely on the eliminating properties of the gallbladder and not so much on its absorptive capacity. The pH of the gallbladder content should not be the subject of major alteration given that both fluids have a pH ranging from 7 to 8, although there are various elements that can influence the biochemistry of the CSF as well as of the bile.

### ABCs of base therapy in neonatology: role of acetate, bicarbonate, citrate and lactate [^112Kc17i]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of base excess on an arterial blood gas

Base excess on an arterial blood gas can help clinicians understand the overall acid-base balance in a neonate. However, base excess should not be interpreted in isolation when determining acid-base status of an infant. Base deficit is a theoretical estimate that is calculated by a blood gas analyzer utilizing measured values of pH, PaCO 2 and hemoglobin. Some blood gas machines report two different values for base deficit or base excess: blood and ECF. Base deficit in blood is the amount of base that needs to be added or extracted (i.e. base excess) to a liter of blood to shift the plasma pH to 7.4 at a temperature of 37 °C and PaCO 2 of 40 mm Hg. As blood gas machines calculate base excess using measured values of pH and PCO 2, acute changes in PCO 2 without changing serum bicarbonate can alter calculated base excess values. For example, a term infant with perinatal acidosis may have an ABG with a pH of 7.1, PaCO 2 of 40 mmHg, bicarbonate of 12 mEq/L and a calculated base excess of −15.7 mEq/L. If this infant develops acute endotracheal tube obstruction with an increase in PaCO 2 to 60 mmHg without any change in serum bicarbonate, the pH decreases to 6.92 and calculated base excess will be −18.2 mEq/L.

### VEGF / VEGFR-2 changes in frontal cortex, choroid plexus, and CSF after chronic obstructive hydrocephalus [^113oC3LV]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic hydrocephalus (CH) is often associated with decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen levels. While the exact pathophysiology is not clear, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) may be involved. Because the choroid plexus (CP) is involved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and secretes numerous growth factors including VEGF, it is important to understand VEGF/VEGFR-2 levels in the CP-CSF circulatory system. Our results showed significant decreases in CBF and VEGFR-2 levels in frontal cortex (FC) in CH compared with SC; there were no significant changes in VEGF levels. CBF change in FC was positively correlated with VEGFR-2 levels (P = 0.024). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed robust expression of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in CP. After CH induction, ventricular CSF volume and VEGF levels significantly increased. These results suggest that the decreased VEGFR-2 levels in FC may be contributed to decreased CBF and increased ventricular CSF-VEGF levels possibly reflected a hypoxic response and/or accumulation of VEGF from CP secretion after blockage of CSF outlet. Further investigation into CSF-VEGF levels in different sites may provide a better understanding of VEGF/VEGFR-2 modulation in the normal and hydrocephalic brain, and may represent a feasible approach to potential therapeutic options for hydrocephalus.

### Effect of arterial blood bicarbonate (HCO) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-bang questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea [^113Mv7Nd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the effect of arterial bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Methods

A total of 144 patients with suspected OSA were included. Polysomnograms (PSG) and blood gas analysis were performed, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), STOP-Bang questionnaire, and Berlin questionnaire were completed. The correlation between the arterial HCO 3 − concentration, apnea hypopnea index (AHI), and other related indicators was analyzed. The scoring results of the ESS, SBQ, and Berlin questionnaire were compared with the PSG results, and the sensitivity and specificity were calculated in the form of a four-cell table. The changes in the sensitivity and specificity of OSA screening after SBQ alone and combined with HCO 3 − concentration were compared, and ROC curves were drawn.

Results

Arterial HCO 3 − concentration was positively correlated with AHI (r = 0.537, P < 0.001). The ratio of HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L in the non-OSA group was significantly lower than that in the OSA group (25.0% VS 80.8%, P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the SBQ was higher than that of the ESS (97.5% VS 81.7%, P < 0.001) and the Berlin questionnaire (97.5% VS 79.2%, P < 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the specificity of the three scales (25%, 37.5%, 37.5%). A combined SBQ score ≥ 3 and HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L showed increased specificity and decreased sensitivity compared with an SBQ score ≥ 3 alone, with a corresponding AUC of 0.771 (P < 0.01) and 0.613 (P > 0.05), respectively.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of the SBQ was better than that of the Berlin questionnaire and ESS. After combining arterial blood HCO 3 − concentration, the SBQ questionnaire increased the specificity of OSA prediction and decreased the sensitivity, which improved the accuracy of screening.

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111uwkYo]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

While bicarbonate has a high sensitivity for daytime hypercapnia in OHS, its sensitivity and the negative predictive value of a bicarbonate within normal limits for sleep hypoventilation are only moderate. Since the detection of sleep hypoventilation is important in obesity and NMD/CWD, an optimal screening tool should be sensitive. The positive likelihood ratio for hypoventilation increases significantly from the HCO 3- upper limit of the normal, and it is therefore helpful in risk groups for hypoventilation when it is elevated, despite not having optimal specificity. Sensitivity is higher in those taking diuretics. Bicarbonate is an essential part of the assessment of patients at risk of hypoventilation but must be interpreted in conjunction with other assessments.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^111ANUqY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3¯) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Effect of arterial blood bicarbonate (HCO) concentration on the accuracy of STOP-bang questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea [^116jC1ug]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic daytime hypercapnia (PaCO 2 ≥ 45 mmHg) is observed in 10% to 38% of patients with OSA. This result is similar to the findings of our study. There were 10 patients with PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg in our study, and all of them were in the OSA group, accounting for 8.3%. Interval nocturnal hypercapnia due to obstructive apnea or hypopnea may result in renal HCO 3 − retention to compensate for respiratory acidosis; this may lead to the elevation of serum HCO 3 −.

In our study, compared with the SBQ questionnaire alone, the specificity and sensitivity of the SBQ combined with arterial blood HCO 3 − concentration in screening OSA were significantly increased and decreased, respectively. However, by calculating and comparing the AUC, we found that the diagnostic accuracy of the SBQ combined with arterial blood HCO 3 − concentration was significantly better than that of the SBQ questionnaire alone. A serum HCO 3 − of at least 28 mmol/L and an SBQ score of at least 3 were found to improve the specificity of the prediction of moderate to severe OSA, but sensitivity was reduced. The results of these studies on the effect of serum HCO 3 − on SBQ sensitivity and specificity are similar to ours. However, we found that the value of HCO 3 − was quite different from our current research results. In the current study cohort of 144 patients, only 3 cases (2.1%) had an HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 28 mmol/L, and the optimal cutoff value of the HCO 3 − concentration was 24.6 mmol/L. A correlation between the BMI and the severity OSA was reported Another study found that as the severity of OSA increases, the risk of chronic daytime hypercapnia may also increase. This finding is relevant, as the BMI of Asians is generally lower than that of Europeans and Americans, and may, in part, explain the low HCO 3 − concentration cutoff value in our study.

### Size of third and fourth ventricle in obstructive and communicating acute hydrocephalus after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115S2A9W]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute hydrocephalus complicates subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured aneurysm in about 20% of the patients. Acute hydrocephalus can be treated by means of lumbar puncture or drainage when the site of obstruction is in the subarachnoid space (communicating hydrocephalus), but when the obstruction is intraventricular (obstructive hydrocephalus) external ventricular drainage (EVD) is the only option. EVD should preferably not be applied in case of communicating acute hydrocephalus because it carries a substantial risk of complications such as misplacement, ventriculostomy-related hemorrhage, and ventriculostomy-related infections. It is therefore important to discriminate between these two types of hydrocephalus, but unfortunately this distinction is often not straightforward. Only in patients with massive extension of the haemorrhage in the third or fourth ventricle or in patients with no intraventricular blood at all the distinction seems reasonably clear.

Theoretically, it might be supposed that the third and fourth ventricles increase in size when the site of obstruction is in the subarachnoid space, but not when the obstruction of the CSF circulation is upstream in the ventricular system. A similar assumption is that relatively greater enlargement of the third ventricle than of the fourth ventricle is characteristic of obstruction at the level of the cerebral aqueduct. To date there are no data to support or refute these assumptions. In patients already presenting with acute hydrocephalus as a result of massive intraventricular hemorrhage external ventricular drainage seems indeed the only option, regardless of the size of the third or fourth ventricle. In patients with partially filled ventricles it can be more difficult to estimate the site of blockage and therefore also the optimal treatment. Ventricular size might be helpful in such cases in indicating the most effective treatment.

However, little is known about normal values for the size of the third and fourth ventricles; most studies performed with Computed Tomography (CT) scanning used linear indices. Some studies addressed the prognostic significance of intraventricular haemorrhage, but did not distinguish the type of hydrocephalus according to the site of obstruction.

Our aim was to measure the planimetric size of the third and fourth ventricles, firstly in normal subjects and subsequently in two defined subsets of patients with acute hydrocephalus after aneurysmal SAH: those with mainly subarachnoid blood (presumed non-obstructive) and those with mainly intraventricular blood (presumed obstructive). If clear differences can be found in the size of the third and fourth ventricle between these two subsets of patients, this difference may help future decisions about the optimal mode of treatment in patients in whom the distribution of blood provides equivocal information about the site of obstruction of the CSF flow.

### Sodium bicarbonate causes dose-dependent increases in cerebral blood flow in infants and children with single-ventricle physiology [^116mj7Qz]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is a common treatment for metabolic acidemia; however, little definitive information exists regarding its treatment efficacy and cerebral hemodynamic effects. This pilot observational study quantifies relative changes in cerebral blood flow (ΔrCBF) and oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations (ΔHbO2 and ΔHb) due to bolus administration of NaHCO3 in patients with mild base deficits.

Methods

Infants and children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) were enrolled before cardiac surgery. NaHCO3 was given as needed for treatment of base deficit. Diffuse optical spectroscopies were used for 15 min postinjection to noninvasively monitor ΔHb, ΔHbO2, and ΔrCBF relative to baseline before NaHCO3 administration.

Results

Twenty-two anesthetized and mechanically ventilated patients with HLHS (aged 1 d to 4 y) received a median (interquartile range) dose of 1.1 (0.8, 1.8) mEq/kg NaHCO3 administered intravenously over 10–20 s to treat a median (interquartile range) base deficit of -4 (-6, -3) mEq/l. NaHCO3 caused significant dose-dependent increases in ΔrCBF; however, population-averaged ΔHb and ΔHbO2 as compared with those of controls were not significant.

Conclusions

Dose-dependent increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) caused by bolus administration of NaHCO3 are an important consideration in vulnerable populations wherein risk of rapid CBF fluctuations does not outweigh the benefit of treating a base deficit.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115tXu9x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome — serum bicarbonate diagnostic accuracy and predictive values in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing are as follows: Serum bicarbonate demonstrated pooled sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70–0.94) and specificity 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60–0.89). A bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L effectively rules out hypercapnia with a very high negative predictive value of 99.0% (95% CI, 97.9–99.6%) and remained effective when pretest probability was as high as 20%. Prevalence strata used for modeling were 5% for BMI 30–34.9 kg/m2, 10% for BMI 35–40 kg/m2, and 20% for BMI > 40 kg/m2. When bicarbonate is ≥ 27 mmol/L, positive predictive value is 48.3% (95% CI, 34.9–66.1%) at 20% prevalence, decreasing to 29.3% (95% CI, 19.2–46.4%) at 10% and 16.4% (95% CI, 10.1–29.0%) at 5%.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^117TWkTk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116WWKfK]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome in the perioperative period — diagnostic thresholds, prevalence, suspicion markers, and perioperative risk: to be diagnosed with OHS, the patient should have a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater and an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 45 mm Hg or greater during wakefulness, with exclusion of other causes of hypercapnia; approximately 90% have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea, and OHS is estimated to occur in 1/160 adults. OHS should be suspected in very obese patients and in obese patients with an increased serum bicarbonate (≥ 27 mEq/L). Compared with obstructive sleep apnea alone, perioperative OHS is associated with increased risk of respiratory failure (OR = 10.9; 95% CI = 3.7–32.3), heart failure (OR = 5.4; 95% CI = 1.9–15.7), prolonged intubation (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 0.6–15.3), tracheotomy (OR = 8; 95% CI = 1.7–8.6), and ICU transfer (OR = 10.9; 95% CI = 3.7–32.3).

Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sodium bicarbonate. It is also not known whether sodium bicarbonate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Pediatric

Rapid injection (10 mL/min) of hypertonic Sodium Bicarbonate Injection solutions into neonates and children under two years of age may produce hypernatremia, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and possible intracranial hemorrhage. The rate of administration in such patients should therefore be limited to no more than 8 mEq/kg/day. A 4.2% solution may be preferred for such slow administration. In emergencies such as cardiac arrest, the risk of rapid infusion must be weighed against the potential for fatality due to acidosis.

Geriatric

Clinical studies of Sodium Bicarbonate Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Comparison of sensitivity and specificity of the SBQ, ESS and Berlin questionnaires

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the three questionnaires for predicting OSA are shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Diagnostic efficiency of three questionnaires for predicting OSA

SBQ = STOP-Bang questionnaire, ESS = Epworth Sleepiness Scale, PPV = positive predictive value, NPV = negative predictive value

The sensitivity of the SBQ questionnaire compared with the ESS questionnaire (97.5% VS 81.7%, P < 0.001) was statistically significant. The sensitivity of the SBQ questionnaire compared with the Berlin questionnaire (97.5% vs. 79.2%, P < 0.001) was also statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between the ESS and Berlin questionnaires (81.7% vs. 79.2%, P = 0.701).

There was no statistical significance in the specificity of the three scales (25%, 37.5%, 37.5%).

The value of SBQ alone and SBQ combined with HCO 3 − concentration screening for OSA

The sensitivity and specificity of all OSA, moderate and severe OSA, and severe OSA were calculated, with an SBQ score ≥ 3 as the screening cutoff value, as shown in Table 3. A combined SBQ score ≥ 3 points and HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L showed increased specificity and decreased sensitivity (Table 3).

Table 3
Values of SBQ ≥ 3 points combined with an HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L for screening for OSA (%)

AHI = apnea hypopnea index, SBQ = STOP-Bang questionnaire

Annotation: *Compared with the SBQ score ≥ 3 group, P < 0.01

When the SBQ was applied alone to predict OSA, the corresponding AUC of the OSA group was 0.613 (P > 0.05). When a combined SBQ score ≥ 3 and the HCO 3 − concentration ≥ 24.6 mmol/L, the corresponding AUC in the OSA group increased to 0.771 (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3 B).

### Respiratory mechanics and ventilatory control in overlap syndrome and obesity hypoventilation [^112RsMiy]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Model combining sleep-disordered breathing, central respiratory drive and renal buffering

The role of OSA in the pathogenesis of hypoventilation has been established by the resolution of hypercapnia in the majority of patients with OHS treated with CPAP or BPAP without any significant change in BMI. There is pathophysiologic basis behind how severe OSA, as measured by AHI, could lead to hypercapnia. In patients with OSA, the minute ventilation during sleep does not decrease due to the large increase in the minute ventilation between the obstructive respiratory events. Obstructive apneas can, however, lead to acute hypercapnia if the duration of the inter-event hyperventilation is inadequate to eliminate the accumulated CO 2. In cases of very severe OSA, there is not much time left to increase the minute ventilation between the obstructive events and to off-load CO 2, leading to significant nocturnal hypercapnia. This acute hypercapnia causes a small increase in serum bicarbonate level that is not corrected before the next sleep period if the time constant of bicarbonate excretion is longer than that of CO 2. Because the bicarbonate in the serum (and brain tissue) rises during the chronic, compensated respiratory acidosis, the baseline pH of the cerebrospinal fluid is actually well defended, so the pH and the stimulus for the brainstem chemoreceptors are not much changed in the steady state. However, should the CO 2 level rise further, elevated bicarbonate level will blunt the ventilatory response to CO 2 by reducing the change in pH associated with the change in CO 2, and the chemosensory stimulus will be less for any given change in the level of CO 2. This would ultimately result in a higher wake CO 2 level. In a recent study it was confirmed that patients with higher bicarbonate concentration had a more blunted CO 2 response. The development of decreased central respiratory drive and/or the greater ventilatory limitations imposed by more extreme central obesity may initiate the acute failure to compensate for OSA, but only if the renal compensatory mechanism is impaired. In other words, whether or not daytime chronic hypercapnia develops depends on the individual's ability to unload both CO 2 and bicarbonate during the waking period. Thus, deficient renal bicarbonate excretion seems to play a critical pathophysiologic role, leading to a cumulative effect over subsequent periods of sleep, which eventually results in a self-perpetuating state of chronic hypercapnia. Hence, the presence of obstructive apneas can trigger a vicious circle of acute hypercapnia, blunting the ventilatory response to CO 2, but only if the renal buffering capacity is impaired. Concommittant presence of morbid obesity and airway obstruction could also lead more easily to limitation of the interapneic ventilation. This could represent a common mechanism by which COPD and obesity could predispose to the development of hypercapnia in OSA.

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^112UTvdE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Serum bicarbonate level (threshold ≥ 27 mmol/L) was recommended in an American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline on OHS to stratify obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing for arterial blood gas analysis to measure p a CO 2 (availability, cost). Our data suggest a lower bicarbonate threshold for screening for sleep hypoventilation in obese individuals. With the proposed serum bicarbonate threshold of 27 mmol/L to screen for OHS, we would miss many patients with sleep hypoventilation, especially younger patients. The aim of a screening tool in these patients would be to detect early stages of obesity-related respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing to improve treatment outcomes.

Since OSA is a major contributing factor to sleep hypoventilation, the sensitivity of bicarbonate for sleep hypoventilation was analysed separately in the obese group and in the group with OSA despite an overlap and was comparable.

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111VUGBZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

The most common causes of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) are obesity, neuromuscular disease (NMD), chest wall disease (CWD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If left untreated, patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure require frequent hospitalisation and have a high mortality rate. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is particularly common in restrictive ventilatory disorders and also contributes to hypoventilation. OSA can also lead to sleep-related hypoventilation and chronic alveolar hypoventilation (hypercapnic OSA). Hypoventilation first manifests during sleep. Thus, the goal is to treat the sleep-disordered breathing before it progresses to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. In most cases, correction of nocturnal hypercapnia leads to a reset of the respiratory centre and chemosensitivity, restoring ventilation during the day.

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is defined by an arterial CO 2 partial pressure (paCO 2) in the awake state of > 45 mm Hg (6 kPa). It can occur as acute, acute-on-chronic or chronic failure. These types can be distinguished on the basis of the constellation of pH, paCO 2 and bicarbonate concentration (cHCO 3-) in the arterial blood gas analysis if no additional metabolic acidosis or alkalosis is present. Metabolic compensation of respiratory acidosis occurs over a period of hours to days. The kidneys respond to respiratory acidosis during sleep by increasing bicarbonate, which may remain elevated during wakefulness. Thus, elevated bicarbonate, especially after waking, can occur as a result of sleep hypoventilation before the onset of daytime hypercapnia. It is therefore used as a screening tool for early diagnosis of sleep hypoventilation in patients at risk of developing chronic hypercapnic ventilatory failure, such as those with obesity, NMD and CWD. A bicarbonate level of 24 ± 2 mmol/L is considered normal. The bicarbonate value is either calculated using acid-base formulas or measured directly in the serum. It has been suggested that a serum bicarbonate concentration of > 27 mmol/L could be used as an indicator of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and should prompt to measure arterial blood gases. An elevated bicarbonate is also used as one of the indicators of residual hypoventilation under HMV.

### Outcomes of virtually assisted personalized tracheostomy tubes for congenital airway anomalies [^112Qbkuo]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

To measure clinical outcomes and respiratory trajectories after the placement of virtually assisted personalized tracheostomy tubes (vapTT) designed for patients with congenital airway anomalies (CAA).

Methods

Retrospective review was performed of vapTT candidates, which included patients with CAA experiencing recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing TT obstruction despite exhaustion of commercially available TT. VapTT design used a previously reported protocol for virtual modeling from CT images correlated with endoscopy findings. Outcomes obtained from medical records included the presence of TT-related granulation/ulceration, symptomatic tracheoscopy frequency, progression of inpatient care, ventilatory parameters, and serum bicarbonate levels.

Results

Six patients were included. CAA pathology included tracheal cartilaginous sleeve, tortuosity, and stenosis in the setting of conditions such as craniosynostosis syndromes, skeletal dysplasia, and long-gap esophageal atresia with scoliosis. Three patients were hospitalized for greater than 5months at the time of vapTT implementation; all three demonstrated improvement in acute obstructive events, resolution of granulation on tracheoscopy, significant improvement in serum bicarbonate (p < 0.005), and progression of care to discharge. Of the three outpatients undergoing vapTT implementation, one patient experienced resolution of recurrent tracheitis and one had resolution of acutely symptomatic airway events. For the group, there was a significant decrease in compiled serum bicarbonate levels after vapTT implementation (3.6, 95% CI: 2.85–4.31, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

VapTT is a feasible option when airway obstruction cannot be overcome with standard TTs in children with CAA. Our early experience with vapTT demonstrated improved respiratory function without significant adverse events. Future studies are required to investigate long-term outcomes of vapTT.

Recommendations

Patients with major infarctions are at high risk of developing brain oedema and intracranial hypertension. Transfer of patients to intensive care unit should be considered. Measures to lessen the risk of oedema and close monitoring of patients for signs of neurological worsening during the first days after stroke are recommended (class I, level of evidence C).
In patients ≤ 60 years of age with unilateral MCA infarctions who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours despite medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion is reasonable (class IIa, level of evidence A).
In patients > 60 years of age with unilateral MCA infarctions who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours despite medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion may be considered (class IIb, level of evidence B).
Although the optimal trigger for decompressive craniectomy is unknown, it is reasonable to use a decrease in level of consciousness attributed to brain swelling as selection criteria (class IIa, level of evidence A).
Ventriculostomy is recommended in the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus after a cerebellar infarct. Concomitant or subsequent decompressive craniectomy may or may not be necessary on the basis of factors such as infarct size, neurological condition, degree of brainstem compression and effectiveness of medical management (class I, level of evidence C).
Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy with dural expansion should be performed in patients with cerebellar infarction causing neurological deterioration from brainstem compression despite maximal medical therapy. When deemed safe and indicated, obstructive hydrocephalus should be treated concurrently with ventriculostomy (class I, level of evidence B).
Use of salvage osmotic therapy for patients with clinical deterioration from occupying signs associated with major supratentorial infarction or cerebellar infarction is reasonable (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Use of brief moderate hyperventilation (PCO 2 target 30–34 mm Hg) is a reasonable treatment for patients with acute severe neurological decline from brain swelling (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Hypothermia or barbiturates in the setting of ischaemic cerebral or cerebellar swelling is not recommended (class III, level of evidence B).
Because of a lack of evidence of efficacy and the potential to increase the risk of infectious complications, corticosteroids (in conventional or large doses) should not be administered for the treatment of cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure (class III, level of evidence A).

### Targeting germinal matrix hemorrhage-induced overexpression of sodium-coupled bicarbonate exchanger reduces posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus formation in neonatal rats [^114FAfs4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The formation of PHH is a well‐described and common complication following GMH. 2 Currently, there is no effective treatment for PHH other than surgical shunting. In fact, the need for CSF diversion via ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculopleural shunt placement is an independent risk factor for an adverse neurological outcome following GMH. 6 While PHH is believed to be caused by an obstruction within the CSF circulation and/or by an imbalance between CSF formation and absorption, 7 insufficient advancements have been made targeting or preventing its formation. Intracerebroventricular accumulation of iron, resulting from degraded hemoglobin, has been linked to the development of PHH. 10 Using a preclinical rat pup model of GMH, which has been shown to induce PHH, 14, 18 we attempted to investigate whether GMH‐induced iron overload decreases IRP1 and IRP2 expressions, and increases NCBE overexpression, resulting in increased CSF production and consequent PHH formation. We further attempted to evaluate whether iron chelation via deferoxamine or slc4a10 knockdown decreases the rate of CSF production, thereby decreasing hydrocephalus formation and improving neurobehavioral outcomes after GMH.

Our data showed that mRNA and protein levels of slc4a10/NCBE significantly increased on days 1, 3, and 5 after GMH. Furthermore, IRP2 mRNA and protein levels were inversely related to slc4a10/NCBE. Interestingly, IRP1 expression was preserved after GMH. We further demonstrated increased NCBE expression localized on the choroid plexus basolateral membrane, the main source of CSF production. Since NCBE protein is significantly involved in CSF production, under pathophysiological circumstances, overexpression of the transporter could result in increased CSF production, thereby promoting PHH formation following GMH. Indeed, the CSF production rate significantly increased after GMH. Furthermore, iron chelation via deferoxamine and slc4a10 knockdown reduced the CSF production rate, which was associated with decreased ventricular dilation and improved neurobehavioral outcomes. These findings suggest that NCBE upregulation seems to be linked to iron toxicity, since improvements were observed after deferoxamine treatment, and possibly associated with IRP2. However, GMH did not significantly alter the expression of IRP1. The mechanism still needs to be further identified.

### Assessing acid-base status: physiologic versus physicochemical approach [^1165zYbe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The physiologic approach has long been used in assessing acid-base status. This approach considers acids as hydrogen ion donors and bases as hydrogen ion acceptors and the acid-base status of the organism as reflecting the interaction of net hydrogen ion balance with body buffers. In the physiologic approach, the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer pair is used for assessing acid-base status and blood pH is determined by carbonic acid (ie, Paco 2) and serum bicarbonate levels. More recently, the physicochemical approach was introduced, which has gained popularity, particularly among intensivists and anesthesiologists. This approach posits that the acid-base status of body fluids is determined by changes in the dissociation of water that are driven by the interplay of 3 independent variables: the sum of strong (fully dissociated) cation concentrations minus the sum of strong anion concentrations (strong ion difference); the total concentration of weak acids; and Paco 2. These 3 independent variables mechanistically determine both hydrogen ion concentration and bicarbonate concentration of body fluids, which are considered as dependent variables. Our experience indicates that the average practitioner is familiar with only one of these approaches and knows very little, if any, about the other approach. In the present Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case, we attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by contrasting the physiologic and physicochemical approaches to assessing acid-base status. We first outline the essential features, advantages, and limitations of each of the 2 approaches and then apply each approach to the same patient presentation. We conclude with our view about the optimal approach.
