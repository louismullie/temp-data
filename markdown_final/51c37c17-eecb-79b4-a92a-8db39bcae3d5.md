## Question

A 52-year-old man is referred to your hepatology clinic after an incidental finding of hepatic steatosis on abdominal ultrasound performed for non-specific abdominal discomfort. He has a BMI of 31 kg/m² and a waist circumference of 110 cm. He does not have a prior diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. His past medical history is notable only for mild obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed several years ago, for which he is not currently receiving treatment. He does not drink alcohol. On examination, his blood pressure is 138/86 mmHg. You suspect metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and are planning his initial work-up.

According to current EASL guidelines, what comorbidities and risk factors should you screen for at the initial diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in this patient, and what approach should you take to ensure comprehensive management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what comorbidities and risk factors should be screened for at the initial diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatolic liver disease (MASLD) in a 52-year-old man with obesity and suspected MASLD, and what approach should be taken to ensure comprehensive management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis of MASLD and excluding other causes of steatosis. Then, I should verify which comorbidities must be screened for at baseline. Next, I will review noninvasive fibrosis risk stratification. After that, I need to outline a multidisciplinary management plan, including lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special scenarios and summarize a practical timeline for follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with EASL-EASD-EASO 2024 guidance and related high-quality sources [^d69b023e] [^9fc868cc].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude alternative etiologies. MASLD requires hepatic steatosis plus at least one cardiometabolic risk factor and the absence of other causes of steatosis; here, obesity (BMI 31 kg/m²) satisfies the metabolic criterion, and the absence of alcohol supports MASLD rather than MetALD, but I should still exclude other causes such as alcohol-related liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, and monogenic or secondary steatosis, using history, medication review, and targeted labs as indicated [^bfaf1a0d] [^cabc9311]. Wait, let me verify the alcohol threshold for MetALD; yes, the overlap category applies when alcohol intake is 20–50 g/day in women and 30–60 g/day in men, which is not the case here, reinforcing a pure MASLD diagnosis in this patient [^2151309b].

> Next, I should review which comorbidities must be screened at baseline. The EASL-EASD-EASO guideline explicitly recommends screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome (when relevant), and cardiovascular risk, with laboratory tests and physical examination at diagnosis and at regular follow-up [^9b06769c] [^d69b023e]. Hold on, I should verify the scope; yes, this includes comprehensive cardiometabolic profiling and targeted screening for sleep apnea and CKD given their prevalence and impact on outcomes in MASLD [^9b06769c].

> I will now examine the specific assessments I need to order. For dysglycemia, I should obtain fasting glucose or HbA1c and consider a 2-hour OGTT if prediabetes is suspected, because MASLD diagnosis itself requires at least one cardiometabolic risk factor and early detection changes management [^7e59c98c]. For dyslipidemia, I need a fasting lipid panel to assess triglycerides and HDL-C, which are part of the MASLD metabolic criteria and inform cardiovascular risk reduction [^7e59c98c]. For hypertension, I should confirm blood pressure on multiple occasions and initiate treatment if ≥ 130/85 mmHg, aligning with the metabolic risk framework embedded in MASLD [^7e59c98c]. For CKD, I should check eGFR and urinalysis to detect early kidney disease, which is common and prognostically relevant in MASLD [^notfound]. For OSA, given his history and obesity, I should arrange polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing and initiate CPAP if indicated, as untreated OSA worsens insulin resistance and liver disease progression [^notfound]. For CVD risk, I should calculate a 10-year ASCVD risk and consider additional testing such as ECG or coronary calcium scoring if risk is borderline or intermediate, integrating MASLD as a risk enhancer [^notfound].

> Now, I need to ensure fibrosis risk stratification is performed noninvasively. The EASL guidance recommends a stepwise approach: first, calculate FIB-4 using age, AST, ALT, and platelets; if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high, proceed to elastography (VCTE or MRE) or ELF to refine fibrosis staging and predict liver-related outcomes [^e30d71d8] [^2666d627]. Wait, I should double-check thresholds; in adults under 65, FIB-4 < 1.3 suggests low risk, 1.3–2.67 is indeterminate, and > 2.67 suggests high risk and warrants expedited secondary testing or referral, with awareness that FIB-4 has lower accuracy in younger patients and should be interpreted in context [^2a703d7f]. I should also remember that no noninvasive test can assess ballooning or lobular inflammation, so biopsy remains the gold standard when histology is needed for diagnosis or trial eligibility [^7dbb6b80].

> Let me consider the management framework next. EASL emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to address both liver-related and extrahepatic outcomes, with coordinated care across hepatology, endocrinology, cardiology, nutrition, and primary care, and this is especially important in patients with obesity and multiple metabolic comorbidities [^8559d3fc] [^50f4eb73]. I should confirm that our plan includes structured lifestyle intervention, aggressive management of metabolic comorbidities, and pharmacotherapy when indicated, all aligned with guideline-directed therapy [^bfaf1a0d].

> For lifestyle therapy, I need to ensure weight loss is prioritized. A 7–10% weight loss target improves steatosis and histology in overweight/obesity, and even 3–5% can reduce liver fat; I should pair this with a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, and resistance training, while discouraging alcohol entirely and addressing OSA with CPAP to improve insulin sensitivity [^4b73b9f7] [^5b757972] [^bfaf1a0d]. Hold on, I should verify that these lifestyle measures are first-line and supported; yes, EASL places lifestyle modification at the core of therapy for MASLD across the spectrum [^bfaf1a0d].

> For pharmacotherapy of comorbidities, I should confirm indications and choices. If prediabetes or type 2 diabetes is present, metformin is reasonable, and GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide or tirzepatide are preferred for their weight loss and potential MASH benefits; SGLT2 inhibitors are also options in T2D with cardiorenal benefit, and insulin is reserved for decompensated cirrhosis when needed [^bfaf1a0d] [^de2bbfb9]. For dyslipidemia, I should initiate statins for primary or secondary prevention regardless of liver enzyme levels, as statins are safe and reduce cardiovascular events in MASLD, including in compensated cirrhosis [^105c7987]. For hypertension, I should treat to < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, favoring ACE inhibitors or ARBs given their cardiorenal benefits in metabolic disease [^notfound].

> I should also review liver-directed pharmacotherapy. In adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant fibrosis (stage ≥ F2), resmetirom is recommended if locally approved, given its histologic efficacy on steatohepatitis and fibrosis; no MASH-targeted therapy is currently recommended for cirrhotic-stage disease, so management focuses on complications and surveillance in that scenario [^bfaf1a0d]. But wait, I need to ensure I do not overstate approval status; I should confirm local availability and labeling before recommending resmetirom [^bfaf1a0d].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up cadence. I need to reassess weight, blood pressure, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and lipids periodically, and repeat FIB-4 every 1–2 years in higher-risk patients such as those with prediabetes/T2D or multiple metabolic risk factors, escalating to elastography or ELF if FIB-4 rises or remains indeterminate [^2a703d7f] [^3cbc06fa]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with primary care pathways; yes, AASLD-endorsed algorithms support periodic FIB-4 reassessment and referral thresholds to hepatology for indeterminate or high-risk results [^2a703d7f].

> I will now examine special scenarios. If the patient were lean, I should still offer lifestyle intervention targeting modest weight loss and dietary quality, as MASLD can occur even with normal BMI and responds to exercise and dietary change; if there is a strong family history of severe liver disease or early presentation, I should consider genetic testing for monogenic steatosis or other heritable liver diseases using next-generation sequencing [^a57381af] [^3803eae4]. If cirrhosis is suspected or confirmed, I should initiate HCC surveillance with ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months and screen for varices when indicated, without requiring biopsy confirmation if noninvasive evidence is compelling [^cc105321].

> Let me summarize the practical timeline to ensure nothing is missed. At baseline, I will obtain fasting glucose or HbA1c, a fasting lipid panel, creatinine/eGFR and urinalysis, confirm blood pressure on multiple readings, arrange OSA evaluation, calculate ASCVD risk, and perform FIB-4 with contingency for elastography or ELF if indicated; I will also exclude other liver diseases and document alcohol intake rigorously [^9b06769c] [^e30d71d8] [^cabc9311]. Within 1–3 months, I will review lifestyle adherence, reinforce weight loss and exercise goals, initiate or optimize pharmacotherapy for metabolic comorbidities, and address OSA therapy; if FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3, I will complete secondary testing and consider hepatology referral if ≥ 2.67 or if advanced fibrosis is suspected [^2a703d7f]. Every 6–12 months thereafter, I will monitor metabolic parameters, repeat FIB-4 in higher-risk patients, and adjust therapy based on liver and cardiovascular outcomes, maintaining multidisciplinary coordination [^3cbc06fa] [^8559d3fc].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the care plan is comprehensive, evidence-based, and patient-centered. By confirming MASLD and excluding other causes, systematically screening for diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, CKD, OSA, and CVD risk, noninvasively staging fibrosis, and implementing multidisciplinary lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy, I can address both liver-specific and cardiometabolic outcomes, which is precisely the EASL-endorsed approach to MASLD management [^d69b023e] [^8559d3fc] [^bfaf1a0d].

At initial MASLD diagnosis, EASL recommends screening for **cardiometabolic comorbidities** (type 2 diabetes/prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease) [^9b06769c] and **extrahepatic conditions** (chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome) [^afd215a4] using history, exam, and labs [^d69b023e]. Also assess **fibrosis risk** with FIB-4 and elastography to guide management and follow-up [^e30d71d8] [^2666d627]. Management should be **multidisciplinary** [^8559d3fc], with lifestyle therapy (weight loss, Mediterranean diet, exercise, alcohol abstinence) [^c970683b] and optimized control of comorbidities; consider resmetirom for non-cirrhotic MASH with F2–F3 fibrosis if available [^bfaf1a0d] [^de2bbfb9]. Monitor annually for progression and complications, and refer to hepatology if advanced fibrosis is suspected [^ec05836f].

## Comorbidities and risk factors to screen for at initial diagnosis

EASL recommends a **comprehensive assessment** at diagnosis to identify and manage cardiometabolic and extrahepatic comorbidities that increase liver-related and cardiovascular risk [^9b06769c] [^d69b023e].

---

### Cardiometabolic comorbidities

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes**: Screen with fasting glucose, HbA1c, and consider OGTT if indicated [^23ef2f70].
- **Hypertension**: Measure blood pressure; treat if ≥ 130/85 mmHg [^23ef2f70].
- **Dyslipidemia**: Obtain fasting lipid profile; assess for hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL [^23ef2f70].
- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**: Evaluate for clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis and calculate cardiovascular risk [^9b06769c].

---

### Extrahepatic comorbidities

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Check eGFR and urinalysis for albuminuria [^notfound].
- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Screen clinically and with validated tools; refer for polysomnography if suspected [^notfound].
- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Assess in women of reproductive age with menstrual irregularities or hyperandrogenism [^9b06769c].

---

### Assessment of liver disease severity and fibrosis risk

Noninvasive fibrosis assessment is essential to **risk-stratify and guide management** [^e30d71d8]:

- **FIB-4 index**: Use as the initial blood-based score to stratify fibrosis risk [^e30d71d8].
- **Transient elastography (TE)**: Perform if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high to assess liver stiffness and fibrosis stage [^e30d71d8].
- **Alternative noninvasive tests**: Consider ELF or MRE if TE is unavailable or inconclusive [^ec05836f].

---

## Recommended approach to comprehensive management

EASL emphasizes a **multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach** targeting both liver-specific and cardiometabolic outcomes [^8559d3fc] [^50f4eb73].

---

### Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle modification is **first-line therapy** for all patients with MASLD [^c970683b]:

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 7–10% weight loss; even 3–5% reduces liver fat and improves metabolic parameters [^4b73b9f7].
- **Dietary changes**: Adopt a Mediterranean diet; limit saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars [^c970683b].
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus resistance training [^5b757972].
- **Alcohol abstinence**: Strongly recommended to reduce liver injury and fibrosis progression [^c970683b].

---

### Pharmacological management of comorbidities

Optimize cardiometabolic risk factors with **guideline-directed therapy**:

| **Comorbidity** | **Recommended pharmacotherapy** |
|-|-|
| T2DM/prediabetes | - Metformin <br/> - GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. semaglutide) <br/> - SGLT2 inhibitors [^de2bbfb9] |
| Hypertension | - ACE inhibitors <br/> - ARBs <br/> - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Thiazide diuretics [^notfound] |
| Dyslipidemia | - Statins (high-intensity if indicated) <br/> - Ezetimibe <br/> - PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL goals unmet [^notfound] |
| Obesity | - GLP-1 receptor agonists <br/> - Tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1) [^de2bbfb9] |

---

### Liver-directed pharmacotherapy

For patients with **biopsy-confirmed MASH and significant fibrosis (F2–F3)**, consider resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor β-agonist, if available and approved locally [^bfaf1a0d] [^de2bbfb9].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to detect progression and complications:

- **Annual follow-up**: Assess weight, blood pressure, glucose, lipids, liver enzymes, and renal function [^notfound].
- **Fibrosis reassessment**: Repeat FIB-4 and elastography every 2–3 years, or sooner if clinical status changes [^2a703d7f].
- **Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis**: If cirrhosis is suspected, screen for HCC and esophageal varices, and refer to hepatology [^cc105321].

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥ 2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

Background and Aims

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects over one third of adults worldwide and represents a growing public health challenge. In addition to becoming the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States, MASLD is currently a major risk factor for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis of MASLD is defined by the presence of a fatty liver in combination with one or more of five cardiometabolic risk factors, excluding excessive alcohol consumption. While the individual risk factors are all observationally associated with a fatty liver, the connection between these cardiometabolic risk factors and fatty liver has not been fully explained.

Methods

In this review we describe how fatty liver is associated with each of the cardiometabolic criteria of the MASLD diagnosis. We review the pathophysiological mechanisms between the cardiometabolic risk factors contributing to the MASLD diagnosis and development of fatty liver. We describe how MASLD associates with cardiovascular disease and suggest that fatty liver is associated with cardiovascular disease through very low-density lipoproteins. Finally, we describe current guidelines and ongoing pharmaceutical approaches in the treatment of MASLD with the focus on cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

This review provides a comprehensive overview of MASLD. Its association with common risk factors, including the mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease, and finally an overview of the advised clinical approach according to current guidelines.

Conclusion

This review encompasses clinical aspects of MASLD from risk factors to outcome, including recommended clinical handling of these patients.

Steatotic liver disease (MASLD) primary care FIB-4 triage — When the FIB-4 is < 1.3, patients can be followed in the primary care setting and reassessed periodically, with patients without prediabetes/T2DM and < 2 metabolic risk factors reassessed every 2–3 years, while more frequent FIB-4 monitoring (eg, every 1–2 y) should be considered for those with prediabetes/T2DM or ≥ 2 or more metabolic risk factors. In patients older than age 65, an FIB-4 cutoff of > 2.0 should be used, whereas FIB-4 has low accuracy in those under the age of 35 years; thus, secondary assessment should be considered in those < 35 years of age with increased metabolic risk or elevated liver chemistries. FIB-4 should not be used in acutely ill patients, and in patients with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, a secondary assessment should be done (preferably VCTE or ELF initially).

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease' (NAFLD) or 'metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease' (MAFLD), is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease across the globe and is associated with high cardiometabolic and hepatic morbidity and mortality. The updated European guidelines on the management of MASLD, jointly published by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), synthetise the developments of recent years and provide comprehensive recommendations on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of MASLD.

AASLD guidance — screening frequency and follow-up for pediatric MASLD notes there are no data to guide the frequency of repeated screening for at-risk children with overweight and obesity, and we suggest annual screening with ALT in children ≥ 10 years of age who remain at risk due to overweight, obesity, or associated cardiometabolic conditions. For asymptomatic and well-appearing children with a single elevated screening ALT, a repeat measurement is recommended within 3 months to exclude transient conditions, and we recommend further evaluation and/or referral to pediatric gastroenterology or hepatology if liver enzymes remain persistently elevated or if there are concerning signs or symptoms for severe liver disease.

Pediatric MASLD — who to screen and re-screen: In children, younger ages may still warrant screening when risk factors are present, as "a few guidelines recommend screening younger children under 10 years of age if risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, or family history of NAFLD are present". In pediatric obesity programs, "up to one-third may exhibit elevated ALT levels exceeding 30 U/L". Regarding interval testing, "There are currently no data on the ideal frequency of re-screening", but "The 2023 AAP obesity management guideline recommends biannual re-screening for comorbid conditions in children with overweight or obesity, or sooner if changes in signs or symptoms".

4 CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF

Several international clinical practice guidelines have been developed for the diagnosis and management of MASLD and MASH (Table 1). In the United States, AASLD, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE), and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have published guidance pertaining to the management of patients with MASLD and MASH by an interprofessional team, including the use of pharmacotherapy in individuals with obesity and/or T2D. In Europe, the European Associations for the Study of the Liver (EASL), Diabetes (EASD) and Obesity (EASO) have published guidance for specialists caring for patients with conditions associated with MASLD/MASH and CMD. Although these MASLD guidelines are broadly consistent with each other, there is discordance amongst some key recommendations, including FIB‐4 thresholds for high‐risk MASLD, the sequence of tests to determine hepatic steatosis, as well as the presence of concise guidance regarding pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery, and lifestyle interventions. These differences may reflect local availability of treatment options, clinic infrastructures, and reimbursement models, but they may also be partially responsible for the low rate of guideline implementation. A cross‐sectional study of MASLD experts conducted between 2018 and 2019 revealed that out of 29 participating European countries, none had written action plan strategies specifically addressing this condition.MASLD was specified in only two obesity strategies (in Portugal and the United Kingdom) and in one alcohol strategy (in Portugal). Furthermore, only 10 countries had national guidelines specifically addressing MASLD, and three had national registries. Notably, 11 countries recommended screening for MASLD in individuals with diabetes, obesity, and/or metabolic syndrome, and five countries had referral algorithms for follow‐up and specialist referral from primary care.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3595dcb6]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis terminology and diagnostic approach — Commensurate with the change from NAFLD to MASLD, NASH was replaced with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and the histologic diagnosis of steatohepatitis remains unchanged; MASLD that does not meet criteria for MASH could be referred to as metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver (MASL), although the Delphi consensus did not explicitly address this, and historically the definitions of MASH and MASL required a liver biopsy for histologic identification of steatohepatitis. Clinical practice has shifted away from biopsy toward using biomarkers to noninvasively categorize MASLD severity, and in most clinical settings MASL could be inferred when noninvasive tests suggest the absence of steatohepatitis, though further biomarker validation is needed.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is not a label… [^05da0418]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: Lazris and colleagues concisely review the epidemiology and prognosis for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults. 1 However, their conclusions that ". it is unlikely that diagnosing NAFLD benefits patients" and ". the best approach to patients with metabolic syndrome is not labeling them with more diseases" are misleading. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases does not recommend screening for NAFLD. 2 However, a patient with an incidental finding of elevated liver transaminases or hepatic steatosis on imaging warrants an appropriate workup. 2, 3 The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines and an American Family Physician article on NAFLD highlight the importance of risk stratification using decision aids or imaging, with a need for more frequent follow-up for patients at high risk. 2, 3 Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality in the workup of patients with elevated liver enzymes.

The false-positive rate of 15% cited by Lazris and colleagues is misleading because that rate applies if ultrasonography is used as a screening test for all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 4 The actual false-positive rate of ultrasonography when used in the workup of patients with elevated liver enzymes is likely much lower. A meta-analysis found a sensitivity and specificity as high as 89% and 90%, respectively, compared with histology, when at least 20% to 30% of hepatocytes are affected. 5 At 5% hepatocytes affected, the sensitivity and specificity decrease to 65% and 81%, respectively; therefore, it is more likely NAFLD goes undiagnosed early in the disease process.
5. Although most patients with NAFLD do not progress to cirrhosis or hepatic-related death, NAFLD represents a significant disease that may progress throughout a patient's lifetime if not managed appropriately.

6 Most patients with NAFLD die from vascular causes, but NAFLD puts patients at increased risk of cardiovascular death. 6 As the U. S. population continues to develop metabolic syndrome at an earlier age, hepatic-related deaths will likely become more prominent over time. 6 Concurrent use of alcohol or hepatotoxic medication is likely to worsen hepatic-related outcomes for patients with undiagnosed NAFLD. 6 Patients should be counseled on their diagnosis, and risk stratification should be performed periodically using a validated decision tool. 2, 3 The diagnosis of NAFLD represents an opportunity to educate patients about the widespread effects of obesity on their health and is not merely a label. The opinions and assertions contained herein are those of the authors and are not to be construed as official or reflecting the views of the U. S. Air Force Medical Corps, the U. S. Air Force at large, or the U. S. Department of Defense. In Reply: We generally agree with Dr. Wiley.

Most of what we discussed in the article involves screening performed in people without elevated liver function test results, who we think should not receive abdominal ultrasonography in the absence of other symptoms. We agree that people with elevated LFT results warrant radiologic and laboratory investigation to assess for possible reversible causes of hepatic dysfunction and to help determine prognosis. However, once the diagnosis of NAFLD is determined by ultrasonography, a discussion should occur between the physician and patient about the meaning of the diagnosis and its connection to metabolic syndrome, rather than labeling the patient with liver disease. Physicians should address the metabolic and dietary causes of NAFLD instead of repeating ultrasonography for surveillance purposes or routinely referring these patients to gastroenterologists. Certainly, follow-up LFT measurements and other laboratory tests would be warranted.

Screening of MASLD in children — Over the last decade, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other North American guidelines have consistently recommended screening for NAFLD and other cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese children, age 9–10 years, due to the high prevalence in children and clear association with early morbidity and mortality; lifestyle modification has been shown to improve histological severity (resolution of NASH and/or improvement in fibrosis) in up to half of children; given the typical absence of pathognomonic signs or symptoms, the only method for detection is screening with noninvasive biomarkers; children may also be incidentally identified during routine laboratory tests or imaging.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in children with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and expert joint perspective 2025 [^0a31b545]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric MASLD — screening approach and primary care roles are outlined: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is the preferred screening test, and routine ultrasound (US) is discouraged as a screening test due to inadequate sensitivity and specificity. The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guidelines recommend MASLD screening for children aged 9 to 11 who have obesity or are overweight with additional risk factors. Historically, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) refrained from issuing formal recommendations on screening in children with obesity due to limited evidence on long-term benefits, but the most recent AASLD pediatric MASLD guidelines recommend ALT as a screening method for children 10 y or older in the presence of cardio metabolic risk factors, family history or severe obesity, with consideration of ultrasound as initial imaging to support the diagnosis of MASLD. Due to the high prevalence of MASLD, many children are diagnosed by primary care providers (PCPs), who play a crucial role in identifying risk, starting initial evaluations (rule out other conditions), performing preliminary assessments, and overseeing ongoing monitoring and lifestyle interventions.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^2151309b]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Steatotic liver disease (SLD) schema and subcategories — SLD, diagnosed histologically or by imaging, has many potential etiologies, with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and an overlap category with alcohol intake (MetALD) comprising the most common causes. MASLD is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis in conjunction with one cardiometabolic risk factor (CMRF) and no other discernible cause; persons with MASLD and steatohepatitis will be designated as metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH [previously NASH]), whereas MASL refers to the presence of MASLD in the absence of steatohepatitis. Within MetALD there exists a continuum across which the contribution of MASLD and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) will vary, and limits have been set for alcohol consumption as weekly intake 140–350 g female, 210–490 g male (average daily 20–50 g female, 30–60 g male). Multiple etiologies of steatosis can coexist, and other causes of SLD need to be considered separately given their distinct driving factors. If there is uncertainty and the clinician strongly suspects metabolic dysfunction despite the absence of CMRF, early MASLD may be considered pending additional testing (eg, HOMA-IR and oral glucose tolerance tests), and an affirmative diagnosis allows for the coexistence of other forms of liver disease with MASLD.

Concomitant with the evolving guidelines, there is a need to direct and spread awareness among practicing diabetologists to identify and screen high-risk individuals for MASLD for timely management. Its asymptomatic nature and the evolving guidelines on diagnosis have hindered the precise estimates of MASLD in the high-risk group of individuals in a clinical setting. Therefore, an expert panel of diabetologists from India convened to review, discuss and document the approach towards screening, diagnosis and management of MASLD. Serum biomarkers, simple non-invasive tools and imaging techniques could direct the risk stratification of the patients. Early lifestyle interventions including weight loss and exercise are beneficial. The pharmacological landscape of drugs directed to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and fibrogenesis pathways for the management of MASLD is expanding. In summary, the consensus statements are expected to serve as a useful guide in the screening and management of MASLD in the region and to direct a well-planned study design that could enhance the scientific value of these statements.

### Cardiovascular assessment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^96b9bb38]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), represents a growing global health concern, affecting over 25% of adults worldwide. The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic steatosis to advanced metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which predisposes individuals to severe complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. MASLD shares a complex pathophysiological overlap with cardiovascular disease (CVD), with both conditions influenced by common risk factors, such as insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. These shared mechanisms, including impaired glucose metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular inflammation, significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular events in MASLD patients. Moreover, racial and ethnic disparities further complicate the management of MASLD and CVD, highlighting the need for tailored screening and intervention strategies. This review explores the intertwined relationship between MASLD and CVD, focusing on their shared risk factors, mechanisms, and the importance of integrated, multidisciplinary care to mitigate the elevated cardiovascular risks in this high-risk patient population. Early diagnosis, effective risk stratification, and comprehensive management are crucial for reducing long-term morbidity and mortality in patients with MASLD.

### Machine learning identifies metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in patients with diabetes mellitus [^257ee24d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases; its prevalence has grown over recent decades and it now affects approximately 30% of adults globally. Because NAFLD does not take into account all underlying pathophysiologic conditions, Eslam et al proposed in 2020 to replace this terminology with metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), as this highlighted the metabolic abnormalities in the condition. However, MAFLD still seemed to stigmatize patients with the term fatty and raised concerns related to mixing etiologies. Therefore, the Delphi consensus recently changed the nomenclature again and proposed metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

One of the most important metabolic diseases among comorbidities associated with liver steatosis is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is also one of the criteria for MASLD classification. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD (the prevalence of MASLD is not known yet since the term was introduced in June 2023) in patients with T2DM, the diagnosis is often unrecognized in clinical practice, and current risk prediction is suboptimal. The European Associations for the Study of the Liver, Diabetes and Obesity (EASL, EASD, EASO) recommended screening patients with T2DM for the presence of NAFLD because of high risk of disease progression and its associations with an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality in the long-term. Since CV disease (CVD) is a more common cause of death than liver disease in patients with NAFLD, early diagnosis is important. For the detection of liver steatosis, ultrasound is the recommended first-line diagnostic method. However, it may be difficult to encourage every patient suspected of MASLD to undergo it. The diagnostic process could be streamlined if patients are informed that new technology or refined risk stratification suggests that they are at elevated risk for liver steatosis and thus increased CV risk.

Such new technology is machine learning (ML), which may quickly analyze the most discriminative predictors differentiating patients with and without diseases, refining risk stratification. Recently, we demonstrated that a ML approach based on easy-to-obtain parameters can accurately identify patients with DM at a high risk of new CV events and MAFLD patients with prevalent CVD. Such an approach in clinical practice can help identify patients who are at risk of MASLD, who could then be targeted for detailed liver examinations for confirmation. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study performed to develop ML models for assessing the risk of MASLD occurrence in a well-profiled cohort of patients with DM.

### Management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-an expert consensus statement from Indian diabetologists' perspective [^89be1fa1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent pathophysiology studies have linked obesity, dietary composition, ethnicity and genetic factors to the risk of NAFLD. In 2020, an international consensus panel proposed the term 'Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD)'. This terminology encompassed liver disorders regardless of an individual's alcohol consumption pattern and amount. Later on in 2023, taking cognizance of the stigmatization associated with the term 'fatty', the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) introduced the term 'Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)'. Figure 1 illustrates the progression of nomenclature over the years, leading to the new nomenclature, MASLD. The concept of MASLD has evolved, reflecting on 'the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome'. The diagnosis of MASLD first requires exclusion of liver disorders stemming from secondary causes with evidence of hepatic steatosis (> 5%) along with the presence of at least one of five cardiometabolic criteria: overweight/obesity, prediabetes/diabetes mellitus (DM), high triglycerides, low high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) or hypertension. While the term NAFLD limited the focus primarily to gastroenterologists, MASLD broadens the scope for involvement of other healthcare practitioners (HCPs), encouraging collaborative efforts to enhance patient awareness, screening and detection. Given that DM significantly heightens the risk of developing MASLD, diabetologists play a crucial role in the prevention, early diagnosis and management. Research has shown a bi‐directional relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and MASLD, with insulin resistance as a crucial factor in the pathophysiology of both disorders. An association of visceral fat and physical inactivity with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance has been shown in several epidemiological studies from India. Oxidative stress has also been shown to be independently associated with NAFLD in India. The growing prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in India also calls for a population‐wide screening and investigation of MASLD.

MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.

Liver biopsy finds its most robust utility in the context of clinical research, particularly in its capacity to assist with the identification of histological endpoints in therapeutic intervention trials. A recognized knowledge deficit exists in the field concerning the validation of noninvasive assessments for monitoring the progression of MASH/MASLD in addition to the ability of noninvasive assessments to accurately prognosticate disease. Following guidance Food and Drug Administration and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/ European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), patients typically enrolled in phase II and phase III trials depend upon a definite histologic diagnosis of MASH and identification of "at-risk" status with a NAS ⩾4. – Most trials typically enroll patients with biopsy-confirmed F2 or F3 fibrosis, and recognizing the potential for variability in interpretation, they often involve central pathologist review or consensus by a pathology adjudication committee comprising at least two pathologists to ensure precise scoring. Histologic outcomes are typically used as surrogate endpoints as liver-related mortality correlates with increasing fibrosis; particularly evident in cirrhosis (F4), while even F3 and F2 stages show significantly elevated mortality compared to minimal or absent fibrosis (F1 or F0). Consequently, histological examination becomes crucial for identifying patients with MASH at the F2 and F3 stages, where potential trial interventions could demonstrate clinical benefits. This underscores the importance of liver biopsy in clinical research, as opposed to relying solely on noninvasive assessments.

### Management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-an expert consensus statement from Indian diabetologists' perspective [^4a3b7b67]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2 PURPOSE OF THIS CONSENSUS

The increasing trend in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and the associated risk of MASLD emphasizes the need to identify and screen the high‐risk group of individuals to initiate timely management. Concomitant to the evolving definitions and the lack of guidelines for uniformity in the diagnostic criteria, the prevalence data of MASLD lack accuracy. Epidemiological studies from different countries, including India, report varying estimates influenced by diverse clinical symptoms, stages of disease manifestation and differences in the diagnostic modalities (Tables 1 and 2).

TABLE 1
Prevalence estimates of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) across the globe.

TABLE 2
Indian prevalence estimates of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

In essence, the underreporting of prevalence might have underestimated the realistic burden of MASLD, especially in the high‐risk group of individuals in India. Therefore, a panel of diabetologists and endocrinologists from India convened to review the risk factors of MASLD and strategies to prevent and manage the condition in individuals at risk. The idea was to obtain consensus statements intended to serve as useful guidance for healthcare professionals in India from a diabetologists' perspective, specifically in the screening, management and clinical research of MASLD. In this paper, the terms NAFLD and MASLD have been used interchangeably in the context of discussion to reflect the time when specific guidelines or criteria were defined.

Also, this year, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) published a joint guideline providing an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. MASLD, previously termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD is broad and includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Guidelines recommend screening for MASLD with liver fibrosis either in individuals with T2D; abdominal obesity and ≥ 1 additional metabolic risk factor(s); or abnormal liver function tests. A strategy for non-invasive assessment of the risk for advanced fibrosis and liver-related outcomes is proposed. The amount of alcohol intake, the drinking pattern, and the type of alcohol consumed should be assessed in all individuals with SLD using a detailed medical history, psychometric instruments, and/or validated biomarkers. In addition to dietary and lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic treatment of comorbidities is recommended. Preferred options for the treatment of comorbidities are GLP-1 RAs, tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 RA), SGLT2is, metformin or insulin (in case of decompensated cirrhosis) for T2D; statins for dyslipidemia; and GLP-1 RAs, tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 RA) for obesity. For fibrosis stages F2/F3, treatment with resmetirom, a liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist, is recommended. Resmetirom has been approved as a MASH-targeted therapy in the US, while its approval in Europe is pending. Bariatric surgery is also an option for individuals with MASLD and obesity.

### Key takeaways from the updated multidisciplinary European MASLD guidelines [^c970683b]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The new European clinical practice guidelines from three scientific societies (European Association for the Study of the Liver, European Association for the Study of Diabetes and European Association for the Study of Obesity) on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) provide detailed recommendations on diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring strategies, treatment and prevention. Lifestyle interventions (eg, weight reduction, Mediterranean diet, exercise, alcohol abstinence) and the treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors continue to be the mainstay of treatment and prevention of the disease. Incretin mimetics that are approved to treat obesity and/or type 2 diabetes such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have benefits for ameliorating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Novel developments include adapted strategies for screening (case finding) using non-invasive tests (NITs) with a focus on detecting fibrosis or cirrhosis, risk-adjusted monitoring of MASLD by NITs as well as the recommendation to use, if locally approved, the thyroid hormone receptor β-agonist resmetirom in patients with non-cirrhotic MASH fibrosis (≥ F2 stage).

The overarching term steatotic liver disease (SLD) — The overarching term of steatotic liver disease (SLD) was chosen to classify individuals with hepatic steatosis due to various etiologies, and the Delphi panel recommended the term steatosis in lieu of the term fatty because the latter was considered to be stigmatizing. Hence, the overarching term and its derivatives were based on steatotic liver disease, and the term encompasses MASLD and a new overlap category that includes individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs) and a spectrum of alcohol consumption (metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease, MetALD), while continuing to recognize other causes of hepatic steatosis including alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).

### A new definition for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement [^c5f55c0c]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of other chronic liver diseases including "excess" alcohol intake has until now been necessary to establish a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, given our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MAFLD and its rising prevalence, "positive criteria" to diagnose the disease are required. In this work, a panel of international experts from 22 countries propose a new definition for the diagnosis of MAFLD that is both comprehensive and simple, and is independent of other liver diseases. The criteria are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis, in addition to one of the following three criteria, namely overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. We propose that disease assessment and stratification of severity should extend beyond a simple dichotomous classification to steatohepatitis vs. non-steatohepatitis. The group also suggests a set of criteria to define MAFLD-associated cirrhosis and proposes a conceptual framework to consider other causes of fatty liver disease. Finally, we bring clarity to the distinction between diagnostic criteria and inclusion criteria for research studies and clinical trials. Reaching consensus on the criteria for MAFLD will help unify the terminology (e.g. for ICD-coding), enhance the legitimacy of clinical practice and clinical trials, improve clinical care and move the clinical and scientific field of liver research forward.

Research insights

What is currently known about this topic?
Type 1 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), despite attaining optimal glycaemic control. Metabolic comorbidities might contribute to this ASCVD risk.

What is the key research question?
Is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) an ASCVD risk factor in people with type 1 diabetes?

What is new?
This study is the first to both link prevalence of atherosclerotic ASCVD with MASLD, and to link risk of fatal/non-fatal ASCVD with MASLD.

How might this study influence clinical practice?
MASLD guidelines have recommended to screen for MASLD in certain populations, but have explicitly mentioned lack of evidence in people with type 1 diabetes. This study provides insights that can lead to improved management strategies for people with type 1 diabetes.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with diabetes: the need for screening and early intervention. A consensus report of the American diabetes association [^8ceb2e31]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a growing but often unrecognized medical problem for people with diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes, especially when associated with obesity). Liver health has not been at the forefront of complications tracked for disease prevention, as traditionally done for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy. However, liver steatosis affects approximately two out of three people with type 2 diabetes and places them at an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall liver-related mortality. MASLD is also associated with extrahepatic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and negatively impacts health-related quality of life. However, most individuals and their health care professionals remain unaware of the severe hepatic or extrahepatic health risks associated with MASLD and the need for early identification. In recognition of this knowledge gap and the rising prevalence of MASLD, this consensus report is a call to action to screen for liver fibrosis and risk stratify people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, in particular if obesity is also present. This consensus report explains the rationale for the recent MASLD nomenclature change, how to best risk stratify, current treatment and long-term monitoring options, the value of an interprofessional approach to disease management, and the impact of alcohol intake on liver health. More awareness about the health risks associated with MASLD and broad adoption of screening for liver fibrosis as a new standard of care hold promise for a future without cirrhosis for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

### Cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health: recommendations in screening, diagnosis, and management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in cardiovascular disease via modified Delphi approach [^303386d3]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a new awareness of the widespread nature of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its connection to cardiovascular disease (CVD). This has catalyzed collaboration between cardiologists, hepatologists, endocrinologists, and the wider multidisciplinary team to address the need for earlier identification of those with MASLD who are at increased risk for CVD. The overlap in the pathophysiologic processes and parallel prevalence of CVD, metabolic syndrome, and MASLD highlight the multisystem consequences of poor cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health. Metabolic dysfunction and associated insulin resistance, together with the predilection for ectopic fat deposition in the liver and surrounding tissues, are associated with elevated risk of endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response, and ectopic fat deposition in the epicardium. This complex pathophysiology can accelerate atherogenic dyslipidemia, atherogenesis, diastolic dysfunction, valvular calcification, and cardiac arrhythmias. Despite the mounting evidence of mechanistic pathways underpinning MASLD and CVD, current recommendations have not clearly focused upon MASLD as a risk factor or target for intervention in CVD. We have brought together a diverse range of international experts committed to promoting cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health and related outcomes across the globe. The overarching goal of this document is to offer a construct for clinicians in the cardiovascular field with regards to (1) diagnosis and screening of MASLD through the use of noninvasive serum and imaging tests; (2) screening for CVD in all individuals with MASLD regardless of established atherosclerotic risk factors; and (3) the approach to management of MASLD with respect to prevention of CVD through lifestyle, as well as pharmacologic and surgical strategies. To achieve this, the modified Delphi method was applied and a series of evidence-based quality standard recommendations have been identified.

Given the limitations of currently available imaging screening methods (ultrasound, CAP, and MRI), we recommend continuing to use serum ALT levels for MASLD screening, with the validated and most optimal cut-offs for detection of MASLD in youth 10 years of age and older being (ALT) levels > 22 U/L for females and > 26 U/L for males. Children incidentally found to have hepatic steatosis on imaging should also be screened for liver disease by obtaining serum aminotransferase levels, and children under 10 years of age may also be considered for screening if they are being evaluated or treated for overweight or obesity, if they exhibit cardiometabolic risk factors, or have a family history of MASLD. Optimal ALT thresholds for the detection of MASLD are less validated in younger children < 10 years, and a threshold of ALT > 30 U/L has been used in population-based studies. There are currently no data supporting the use of imaging methods for clinical screening for MASLD in at-risk youth, and current imaging techniques are limited or costly, precluding their use for MASLD screening outside of a research study.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^5b757972]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with MASLD, lifestyle changes, EASD/EASL/EASO 2016 guidelines recommend to offer aerobic exercise or resistance training to effectively reduce liver fat tailored based on the patient's preferences to be maintained in the long-term.
