## Question

diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency without anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency without anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining iron deficiency without anemia and why it matters clinically. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and how inflammation alters ferritin interpretation. Next, I will review first-line treatment with oral iron, including dosing, timing, and adherence strategies. After that, I need to check indications for intravenous iron and preferred formulations. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and how to integrate emerging guidance and evidence gaps into practice.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its significance. Iron deficiency without anemia is a state in which iron availability is insufficient to meet physiologic needs despite a normal hemoglobin concentration, and it can cause fatigue, impaired cognition, reduced exercise tolerance, and worsening of comorbid disease even before anemia develops, which is why recognizing and treating it can improve quality of life and outcomes in chronic disease states [^1149vZHG].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds because inflammation confounds ferritin. In adults without inflammation, ferritin less than about 30 ng/mL indicates absolute iron deficiency, whereas in inflammatory states ferritin up to 100 ng/mL may still be consistent with iron deficiency; transferrin saturation less than 20 percent supports reduced iron availability and helps distinguish absolute from functional deficiency, and in CKD or heart failure, expert groups often use ferritin less than 100 ng/mL or TSAT less than 20 percent as diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency even without anemia [^116WBw1N] [^1128644A] [^11541yGz].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of additional markers. When ferritin is equivocal or inflammation is suspected, transferrin saturation and, if needed, soluble transferrin receptor can refine the diagnosis; in IBD, for example, ferritin less than 30 ng/mL in quiescent disease or less than 100 ng/mL in active disease, together with TSAT less than 20 percent, supports iron deficiency, and in perioperative or CKD contexts, ferritin 30–100 ng/mL with low TSAT suggests iron-restricted erythropoiesis that may benefit from iron therapy [^111n1hRb] [^112L9fB4] [^114stzej] [^11541yGz].

> I need to ensure I anchor the treatment goal. The objective is to restore iron stores and normalize iron indices rather than to raise hemoglobin, since hemoglobin is already normal; clinically, that translates to repleting ferritin and achieving TSAT above about 20 percent, while monitoring for symptom improvement and tolerability of therapy [^116WBw1N] [^11189XPC].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy. Oral iron remains the initial approach for most nonpregnant adults with iron deficiency without anemia; typical dosing uses 40–65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day, with every-other-day regimens potentially improving absorption by mitigating hepcidin-mediated inhibition, and pairing with vitamin C can enhance uptake; I initially thought divided doses might be better, but wait, newer guidance favors once-daily or alternate-day dosing to maximize absorption and tolerability, so I should correct that assumption and align with current practice [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9] [^117G1BYP].

> Let me consider adherence and side effects because they drive failure. Gastrointestinal intolerance is common and leads to discontinuation in roughly half of patients; strategies include lower dose, alternate-day dosing, switching formulations, or short-term use of IV iron to bridge, and I should confirm that patients are actually taking the iron away from calcium, PPIs, and coffee or tea to avoid absorption inhibitors [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9].

> I should double-check when to escalate to intravenous iron. Indications include intolerance or nonadherence to oral iron, failure of ferritin to rise after a 4–8 week oral trial, conditions that impair absorption such as active IBD, post-bariatric anatomy, or persistent blood loss, and when a rapid correction is desired; modern IV formulations allow 1–2 infusions to replete stores with very low anaphylaxis risk, though infusion reactions can occur and are usually manageable as complement activation–related phenomena [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9] [^1177mVnZ].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD, heart failure, or IBD. In CKD, iron deficiency without anemia is common and contributes to symptoms; guidelines suggest considering oral or IV iron to improve symptoms such as restless legs when ferritin is low or TSAT is low, balancing infection risk and individual patient factors; in heart failure, correcting iron deficiency can improve functional capacity even without changing hemoglobin; in IBD, IV iron is often preferred when disease is active or oral iron is not tolerated, with retreatment triggers such as ferritin less than 100 ng/mL or hemoglobin below about 12–13 g/dL prompting re-dosing [^116ezqs9] [^1149vZHG] [^115VPcNR] [^114k8Tww].

> I will now examine pregnancy, where the evidence base is evolving. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening or treatment of iron deficiency without anemia in pregnancy, yet many clinicians treat when ferritin is low given physiologic demands and potential neurodevelopmental risks; if treated, typical oral doses of 20–65 mg elemental iron daily are used, with IV iron reserved for intolerance or failure, and ongoing research aims to clarify thresholds and outcomes in screen-detected, asymptomatic populations [^115UYDZG] [^114QHjnG] [^115AkUP8] [^116j2MUD].

> Let me verify monitoring and response. For oral therapy, reassess ferritin and TSAT in about 4–8 weeks and continue until ferritin reaches roughly 50 ng/mL and TSAT exceeds 20 percent, then maintain with intermittent dosing if risk persists; for IV therapy, a single 1,000–1,500 mg dose or two smaller doses often suffice, with reassessment of ferritin and TSAT in 4–8 weeks; clinically, I should also ask about fatigue, restless legs, and exercise tolerance to ensure symptomatic benefit [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9] [^116WBw1N].

> Hold on, I should verify the etiologic workup so we do not miss ongoing losses. Even when hemoglobin is normal, unexplained iron deficiency warrants evaluation for sources of chronic blood loss and malabsorption; in men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy is indicated to exclude malignancy; in premenopausal women, heavy menstrual bleeding should be assessed; and in all patients, consider celiac disease and H. pylori when no other source is identified, as treating these can correct iron deficiency [^116YwJpN].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. There is no universal consensus on ferritin thresholds across all populations, limited high-quality data on treating iron deficiency without anemia in many chronic diseases, and ongoing debate about screening in pregnancy; emerging guidance emphasizes individualized decisions, shared decision-making, and pragmatic use of IV iron when oral therapy fails or is unsuitable, which I should integrate into shared care plans [^116Nz14H] [^115UYDZG] [^114QHjnG].

> In summary, I should confirm that the practical approach is to diagnose iron deficiency without anemia using ferritin and TSAT with inflammation-aware thresholds, start with oral iron using once-daily or alternate-day dosing and optimize absorption, escalate to IV iron for intolerance or inadequate response, tailor management to comorbidities such as CKD, heart failure, IBD, and pregnancy, monitor ferritin and TSAT to guide repletion, and investigate underlying causes to prevent recurrence, adjusting therapy to patient preferences and clinical context [^116Nz14H] [^116WBw1N] [^113xmMC9] [^115bHVQo].

Iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) is defined by **low ferritin with normal hemoglobin** [^116WBw1N], and is common in women, adolescents, and those with chronic disease or malabsorption [^111sFJG3]. Diagnosis relies on **ferritin < 30 ng/mL** in the absence of inflammation, or < 100 ng/mL with inflammation, plus TSAT < 20% [^116Nz14H] [^1128644A]. IDWA causes fatigue, cognitive impairment, and reduced performance [^116WBw1N]; treat with **oral iron** (ferrous sulfate 325 mg every other day) [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9] for 3 months, reassessing ferritin and TSAT at 4–8 weeks. Use IV iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated, and always address the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^1177mVnZ] [^116Nz14H].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

IDWA is a state of **insufficient iron supply without anemia**, with ferritin < 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation, or < 100 ng/mL with inflammation, and TSAT < 20% [^116Nz14H] [^1128644A]. It is common in women of reproductive age, adolescents, and patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, malabsorption, or chronic blood loss [^111sFJG3]. IDWA impairs oxygen delivery, mitochondrial function, and neurotransmitter synthesis, causing fatigue, cognitive deficits, and reduced exercise capacity even when hemoglobin is normal [^116WBw1N].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory evaluation

### Primary laboratory tests

- **Serum ferritin**: Most sensitive marker of iron stores; < 30 ng/mL indicates absolute iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation; in inflammatory states, < 100 ng/mL suggests iron deficiency [^116Nz14H] [^1128644A].

- **Transferrin saturation (TSAT)**: Reflects iron availability; < 20% supports iron deficiency [^116Nz14H] [^1128644A].

- **Hemoglobin**: Normal in IDWA, distinguishing it from iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^116WBw1N].

---

### Additional tests (if needed)

- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Helps distinguish absolute from functional iron deficiency in inflammatory states [^1128644A].

- **Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)**: Elevated in iron deficiency; useful when ferritin is equivocal or inflammation is present [^115LH3LE].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: May show microcytosis or increased RDW even with normal hemoglobin [^117DEawE].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

IDWA presents with **nonspecific symptoms** that often overlap with other conditions:

- **Fatigue and reduced stamina**: Common and often debilitating [^116WBw1N].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Poor concentration, memory deficits, and decreased academic performance [^11644usu].

- **Neuromuscular symptoms**: Restless legs, paresthesia, and muscle cramps [^116WBw1N].

- **Hair and nail changes**: Hair loss, brittle nails, and koilonychia [^notfound].

- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased susceptibility to infections [^notfound].

---

## Underlying causes and risk factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Dietary factors | - Poor iron intake <br/> - Strict vegetarian/vegan diets <br/> - Restrictive eating [^112sB6Gi] |
| Malabsorption | - Celiac disease <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease <br/> - Gastric bypass surgery <br/> - Helicobacter pylori infection [^116wrM29] |
| Chronic blood loss | - Heavy menstrual bleeding <br/> - Gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g. peptic ulcer, malignancy) <br/> - Hookworm infestation [^111sFJG3] |
| Chronic diseases | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Chronic heart failure <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Cancer [^115LH3LE] |
| Physiological states | - Pregnancy <br/> - Adolescence <br/> - Rapid growth [^11644usu] |

---

## Treatment strategies

### Oral iron supplementation

- **First-line therapy**: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg every other day (alternating-day dosing improves absorption and tolerability) [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9].

- **Duration**: Continue for 3 months to replete stores, then reassess ferritin and TSAT [^116Nz14H].

- **Adjuncts**: Vitamin C can enhance absorption; avoid calcium, PPIs, and fiber with doses [^113xmMC9].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy

IV iron is indicated for **oral intolerance**, malabsorption, severe symptoms, or failure of oral therapy after 4–8 weeks [^116Nz14H] [^116wp4dY]. Modern formulations (ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose) are effective and safe, with low anaphylaxis risk [^116Nz14H] [^113xmMC9].

---

### Addressing underlying causes

Identifying and treating the cause — such as menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption, or chronic disease — is essential to prevent recurrence [^115bHVQo] [^116wrM29].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess ferritin and TSAT at **4–8 weeks** to confirm repletion and adherence [^116Nz14H]. Continue monitoring every 3–6 months after correction to detect recurrence, especially in high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated IDWA can progress to **IDA** and cause significant morbidity [^116WBw1N]. It is associated with impaired cognition, neurodevelopmental deficits, and reduced quality of life [^11644usu]. In chronic diseases, it worsens outcomes and increases mortality risk [^1149vZHG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: IDWA is common; treat to prevent progression to IDA and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes [^116j2MUD].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Functional iron deficiency is common; IV iron may be preferred in select patients [^115RRCTu].

- **Pediatric population**: IDWA impairs growth and neurodevelopment; early detection and treatment are critical [^11644usu].

---

Iron deficiency without anemia is a **clinically significant condition** with measurable symptoms and functional impairment. Accurate diagnosis using ferritin and TSAT, followed by oral iron therapy and correction of the underlying cause, is essential to restore iron stores and prevent progression to anemia and its complications [^116Nz14H].

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^1159a5aK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1149vZHG]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^117G1BYP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

Abstract

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease‐specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^116j2MUD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^116YwJpN]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is common worldwide. In adult patients without inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 45 ng/mL or ferritin level of 46 to 99 ng/mL plus a transferrin saturation of less than 20% is diagnostic of iron deficiency. In patients with inflammation, a ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL is diagnostic. Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include low socioeconomic status, female sex, age younger than 5 years, and chronic inflammation. Underlying causes should be investigated. Recurrent blood loss is responsible for 94% of cases. In younger patients with a plausible cause of iron deficiency anemia (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding), a reasonable approach is to treat the bleeding and provide iron supplementation. In men and postmenopausal women, bidirectional endoscopy should be performed. Noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori infection and celiac disease is recommended because both are common causes of iron deficiency anemia. Oral iron replacement is the first-line treatment for most patients. However, intravenous iron is recommended in patients with heart failure to increase exercise capacity. Every-other-day dosing of oral iron improves absorption. Approximately 50% of patients have decreased adherence due to adverse effects. Patients taking oral iron therapy should be evaluated for response in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who cannot tolerate oral iron or do not have adequate response should receive intravenous iron. Hypersensitivity to newer formulations of intravenous iron is rare (less than 1%).

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

### Iron deficiency: a concise review [^114q2zV3]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a major worldwide health problem. There is recent evidence that the anemia is only the last manifestation of the syndrome and that symptoms occur before the anemia is manifest. Advances in outlining the physiology of iron deficiency have been made, gaps remain in the current understanding. While oral iron supplement remains the mainstay, some indications for the intravenous administration have developed. This review will highlight the epidemiology, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^116gjUwx]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia characterized by partial or complete resistance to oral iron supplementation, caused by elevated plasma hepcidin levels resulting from pathogenic variants in the TMPRSS6 gene. Although intravenous iron supplementation is often effective, patient responses can vary significantly due to various factors, and potential side effects of this treatment remain unclear. Additionally, evidence-based international guidelines for diagnosing and managing IRIDA are lacking. This review aims to provide patient-tailored treatment strategies, informed by case studies and expert opinion, to address the specific therapeutic needs of both children and adults with IRIDA.

Results of recent basic research support the concerns that iron-deficiency anemia and iron deficiency without anemia during infancy and childhood can have long-lasting detrimental effects on neurodevelopment. Therefore, pediatricians and other health care providers should strive to eliminate iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. Appropriate iron intakes for infants and toddlers as well as methods for screening for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are presented.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115UYDZG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Implementation — screening and supplementation during pregnancy should reflect the evidence gap and clinical judgment, as there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or supplementation during pregnancy for iron deficiency with or without anemia, and in the absence of evidence, clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and whether to provide routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Screening often includes measurement of hematologic indices (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values as proxies of iron deficiency anemia), and an abnormal screening test result may be followed by treatment with iron therapy; supplementation refers to routine provision of low-dose supplemental iron or intake of iron-fortified foods without specifically measuring hematologic indices. Other organizations' guidelines vary, and screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia during pregnancy are common.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^114QnEQf]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

USPSTF research needs — screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are identified as priorities. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of screening (eg, with hemoglobin, hematocrit, or ferritin values) for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal (eg, quality of life or need for transfusion) and infant (eg, low birth weight or preterm birth) health outcomes. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of treatment (eg, oral or intravenous iron) in asymptomatic, screen-detected populations with iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy on maternal and infant health outcomes in settings relevant to US primary care clinical practice. Research is needed to assess the benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons without known iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Management of iron deficiency [^1177mVnZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^111FSCEk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

Within a total of 16 statements, recommendations are made regarding diagnostic measures to screen for iron- and other anemia-related deficiencies regarding the triggers for medical intervention, treatment goals, and appropriate therapies. Anemia is a common cause of hospitalization, prevents physicians from discharging hospitalized patients, and is one of the most frequent comorbid conditions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It therefore needs appropriate attention and specific care.

### Identification and management of iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department [^112GAqCt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in the United States and worldwide. Yet, clinical guidelines for the identification and management of this disorder in the emergency department are lacking.

Objective Of Review

This clinical review examines strategies for identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department, with a focus on the role of oral iron therapy, intravenous iron therapy, as well as red blood cell transfusion. The article highlights both the available evidence on this topic and the need for future research.

Discussion

The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has important clinical implications and, although testing is generally straightforward, it may be under-recognized. The scant literature available describing emergency department practice patterns for iron deficiency anemia suggests there is room for improvement. In particular, intravenous iron may be underutilized and red blood cell transfusions administered too liberally.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency anemia is common and many patients can be treated effectively with oral iron. For selected patients with moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron is safe and more effective than oral iron. Red blood cell transfusions should be used rarely for hemodynamically stable patients with iron deficiency irrespective of hemoglobin levels.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115mg2GW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are some of the most common systemic complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Symptoms such as fatigue, reduced ability to concentrate and reduced exercise tolerance can mimic common symptoms of IBD and can therefore easily be overseen. Furthermore, clinicians tend to see mild to moderate anemia as an inevitable accompaniment of IBD that is sufficiently explained by the underlying disease and does not require further workup. But in contrast to these clinical routines, current guidelines recommend that any degree of anemia in patients with IBD should be further evaluated and treated. Multiple studies have shown that anemia is a main factor for decreased quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD. Correction of anemia, however, can significantly improve the QoL of patients with IBD. It is therefore recommended that every patient with IBD is regularly screened for iron deficiency and anemia. If detected, appropriate workup and treatment should be initiated. Over the last years, a number of new diagnostic tools and treatment options have been developed. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety of newer formulations of intravenous iron in patients with IBD and have compared oral and intravenous iron in various situations. Treatment recommendations have changed and new evidence-based guidelines were developed. However, to date these guidelines are still not widely implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to the need for treatment for every level of anemia in patients with IBD and to provide some practical guidance for screening, diagnostics, treatment and follow up of IDA in patients with IBD following current international guidelines.

### Iron… [^112MJaRK]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

A standard daily dosage of 325 mg of ferrous sulfate, in three divided doses, will provide the necessary elemental iron for patients receiving replacement therapy. Hematocrit levels should show improvement within one to two months of initiation of therapy; however, the serum ferritin level is a more accurate measure of total body iron stores. Adequate iron replacement has typically occurred when the serum ferritin level reaches 50 μg per L. 9–11 Depending on the cause and severity of the anemia, and on whether there is continuing blood loss, replacement of low iron stores usually requires four to six months of iron supplementation. Yet one recent study showed a benefit from replacement therapy persisting for two years. 12 In patients with continuing iron requirements, a daily dosage of 325 mg of ferrous sulfate may be necessary for maintenance therapy. This is, of course, dependent on the amount of iron in the patient's diet.

Use of iron preparations for empiric therapy in patients with undifferentiated symptoms is inappropriate. In many instances, this practice may be detrimental to the patient. For example, iron administration will aggravate the condition of patients with undiagnosed hemochromatosis. 16 The use of folic acid in patients with undiagnosed vitamin B 12 deficiency will produce transient hematologic improvements but will mask the clinical symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency, allowing neurologic deterioration to continue.
17. 6 If the patient does not respond adequately to oral iron supplementation, parenteral treatment with iron dextran should be considered. Specific indications for treatment with parenteral iron include the patient's inability to tolerate oral iron supplements, noncompliance with medication, malabsorption of iron after acid reduction surgery or continued blood loss.

19 The severity of anemia or the desire to correct it quickly do not justify the use of parenteral iron therapy. Regardless of the route of delivery, the red blood cell requires the same length of time to utilize the supplemental iron. 20 Unpredictable absorption and local complications of intramuscular administration make the intravenous route preferable for parenteral iron treatment. Parenteral iron dextran may be administered as a single dose. The total dosage required to replenish body stores is determined by body weight and hemoglobin deficit. The dosage may be calculated using the following formula.

### Clinicolaboratory findings and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in childhood [^114eGsSK]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

One of the major causes of anemia in childhood worldwide is iron deficiency. Its prevalence depends mainly on age, being higher in infancy and adolescence. Its etiology varies, but poor iron diet is considered the commonest causative factor. Better tactics may be needed, like the targeted screening of children who belong to high-risk groups, to eradicate childhood iron deficiency. The amount of the body iron regulates its absorption from the gut through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Early identification of iron deficiency is essential for the prevention not only of anemia but also the numerous and long-term consequences caused by the lack of iron. Many tests are available for the diagnosis of the disease. Some of them seem very promising for the early detection of iron deficiency, but further research is needed before they become widely acceptable in clinical practice. Treatment is based on oral iron salts, which do not have any serious side effects.

### Updates in the management of iron deficiency anemia… [^113e6AoE]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency results from reduced iron intake, absorption, losses or reduced mobilization of iron from bodily stores. Effects of iron deficiency anemia include reduced cognition in children and older adults, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is generally based on deficient iron stores and anemia. A serum ferritin level of < 45 mg/dL is indicative of iron deficiency, demonstrating an 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold is recommended by the American Gastroenterological Association. In patients with an elevated serum ferritin due to inflammation, alternative markers of iron status such as transferrin saturation may be considered. In adults, evaluation of iron deficiency anemia involves noninvasive screening for celiac disease and. Helicobacter pylori infection.

The AGA guidelines additionally recommend bidirectional endoscopy in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency anemia. Endoscopy may also be considered in premenopausal women; however, a trial of oral iron supplementation is a reasonable initial step in these patients in the absence of concerning symptoms. A hemoglobin increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL over 1 month is considered a successful response and supports the diagnosis. In children, mild iron deficiency anemia may be treated initially with oral iron supplementation for 1 month without additional testing. As in adults, an increase of greater than 1. 0 g/dL of hemoglobin over 1 month is considered supportive of the diagnosis. In those who do not respond to empiric treatment, further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding and referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended.

Intravenous iron replacement is typically recommended by the AGA updated guidelines for patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, exhibit poor absorption, or fail to demonstrate improvement with oral iron supplementation. Compared with oral iron, IV iron does not reduce mortality or the need for blood transfusions in adults with iron deficiency anemia, and it may increase the risk of infection, according to a 2022 FPIN Clinical Inquiry.

Current recommendations for treatment

Recommendations for iron supplementation vary according to the guidelines. The NCCN guidelines are mainly for anemic patients receiving ESA, not with ID alone. Intravenous or oral iron is recommended for absolute ID (serum ferritin < 30 ng/ml and TSAT < 20%); failure to correct anemia within 4 weeks should lead to consideration of functional ID. Intravenous iron is recommended in functional ID (serum ferritin 30–500 µg/L and TSAT < 20%) in patients on ESA therapy.

According to ESMO guidelines, ID should be corrected as soon as serum ferritin levels are < 100 µg/L and TSAT is < 20% regardless of anemia. Oral iron treatment can only be considered in patients with absolute ID with ferritin < 30 µg/L and in the absence of an inflammatory state (C‐reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L).

Knowledge gaps

ID remains insufficiently diagnosed in cancer patients and guidelines recommendations are insufficiently applied. Iron therapy is generally considered only a supportive care treatment, combined with ESA in advanced cancer disease. There is a lack of data on ID with or without anemia in the early phases of cancer in patients with adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment. The insufficient use of iron therapy by oncologists may be related to previous concerns and uncertainties regarding iron administration in this setting. Although iron therapy is recommended in patients controlled with antitumor treatment, iron is also considered as a promising target in cancer progression because it facilitates cell proliferation and growth. In addition, blood transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of cancer development. Long‐term studies on the efficacy and safety of iron therapy could help convince oncologists to systematically diagnose and treat ID, especially during the early phase of the cancer disease, thus avoiding the need for ESA or transfusions when anemia is established and more problematic to treat.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^111eJdh2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID), with or without anemia, is associated with many symptoms and complications that have a significant and negative impact on patients. It can increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, impair cognition, and decrease quality of life. The impact on quality of life in particular is substantial and can affect patients physically and emotionally, impairing their cognition and their ability to work. ID can also induce a variety of metabolic changes in the liver. In a study with rats, Kamei et al showed that ID can cause impairment of lipid, glucose and nutrient metabolism, as well as induction of cell apoptosis.

This review focuses on IDA in the group of patients with CLD, as it is a very common finding and can be easily corrected when appropriate. The diagnosis of this condition is not always straightforward, since many of the conventional tests commonly used in the diagnosis of ID are affected by hepatic cell injury.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87?

### Screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: a structured review and gap analysis against UK national screening criteria [^115ENVvW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia in pregnancy is a worldwide problem. The incidence and aetiology vary considerably between low and high-income countries, with iron deficiency considered the most common cause in the latter. Somewhat surprisingly, recent prevalence estimates of maternal anaemia in pregnancy in the UK and other high-income countries, suggest there has been no significant decrease in the prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy in the last decade. The UK prevalence of maternal anaemia in the antenatal period was estimated as 24% in a recent cross sectional study.

There is a spectrum of iron deficiency in pregnancy ranging from iron depletion without anaemia (absent iron stores with a normal haemoglobin concentration) to overt anaemia. Although iron deficiency in pregnancy is, in principle, identifiable, treatable and possibly preventable with iron supplementation, there is uncertainty about its significance as a clinical and public health problem, and whether systematic screening and treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy would improve maternal and infant outcomes.

The UK guidelines that underpin the clinical management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy are summarised in Table 1. There are also a variety of international and national guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organisation, United States of America, Australia and New Zealand has been reviewed elsewhere. Recommendations for current practice in the UK are to assess the mother's haemoglobin concentration at booking and at 28 weeks' gestation and ensure there are systems in place to follow up abnormal results; routine assessment of iron status is not recommended in all women.

Whilst 'screening' for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy is consistently recommended in these guidelines, the approach in practice differs significantly by country. Screening in this review refers to a systematic integrated programme targeting all pregnant women; including testing, diagnosis, treatment, training and quality assurance. As yet, there has been no formal screening programme to implement these recommendations in the UK.

The aim of this analysis was to review the case for screening pregnant women for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia, using, as a framework, the criteria set out by the UK National Screening Committee. Additional objectives were to identify any gaps in the evidence and outline opportunities for further research to answer the question about the case for screening.

### Iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease: updates on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115RRCTu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^114LPdNF]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### Anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel diseases: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^114FrBvq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia coexists with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in up to two-thirds of patients, significantly impairing quality of life. The most common types of anemia in patients with IBD are iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, which often overlap. In most cases, available laboratory tests allow successful diagnosis of iron deficiency, where difficulties appear, recently established indices such as soluble transferrin-ferritin ratio or percentage of hypochromic red cells are used. In this review, we discuss the management of the most common types of anemia in respect of the latest available data. Thus, we provide the mechanisms underlying pathophysiology of these entities; furthermore, we discuss the role of hepcidin in developing anemia in IBD. Next, we present the treatment options for each type of anemia and highlight the importance of individual choice of action. We also focus on newly developed intravenous iron preparations and novel, promising drug candidates targeting hepcidin. Concurrently, we talk about difficulties in differentiating between the true and functional iron deficiency, and discuss tools facilitating the process. Finally, we emphasize the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment of anemia in IBD. We conclude that management of anemia in patients with IBD is tricky, and appropriate screening of patients regarding anemia is substantial.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^116Nz14H]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117DEawE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1112tpdB]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA — for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss.

Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.

IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease — with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.

Iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease — Celiac disease is present in 2% to 6% of asymptomatic patients with IDA; in most patients without another explanation for iron deficiency, anemia will improve after initiation of a strict gluten-free diet without iron supplementation, but up to 20% of patients will remain iron deficient even with strict gluten avoidance. Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

1.9 Expert recommendation

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut‐off values in patients with CHF, CKD or IBD:

Serum ferritin < 100 µg L −1 or TSAT < 20%

If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L −1, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency

Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD (Figures 2, 3, 4). In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis (Figure 3 A, B). Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg L −1 to determine the IBD disease activity. Although laboratory markers are usually sufficient with clinical disease activity markers, other indicators of intestinal inflammation, such as transabdominal ultrasound or endoscopy, may also be used to supplement these assessments.

### Expert consensus on improving iron deficiency anemia management in obstetrics and gynecology in Asia [^115hdDfd]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a major health burden among women in Asia. Key issues in IDA management in Asia are under-diagnosis and under-treatment. The lack of Asia-specific guidelines, and suboptimal utilization of treatment compounds the management of IDA. To address these gaps, a panel of 12 experts in obstetrics, gynecology, and hematology from six regions in Asia convened to review current practices and clinical evidence and provide practical guidance on IDA diagnosis and management in Asian women. The Delphi approach was used to obtain objective opinions and attain consensus on statements pertaining to awareness, diagnosis, and management of IDA. In total, 79 statements attained consensus and are summarized to provide guidance on raising awareness of IDA and approaches for improved diagnosis and treatment of IDA among women in various settings: pregnancy, postpartum, heavy menstrual bleeding, gynecologic cancers, and perioperative care. This clinician-led consensus integrates appropriate recommendations based on clinical evidence and best practices and is intended to guide decision making in the management of iron deficiency/IDA in women. The expert panel raises a call for timely diagnosis and utilization of appropriate treatment, including use of high-dose intravenous iron, stringent blood management, and interdisciplinary collaboration, for optimization of IDA management among women in Asia.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^113xmMC9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.
