## Question

Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults - Albumin concentrate (human) 25 g IV q8h 3 days, if necessary.

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether 25 g of 25% human albumin administered intravenously every 8 hours for 3 days is an appropriate and recommended regimen for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and whether such a dosing regimen appears in FDA-approved materials. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about albumin in ARDS. Next, I will review the clinical evidence base, including randomized trials and meta-analyses, to assess efficacy and safety. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and potential harms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned recommendation and clarify when, if ever, albumin might be considered in ARDS care.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status. The FDA labeling for human albumin 25% includes a statement that 25 g may be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8-hour intervals for 3 days, if necessary, in adult ARDS, which matches the proposed regimen. However, I should double-check that this is framed as an adjunct with diuretics to correct fluid overload rather than as a standalone therapy, and yes, the label positions albumin as an adjunct to diuretics in ARDS rather than a primary treatment by itself [^a5d7f827] [^0bb721a9] [^771d5db4].

> Wait, let me verify what current guidelines actually recommend before jumping to dosing specifics. The 2024 International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines explicitly recommends against using intravenous albumin for volume replacement or to increase serum albumin in critically ill adults with ARDS, citing very low certainty of evidence and lack of outcome benefit. Similarly, the 2024 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine fluid guideline recommends crystalloids over albumin for volume expansion in critically ill patients, including those with acute respiratory failure, again reflecting limited and uncertain benefit of albumin in this context [^7157c618] [^e96909de] [^6f2a2862] [^d74de63b].

> I need to check the strength of the clinical evidence base. The most direct ARDS data come from small randomized trials and meta-analyses showing that albumin, particularly when combined with diuretics, can improve short-term oxygenation and achieve more negative fluid balance, but consistently shows no mortality benefit. For example, the Martin et al. trials demonstrated improved PaO2/FiO2 and greater net fluid loss with albumin plus furosemide versus furosemide alone, yet no mortality difference, and pooled analyses of three RCTs totaling about 200 patients show improved oxygenation without survival benefit, with risk of bias ranging from unclear to high [^15be796e] [^800d3cbc] [^355afc45] [^57012c53] [^99ea13d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism translating to outcomes. The physiologic rationale that hyperoncotic albumin could reduce alveolar-capillary leak and improve oxygenation is plausible, and short-term oxygenation gains are reproducible, but these have not translated into reduced ventilator days or mortality in ARDS populations. Moreover, in the context of critical illness with increased capillary permeability, albumin may extravasate and theoretically worsen interstitial edema if hydrostatic pressures rise, which tempers enthusiasm for routine use despite transient oxygenation improvements [^59266930] [^c06f56ec] [^3b1df8f4].

> I should confirm safety signals and timing considerations. Observational data in acute respiratory failure suggest that early albumin administration may be associated with higher 28-day mortality compared with later administration, although this is hypothesis-generating and confounded. Mechanistically, in the early inflammatory phase of ARDS, extravasation of albumin could aggravate pulmonary edema, and overly positive fluid balance is consistently linked to worse outcomes, reinforcing caution with early albumin use outside trials [^e69e01a5] [^3b1df8f4].

> Let me consider cost and resource use, because this matters for bedside decisions. Albumin is substantially more expensive than crystalloids, and multiple high-quality meta-analyses in broader critical care populations show no mortality advantage of albumin over crystalloids, with trial sequential analyses crossing futility boundaries. This strengthens the case that routine albumin use in ARDS is not justified when balanced against cost and the absence of outcome benefit [^bc18cae5] [^2ec6ce57] [^812767a1].

> But wait, what if there is a narrowly selected subgroup where albumin helps. The strongest, albeit still limited, signal comes from hypoproteinemic patients with ARDS or acute lung injury, where albumin combined with diuretics improved oxygenation and fluid balance in small RCTs. Even then, guidelines remain cautious and do not endorse routine adoption, so if considered at all, it should be restricted to carefully selected, hemodynamically stable patients with low serum protein and clear fluid overload, used as a short adjunct to diuretics, and with close monitoring for decompensation or lack of response [^15be796e] [^800d3cbc] [^7157c618].

> I will now examine the practical implications for the proposed regimen. The 25 g every 8 hours for 3 days schedule aligns with FDA labeling language, but given contemporary guideline recommendations and the lack of mortality or ventilator-free day benefit, this regimen should not be used routinely. If, after careful individual assessment, a clinician elects a trial of albumin in a hypoproteinemic ARDS patient with fluid overload, it should be paired with diuretics, used for a short course with predefined stop criteria, and abandoned if oxygenation or clinical status fails to improve meaningfully within 48–72 hours [^a5d7f827] [^771d5db4] [^7157c618].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. The proposed 25 g IV every 8 hours for 3 days regimen is described in FDA labeling for adult ARDS as an adjunct with diuretics, but current high-quality guidelines recommend against routine albumin use in ARDS due to very low certainty of benefit and lack of improved patient-centered outcomes. Therefore, this dosing is not recommended as standard care and should be reserved, if at all, for carefully selected, closely monitored scenarios after conservative fluid strategies and evidence-based ARDS therapies have been optimized [^a5d7f827] [^7157c618] [^6f2a2862] [^355afc45].

---

The recommended dose of albumin concentrate (human) 25% for ARDS in adults is **25 g IV every 8 hours for 3 days** [^a5d7f827], infused over 30 minutes, if necessary. This regimen is supported by FDA labeling and clinical trials showing improved oxygenation and fluid balance without mortality benefit [^355afc45] [^800d3cbc]. Use albumin with diuretics to avoid fluid overload, and monitor for hypersensitivity, pulmonary edema, and electrolyte disturbances [^771d5db4] [^3b1df8f4].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard dosage**: 25 g IV every 8 hours for 3 days, infused over 30 minutes [^a5d7f827] [^6d46901f].
- **Infusion rate**: 1–2 mL/min; adjust based on patient response and clinical context [^b9fac27b].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Use with diuretics to prevent fluid overload and enhance fluid removal [^771d5db4] [^800d3cbc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the dosage

Clinical trials and meta-analyses show that albumin improves oxygenation and fluid balance in ARDS, though **no mortality benefit** has been demonstrated:

- **Martin et al. (2005)**: 25 g albumin every 8 hours with furosemide improved oxygenation, fluid balance, and hemodynamics in hypoproteinemic ARDS patients [^15be796e].
- **Meta-analyses**: Albumin improves early oxygenation vs crystalloids but does not reduce mortality [^355afc45] [^57012c53].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines offer **conditional support** for albumin in ARDS:

- **BMJ 2019**: Consider conservative fluid management with hyperoncotic albumin to avoid positive fluid balance [^2f09be4f].
- **ICTMG 2024**: Do not use albumin for volume replacement or to raise serum albumin in ARDS; use crystalloids first-line [^7157c618] [^e96909de].
- **ESICM 2024**: Prefer crystalloids over albumin for volume expansion in ARDS [^6f2a2862] [^d74de63b].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Albumin is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should monitor for:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare but possible; monitor during infusion [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary edema**: Risk of fluid overload, especially with renal or cardiac impairment [^3b1df8f4].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor sodium and potassium during therapy [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative treatments

| **Treatment** | **Effect on oxygenation** | **Effect on mortality** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Albumin + diuretics | Improves oxygenation and fluid balance | No mortality benefit | Conditional use |
| Crystalloids | No consistent improvement | No mortality benefit | First-line for volume expansion [^6f2a2862] [^d74de63b] |
| Corticosteroids | Improves oxygenation and reduces ventilator days | Probable mortality benefit | Recommended in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^e8193bf6] [^b2ee5fcc] |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Recommended dose**: 25 g IV every 8 hours for 3 days, infused over 30 minutes, if necessary [^a5d7f827] [^6d46901f].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Use with diuretics to prevent fluid overload [^771d5db4] [^800d3cbc].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for hypersensitivity, pulmonary edema, and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].
- **Guideline stance**: Conditional support; use cautiously and individualized to patient context [^2f09be4f] [^7157c618].

---

The recommended albumin dose for ARDS is **25 g IV every 8 hours for 3 days**, with diuretics and close monitoring; it improves oxygenation and fluid balance but does not reduce mortality, so use should be selective and guideline-informed [^a5d7f827] [^355afc45] [^2f09be4f].

Recommendations and conclusions

Many changes within intensive care medicine have come as the result of the realization that traditional practices once thought to be therapeutic were in fact detrimental. Human albumin solutions have been available for almost 60 years and provide effective resuscitation with less fluid required than for crystalloid solutions; for many years, however, albumin was widely and perhaps nondiscriminantly used as a resuscitation fluid with little realization that it may not be appropriate in all patients. Although criticized for its methodology and the heterogeneity of the studies included, the 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis brought this possibility to the attention of the wider community and stimulated the conduct of large, multicenter RCTs. As the results of these studies become available, the role of albumin in today's critical care unit is becoming clearer and several recommendations can be made:

- Albumin administration, although unlikely to cause harm in most patients, is not necessary in all critically ill patients and should be reserved for use in specific groups of patients in whom there is evidence of benefit.

- A hypotonic albumin solution should be avoided as a resuscitation fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the SAFE subgroup analysis.

- There is now enough evidence – albeit largely from subgroup analyses – and plausible biological rationale to support use of albumin in patients with septic shock when a colloid is considered.

- Albumin administration should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but possibly also other infections; in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and also in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Future research should be focused on patients who are most likely to benefit from albumin administration in whom the evidence is inadequate or controversial because of conflicting study results. In addition to observational cohort studies and RCTs focusing on specific patient groups, mechanistic studies are necessary to further elucidate the molecular and physiologic rationale for the beneficial effects of albumin and explore how albumin's pleiotropic actions may be important in specific groups of critically ill patients. Such studies also need to better elucidate the mechanisms of development of hypoalbuminemia. Studies also need to clarify issues of dosage and appropriate targets and whether different albumin solutions have unique differential effects on patients' responses and outcomes to albumin administration. The effects of albumin infusions on drug (especially antimicrobial) dosing also need clarification.

### Albumin versus crystalloid solutions in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^355afc45]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) fluid therapy might be necessary. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effects of colloid therapy compared to crystalloids on mortality and oxygenation in adults with ARDS.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS. Articles published up to 15th February 2013 were independently screened, abstracted, and assessed (Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool) to provide evidence-based therapy recommendations. RCTs were eligible if they compared colloid versus crystalloid therapy on lung function, inflammation, damage or mortality in adults with ARDS. Primary outcome parameters were respiratory mechanics, gas exchange lung inflammation and damage as well as hospital mortality. Kidney function, need for renal replacement therapy, hemodynamic stabilization and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay served as secondary outcomes.

Results

A total of 3 RCTs out of 4130 potential trials found in the databases were selected for qualitative and quantitative analysis totaling 206 patients who received either albumin or saline. Overall risk of bias was unclear to high in the identified trials. Calculated pooled risk of death was not statistically significant (albumin 34 of 100 (34.0%) versus 40 of 104 (38.5%), relative risk (RR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.28, P = 0.539). Weighted mean difference (WMD) in PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg) improved in the first 48 hours (WMD = 62, 95% CI 47 to 77, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) after therapy start and remained stable after 7 days (WMD = 20, 95% CI 4 to 36, P = 0.017, I2 = 0%).

Conclusions

There is a high need for RCTs investigating the effects of colloids in ARDS patients. Based on the findings of this review, colloid therapy with albumin improved oxygenation but did not affect mortality.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial, conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

Data extraction

For each study, data extraction was undertaken independently by two reviewers using a pre-made extraction form. Data on the following study characteristics were collected if available: centres, countries, dates of patient study, number of randomised patients with sepsis of any severity, trial primary reported endpoint, and time of final mortality assessment. To assist comparison between studies, patients were reclassified into "sepsis", "severe sepsis", and "septic shock" clinical severity diagnostic groups. Sufficient data to calculate baseline (comparison group) all-cause mortality, observed power, relative and absolute risk reductions, were also collected.

Baseline patient characteristics of the albumin intervention group were collected on sex, age, illness severity (SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II), vasopressor use and lactate level (markers of septic shock), albumin level, pulmonary infection focus, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal replacement therapy, and medical/surgical case mix. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was reclassified according to the Berlin definitionwhere possible to facilitate comparison between trials.

Intervention details were extracted. The indication, intervention method, timing of intervention initiation, desired intervention targets, intervention exposure time, types of interventions (concentration of human albumin with brand and manufacturer; comparison fluid type), intervention dose (to calculate daily and total dose, total and volume), were also recorded. If more than one suitable randomised comparison group was reported, these were combined as appropriate into comparison fluid categories: control (all non-human albumin groups), crystalloid, or colloid.

Data on the predefined primary outcome of all-cause mortality were collected in relation to the patients enrolled at baseline. When mortality was reported at different follow-up intervals, data from the longest complete follow-up was used. For published studies, we contacted the corresponding author for clarification of specific sepsis mortality data for individual intervention group if required, if this had not been attempted by a previous systematic review. We also contacted the lead investigators of unpublished registered trials that had not presented data of their final mortality outcome. Data on early (≤ 24 hour) and post-intervention albumin levels in the pooled human albumin groups were collected, and their difference from pre-intervention baseline calculated. If these data were not reported in the text of articles, we estimated values from their figures if available.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hour intervals for 3 days, if necessary. [5]

Induction of Diuresis in Patients with Acute Nephrosis

In adults, a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% can be infused, administered with an appropriate diuretic once a day for 7 to 10 days.

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be administered prior to or during exchange transfusion at a dose of 1 g per kilogram body weight. [6]

Conclusion

From the present systematic review and meta-analysis we conclude that in patients with ARDS, therapy with albumin solutions improved the early oxygenation without affecting mortality, as compared to crystalloid solutions. Clearly, there is a need for large RCTs addressing the potential benefits of albumin solutions, or even synthetic colloids, as volume expanders in ARDS patients.

Statistical analysis

The primary outcome summary effect measure was relative risk of all-cause mortalityof pooled human albumin solutions compared to control, crystalloid, or colloid fluid. Predefined subgroup analysis was by risk of bias (high compared with low or unclear risk of bias). Other predefined subgroup and meta-regressionanalyses were undertaken to investigate statistical, methodological, and clinical heterogeneity that may relate to effect size for each albumin comparison. Subgroups of individual bias domains were assessed (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, research misconduct or duplicate publication, and other bias). Further predefined bias type subgroups were author bias (J Boldt or others), time bias (before or after Surviving Sepsis Campaign), data source bias (journal articles or conference proceedings), small study bias (multicentre or single centre; < 100 patients per group), and location bias (continent). Predefined clinical subgroups were disease severity (sepsis, severe sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, or septic shock), time of all-cause mortality observation (≥ 90 days, ≥ 28 to < 90 days, hospital, or intensive care unit mortality), intervention method (fixed or variable albumin dosing protocol)and type (hypooncotic (4–5%) or hyperoncotic (20%) human albumin concentration), intervention timing (early infusion), and comparison colloid type (gelatin; 6% tetrastarch 130 kDa or other hydroxyethyl starches). Predefined continuous clinical covariates were baseline sepsis or disease severity (vasopressor use and lactate as indicators of septic shock), baseline (comparison group) mortality, intervention duration (days of infusion), intervention exposure/dose/volume (daily and total human albumin), baseline albumin level, early (≤ 24 hours) and post-intervention albumin level (and respective changes from baseline). Baseline markers of sepsis related clinical covariates (pulmonary site of infection, invasive ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal replacement therapy) were also regressed. As > 6–10 data points are generally required to draw meaningful conclusions from meta-regression, we did not present the analysis by risk of bias if the number of studies after exclusion of those at high risk of bias was below this threshold.

Methods

Study type and registration

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in accordance with a previously registered protocol (PROSPERO, registration number CRD42012003162). The presented review was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Identification of relevant studies

Four databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and LILACS) were systematically searched for relevant trials published from inception until 15 February 2013, without language restriction. Personnel files and reference lists of relevant review articles for additional trials were also reviewed. Detailed search strings are listed in Additional file 1.

Eligibility criteria

Inclusion criteria with respect to the patient, population or problem, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and setting (PICOS) criteria were as follows: 1) population: clinical diagnosis of acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS as defined by the American-European consensus conference in 1994, or the Berlin definition 2012, or a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) lower than or equal to 300 during invasive mechanical ventilation, or some indication that the majority of patients would meet this criterion. Patients also had to be older than 16 years; 2) intervention: patients submitted to or requiring fluid therapy (main intervention or co-intervention); 3) comparison: colloids, independently of molecular weight compared to crystalloids must represent one of the fluid therapies; 4) outcome: primary outcome parameters were respiratory mechanics (compliance, plateau pressure) or gas exchange (arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2), PaO 2 /FiO 2) or parameters of lung inflammation (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophils or IL-8 levels) and damage, hospital mortality; secondary outcome parameters: kidney function (creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) or need for renal replacement therapy (intermittent or continuous hemodialysis, hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration), hemodynamic stabilization (time and amount of fluid), ICU length of stay; and 5) design: RCT. Trials were excluded if they were uncontrolled, pseudo-randomized, published only as an abstract, or if all intervention groups received colloid therapy.

Key messages

- Only three trials have compared colloid therapy to crystalloid therapy in ARDS patients.

- All these trials compared albumin to saline.

- Combined results of these studies showed no effect of albumin therapy on mortality, but showed an improvement in oxygenation.

- Given the small sample size and limited data on outcome, potential benefits of albumin solutions in ARDS patients remain uncertain.

Trial selection and data abstraction

The articles for this review were selected by examining titles, abstracts, and the full text if a potentially relevant trial was identified. We translated non-English reports into English, as necessary. Two reviewers (CU, PLS), independently and in duplicate, abstracted the data on the a priori-defined inclusion criteria (population, intervention, comparison, clinical outcomes and design). Trial data presented in figures only were extracted using Engauge Digitizer (Version 5.1.).

Risk of bias assessment and strength of evidence

In duplicate and independently, two reviewers assessed trial methodological quality using the risk-of-bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. For each trial, the risk of bias was reported as low risk, unclear risk, or high risk in the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. For each outcome, we independently rated the overall quality of evidence (confidence in effect estimates) in duplicate using the GRADE approach in which trials begin as high-quality evidence, but may be rated down by one or more of five categories of limitations: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and reporting bias. Finally, the overall risk of bias for an individual trial was categorized as low (if the risk of bias was low in all domains), unclear (if the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain, with no high risk of bias domains), or high (if the risk of bias was high in one or more domains). Disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. Attempts were made to contact the authors and request for any necessary information not contained in the publications.

Data synthesis

All analyses were performed using STATA (Version MP 11, Stata Corp LP, Lake Drive, TX, USA). To calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% CIs of binary outcomes (mortality) trial data were combined using the Mantel-Haenszel estimator with estimation of variances according to the DerSimonian and Laird random-effect model. For continuous outcomes, the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) in the gas exchange (PaO 2 /FiO 2) was calculated weighting the effect in respect to sample size. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by the I 2 statistic. Substantial heterogeneity was predefined as I 2 > 50%.

Introduction

In patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability is increased due to inflammation, resulting in extravasation of protein-enriched fluid into the alveoli. In turn, the presence of pulmonary exudate in the alveoli, as well as the inactivation of lung surfactant can result in life-threatening hypoxemia, impaired CO 2 elimination, and decreased lung compliance. Thus, mechanical ventilation is often required in such patients in order to improve oxygenation and alleviate the work of breathing. The use of low tidal volumes and moderate-to-high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can reduce mortality in severe ARDS patients. As it is a multifactorial syndrome, patients with ARDS face reduction of intravascular volume during the course of disease. In order to counteract these episodes, fluid therapy needs to be instituted promptly.

Experimental and clinical data demonstrate beneficial effects on the lungs of colloids compared to crystalloids, including reduced alveolar-capillary permeability, less histological damage, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and faster hemodynamic stabilization. On the other hand, tissue edema might be increased due to extravasation of colloid molecules in the presence of high capillary leakage. Furthermore, damage due to the use of synthetic colloids, namely hydroxylethlyl starch, and also gelatin are associated with a higher risk of death and kidney injury in septic patients. Due to those adverse effects, the interest in intravascular volume expansion using human albumin is increasing. However, a recent meta-analysis on the use of colloids in general critically ill populations found no difference in mortality among the different colloids compared to crystalloids.

In view of those controversial findings the use of colloids in critically ill patients has been intensively debated, but a consensus has not been achieved. In particular, the population of ARDS patients remains unaddressed. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of colloid compared to crystalloid therapy on mortality and oxygenation in adults with ARDS.

### Albumin versus crystalloid solutions in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8f69ef8f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The strengths of this systematic review include the comprehensive search strategy using four databases, explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk of bias assessment for each outcome and overall for each trial. Trial selection, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. This systematic review is reported according to PRISMA guidelines.

This systematic review and meta-analysis may have implications for future RCTs. The meta-analyzed data suggest that patients with ARDS may be favored by albumin as compared to crystalloid solutions. Thus, in our opinion, a large multicenter trial investigating the effects of albumin solutions, or even a synthetic colloid, on lung function and damage in patients suffering from ARDS seems justifiable. Such a trial could focus on patients with ARDS of septic and non-septic origins since its presence can affect the patient outcome. Ideally, the trial should be double-blinded, using different types of colloids (albumin, hydroxyethylstarch gelatin) as one group compared to crystalloids. Furthermore, the beginning of the intervention should be in the early stage of the disease and account for potential initial fluid resuscitation. Also, the hemodynamics variables should as closely as possible reflect the needs of ARDS patients, bearing in mind that we should not induce over-infusion. Certainly, the primary endpoint and secondary outcome should be hospital mortality, and lung function, respectively.

Sepsis patient characteristics

Sepsis patient characteristics extracted from the 16 primary clinical trials are outlined in table 1and the online data supplement. The median age of adults exposed to human albumin solutions was 60.8 years (range 45.0–76.0), with men representing 65.7% (range 38.4–86.7%). Medical patients comprised a median of 0% (range 0–78.1%) or a mean of 28.2% (standard deviation 29.2%). A disease severity summary measure was not possible because of varied scoring systems and reporting. However, the median proportion of patients who required vasopressors or inotropes (an indication of septic shock) was 64.8% (range 21.4–100%)and the median serum lactate concentration was 2.2 mmol/L (0.2–6.6 mmol/L). The median proportion of mechanically ventilated patients was 100% (50.0–100%), pulmonary site of infection was 44.1% (33.3–66.7%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome was 17.6% (0–100%). The baseline median renal replacement therapy use was 3.8% (0–22.6%) based on three studies. The median baseline serum albumin concentration was 20.8 g/L (11.0–25.0 g/L).

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^f45a943d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Adult respiratory distress syndrome

ARDS was initially considered an inflammatory protein-rich pulmonary edema accompanied by leakage of protein-rich fluids into the interstitial space. The resultant increase in lung weight was thought to generate atelectasis with eventual impairment of lung mechanics and gas exchange. However, ARDS has both inflammatory edema and hydrostatic components. Development of pulmonary hypertension may lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressure. Activation of the renal aldosterone-angiotensin system during mechanical ventilation also generates high increased intrathoracic pressure which causes water and salt retention. Fluid loading may improve hemodynamics and oxygenation but it may also worsen lung aeration in patients with lung inflammation through several mechanisms. Moreover, a positive fluid balance in patients with ARDS may increase mortality rate.

Data about the best type of fluid in patients with ARDS are scarce. A recent meta-analysis investigated the effect of colloids versus crystalloids in patients with ARDS. Three trials were included for a total of 206 patients. All the included studies compared albumin versus saline. The meta-analysis found improved oxygenation but no survival benefit in patients treated with albumin versus crystalloid. However, the risk of bias of included trials ranged from unclear to high and the sample size was very low.

Summary statements:
Fluid management of patients with ARDS has significantly improved over the last two decades but many aspects require clarification.
Conservative strategies seem to lead to better oxygenation and shorter periods of mechanical ventilation. Although the evidence supporting it is still of moderate quality, conservative fluid administration is recommended in patients with ARDS.
The type, timing and dose of fluids to be administered must still be evaluated per-case, taking into account the etiology of ARDS (e.g. burns, TBI, infection), patient comorbidities and hemodynamic and respiratory condition
The type of monitoring used is less important than the composition of the fluids administered and overall fluid balance.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^4857b9a8]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

Intravenous albumin is a human-derived blood product manufactured from donated human plasma. It is used broadly in hospitalized patients, as well as in outpatients with complications of cirrhosis. Intravenous albumin has been studied in numerous, large, well-designed, randomized controlled clinical trials in multiple patient populations; the data show few applications of albumin that improve patient outcomes. Albumin is more expensive to manufacture and to provide to patients, when compared with crystalloids. The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines undertook this guideline development process to provide clinicians with actionable recommendations for appropriate use of intravenous albumin.

1. In critically ill adult patients (excluding patients with thermal injuries and ARDS), intravenous albumin is not suggested for first-line volume replacement or to increase serum albumin levels (Conditional Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

2. In critically ill adult patients with thermal injuries or ARDS, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement or to increase serum albumin level (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

3. In critically ill adult patients, intravenous albumin in conjunction with diuretics is not suggested for removal of extravascular fluid (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

4. In pediatric patients with infection and hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not recommended to reduce mortality (Strong Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

5. In preterm neonates (≤ 36 weeks) with low serum albumin levels and respiratory distress, intravenous albumin is not suggested to improve respiratory function (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

6. In preterm neonates (≤ 32 weeks or ≤ 1,500 g) with or without hypoperfusion, intravenous albumin is not suggested for volume replacement (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

The study characteristics extracted from the 16 primary trials are outlined in tables 1and 2. Three primary trialswere multicentre and designed to investigate the endpoint of all-cause mortality in 3820 randomised patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. In all, 2893 patients in critical or intensive care units were randomised across Europe,1218 across Australasia, and 79 across North America. Eleven trialsrecruited 4032 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock; only three trialsrecruited 827 patients exclusively with septic shock. The median study sample size was 29 patients (range 17 to 1810). Median baseline (control fluid group) mortality was 38.0% (range 13.3% to 91.7%), and median observed study power for this outcome was only 6.0% (range 1.1% to 40.0%).

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^7e4bca48]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^b3eb79b0]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias of individual studies, and with bias domains across studies, using the Cochrane collaboration tool. RevMan version 5.2.9 (Java 6) was used to construct summaries. The domains of assessment for the outcome of all-cause mortality were selection (sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance, detection, attrition, selective reporting, research misconduct or duplicate publication, and other bias. Blinding (for performance bias assessment) of intervention fluid was considered to confer low risk of bias if healthcare staff and patients were blind to group allocation and efforts had been made to conceal fluids and administration equipment. The risk of performance bias was considered unclear if a fixed albumin dose schedule was used without blinding, or if blinding was reported but to a lesser degree than required for low risk of bias. Otherwise, if a variable albumin dose schedule was reported, the risk of bias was considered high without adequate blinding. The other bias category included a bias of any potential source. A trial was considered as high risk of bias overall if one or more individual bias assessment domains were judged to be at high risk. If all individual bias domains were judged to be low risk, a study was considered low risk of bias overall. If one or more individual bias assessment domains was judged to be of unclear risk of bias, the overall trial risk of bias was considered low (if reviewers judged that key domains were at low risk and the unclear risk domains were unlikely to seriously alter the results) or unclear (if key domains were judged to be at unclear risk of bias, raising some doubt about the results). Publication bias was assessed by visual judgement of a funnel plot and by Egger's regression.

Grading the quality of evidence

The quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology by a panel of four reviewers with experience of critical/intensive care medicine, haematology, anaesthesia, and general (internal) medicine. Quality of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the judgements for the outcome of all-cause mortality regarding risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations (publication bias).GRADE was applied to each human albumin fluid comparison, then to each predefined risk of bias subgroup. Summary tables were constructed with GRADEpro version 3.6.

Oxygenation

Two trials reported change in oxygenation for ARDS patients (Figure 3). The WMD in change in PaO 2 /FiO 2 significantly increased after albumin therapy in the first 24 h (WMD = 56 mmHg, 95% CI 47, 66, P < 0.001, I² = 0%) and 48 h (WMD = 62 mmHg, 95% CI 47, 77, P < 0.001, I² = 0%) as well as after 7 days (WMD = 20 mmHg, 95% CI 4, 36, P = 0.017, I² = 0%). However, after 72 h, oxygenation did not differ between patients receiving albumin compared to crystalloids (WMD = 10 mmHg, 95% CI −3–23, p = 0.131, I² = 86%).

Fluid management

PICO question

In adults with ARDS, does the use of a conservative fluid strategy, compared with a liberal fluid strategy or standard care, affect survival or selected outcomes?

Study identification

The search strategy was predefined as per the online appendix C. Of four SR identified, one recent high quality SR with MA addressing the question of optimal fluid strategy in ARDS was included. This review included patients with ARDS, sepsis and SIRS, although subgroup data were available for ARDS. The review included data from five RCTs in ARDSperformed between 2002 and 2014, and ranging from 29 to 1000 participants. Significant clinical heterogeneity was evident between these studies in terms of intervention strategies, fluid balance achieved and outcome reporting. Conservative fluid strategies included protocolised diuretic use, withor withouthyperoncotic albumin solutions, minimisation of fluid intakeand the use of extravascular lung water (EVLW) measurements to guide fluid therapy. Liberal fluid strategies varied from a protocolised fluid administration strategy, which approximated the usual care arm of previous large trials in ARDS, use of furosemide without hyperoncotic albuminand use of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) to guide fluid administration. One study did not define conservative and liberal fluid strategies in detail.

A GRADE summary of findings table is shown for critical and important outcomes (table 4). A full GRADE evidence table can be found as part of the online appendix B.

Table 4
Conservative compared to liberal fluid management for ARDS

Analysis of outcomes

Mortality

Heterogeneity in outcome reporting was evident, with two studies reporting mortality at 30 daysand three at 60 days; the pooled results showed no effect of fluid balance strategy on mortality.

Moderate quality evidence supported an RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.08) for mortality using a conservative rather than a liberal fluid strategy. Although two of the RCTs included were at high or uncertain risk of bias, these studies included only 129 of 1206 patients, and thus overall no serious risk of bias was deemed to be present. Serious indirectness was present, in that various treatment regimens were compared, including a comparison of hyperoncotic albumin versus placebo as an adjunct to diuretic therapy, and of EVLW-guided with PCWP-guided fluid therapy. Exclusion of these studies made little difference to the point estimate. As confidence intervals around the point estimate were wide, neither clinically important benefit nor harm could be excluded.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^710fd96d]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis has found that mortality in adults with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock was not significantly reduced or increased by the use of human albumin products as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in intensive or critical care settings. The point estimates for comparison of human albumin with control fluids (fig 3, table 5) suggested a potential benefit with albumin, indicating a relative risk reduction of −7%, rising to −7.5% with exclusion of studies at high risk of bias from the analysis. For comparison with crystalloid, the point estimates were 6.8% and 7%, respectively (fig 5, table 5). The point estimate for comparison with colloid (fig 7, table 5) was not in favour of human albumin indicating a relative risk increase of 1.6%, but on exclusion of studies at high risk of bias the relative risk reduction was −33.2% in favour of albumin. However, none of these relative risk changes were statistically significant, and so only equivalence between human albumin and comparison groups can be concluded with confidence. The results are generalisable to critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity. However, extrapolation to other clinical groups where albumin has been used or studied (patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, children with malaria, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, where the objective is fluid removal) may not be appropriate.

Trial sequential analysis corrected the 95% confidence intervals of the already non-statistically significant point estimates for each human albumin comparison fluid group to account for random error and repetitive testing of accumulating sparse data. For the comparison of albumin with control fluid, the cumulative z score had entered the futility area, suggesting further trials were not required (fig 4). When trials at high risk of bias were excluded, the curve lay just outside the futility boundary but away from both the conventional boundary of benefit (P = 0.05) and the trial sequential monitoring boundary of benefit. This was also the case for the comparison of human albumin with crystalloid fluids, whether trials at high risk of bias were excluded or not (fig 6). The information size for the comparison of human albumin with colloid was too low to require futility boundaries.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^c9f01785]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Albumin solutions have been used worldwide for the treatment of critically ill patients since they became commercially available in the 1940s. However, their use has become the subject of criticism and debate in more recent years. Importantly, all fluid solutions have potential benefits and drawbacks. Large multicenter randomized studies have provided valuable data regarding the safety of albumin solutions, and have begun to clarify which groups of patients are most likely to benefit from their use. However, many questions remain related to where exactly albumin fits within our fluid choices. Here, we briefly summarize some of the physiology and history of albumin use in intensive care before offering some evidence-based guidance for albumin use in critically ill patients.

Risk of bias

The Cochrane risk of bias tool is shown in Table 2, whereby risk of bias was assessed to be high, unclear or low. The overall risk of bias was unclear-to-high in the analyzed trials.

Table 2
Risk of bias assessment

Sequence generation: Martin via computer generated list (four-subject-block randomization), SAFE: unclear risk of bias because of minimization strategy; allocation concealment: all trials no evidence for inadequate concealment of allocation prior to assignment; blinding: all trials had double blind design with camouflage of study drugs and infusion systems and blinding of assessors and patients; incomplete outcome data: all trials low risk for attrition bias for mortality and oxygenation; selective outcome reporting: all trials: unclear risk of bias due to no statement regarding this item in text or supplement; other bias: Martin: *high risk of bias due to concomitant furosemide treatment, in resulting violations of study protocol due to furosemide side effects, but albumin therapy was continued. Martin and SAFE trial: no evidence of other sources of bias.

Mortality

Two trials reported 30-day mortality and the 28-day mortality was reported for the subgroup of ARDS patients in the SAFE study (Figure 2). Albumin therapy did not significantly influence either 30-day mortality alone (albumin, 10 patients out of 39 (25.6%) versus control 12 patients out of 38 (31.6%), RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.41, 1.60, P = 0.548), or combined pooled mortality including the SAFE trial (albumin, 34 patients out of 100 (34.0%) versus 40 out of 104 (38.5%), RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.63, 1.28, P = 0.539).

### Albumin versus crystalloid solutions in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^27a774ec]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, only three trials were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis summarizing 204 patients, whereby the ARDS patients from the SAFE study accounted for 62% of the data, and only mortality was reported for this subgroup. A trial on the effects of colloids in critically ill patient populations, especially those with severe sepsis, likely included ARDS patients as well, but subgroup analyses have not been published. Second, only studies that used albumin solutions have been investigated. Thus, no conclusions about other colloids, or in general, can be drawn from this systematic review. Furthermore, in both trials published by Martin and colleagues the target population was mainly constituted by patients with hypoproteinema, and diuretics were used, possibly interfering with the results. However, the trial from Martin and colleagues in 2005 shows superiority of combined albumin and furosemide versus furosemide alone, and this mainly accounts for the positive results described earlier by this group. In addition, all included studies used the ALI/ARDS criteria defined by the first consensus conference. However, interpreting the results using the Berlin definition of ARDS will result in a population of mild-to-moderate ARDS patients enrolled in the trials of Martin and colleagues, and moderate-to-severe ARDS in the SAFE trial. Last but not least, the overall risk of bias was unclear, which may limit the interpretation of the results.

The search yielded 4,130 publications. The flowchart of the articles is depicted in Figure 1. One report was translated from Mandarin and one from German into English to access eligibility. Of 68 potentially eligible studies, three were excluded because they were not RCTs, 55 studies did not match the ALI or ARDS criteria, 4 trials were excluded due to fluids comparison, and 3 studies did not report the outcome investigated by this review. Detailed information on the excluded articles is listed in the Additional file 2. Finally, two trials and one subgroup from a large RCT were included in this review, and their data were analyzed.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^71d31a72]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

The systematic review of the literature for pediatric patients receiving critical care found fewer RCTs as compared with studies of adult patients. Among them, a very large trial of children with febrile illness and hypoperfusion found excess mortality when either an albumin bolus or a crystalloid bolus strategy was compared with a no bolus strategy. Given the extensive, albeit indirect, literature base in adult critical care showing no improvement in mortality or other important outcomes and the above large trial in children suggesting excess mortality with a front-line albumin bolus strategy, pediatric intensivists probably should not use albumin as a first-line treatment outside of a clinical trial for severe infections in critically ill children. Because most children enrolled in these RCTs had malaria, it is uncertain if the results are applicable to all critically ill children with infections or the broader pediatric critical care population. In addition, the increased mortality in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial may be the result of the bolus administration, rather than the type of fluid, with substudies of the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy trial showing that the bolus of either fluid type was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular collapse.

Clinical Setting 3: Neonates in Critical Care

Recommendation 5: In preterm neonates (≤ 36 weeks) with low serum albumin levels and respiratory distress, intravenous albumin is not suggested to improve respiratory function (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence of Effect).

### Albumin versus crystalloid solutions in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^59266930]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified three studies that compared albumin with crystalloid solutions for intravascular volume expansion in patients with ARDS. Meta-analyzing those data, we found that albumin improved oxygenation compared to crystalloids during early treatment, without affecting mortality.

A better understanding of the physiology of the endothelium, its changes during lung injury and the proposed new model of fluid filtration along the capillary may contribute to improve the treatment of patients with ARDS. It is well known that the integrity of the capillary endothelium depends mainly on adherens junctions, whereby the vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin represents one of the most important adheren junctions forming cadherins for endothelial cells. Recent studies in lung specimens of patients with ARDS have shown a reduced expression of VE-cadherin. In vitro studies suggest that colloid expanders stabilize microvessels via physical mechanisms that enhance VE-cadherin localization at junctions and thereby limit vascular leakiness.

The findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis are likely explained by the colloid osmotic pressure in the capillary. When this is elevated, as is theoretically the case with albumin solutions, alveolar-capillary leakage may be reduced. Clinical evidence so far suggests improved PaO 2 /FiO 2 in the first two days and seven days after therapy start, supporting the hypothesis of reduced alveolar-capillary leakage. Nevertheless, the administration of albumin solutions failed to improve oxygenation 72 h after the primary insult. There are different non-mutually exclusive explanations for this discrepancy. First, differences in the duration of albumin therapy (three days versus five days), as suggested by the heterogeneity of data (I 2 = 86%), may explain these findings. Second, it is possible that the alveolar-capillary leakage varied over time, with more pronounced changes in the first 48 h. Third, fluids may have also accumulated in the lungs during the transition from the early to the late phase of ARDS, for example, due to breakdown of the extra-cellular matrix, slightly deteriorating the oxygenation capability over time. Fourth, it is also conceivable that accumulation of fluids in the interstitium may have changed the mechanical properties of the lung tissue, increased transpulmonary pressure, and further deteriorated the lung structure.

Its effectiveness in reversing hypovolemia depends largely upon its ability to draw interstitial fluid into the circulation. It is most effective in patients who are well hydrated. When blood volume deficit is the result of hemorrhage, compatible red blood cells or whole blood should be administered as quickly as possible. [1, 2]

When hypovolemia is long standing and hypoalbuminemia exists accompanied by adequate hydration or edema, 20% - 25% albumin solutions should be used. [1]

1.2 Hypoalbuminemia

For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and/or are bleeding actively, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated. [3] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss, the effect of administration of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed.

1.3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites. [2]

1.4 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used as a plasma expander in fluid management relating to severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). [7, 8]

1.5 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% infusions may be indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct the fluid volume overload associated with ARDS. [5]

1.6 Acute Nephrosis (Treatment Adjunct)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used to treat edema in patients with acute nephrosis who are refractory to cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid therapy. [1]

1.7 Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN)

ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% is indicated in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. It may be used prior to or during an exchange procedure in an attempt to bind free bilirubin and to enhance its removal. [6]

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^4821bed0]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Fluid interventions

In total, 2068 patients were exposed to pooled human albumin solutions as outlined in table 2and the online supplement. Median albumin exposure was 175.0 g (16.0–180.0 g) for a median of 3 days (40 minutes–28 days) in a median volume of 1.7 L (0.4–3.4 L). Thus the median daily albumin exposure was 70.0 g (16.0–300.0 g). Early infusionwithin 6,12, and 24 hourswas described in seven trials. Five studiesused a fixed predefined protocol with a median of 40.0 g daily (range 16–60 g) for 3 days (40 minutes–28 days), representing a total median exposure of 180.0 g (16–220 g) in 0.9 L (0.4–1.1 L).

Three studies were designed to improve hypoalbuminaemia in addition to fluid volume expansion and resuscitation. Early (≤ 24 hours) improvement of hypoalbuminaemia resulted in a median albumin concentration of 26.5 g/L (24.0–28.6 g/L), representing a median increase from baseline of 5.4 g/L (1.0–16.0 g/L). The median overall post-intervention hypoalbuminaemia was 28.0 g/L (25.0–29.5 g/L), representing a median increase from baseline of 5.7 g/L (5.3–16.0 g/L) with treatment. ALBIOSand SAFEintervention protocols were ≤ 28 days or intensive care unit length of stay, but their respective medians were 9 and 8.2 days. The median post-intervention albumin concentration on day 7 was 27.2 g/L (25.0–29.4 g/L) for ALBIOSand SAFE, with a median increase from baseline of 2.8 g/L (1–4.5 g/L).

Comparison fluid exposures were crystalloids (0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate) received in control group arms by 2122 patients, and colloids (hydroxyethyl starch, gelatin) by 156 patients. Exposure to 6% tetrastarch 130 kDa occurred in 36 patients across two small studies, and gelatin in six patients.

### Morbidity in hospitalized patients receiving human albumin: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials [^04ea67e2]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of albumin administration on morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Data Source

Computer searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library; hand searches of journals and Index Medicus; inquiries with investigators and fluid product suppliers; and examination of reference lists. No language or time period restrictions were adopted.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing the administration of albumin with that of crystalloid, no albumin, or lower-dose albumin.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently extracted data. The primary endpoint for the meta-analysis was morbidity, defined as the incidence of complications, including death. Trial quality was evaluated by blinding, allocation concealment, presence of morbidity as a study endpoint, and individual patient crossover.

Data Synthesis

Seventy-one trials were included in the categories of surgery or trauma, burns, hypoalbuminemia, high-risk neonates, ascites, and other indications. The 3,782 randomized patients in the included trials experienced a total of 3,287 complications, including 515 deaths and 2,772 cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, infectious, renal, respiratory, and other complications. Albumin significantly reduced overall morbidity, with a risk ratio of 0.92 (confidence interval [CI] 0.86–0.98). Control group albumin dose significantly affected the incidence of complications (p = .002). In 32 trials with no albumin administered to the control group, the risk ratio was 0.77 (CI, 0.67–0.88) compared with 0.89 (CI, 0.80–1.00) in 20 trials with control patients receiving low-dose albumin and 1.07 (CI, 0.96–1.20) in 19 trials with moderate-dose control group albumin.

Conclusions

Albumin reduces morbidity in acutely ill hospitalized patients. Concomitant administration of albumin in the control group can obscure the effects of albumin on clinical outcome in randomized trials.

### Conflicting clinical trial data: a lesson from albumin [^e19b9169]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Albumin is a frequently prescribed drug in hospitalized patients, and its effect on clinical outcomes has been scrutinized in recent years. Data from meta-analyses has suggested harm related to albumin therapy in critically ill patients, and new observational data are consistent with these results. However, appropriately powered randomized, controlled trials have shown albumin to be safe in broad groups of critically ill patients. This article will discuss the reasons for differences between observational and controlled trial data, and the implications for future albumin use and clinical research.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^f1527361]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Three systematic reviews found no impact of albumin in critically ill adults on the need for kidney replacement therapy, including two network meta-analyses, and the 2018 Cochrane review. A systematic review evaluated the impact of albumin on patient outcomes after thermal injuries. The report identified four RCTs and found no impact on the incidence of kidney failure or mortality (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.27–7.38).

In a 2022 systematic review evaluating the impact of albumin and diuretics, as compared with diuretics alone, in mechanically ventilated patients (three trials; N = 129), albumin reduced hypotensive episodes, but did not shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation or improve the mortality rate. A 2014 systematic review evaluated the impact of albumin, as compared with crystalloid, in patients with ARDS. Three RCTs (N = 204) were included; no difference in mortality was found (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62–1.28). Similarly, a 2014 systematic review that included two small RCTs (N = 70) found no difference in ventilator-free days or mortality when albumin with diuretics, as compared with diuretics alone, were used to improve respiratory status in critically ill patients.

A 2014 systematic review evaluated the impact of albumin with furosemide, compared with furosemide alone, to facilitate fluid removal in patients with hypoalbuminemia and hypervolemia. The systematic review identified 10 studies (N = 343). Although urine output was higher at 6 h in the patients receiving albumin-furosemide, no difference was found in urine output at 24 h. One RCT of 49 patients with edema receiving critical care was identified subsequent to this systematic review that compared albumin and furosemide with furosemide alone; no difference in urine output at 8 h was found.

### A randomized, controlled trial of furosemide with or without albumin in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury [^15be796e]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoproteinemia is a common condition in critically ill patients, associated with the development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent worse clinical outcomes. Albumin with furosemide benefits lung physiology in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, but the independent pharmacologic effects of these drugs are unknown.

Design

Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicentered trial.

Setting

Eleven medical, surgical, and trauma intensive care units including 190 beds within two university hospital systems.

Patients

Forty mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, whose serum total protein concentrations were < 6.0 g/dL were included. Patients were excluded for hemodynamic instability or significant renal or hepatic failure.

Interventions

Subjects were equally randomly allocated to receive furosemide with albumin or furosemide with placebo for 72 hrs, titrated to fluid loss and normalization of serum total protein concentration.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was change in oxygenation from baseline to day 1, with secondary physiologic and clinical outcomes. There were no differences in baseline characteristics of the subjects in relation to group assignment. Albumin-treated patients had greater increases in oxygenation (mean change in Pao2/Fio2: +43 vs. -24 mm Hg at 24 hrs and +49 vs. -13 mm Hg at day 3), serum total protein (1.5 vs. 0.5 g/dL at day 3), and net fluid loss (-5480 vs. -1490 mL at day 3) throughout the study period (all p < .05). Fluid bolus administration to control patients reduced net negative fluid balance; control patients more frequently developed hypotension and had fewer shock-free days, which translated to differences in organ failure at study end.

Conclusions

The addition of albumin to furosemide therapy in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome significantly improves oxygenation, with greater net negative fluid balance and better maintenance of hemodynamic stability. Additional randomized clinical trials are necessary to examine mechanisms and determine the effect on important clinical outcomes, such as the duration of mechanical ventilation.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^60b813bf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of albumin administration may also depend on the simultaneous use of diuretics to prevent an albumin infusion-induced increase in hydrostatic pressure, which may increase (rather than decrease) edema formation. Some studies have suggested that the concurrent use of albumin may increase furosemide-induced diuresis in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury and cirrhosis-induced ascites, although not in all critically ill patients; whether this strategy has any effect on patient-centered clinical outcomes is unclear.

In 1999 Sort and colleagues published the results of a RCT in 126 patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis comparing treatment with intravenous cefotaxime or cefotaxime plus intravenous albumin for plasma volume expansion. Renal impairment developed in fewer patients in the patients who received albumin (P = 0.002) and these patients also had reduced hospital and 3-month mortality rates (both P = 0.01). A more recent RCT reported beneficial effects of albumin plus antibiotic on renal and circulatory function in 110 patients with cirrhosis and infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; treatment with albumin was an independent predictive factor of survival. A meta-analysis of 16 RCTs also suggested that albumin use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.86) and renal impairment (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.75) in patients with cirrhosis and any infection. Two small RCTs have also demonstrated improved renal function in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome treated with albumin and terlipressin.

Which concentration of albumin solution?

Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20 to 25% or 4 to 5%, and which concentration should be used has generated some debate. Direct blood volume measurements in humans have revealed that the intravascular volume effect of isooncotic preparations of human albumin solutions is much higher than that of crystalloids (> 80% vs < 20%). However, the albumin concentration chosen largely depends on whether other fluids, especially crystalloids, are administered simultaneously – a 20% (20 g in 100 ml) albumin solution given simultaneously with 500 mL of normal saline solution is equivalent to a 3.3% (20/600) albumin solution. Nevertheless, hyperoncotic albumin may be a better choice if edema is already present, avoiding excessive sodium and chloride loads and their attendant complications.

Which dose of albumin?

Determining the ideal dose or volume of albumin that should be used is difficult. Early physiological studies demonstrated that administration of 5% albumin to septic patients expanded the plasma volume by an amount equivalent to the volume infused. Different studies have used different doses, and perhaps the dose should be adjusted according to a target serum albumin concentration, as in the ALBIOS study. The dose chosen by Mira and colleagues in the EARSS study (100 mL of 20% albumin 8 hourly for 3 days) achieved an increase in serum albumin to 25 to 29 g/l, raising the possibility that the albumin dose used may have been too low to show definite benefit – although this increase was similar to that reported in the SAFE study subgroup analysis of patients with sepsis, in whom a benefit was reported.

Conclusion

Albumin may indeed be safe when used as a resuscitation fluid (as shown by the SAFE study), but our results suggest that it may not be safe all of the time in all critically ill patients. We believe further studies, such as the present, are needed to generate hypotheses and encourage further research to fully clarify the role of albumin in our ICUs.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^a392675f]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Guidelines Focus

These recommendations apply to patients receiving albumin in critical care settings with hypovolemia, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, thermal injuries, and ARDS; cirrhosis; intradialytic hypotension; and cardiovascular surgery. These settings were included based on common uses of albumin, the systematic review of the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and with input from the panel. We included studies that compared the use of albumin with that of other resuscitation fluids, other pharmaceutical treatments, or standard of care.

Target Population

These guidelines provide actionable recommendations for the most common indications for the use of albumin. The use of albumin for therapeutic apheresis was excluded because recent guidelines were published.

Guidelines Development Process

Panel Composition

This guideline development process was funded by the Ontario Regional Blood Coordinating Network (Ontario, Canada) and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG; funded by Canadian Blood Services). Neither entity had any input on recommendations or guidelines content. An international panel of neonatal, pediatric, and adult specialists with expertise in the use of albumin developed the recommendations. This panel included 20 members with expertise in intensive care, hepatology, gastroenterology, nephrology, hematology, pathology, neonatology, transfusion medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, internal medicine, and methodology and a patient representative. A framework and related clinical questions were developed according to the United States Preventative Services Task Force Criteria. Disclosures were ascertained yearly from all members.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine clinical practice guideline on fluid therapy in adult critically ill patients. part 1: the choice of resuscitation fluids [^d74de63b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This is the first of three parts of the clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) on resuscitation fluids in adult critically ill patients. This part addresses fluid choice and the other two will separately address fluid amount and fluid removal.

Methods

This guideline was formulated by an international panel of clinical experts and methodologists. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence and to move from evidence to decision.

Results

For volume expansion, the guideline provides conditional recommendations for using crystalloids rather than albumin in critically ill patients in general (moderate certainty of evidence), in patients with sepsis (moderate certainty of evidence), in patients with acute respiratory failure (very low certainty of evidence) and in patients in the perioperative period and patients at risk for bleeding (very low certainty of evidence). There is a conditional recommendation for using isotonic saline rather than albumin in patients with traumatic brain injury (very low certainty of evidence). There is a conditional recommendation for using albumin rather than crystalloids in patients with cirrhosis (very low certainty of evidence). The guideline provides conditional recommendations for using balanced crystalloids rather than isotonic saline in critically ill patients in general (low certainty of evidence), in patients with sepsis (low certainty of evidence) and in patients with kidney injury (very low certainty of evidence). There is a conditional recommendation for using isotonic saline rather than balanced crystalloids in patients with traumatic brain injury (very low certainty of evidence). There is a conditional recommendation for using isotonic crystalloids rather than small-volume hypertonic crystalloids in critically ill patients in general (very low certainty of evidence).

Conclusions

This guideline provides eleven recommendations to inform clinicians on resuscitation fluid choice in critically ill patients.

### Fluid administration and monitoring in ARDS: which management? [^3b1df8f4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Modalities of fluid management in patients sustaining the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are challenging and controversial. Optimal fluid management should provide adequate oxygen delivery to the body, while avoiding inadvertent increase in lung edema which further impairs gas exchange. In ARDS patients, positive fluid balance has been associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Accordingly, a restrictive strategy has been compared to a more liberal approach in randomized controlled trials conducted in various clinical settings. Restrictive strategies included fluid restriction guided by the monitoring of extravascular lung water, pulmonary capillary wedge or central venous pressure, and furosemide targeted to diuresis and/or albumin replacement in hypoproteinemic patients. Overall, restrictive strategies improved oxygenation significantly and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, but had no significant effect on mortality. Fluid management may require different approaches depending on the time course of ARDS (i.e., early vs. late period). The effects of fluid strategy management according to ARDS phenotypes remain to be evaluated. Since ARDS is frequently associated with sepsis-induced acute circulatory failure, the prediction of fluid responsiveness is crucial in these patients to avoid hemodynamically inefficient-hence respiratory detrimental-fluid administration. Specific hemodynamic indices of fluid responsiveness or mini-fluid challenges should be preferably used. Since the positive airway pressure contributes to positive fluid balance in ventilated ARDS patients, it should be kept as low as possible. As soon as the hemodynamic status is stabilized, correction of cumulated fluid retention may rely on diuretics administration or renal replacement therapy.

### The short-term effect of hyperoncotic albumin, given alone or with furosemide, on oxygenation in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d7d09b3e]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Two prospective non-randomised interventional case series were conducted consecutively at a single university hospital mixed intensive care unit, in patients with severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The first series describes the administration of 200 mL of 20% human albumin solution over 120 s in 13 patients, examining the hypothesis that raising plasma albumin should improve oxygenation. The second series describes the effect of administering 30 mg of furosemide intravenously along with the albumin in 15 patients, exploring whether this would produce more sustained improvement in oxygenation than albumin only. Oxygenation and haemodynamic parameters were measured for 4 h, during the period of peak oncotic effect. Hyperoncotic albumin given alone or with furosemide produced only transient improvement in oxygenation and haemodynamics, which was statistically significant only in the patients given albumin alone. Although the plasma albumin remained significantly elevated at 4 h in both series, no sustained improvement in oxygenation was seen.

Risk of bias assessment

Assessment of within study bias (internal validity) is summarised in figure 2. All studies were judged to be of unclear risk of bias in at least one bias assessment domain. Ten studieshad at least one high risk of bias judgment for the outcome of mortality, and were therefore considered at high risk of bias overall. The remaining six studieswere considered at low risk of bias overall as reviewers judged that key domains were at low risk of bias and the domains at unclear risk of bias were unlikely to have seriously altered the results for the outcome of all-cause mortality.

SAFE, ALBIOS, and EARSSwere the only large high quality studies designed to assess the endpoint of mortality, and reported on 3820 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, only EARSSand ALBIOScollected 90 day mortality data on 2602 patients, of whom 1927 had septic shock. ALBIOS reported baseline group imbalance for central venous oxygen saturation (P = 0.02) and organ dysfunction (P = 0.04). Full publication of EARSS is awaited.SAFEwas the only double blind study that adequately concealed fluid group allocation in 1218 patients, and would have been classified as low risk of bias for all assessment domains had baseline blood pressure been similar between groups (P = 0.03). To prevent the unnecessary introduction of bias that would have classified SAFE 2011 as at high risk of bias,28 day mortality outcome data from SAFE 2004was used rather than multivariate adjusted data from SAFE 2011, which excluded 24.5% of enrolled patients. All the other studies described patients exposed to open-label fluid interventions, with a variable dosing schedule, except for five that used a predefined fixed dose.

### Early human albumin infusion was associated with 28-day mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure and hypoalbuminaemia in the intensive care unit: a retrospective study of the MIMIC-IV database [^e69e01a5]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the relationship between different timing of human albumin infusion and mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Methods

This cohort study utilized data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV 2.0) database. Patients were categorized into two groups, early human albumin infusion (infusion within 72 hours after ICU admission) and late human albumin infusion (infusion more than 72 hours after ICU admission), irrespective of dosage or colloid osmotic pressure. 28-day mortality and independent risk factors of mortality were measured.

Results

A total of 1,118 patients with acute respiratory failure and hypoalbuminaemia were included in the analysis, with 471 patients in the early albumin infusion group and 647 patients in the late albumin infusion group. After PSM, 451 patients were included in each group. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 28-day mortality was statistically significantly higher in the early albumin infusion group compared to the late albumin infusion group. Additionally, stratified analysis by albumin levels showed that 28-day mortality was statistically significantly higher in the early infusion group than in the late infusion group for patients with albumin levels less than 30 g/L.

Conclusion

The 28-day mortality of patients with acute respiratory failure who received early human albumin infusion in the ICU was higher than that of patients who received late human albumin infusion. Early albumin infusion was not associated with an improvement in the survival rate among patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU.

Recent randomized controlled trial results

Following the results of the SAFE study suggesting a benefit of albumin administration in patients with sepsis, several groups designed RCTs to further evaluate albumin use in this specific group of patients.

In the ALBIOS study, conducted in 100 ICUs in Italy, 1,818 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were randomized either to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin plus crystalloid or to receive crystalloid alone initially to achieve the target resuscitation goals of the early goal-directed therapy protocol used by Rivers and colleagues. Over the subsequent 28 days, albumin infusions were adjusted to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l; crystalloid solutions were given when considered clinically indicated by the attending physician. More patients in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group reached the target mean arterial pressure within 6 hours after randomization (86% versus 82.5%, P = 0.04), and during the first 7 days the mean arterial pressure was higher and the net fluid balance lower in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group, despite similar amounts of fluid being administered to the two groups. There were, however, no overall differences in 28-day mortality rates (32% albumin vs 32% crystalloid; relative risk in the albumin group, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.14; P = 0.94) or 90-day mortality rates (41% albumin vs 44% crystalloid; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05; P = 0.29) between the groups. Of the 1,818 patients, 579 (31.8%) were randomized within 6 hours and 1,239 (68.2%) more than 6 hours after meeting the clinical criteria for severe sepsis; there were no significant differences in outcomes according to the interval between meeting clinical criteria and randomization. In the subgroup of patients with septic shock at enrollment (n = 1,121), however, those who received albumin had significantly lower 90-day mortality rates than those who received saline (44% versus 50%; relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99; P = 0.03).

### Effects of crystalloid, hyper-oncotic albumin, and iso-oncotic albumin on lung and kidney damage in experimental acute lung injury [^b694811f]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid replacement is often necessary in critically ill patients. Different fluids have different indications and contraindications in different scenarios and at different phases of the same disease. Fluids must be regarded like any other drug; their management must consider the type, dose, and timing of administration.

In acute respiratory distress syndrome, a conservative fluid administration strategy has been associated with reduced mechanical ventilation time, less organ dysfunction, and a tendency toward reduced need for renal replacement therapy. Albumin is currently available as either an iso-oncotic (5%) or a hyper-oncotic (20%) solution. However, conflicting data have reported beneficial effects of crystalloids, iso-oncotic albumin, and hyper-oncotic albumin in critically ill patients.

Therefore, additional experimental studies are needed to evaluate the effects of different fluids on different organs. In experimental sepsis and shock resuscitation, hyper-oncotic albumin showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thus minimizing lung injury. However, both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that human albumin may lead to kidney damage proportional to albumin concentration. Thus, it is unknown whether iso- or hyper-oncotic human albumin concentrations may result in beneficial effects in the lungs, previously primed by endotoxin, without damaging the kidney. Based on the foregoing, we hypothesized that, compared to hyper-oncotic albumin and crystalloid solution (Ringer's lactate, RL), iso-oncotic albumin might minimize lung and kidney damage in experimental acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, we compared the effects of RL, 5%ALB, and 20%ALB, all titrated to reach similar hemodynamic goals, on lung function and histology, kidney histology and renal cell regeneration, expression of genes associated with lung and kidney inflammation, and endothelial cell damage in experimental ALI.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^50c56ea2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

A substantial amount of evidence from RCTs in critically ill adult patients across a wide range of patient subgroups provides little supportive evidence for the use of albumin as fluid replacement to reduce mortality, the need for kidney replacement therapy, or other outcomes considered important or critical for decision-making by the panel. Given the wide CIs for the estimates from the systematic reviews, all recommendations were considered conditional because of the residual uncertainty.

In systematic reviews evaluating the role of albumin in patients with sepsis, the use of albumin has not been found to be associated with improved outcomes, although a benefit has not been excluded because of the wide CI in the most recent systematic review. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines published in 2021recommend albumin in addition to crystalloids when patients require large volumes of crystalloids (Weak Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence). Specific formulations of albumin (4%-5% or 20%-25%), volumes or doses, serum albumin targets, or a combination thereof were not described. The guidelines state, "The lack of proven benefit and higher cost of albumin compared to crystalloid contributed to our strong recommendation for the use of crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock". More studies will be needed to evaluate the role and timing of albumin as a rescue fluid in patients with sepsis failing front-line crystalloid resuscitation, particularly given the considerably higher cost of albumin compared with crystalloids, the risks of albumin, and the lack of benefit shown in RCTs.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^bc18cae5]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials, with trial sequential analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses.

Data Sources

PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science (includes Medline, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Data Citation Index, Chinese Science Citation Database, CAB abstracts, Derwent Innovations Index), OvidSP (includes Embase, Ovid Medline, HMIC, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care, Transport Database), Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, controlled-trials.com, online material, relevant conference proceedings, hand searching of reference lists, and contact with authors as necessary.

Eligibility Criteria

Prospective randomised clinical trials of adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) in critical or intensive care who received pooled human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation (with or without improvement of hypoalbuminaemia) compared with those who received control fluids (crystalloid or colloid), were included if all-cause mortality outcome data were available. No restriction of language, date, publication status, or primary study endpoint was applied.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion, extracted data to assess risk of bias, trial methods, patients, interventions, comparisons, and outcome. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was calculated using a random effects model accounting for clinical heterogeneity.

Primary Outcome Measure

All-cause mortality at final follow-up.

Results

Eighteen articles reporting on 16 primary clinical trials that included 4190 adults in critical or intensive care with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. A median of 70.0 g daily of pooled human albumin was received over a median of 3 days by adults with a median age of 60.8 years as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation, with or without correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The relative risk of death was similar between albumin groups (that received a median of 175 g in total) and control fluid groups (relative risk 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.01; P = 0.11; I(2) = 0%). Trial sequential analysis corrected the 95% confidence interval for random error (0.85 to 1.02; D(2) = 0%). Eighty eight per cent of the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) of 4894 patients was achieved, and the cumulative effect size measure (z score) entered the futility area, supporting the notion of no relative benefit of albumin (GRADE quality of evidence was moderate). Evidence of no difference was also found when albumin was compared with crystalloid fluid (relative risk 0.93; 0.86 to 1.01; P = 0.07; I(2) = 0%) in 3878 patents (GRADE quality of evidence was high; 79.9% of required information size) or colloid fluids in 299 patients (relative risk 1.04; 0.79 to 1.38; P = 0.76; I(2) = 0%) (GRADE quality of evidence was very low; 5.8% of required information size). When studies at high risk of bias were excluded in a predefined subgroup analysis, the finding of no mortality benefit remained, and the cumulative z score was just outside the boundary of futility. Overall, the meta-analysis was robust to sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses.

Conclusions

In this analysis, human albumin solutions as part of fluid volume expansion and resuscitation for critically unwell adults with sepsis of any severity (with or without baseline hypoalbuminaemia) were not robustly effective at reducing all-cause mortality. Albumin seems to be safe in this setting, as a signal towards harm was not detected, but this analysis does not support a recommendation for use.

### Choice of fluid in acute illness: what should be given? An international consensus [^afe605d8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^2ec6ce57]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The cumulative z score crosses the boundary of futility, suggesting further trials are not required as they are unlikely to demonstrate reduced mortality with albumin, and even less likely to show increased mortality (fig 4). A model including the ongoing RASP trialincreased the information size to 93.0%, but this still did not alter the finding of no overall mortality benefit (online supplement). This was also the case for the model including patients with sepsis who received albumin in the CRISTAL trial(online supplement).

Overall, with 85.6% of the required information size, the number needed to treat was 37 patients (95% confidence interval: the number needed to treat is > 18, and the number needed to harm is > 517) for the comparison of albumin with control fluid. GRADE quality of evidence was judged to be moderate (table 5).

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^812767a1]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence Summary

Sixteen, of 19 systematic reviews were retrieved and included. These reports included a broad critical care patient population, including patients with critical illness, sepsis, thermal injuries, and ARDS. Three of the 19 systematic reviews were excluded because they assessed the impact of albumin only on fluid balance, gelatin vs colloids, or all colloids compared with crystalloids (without reporting albumin vs other fluids).

A systematic review from 2019identified 55 RCTs comparing crystalloid with colloids in critical care. Data on mortality were available for 26,329 patients from 46 studies. No mortality benefit was found when crystalloid was compared with albumin (relative risk [RR] 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.10). Crystalloids were less effective than colloids in hemodynamic resuscitation end points (eg, mean arterial pressure) but this did not translate into improvements in patient outcomes. After this systematic review, one RCT was identified that examined 360 patients with sepsis with an underlying diagnosis of cancer (albumin was compared with Ringer's lactate); no differences in mortality or other outcomes were found. A systematic review from 2018 conducted by the Cochrane collaborationfound no difference in mortality in patients in the ICU (20 studies; N = 13,047) when patients managed with crystalloids were compared with those managed with albumin at the end of follow-up (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.06), at 30 days (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.93–1.06), or at 90 days (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92–1.04) or who needed kidney replacement therapy (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.96–1.27). The largest randomized trial is the Saline Versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation trial published in 2004, which enrolled 6,997 patients receiving critical care (including a mix of medical and surgical patients) and compared 4% albumin with 0.9% normal saline. No differences were found in outcomes, including 28-day mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91–1.09).

### Randomised trials of human albumin for adults with sepsis: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality [^f9e686c7]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The use of colloid fluids is controversial and neither the efficacy nor safety of pooled human albumin solutions has been adequately demonstrated in randomised trials or meta-analyses. Uncertainty has resulted in continued globalalbumin use and associated expense. Human albumin is a natural colloid used as part of volume expansion and resuscitation and to correct hypoalbuminaemia. Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock have a high mortality in adults of 24–39% in hospitalor at 28 days and 33–50% at 90 days. Fluid volume expansion and resuscitation of these critically ill patients with albumin is recommended by both the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (GRADE 2C), based on limited evidence that is of low quality. The SAFE studyreported no difference in mortality between human albumin and crystalloid (P = 0.09) in 1218 randomised adults with severe sepsis, of whom 36% had septic shock. However, mortality reduction was reported when a subgroup (76%) with available data on covariates was subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis (P = 0.03), supported by persistent Kaplan-Meier survival curve separation observed after approximately eight days. Furthermore, the use of albumin to correct or improve hypoalbuminaemia is controversial. Cohort studies associate hypoalbuminaemia with increased morbidity and mortality in both heterogeneousand septicpatients in critical or intensive care. COASSTalso suggested that human albumin infusion for severe sepsis was cost effective. However, randomised clinical trials report human albumin infusion improves only organ functionand hypoalbuminaemiain these septic adults. Thus, it is unclear if mortality is dependent on baseline albumin concentration.

### Albumin and furosemide therapy in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury [^800d3cbc]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoproteinemia, fluid retention, and weight gain are associated with development of acute lung injury and mortality in critically ill patients, without proof of cause and effect. We designed a clinical trial to determine whether diuresis and colloid replacement in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury would improve pulmonary physiology.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

All adult intensive care units from two university hospitals.

Patients

Thirty-seven mechanically-ventilated patients with acute lung injury and serum total protein ≤ 5.0 g/dL.

Interventions

Five-day protocolized regimen of 25 g of human serum albumin every 8 hrs with continuous infusion furosemide, or dual placebo, targeted to diuresis, weight loss, and serum total protein.

Measurements and Main Results

Measured outcomes included change in weight, serum total protein, fluid balance, hemodynamics, respiratory system compliance, and oxygenation. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (treatment, n = 19; control, n = 18), with trauma being the major cause of acute lung injury. Diuresis and weight loss over 5 days (5.3 kg more in the treatment group, p = .04) was accompanied by improvements in the Pao2/Fio2 ratio in the treatment group within 24 hrs (from 171 to 236, p = .02). Respiratory mechanics were unchanged. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 to 88 mm Hg (p = .10), and heart rate decreased from 110 to 95 beats/min (p = .008) over time in the treatment group. No difference in mortality was observed, with favorable trends in measures of intensive care.

Conclusions

Albumin and furosemide therapy improves fluid balance, oxygenation, and hemodynamics in hypoproteinemic patients with acute lung injury. Determining the effect of this simple therapy on cost, outcomes, and other patient populations requires further study.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^30395c3f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a clinical review [^961fe692]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are well defined and readily recognised clinical disorders caused by many clinical insults to the lung or because of predispositions to lung injury. That this process is common in intensive care is well established. The mainstay of treatment for this disorder is provision of excellent supportive care since these patients are critically ill and frequently have coexisting conditions including sepsis and multiple organ failure. Refinements in ventilator and fluid management supported by data from prospective randomised trials have increased the methods available to effectively manage this disorder.

### Evidence-based management of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^9de300e7]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

This report explores the efficacy of existing therapies for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), primarily in terms of clinically important outcomes such as the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital mortality. Of the 15 therapies reviewed, the strongest evidence suggests that ALI/ARDS should be managed with a low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either low or moderately high positive end-expiratory pressure. To date there have been few large, sufficiently powered, randomized controlled clinical trials of ALI/ARDS therapies that addressed patient outcomes. However, there is relatively strong evidence to support conservative fluid management and high-fat, anti-oxidant nutritional formulations. Although most pharmacologic ALI/ARDS therapies have been ineffective, high-dose methylprednisolone is indicated in the subgroups of ALI/ARDS patients who have pneumonia or are at risk of ARDS due to fat embolization.

Development of Clinical Recommendations

Each group convened to develop initial recommendations for the individual PICO questions. The co-chairs and methodologists led the groups through a discussion of the evidence profiles and GRADE Evidence to Decision framework to determine the direction and strength of the recommendations (see online supplement). As part of the GRADE Evidence to Decision process, we considered the certainty of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention, patient preferences and values, resource use, implications for health equity, acceptability of the intervention to stakeholders, and clinical feasibility. Evidence across the full spectrum of ARDS severity was unavailable for some interventions. For those interventions, recommendations were limited to the specific severity subgroups (i.e. mild, moderate, or severe) for which evidence was sufficient, and no recommendation was made for the subgroups for which it was not. Each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional" (Table 2). After the individual groups generated draft recommendations, these were presented to the full panel for detailed discussion, input, and approval. Final recommendations were determined by consensus of the full panel. Consistent with the GRADE approach, we had planned to use voting for recommendations that could not achieve consensus through discussion, but this was not required.

Table 2.
Implications of Strong versus Conditional Recommendations

Manuscript Preparation

The writing committee composed of the chairs and co-chairs drafted the guideline document for subsequent review by the panel. We summarized the rationale and supporting evidence for each recommendation, as well as issues raised during the GRADE Evidence to Decision process. A patient representative reviewed the draft guidelines and provided feedback regarding the recommendations and selected patient-centered outcomes, which were incorporated into the document. We then integrated feedback from all panel members into the manuscript. The entire panel approved the final wording of the recommendations and justifications, which was then submitted to ATS for review and approval.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### Albumin infusion for the critically ill – is it beneficial and, if so, why and how? [^581281e0]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Human albumin is used for volume expansion and resuscitation and to correct hypoalbuminemia. Hypoalbuminemia is frequent in sepsis and is a strong predictor of mortality and morbidity. Fluid volume expansion and resuscitation of the critically ill with albumin has been recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (grade 2C), although the evidence for these recommendations is not strong and use of albumin to correct or improve hypoalbuminemia remains controversial despite the fact that albumin is safe to use for the critically ill.

Albumin mobilizes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from the liver and other tissues, and thus enhances the formation of cytoprotective bioactive lipids – lipoxins, resolvins and protectins – that, in turn, suppress production of proinflammatory prostaglandins, free radicals and cytokines. The beneficial actions of albumin thus depend on its ability to mobilize PUFAs and the formation of adequate amounts of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins. For those who have hepatic and tissue deficiency of PUFAs, albumin fails to mobilize PUFAs and formation of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins will be inadequate, which may explain failure of the beneficial actions of albumin in the critically ill.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this Series paper the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition and evidence that could inform future revisions are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on burn shock resuscitation [^f84ca6f3]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn shock resuscitation — albumin versus crystalloid in adults with large burns is assessed among adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area (TBSA) during the first 24 hours to evaluate effects on resuscitation volume at 24 or 48 hours, urine output (UOP), and edema-related complications. In nonrescue comparisons, two high-strength studies and 2 low-strength studies showed either a significant decrease or a trend to lower resuscitation volume with albumin compared to crystalloid alone, whereas most rescue studies found higher volumes with albumin; in rescue studies, patients were generally sicker, had bigger and/or deeper burns, and were already receiving large amounts of crystalloids, potentially influencing outcomes. Across rescue situations, three studies observed that initiation of albumin rapidly lowered the in-to-out (I:O) ratio, suggesting that albumin appears to have a fluid-sparing effect. For UOP, one high strength study showed a tendency to higher UOP in albumin-treated patients, but most studies did not directly examine or report this variable. Edema-related findings were mixed: a predetermined-use, high-strength study found pulmonary edema significantly worsened over the first post burn week in albumin-treated patients; another rescue study saw no respiratory compromise with colloids compared to crystalloid alone; and one meta-analysis found a lower odds of abdominal compartment syndrome with albumin infusion but pooled heterogeneous study types. Mortality was not evaluated due to underpowered and heterogeneous crystalloid-versus-colloid evidence, and larger high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed (e.g. ABRUPT 2, NCT03456859).

### A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial assessing safety and efficacy of active site inactivated recombinant factor VIIa in subjects with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome [^85335f3d]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of active site inactivated recombinant factor VIIa (FFR-rFVIIa) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Design

Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial.

Setting

Forty-six intensive care units (ICU) in ten countries.

Patients

All adult (≥ 18 years), mechanically ventilated patients with acute onset (within 48 hour) of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome were included.

Interventions

Four sequential (in ascending order) treatment groups (cohorts) in single and multiple dosing strategies. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either FFR-rFVIIa or placebo within each cohort.

Measurements and Results

Data were collected daily for 7 days and on days 14 and 28 for efficacy variables including hematology and coagulation parameters, plasma d-dimer levels, plasma interleukin-6 levels, vital signs, ventilator parameters, lung injury score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. The study was discontinued prematurely by the Safety Committee based on statistical analysis of the mortality in cohort 3 (4 x 400 microg/kg), which suggested that, after adjusting for prognostic covariates, 28-day mortality was significantly higher in this cohort than in the placebo group and time to death was significantly shorter. A total of 214 patients (147 male) were included in the trial, mean age 59 years (range, 24–85 years). Overall, there were no significant differences in mortality rates in treated and placebo patients (36/144 deaths FFR-rFVIIa, 15/70 placebo). There was no treatment effect of FFR-rFVIIa on vital signs, blood chemistry parameters, hematology parameters, or amount of transfusion products required. There was a trend to increased bleeding with increasing FFR-rFVIIa dose.

Conclusion

In this randomized double-blind, placebo- controlled, dose-escalation trial, FFR-rFVIIa had no beneficial effects on morbidity or outcome overall. The cohort of patients receiving 4 x 400 g/kg of FFR-rFVIIa had increased mortality rates compared with placebo-treated patients, and there was a trend to increased risk of serious bleeding with increasing doses.

### Is albumin administration in the acutely ill associated with increased mortality? Results of the SOAP study [^33eda29f]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

The SOAP study was a prospective, multicenter, observational study designed to evaluate the epidemiology of sepsis as well as other characteristics of ICU patients in European countries and was initiated by a working group of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Institutional recruitment for participation was by open invitation from the study steering committee. As this epidemiological observational study did not require any deviation from routine medical practice, institutional review board approval was either waived or expedited in participating institutions and informed consent was not required. All patients older than 15 years admitted to the participating centers (see Acknowledgements below for a list of participating countries and centers) between 1 May and 15 May 2002 were included. Patients were followed up until death, hospital discharge, or for 60 days. Those who stayed in the ICU for less than 24 hours for routine postoperative observation were excluded.

### Albumin administration improves organ function in critically ill hypoalbuminemic patients: a prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study [^731efb90]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that administration of albumin to correct hypoalbuminemia might have beneficial effects on organ function in a mixed population of critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective, controlled, randomized study.

Setting

Thirty-one-bed, mixed medicosurgical department of intensive care.

Patients

All adult patients with a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/L were assessed for eligibility. Principal exclusion criteria were expected length of stay < 72 hrs, life expectancy < 3 months or a do-not-resuscitate order, albumin administration in the preceding 24 hrs, or evidence of fluid overload.

Interventions

The 100 patients were randomized to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin solution on the first day, then 200 mL/day provided their serum albumin concentration was < 31 g/dL (albumin group), or to receive no albumin (control group).

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the effect of albumin administration on organ function as assessed by a delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score from day 1 to day 7 (or the day of intensive care discharge or death, whichever came first). The two groups of 50 patients were comparable at baseline for age, gender, albumin concentration, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. Albumin concentration did not change over time in the control group but increased consistently in the albumin group (p < .001). Organ function improved more in the albumin than in the control group (p = .026), mainly due to a difference in respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous system components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Diuretic use was identical in both groups, but mean fluid gain was almost three times higher in the control group (1679 ± 1156 vs. 658 ± 1101 mL, p = .04). Median daily calorie intake was higher in the albumin than in the control group (1122 [935–1158] vs. 760 [571–1077] kcal, p = .05).

Conclusions

Albumin administration may improve organ function in hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients. It results in a less positive fluid balance and a better tolerance to enteral feeding.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^3c6ea7d3]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Albumin co-administration with terlipressin — use, dosing, and caution: Most of the patients included in the trials comparing terlipressin with placebo received albumin (20–40 g/d) during terlipressin treatment. The rationale to give albumin is to fill the central circulation, enhancing the effects of splanchnic vasoconstriction in improving renal blood flow, but this is likely enhanced after a short course (1–2 days) of albumin administration; therefore, the need for continuation of albumin should be assessed carefully based on volume status. A nonrandomized study including only 21 patients suggested that terlipressin without albumin is less effective than the combination of both. There was a trend for higher amounts of albumin given before terlipressin administration in patients developing respiratory failure; therefore, judicious use of albumin before and during treatment with terlipressin is necessary.

### Albumin in critical care: SAFE, but worth its salt? [^c683db17]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.

### Nonventilatory treatments for acute lung injury and ARDS [^90fe087c]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, advances in the ventilatory management of acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS have improved outcomes; however, until recently the search for other therapies has been less fruitful. Recently, the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial reported that a conservative fluid management strategy, compared with a fluid liberal strategy, increased the mean (± SE) number of ventilator-free days in patients with ALI (14.6 ± 0.5 vs 12.1 ± 0.5 days, respectively; p < 0.001). In addition to this beneficial effect on outcomes, the study found that the conservative fluid strategy did not increase the incidence of renal failure or the development of shock. Other studies have demonstrated that albumin and furosemide therapy may be beneficial in hypoproteinemic patients with lung injury, though data on outcomes is still lacking. Although several pharmacologic therapies, such as corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide, have been demonstrated to be ineffective in improving outcomes, several promising new treatments are being investigated in ongoing or upcoming clinical trials. This article reviews these developments and other recent research on the optimal nonventilatory management of patients with ALI.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^714b4165]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

It is still unclear what type of fluid should be employed in the initial treatment of the bleeding trauma patient. Although several meta-analyses have shown an increased risk of death in patients treated with colloids compared with patients treated with crystalloids and three of these studies showed that the effect was particularly significant in a trauma subgroup, a more recent meta-analysis showed no difference in mortality between colloids and crystalloids. If colloids are used, modern hydroxyethyl starch or gelatin solutions should be used because the risk:benefit ratio of dextran is disadvantageous. Problems in evaluating and comparing the use of different resuscitation fluids include the heterogeneity of populations and therapy strategies, limited quality of analysed studies, mortality not always being the primary outcome, and different, often short, observation periods. It is therefore difficult to reach a definitive conclusion as to the advantage of one type of resuscitation fluid over the other. The Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation study compared 4% albumin with 0.9% sodium chloride in 6997 ICU patients and showed that albumin administration was not associated with worse outcomes; however, there was a trend towards higher mortality in the brain trauma subgroup that received albumin (P = 0.06). Promising results have been obtained with hypertonic solutions. Recently, a double-blind, RCT in 209 patients with blunt traumatic injuries analysed the effect of the treatment with 250 mL of 7.5% hypertonic saline and 6% dextran 70 compared with lactated Ringer solution on organ failure. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated no significant difference in organ failure and in acute respiratory disress syndrome (ARDS)-free survival. However, there was improved ARDS-free survival in the subset (19% of the population) requiring 10 U or more of packed red blood cells (RBCs). One study showed that the use of hypertonic saline was associated with lower intracranial pressure than with normal saline in brain-injured patients and a meta-analysis comparing hypertonic saline dextran with normal saline for resuscitation in hypotension from penetrating torso injuries showed improved survival in the hypertonic saline dextran group when surgery was required. A clinical trial with brain injury patients found that hypertonic saline reduced intracranial pressure more effectively than dextran solution with 20% mannitol when compared in equimolar dosing. However, Cooper and colleagues found almost no difference in neurological function six months after TBI in patients who had received pre-hospital hypertonic saline resuscitation compared with conventional fluid. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that hypertonic saline solutions are safe, and will improve haemodynamics during hypovolaemic resuscitation. The evidence for increased survival with use of hypertonic saline solutions is inconclusive. It is possible that certain subgroups might benefit from hypertonic saline solutions, but further research is required.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, tidal volume targets, SSC 2021 guidelines recommend to use low tidal volume ventilation strategies (6 mL/kg) over high tidal volume strategies (> 10 mL/kg) in adult patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^0ec23fdf]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

Recommendations for Specific Treatment Questions

Question 1: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Systemic Corticosteroids?

Recommendation

We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

Background

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators present in ARDS. They are widely administered to patients with ARDS for the management of ARDS specifically and for concurrent conditions such as septic shock or pneumonia. More recently, corticosteroids have been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19–related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, several multicenter RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with ARDS have been published, prompting a recommendation for this intervention.

Evidence summary

Corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 9 studies; mean difference (MD), 4 d less; 95% CI, −5.5 to −2.5; low certainty) and the length of hospital stay (n = 4 studies; MD, 8 d shorter; 95% CI, −13 to −3; low certainty), although the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain (n = 4 studies; MD, 0.8 d shorter; 95% CI, −4.1 to +5.7; very low certainty). With regard to safety outcomes, corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

### Fluid resuscitation in acute medicine: what is the current situation? [^9deca004]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation is the most common intervention in acute medicine. There is increasing evidence that the type of fluid may directly affect patient-centred outcomes. There is a lack of evidence that colloids confer clinical benefit over crystalloids and they may be associated with harm. Hydroxyethyl starch preparations are associated with increased mortality and use of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis; albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Crystalloids, such as saline or balanced salt solutions, are increasingly recommended as first-line resuscitation fluids for the majority of patients with hypovolaemia. There is emerging evidence that saline may be associated with adverse outcomes due to the development of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, although the safety of balanced salt solutions has not been established. Fluid requirements vary over the course of critical illness. The excessive use of fluids during the resuscitative period is associated with increased cumulative fluid balance and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The selection of fluid depends on the clinical context in which it is administered and requires careful consideration of the dose and potential for toxicity. There is an urgent need to conduct further high-quality randomized controlled trials of currently available fluid therapy in patients with critical illness.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^a829ae5f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Albumin — diagnostic and therapeutic use in hepatorenal syndrome–acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) includes an intravenous albumin challenge of 1 g per kilogram of body weight per day for 2 consecutive days without demonstrated improvement in serum creatinine in patients meeting other criteria, which confirms the diagnosis of HRS-AKI; for treatment, an albumin dose of 20–40 g/d together with vasoconstrictors can be administered. Albumin alone is ineffective in the management of HRS-AKI, higher total doses may be associated with improved 180-day survival but excessive albumin may lead to respiratory failure, and albumin use in the context of HRS requires careful monitoring to avoid volume overload.

### A word of caution regarding proposed benefits of albumin from ALBIOS: a dose of healthy skepticism [^8aaa1403]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Caution in evaluating open-label endpoints at risk for bias

In the subgroup of patients with septic shock receiving vasopressors and/or inotropes at enrollment, a tertiary analysis suggested that use of albumin was associated with fewer days of vasopressor or inotrope support (median 3 days (interquartile range 1 to 6) vs. 4 days (interquartile range 2 to 7), P = 0.007). Of note, the ALBIOS trial was an open-label study, which may have biased the vasopressor titrations. Additionally, analyzing hours as opposed to days of vasopressor duration may have clarified the true effect size. Nevertheless, vasopressor agents are not benign medications and a reduction in their use could be of benefit.

### Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients [^8edcf10f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Human albumin solutions are used for a range of medical and surgical problems. Licensed indications are the emergency treatment of shock and other conditions where restoration of blood volume is urgent, such as in burns and hypoproteinaemia. Human albumin solutions are more expensive than other colloids and crystalloids.

Objectives

To quantify the effect on mortality of human albumin and plasma protein fraction (PPF) administration in the management of critically ill patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 31 May 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1948 to week 3 May 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 21 2011), CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to May 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to May 2011), PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/) (searched 10 June 2011, limit: last 60 days). Reference lists of trials and review articles were checked, and authors of identified trials were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing albumin or PPF with no albumin or PPF or with a crystalloid solution in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia, burns or hypoalbuminaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on the participants, albumin solution used, mortality at the end of follow up, and quality of allocation concealment. Analysis was stratified according to patient type.

Main Results

We found 38 trials meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting death as an outcome. There were 1,958 deaths among 10,842 trial participants. For hypovolaemia, the relative risk of death following albumin administration was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.13). This estimate was heavily influenced by the results of the SAFE trial, which contributed 75.2% of the information (based on the weights in the meta-analysis). For burns, the relative risk was 2.93 (95% CI 1.28 to 6.72) and for hypoalbuminaemia the relative risk was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.88). There was no substantial heterogeneity between the trials in the various categories (Chi(2) = 26.66, df = 31, P = 0.69). The pooled relative risk of death with albumin administration was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.16).

Authors' Conclusions

For patients with hypovolaemia, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline. There is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality in critically ill patients with burns and hypoalbuminaemia. The possibility that there may be highly selected populations of critically ill patients in which albumin may be indicated remains open to question. However, in view of the absence of evidence of a mortality benefit from albumin and the increased cost of albumin compared to alternatives such as saline, it would seem reasonable that albumin should only be used within the context of well concealed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials.
