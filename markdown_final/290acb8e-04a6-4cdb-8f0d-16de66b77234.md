## Question

How much reduction can be expected with ezetimibe alone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much LDL-C reduction to expect with ezetimibe monotherapy and how to contextualize that estimate clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the best evidence for ezetimibe monotherapy from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Then, I should verify consistency across sources and check for outliers. Next, I will consider the time course of effect and whether baseline LDL-C influences the percentage reduction. Finally, I will translate the LDL-C reduction into expected clinical benefit using established risk models and align the recommendation with guideline positions on when monotherapy is appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the core estimate from high-quality syntheses. A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of ezetimibe 10 mg daily monotherapy reported a mean LDL-C reduction of 18.58% with a tight 95% CI of −19.67% to −17.48%, which I should treat as the anchor estimate for typical adult primary hypercholesterolemia patients [^112LxuBB]. Wait, let me verify consistency with authoritative guidance; the National Lipid Association's statin intolerance statement cites a 15–20% LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe monotherapy, which aligns with the meta-analytic point estimate and supports generalizability across populations and baseline LDL-C strata [^112zAqo3]. I should also confirm regulatory labeling; the FDA prescribing information summarizes that ezetimibe 10 mg reduces LDL-C by about 18% on average, reinforcing the same magnitude across multiple trials [^113QRWv6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for outliers and understand variability. Some narrative reviews and pooled analyses cite ranges up to 20–25% for monotherapy, but these figures often mix heterogeneous populations or include indirect comparisons, so I should weigh them less heavily than the dedicated meta-analysis and guideline statements that converge on roughly 15–20% [^114BHA5T]. Let me reconsider whether baseline LDL-C meaningfully changes the percent reduction; a large pooled analysis across statin, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitor trials found minimal variation in the percentage LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe across baseline LDL-C levels, supporting the applicability of the ~18% estimate across a broad range of starting values [^116NyvuC].

> Next, I should review the time course of effect to set expectations for monitoring. The FDA label notes maximal or near-maximal LDL-C lowering is typically achieved within 2 weeks and maintained with chronic therapy, which is clinically useful for early reassessment of response and adherence [^115tMsyg] [^1148fV6m]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the full effect might take 4–12 weeks like statins, but that longer window reflects statin kinetics and guideline lipid monitoring intervals rather than ezetimibe's onset; ezetimibe's effect is indeed faster, so a 2–4 week check is reasonable if a rapid assessment is needed [^114UAUU2].

> I will now examine how to translate LDL-C lowering into expected cardiovascular risk reduction. Using the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-regression framework, each 1 mmol/L (about 39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C yields approximately a 22% relative risk reduction in major vascular events, and this relationship appears similar for nonstatin LDL receptor–mediated therapies, including ezetimibe, supporting the concept that the absolute LDL-C drop drives benefit [^112e2MNn]. Let me double-check a concrete example: if baseline LDL-C is 130 mg/dL, an 18% reduction equals about 23 mg/dL, which corresponds to roughly a 13% relative risk reduction in major vascular events; this is an illustrative estimate and the absolute benefit will vary with baseline risk, but it shows the order of magnitude clinicians can expect [^112e2MNn].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a statin and we are considering add-on therapy rather than monotherapy. I should confirm the incremental effect size. When added to background statin therapy, ezetimibe typically lowers LDL-C by an additional 20–25%, and this additive effect is consistently observed across trials and reflected in guideline summaries, which helps with sequencing decisions after statin optimization [^113iCB7q] [^114UAUU2]. Hold on, I should verify with a representative trial; in a randomized add-on study to ongoing statins, ezetimibe produced an additional ~25% LDL-C reduction versus placebo, reinforcing the additive estimate for combination therapy [^11764zMU].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure the clinical context is correct. For adults who are statin-intolerant or decline statins, ezetimibe monotherapy is a reasonable option, with expected LDL-C lowering in the 15–20% range, and this is supported by ACC/AHA and ESC/EAS guidance as well as the NLA's statin intolerance statement [^116Tkx54] [^117NA1Er] [^112zAqo3]. I need to ensure I emphasize that in statin-tolerant patients, guidelines still prioritize statins first due to robust outcome data, with ezetimibe reserved for add-on or intolerance scenarios, which aligns with risk-stratified care and shared decision-making principles [^115toYX3] [^114UAUU2].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Ezetimibe 10 mg daily monotherapy lowers LDL-C by about 18% on average, with a typical range of 15–20% and minimal dependence on baseline LDL-C, onset within about 2 weeks, and sustained effect with adherence. This degree of LDL-C lowering is expected to translate into a modest but meaningful relative risk reduction in major vascular events proportional to the absolute LDL-C decrease, with the absolute benefit greatest in higher-risk patients [^112LxuBB] [^112zAqo3] [^115tMsyg] [^112e2MNn].

---

Ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg daily) lowers LDL cholesterol by **15–20%** [^112zAqo3] on average, with a typical reduction of about 18% [^112LxuBB]. The effect is consistent across age, sex, and baseline LDL-C [^115tMsyg], and the maximal response is achieved within 2 weeks [^115tMsyg] and maintained with continued therapy. Ezetimibe is well tolerated [^112LxuBB] and is appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate statins or as add-on therapy when additional LDL-C lowering is needed [^112SYNSK].

## LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe monotherapy

- **Average LDL-C reduction**: 15–20% [^112zAqo3], with a mean of ~18% in clinical trials [^112LxuBB] [^113QRWv6].
- **Consistency**: The reduction is consistent across age, sex, and baseline LDL-C [^115tMsyg].
- **Time to effect**: Maximal or near-maximal response is achieved within 2 weeks [^115tMsyg] and maintained with continued therapy.

## Clinical evidence supporting LDL-C reduction

Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate the **LDL-C-lowering efficacy** of ezetimibe monotherapy:

| **Study** | **Design** | **Ldl-c reduction (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis of 8 RCTs | Ezetimibe 10 mg vs placebo | -18.58% (95% CI: -19.67 to -17.48) [^112LxuBB] |
| FDA clinical trials | Ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy | ~18% [^113QRWv6] |
| National Lipid Association | Ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy | 15–20% [^112zAqo3] |

---

## Comparison with other lipid-lowering therapies

Ezetimibe's LDL-C reduction is **modest compared with statins** but meaningful, especially for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional LDL-C lowering beyond statins:

- **Statins**: Lower LDL-C by 30–50% (moderate intensity) and ≥ 50% (high intensity) [^114UAUU2].
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Lower LDL-C by an additional ~60% when added to statins [^113iCB7q].
- **Bempedoic acid**: Lowers LDL-C by ~18% as monotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from major cardiovascular societies provide clear recommendations on the use of ezetimibe monotherapy:

- **ACC/AHA 2022**: Recommends ezetimibe as the initial nonstatin therapy for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional LDL-C lowering beyond statins [^115toYX3].
- **ESC/EAS 2019**: Recommends ezetimibe as an alternative or adjunctive therapy for patients who cannot achieve LDL-C goals with statins alone or are statin-intolerant [^115Qxm5F].
- **CCS 2021**: Recommends ezetimibe as an alternative therapy for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional LDL-C lowering [^114maNHF].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from ezetimibe monotherapy

Ezetimibe monotherapy is **particularly beneficial** for the following patient populations:

- **Statin-intolerant patients**: Patients who experience muscle-related side effects or other adverse effects with statins [^117NA1Er].
- **Primary hypercholesterolemia**: Patients with mild to moderate elevations in LDL-C who do not require aggressive lipid-lowering therapy [^115tMsyg].
- **High-risk patients**: Patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk who require additional LDL-C lowering beyond statins [^115toYX3].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Ezetimibe is **generally well tolerated**, with minimal adverse effects. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, and headache, and serious adverse effects — such as hepatotoxicity and myopathy — are rare. Routine liver enzyme monitoring is not required unless combined with a statin or in patients with liver disease.

---

## Limitations and considerations

While ezetimibe effectively lowers LDL-C, its **cardiovascular outcome data as monotherapy are limited** [^113wm6P5]. The IMPROVE-IT trial demonstrated cardiovascular benefit when ezetimibe was added to statin therapy, but similar robust outcome data for monotherapy are lacking [^111Qosxh]. Therefore, ezetimibe is generally recommended as adjunctive therapy or for patients who cannot tolerate statins [^115toYX3].

---

Ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg daily) lowers LDL cholesterol by **15–20%** [^112zAqo3], with a typical reduction of about 18% [^112LxuBB]. It is well tolerated and appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate statins or as add-on therapy when additional LDL-C lowering is needed [^112SYNSK].

### Statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events [^114Wj6SJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the physiologically normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the thresholds for development of atherosclerosis and adverse coronary events are in the 30- to 70-mg/dl range. More patients have been studied in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of statins on outcomes than any other drug class in the history of medicine. This cumulative body of evidence documents that atherosclerosis progression is halted and coronary heart disease events are minimized when statin therapy with or without ezetimibe, and possibly proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, is used to drive down the LDL-C to a range of about 30 to 50 mg/dl. Thus far, these agents appear to be safe even when LDL-C is lowered to about 50 mg/dl, although more robust outcome and safety data are required, particularly for the PCSK9 inhibitors and very low LDL-C levels (e.g., down to 25 mg/dl). In conclusion, the current national guidelines specifying only the use of a high-potency statin without specific LDL-C goals may lead to substantial undertreatment of high-risk patients, leaving them vulnerable to future adverse cardiovascular events.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113Pgdw6]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) — mechanism, dosing, efficacy, and pediatric considerations are summarized as follows: Ezetimibe lowers LDL–C levels by upregulating LDL–C receptors, and in adults its effect with statins is additive, giving an additional 20 percent lowering of LDL–C levels with a dose of 10 mg/day recommended. In pediatrics, a recent RCT in ages 10–17 years with FH showed that ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin produced significantly greater LDL–C reductions than simvastatin alone and was safe and well-tolerated for up to 53 weeks. At present, there is no evidence that adding ezetimibe to a statin prevents atherosclerosis or events, and there are no published studies of monotherapy in children. Ezetimibe might be considered for children and adolescents under the care of a lipid specialist who do not meet LDL–C therapeutic targets on a statin alone, and given a 2009 FDA safety alert in adults, ezetimibe should be used only in consultation with a lipid specialist.

Cholesterol absorption inhibition

Ezetimibe, the only available cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers LDL-C by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 in the upper small intestine. Ezetimibe is available at a single dose of 10 mg daily and specifically lowers LDL-C levels by 18% to 25%; the ezetimibe-statin combination can lower LDL-C by up to 70%. Ezetimibe is well tolerated with minimal side effects. The cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe was demonstrated in the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial study, which enrolled 18 144 patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study showed that reducing LDL-C from 1.8. to 1.4 mmol/L by adding ezetimibe to statin therapy over 7 years was associated with a further ~7% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, which was even more pronounced among patients with diabetes. Other randomized trials showed cardiovascular benefit of ezetimibe when used as monotherapy in patients > 75 years and in combination with a statin in patients with renal impairment. Ezetimibe is a second-line agent in clinical practice guidelines and is often prescribed to statin-intolerant patients.

### Drug insight: the role of statins in combination with ezetimibe to lower LDL cholesterol [^1176sgGU]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are well documented. Undertreatment of dyslipidemia remains pervasive, however, and the introduction of more-aggressive optional LDL-cholesterol targets in US guidelines only heightens the challenges of reaching the target values. Combination therapy with a statin and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe could help in the management of patients who have an inadequate reduction in cholesterol after making changes to lifestyle or taking statins alone. The effects of the combination on cardiovascular risk remain speculative, however, and clinical trials are in development. In this Review we consider the rationale for combination therapy in the context of achieving LDL-cholesterol goals.

### Emerging innovative therapeutic approaches targeting PCSK9 to lower lipids [^117Unybz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are established therapies for cardiovascular disease prevention and ezetimibe has recently been shown to modestly reduce cardiovascular events when added to background statin therapy. Yet here remains a clear unmet need for additional therapies aimed at lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to further reduce cardiovascular risk. Multiple strategies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition have emerged as effective modalities for LDL-C lowering. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are the farthest along in clinical development and alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies in 2015. In addition to robust LDL-C lowering (nearly 50–65% from baseline), they improve other lipid parameters as well. Adverse events associated with these medications are minimal. Importantly, they improve clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes, although long-term study results are awaited. Cost may be an important limiting factor in their use and we propose two possible solutions which can potentially curtail cost.

Ezetimibe add-on therapy — an randomized controlled trial (RCT) of simvastatin 80 mg daily with or without ezetimibe 10 mg daily over 2 years showed greater LDL-C reduction with combined therapy but no difference in carotid intima-media thickness and was not powered to examine ASCVD events; a very large placebo-controlled RCT over 7 years found that adding ezetimibe 10 mg to simvastatin 40 mg daily resulted in greater ASCVD risk reduction than statin monotherapy; in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia who adhere to statins but achieve < 50% reduction in LDL-C with maximally tolerated statin therapy and have an LDL-C level ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), additional ASCVD risk reduction from ezetimibe add-on therapy is likely through additional LDL-C lowering.

Simulation ofLowering With Each Intervention

The impact of treating a population with each intervention was explored using simulation techniques. Using the DA VINCI (The EU‐Wide Cross‐Sectional Observational Study of Lipid Modifying Therapy Use in Secondary and Primary Care) study, a European Union–wide cross‐sectional observational study of lipid‐modifying therapy use in secondary and primary care, we estimated the mean (and SD) LDL‐C for the group of patients with ASCVD receiving stabilized statin therapy without ezetimibe or PCSK9i. Assuming a normal distribution, we simulated 10 000 LDL‐C values, and values > 70 mg/dL (> 1.8 mmol/L) were selected to represent a hypothetical pool of patients requiring additional LLT. We then simulated the LDL‐C reduction achieved by each intervention by randomly sampling from a normal distribution with mean estimated from the primary NMA and SD estimate obtained from a specific clinical trial (Table S1). The NMA does not provide any information about the variability between individuals; hence, to estimate the SD, a single clinical trial was selected for each intervention, with a preference given to the largest study with the time point closest to 12 weeks. For ezetimibe, only studies that included patients stabilized on statin at randomization were considered as a source for the SD, because, for the studies that included patients not stabilized on statin at randomization, percentage reduction in LDL‐C from baseline of ezetimibe versus placebo had been derived from the data provided (statin plus ezetimibe versus statin plus placebo). The posttreatment LDL‐C was calculated, and it was assessed whether each value decreased below 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L), the goal recommended in the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for very high‐risk patients (eg, those who have ASCVD).

Ezetimibe Tablet, added to on-going statin therapy, significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared with a statin administered alone (see Table 7). LDL-C reductions induced by Ezetimibe Tablet were generally consistent across all statins.

* Patients receiving each statin: 40% atorvastatin, 31% simvastatin, 29% others (pravastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin).

†Baseline - on a statin alone.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UxjEg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality and disability, with elevated serum lipid levels, particularly low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as one of its major risk factors. Lowering LDL‐C is crucial in mitigating the negative outcomes of CVD, especially in patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the first‐line therapy for patients with ASCVD for LDL‐C elevations, but many patients on low/moderate‐intensity statin regimens fail to attain target LDL‐C levels. Contemporary guidelines recommend high‐intensity statins for hyperlipidemia treatment, but they come with challenges such as drug interactions and dose‐dependent adverse events. An alternative approach is combining ezetimibe, a non‐statin drug, with tolerated stain dosage. Ezetimibe has shown efficacy in lowering LDL‐C alongside a more favorable safety profile. However, previous meta‐analyses have shown conflicting information regarding the superiority in efficacy or safety profile of high‐intensity statin monotherapy compared to low/moderate‐intensity statin combined with ezetimibe therapy. Given the recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these two lipid‐lowering strategies in ASCVD patients.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114KBUar]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC nonstatin LDL-C lowering — escalation thresholds and use of bempedoic acid — states that if additional LDL-C lowering is desired (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL [or non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL]) after the addition of ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 mAb, it is reasonable to engage in a clinician-patient discussion with consideration of the net benefit of bempedoic acid; factors that may favor bempedoic acid include a mean expected reduction of approximately 17%, and bempedoic acid should be used with caution in patients who have a history of gout or tendon rupture, and it may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents simultaneously to more rapidly reduce the risk of events.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Monitoring in response to LDL-C–lowering therapy — adherence and effects should be checked by measurement of fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter, and the maximum percentage change will occur by 4 to 12 weeks after starting a statin or combined therapy. Good adherence to LDL-lowering diets will reduce LDL-C by 10% to > 15%; moderate-intensity statins can be expected to reduce LDL-C by another 30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥ 50%; adding ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants to a statin typically provides an additional 15% to 25% reduction in LDL-C, with much greater additive reductions when a PCSK9 inhibitor is added to statin plus ezetimibe.

### Efficacy and safety of statins, ezetimibe and statins-ezetimibe therapies for children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^115rrLd3]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Newer generation PCSK9i studies, inclisiran and bempedoic acid were excluded from this review, as they are not commonly used in practice. Although evolocumab and alirocumab are now licensed in children, they are not recommended for in current paediatric guidelines. Trials evaluating these therapies in paediatric FH were published in 2020 and February 2024. This trial evidence indicates that evolocumab and alirocumab may significantly reduce LDL-C in HeFH paediatric patients inadequately controlled with statins, and may become a relevant adjunct to paediatric HeFH management in a subset of patients.

4.2 Clinical implications

Most trials started LLT at low doses, which is reflective of current practice. This review supports existing guidelines on paediatric HeFH management and provides further evidence to support statin dose-escalation and/or addition of ezetimibe where LDL-C targets are not met, where safe, tolerated and age-appropriate.

4.3 Research recommendations

Future evidence is required to establish the longer-term efficacy and safety of LLTs. Direct evidence could confirm the findings from our indirect comparisons, although we recognise it is highly unlikely that direct randomised comparisons may be published in the future for all possible comparisons included in this NMA. Future research will help to inform guidance on an optimal age and LDL-C levels for treatment initiation in children and LDL-C targets. Future studies should investigate the impact of dose-titration on LDL-C targets and adherence.

4.4 Conclusions

Statins, ezetimibe and statins-ezetimibe combination therapy all lead to clinically significant reductions in LDL-C and TC, reductions in TG, and increases in HDL-C. All LLTs were generally well-tolerated and there was no evidence that LLTs had an adverse impact on maturation or safety, although trial duration was limited. The effectiveness and safety evidence for ezetimibe is limited by the number of trials evaluating this therapy.

The magnitude of LDL-C reductions varies and may depend on dosage and the addition of ezetimibe. Higher-dose and intermediate dose statins combined with ezetimibe are probably similarly effective and superior to intermediate-and lower-dose therapies. There is no evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between ezetimibe monotherapy and lower-to intermediate-dose statins. Intermediate-dose statins may be slightly more effective than lower-dose statins, although the difference is likely to be small.

Severe hypercholesterolemia — Synopsis emphasizes that patients have a high lifetime risk and decisions about statins do not require atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scoring; benefits are linked to interventions that increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing greater risk reduction with statins than placebo and greater reduction from higher- versus moderate-intensity statins. Ezetimibe plus a moderate-intensity statin is associated with greater LDL-C reduction than statin monotherapy in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and reduces ASCVD risk more than moderate-intensity monotherapy in those with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In selected patients whose LDL-C remains inadequately controlled on drug therapy, LDL apheresis is an option, and referral to a lipid specialist may be indicated.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^112k1kmJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets were compared to those receiving all doses of simvastatin, ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG, and non-HDL-C. The effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets on HDL-C were similar to the effects seen with simvastatin. Further analysis showed ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets significantly increased HDL-C compared with placebo (see Table 7). The lipid response to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets was similar in patients with TG levels greater than or less than 200 mg/dL.

In a multicenter, double-blind, controlled, 23 week study, 710 patients with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents, as defined by the NCEP ATP III guidelines, and an LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL were randomized to one of four treatment groups: coadministered ezetimibe and simvastatin equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets (10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, and 10 mg/40 mg) or simvastatin 20 mg. Patients not reaching an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL had their simvastatin dose titrated at 6 week intervals to a maximal dose of 80 mg.

At Week 5, the LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg, or 10 mg/40 mg were significantly larger than with simvastatin 20 mg (see Table 8).

### US public health gains from improved treatment of hypercholesterolemia: a simulation study of NHANES adults treated to guideline-directed therapy [^111fYSVJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hypercholesterolemia is widely undertreated.

Objective

To project anticipated improvements in treatment and outcomes under full implementation of US and European pharmacologic treatment recommendations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The study sample included a total of 4980 adults aged 40–75 years from the 2013 through March 2020 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We estimated the number of individuals eligible to receive versus currently receiving lipid lowering therapy (LLT) after applying: (1) the AHA/ACC guideline ("2018 US guideline"); (2) the ESC/EAS guideline ("2019 EU guideline"); and (3) the ACC expert decision pathway ("2022 US pathway").

Main Outcomes and Measures

(1) Number of individuals eligible for LLT; and (2) expected reduction in LDL-C and major cardiovascular events.

Results

The study sample represented 131 million US adults. A total of 23% of the NHANES primary prevention cohort was currently using LLT compared to the 2018 US guideline/2022 US pathway (47% eligible) and the 2019 EU guideline (87% eligible). LLT use was significantly lower than the proportion of eligible patients for all therapies, including statins (66% use vs. 100% eligibility), ezetimibe (4% vs. 31–74% eligibility under the various recommendations) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) (0% vs. 11–53% eligibility). The additional overall median LDL-C reduction expected under fully guideline concordant care was 37.2 (IQR 6.7–57.6) mg/dL, 48.5 (IQR 33.0–69.9) mg/dL, and 46.8 (IQR 7.2–67.6) mg/dL based on the 2018 US guideline, 2019 EU guideline and the 2022 US pathway, respectively. These reductions in LDL-C could yield a 21–27% relative reduction in risk of major cardiovascular events.

Conclusions and Relevance

Aligning treatment of hypercholesterolemia with US and European guidelines would generate major clinical and public health gains.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^1173efH4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction and PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) selection — After ezetimibe lowering (reduction of 90 mg/dL to 68 mg/dL), the 10-year ASCVD risk would be 40%; IMPROVE-IT showed a 34% risk over 7 years in the placebo-statin group, and the ezetimibe effect extrapolates to a 42% 10-year risk. If an LDL-C of 70 mg/dL is used as a strict threshold, a patient might be considered no longer a PCSK9 mAb candidate despite potential benefit from further LDL-C lowering. For patients whose risk remains very or extremely high, or if LDL-C levels are < 100 mg/dL or response to ezetimibe is less than expected, it may be more cost-effective and clinically efficacious to initiate a PCSK9 mAb rather than ezetimibe; however, it is reasonable to consider adding ezetimibe per the 2018 Cholesterol guidelines to assess for a larger-than-expected LDL-C reduction.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) — discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurs in about 5% of patients and common adverse effects are gastrointestinal with occasional increases in liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase with muscle symptoms; ezetimibe is administered as a 10 mg tablet once daily; in IMPROVE-IT, ezetimibe with a statin versus a statin alone in 18,144 post-acute coronary syndrome patients produced an additional 16.7 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L) decrease in LDL-C with on-treatment [1-year] levels of 69.9 and 53.2 mg/dL, respectively, and was associated with a statistically significant 10% reduction in a composite CVD outcome; this reduction aligns with a predicted estimate assuming each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) LDL-C lowering produces a 22% ASCVD event risk reduction (16.7 mg/dL ÷ 38.7 mg/dL = 0.4; 0.4 × 22% = 8.8%).

### Time-dependent cardiovascular treatment benefit model for lipid-lowering therapies [^115MnGUg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background With the availability of new lipid-lowering therapy options, there is a need to compare the expected clinical benefit of different treatment strategies in different patient populations and over various time frames. We aimed to develop a time-dependent model from published randomized controlled trials summarizing the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction and to apply the model to investigate the effect of treatment scenarios over time. Methods and Results A cardiovascular treatment benefit model was specified with parameters as time since treatment initiation, magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction, and additional patient characteristics. The model was estimated from randomized controlled trial data from 22 trials for statins and nonstatins. In 15 trials, the new time-dependent model had better predictions than cholesterol treatment trialists' estimations for a composite of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. In explored scenarios, absolute risk reduction ≥ 2% with intensive treatment with high-intensity statin, ezetimibe, and high-dose proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor compared with high- or moderate-intensity statin alone were achieved in higher-risk populations with 2 to 5 years of treatment, and lower-risk populations with 9 to 11 years of treatment. Conclusions The time-dependent model accurately predicted treatment benefit seen from randomized controlled trials with a given lipid-lowering therapy by incorporating patient profile, timing, duration, and treatment type. The model can facilitate decision making and scenario analyses with a given lipid-lowering therapy strategy in various patient populations and time frames by providing an improved assessment of treatment benefit over time.

### Changes in prescription patterns before and after reporting of the ezetimibe and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemia enhances atherosclerosis regression trial (ENHANCE) results and expected effects on low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol reduction [^117X79nf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent trends suggest a decreased use of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination and coadministered ezetimibe plus statin therapies.

Objective

This analysis evaluated changes in prescription patterns for ezetimibe/simvastatin, ezetimibe plus statins, and statin therapies and expected effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering during 2007 to 2008.

Methods

Prescription pattern changes were assessed by the use of patient-level data from the IMS Health Longitudinal Rx database during two time periods, July 14, 2007 to January 13, 2008 (n = 8,813,674) and January 14, 2008 to July 13, 2008 (n = 9,131,030), 6 months before and after reporting of the results of The Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia Enhances Atherosclerosis Regression trial (ENHANCE) trial on January 14, 2008. Expected LDL-C reductions were estimated using data from previous controlled clinical trials.

Results

During 6 months post-ENHANCE, greater proportions of patients were switched from ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe plus statins to other lipid-lowering therapies by health care providers than 6 months pre-ENHANCE (21.1% vs 6.0% and 46.9% vs 38.5%, differences: -15.06% [95% confidence interval -15.14%, -14.97%] and -8.43% [95% confidence interval -8.70%, -8.17%], respectively). Greater proportions of these patients switched to statin monotherapy in the later than earlier period. Prescription patterns were similar for statins during both time periods, although fewer patients switched to ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe plus statin therapies post-ENHANCE. In both time periods, greater proportions of patients on ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe plus statins switched to less-than-equivalent LDL-C lowering efficacy doses of statins than those on statin therapy. On the basis of previous clinical data for these therapies, smaller LDL-C reductions would be expected in patients who switched from ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe plus statins to statins, despite a trend toward switching to greater statin doses in the later time period.

Conclusions

More patients switched from ezetimibe/simvastatin and ezetimibe plus statin to statin monotherapy 6 months after the reporting of the ENHANCE trial, the majority of which were prescribed less potent, LDL-C-lowering therapies. On the basis of the known LDL-C lowering efficacies for these therapies, such changes would be expected to increase LDL-C levels in these patients and may reduce the proportion of patients who achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals.

### Use of lipid-lowering therapy after ischaemic stroke and expected benefit from intensification of treatment [^1168eZ4u]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

LDL-C control and expected LDL-C with up-titration of LLT

LDL-C ≤ 1.8 mmol/L was defined as target attainmentand 3-month levels were used as the basis for theoretical intensification. Guidelines recommend statins at maximally tolerated dose (step 1) and use of ezetimibe (step 2) in patients unable to achieve the target with statin monotherapy or statin intolerance. The potent and expensive proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are mainly considered for patients still not reaching targets (step 3).

We included patients receiving LLT at discharge in these analyses. We used mean % reduction in LDL-C derived from randomised clinical trials as previously presented and validated(online supplemental methods, online supplemental table S1). First, all patients with LDL-C > 1.8 mmol/L not using HIS was up-titrated to HIS, assuming a 50.2% mean reduction in LDL-C (the effect of atorvastatin 80 mg). If the expected LDL-C then was > 1.8 mmol/L, ezetimibe was added, assuming a mean 22.7% reduction in LDL-C. We also estimated the effect of adding ezetimibe without increased statin doses, assuming patients already used maximally tolerated statin.

### Effect of ezetimibe coadministered with atorvastatin in 628 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia: a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial [^1132eMY7]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the established efficacy of statins, many patients do not achieve recommended LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. Contributing factors may be inadequate dosing, increased risk for adverse effects with high-dose monotherapy, and increased potential for intolerance and adverse effects with combinations of available agents.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind study, 628 patients with baseline LDL-C 145 to 250 mg/dL and triglycerides ≤ 350 mg/dL were randomly assigned to receive 1 of the following for 12 weeks: ezetimibe (10 mg/d); atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); ezetimibe (10 mg) plus atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/d); or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was percentage reduction in LDL-C for pooled ezetimibe plus atorvastatin versus pooled atorvastatin treatment groups. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin significantly improved LDL-C, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL-C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) compared with atorvastatin alone (P < 0.01). Coadministration of ezetimibe provided a significant additional 12% LDL-C reduction, 3% HDL-C increase, 8% triglyceride reduction, and 10% hs-CRP reduction versus atorvastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 50% to 60%, triglyceride reductions of 30% to 40%, and HDL-C increases of 5% to 9%, depending on atorvastatin dose. LDL-C reductions with ezetimibe plus 10 mg atorvastatin (50%) and 80 mg atorvastatin alone (51%) were similar.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to atorvastatin alone and to placebo. When coadministered with atorvastatin, ezetimibe provided significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and triglycerides and increases in HDL-C. Coadministration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin offers a well-tolerated and highly efficacious new treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes [^111Qosxh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes — In stable patients who had an acute coronary syndrome and LDL cholesterol within guideline recommendations, the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy further lowered the risk of cardiovascular events, with the event reduction consistent with the predicted effects seen with statins even at low LDL cholesterol levels, and no offsetting adverse events or toxic effects observed. The authors note the trial had a particularly long duration of follow-up, they nonetheless found a significant benefit, and they state that if adherence had been higher, one might anticipate that a greater clinical benefit might have been seen.

### Safety and efficacy of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe versus high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis [^114Cdjjn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), affects approximately 18.6 million individuals worldwide and poses a significant healthcare related challenge. Despite the established efficacy of both high-intensity statin monotherapy (HIS) and moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe (MIS+EZT) in ASCVD management, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear.

Methods

A thorough literature study was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases, focusing on studies that compared the effects of MIS+EZT with HIS monotherapy in ASCVD patients.

Results

In the 13 included studies, involving 8,592 patients, 4,525 (52.67%) of which received moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe treatment. The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 156 weeks, with participant ages varying from 55.2 to 71 years old. Analysis revealed that MIS+EZT was associated with a significantly greater percentage of patients who achieved the goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dL. (odds ratio [OR] 1.76; 95% CI [1.26; 2.45]; p = 0.001; I² = 73%); LDL-C reduction (mean difference [MD] -5.05 mg/dL; 95% CI [-9.02;-1.07]; p < 0.013; I² = 56%); total cholesterol reduction (MD -7.91 mg/ dL; 95% CI [-14.90; -0.91]; p < 0.027; I² = 60%) and triglyceride reduction (MD -8.20 mg/ dL; 95% CI [-13.05; -3.35]; p < 0.001; I² = 2%). There was no statistical difference between groups in drug adverse reaction (risk ratio [RR] 1.19; 95% CI [0.79; 1.78]; p = 0.404; I² = 0%) and drug intolerance (RR 0.78; 95% CI [0.32; 1.92]; p = 0.584; I² = 35%).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis highlights the effectiveness of MIS+EZT in significantly improving lipid profile components for ASCVD patients, as can been seen through the greater percentage of patients achieving the LDL-C < 70 mg/dL target and lower LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Importantly, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of overall adverse events and adverse drug reactions between the two groups.

### Lipid-altering efficacy of ezetimibe plus statin and statin monotherapy and identification of factors associated with treatment response: a pooled analysis of over 21, 000 subjects from 27 clinical trials [^114XdPkY]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with dyslipoproteinemia constitute the largest risk group for development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite extensive statin use, many patients with CVD risk do not achieve guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets. This pooled analysis of 27 previously published clinical trials conducted between 1999 and 2008 evaluated the lipid-altering efficacy and factors related to treatment response of ezetimibe combined with statin and statin monotherapy.

Methods

Patient-level data were combined from double-blind, placebo-controlled or active comparator studies randomizing adult subjects to ezetimibe 10mg plus statin (n = 11,714) versus statin alone (n = 10,517) for 6–24 weeks (mean = 9 weeks). Association of factors with treatment response, percent change from baseline LDL-C and other lipids, and attainment of guideline-recommended lipid and lipoprotein targets were evaluated.

Results

Higher baseline LDL-C, diabetes mellitus, Black race, greater age, and male gender were associated with small but significantly greater percent reductions in LDL-C regardless of treatment. Treatment influenced efficacy, with ezetimibe plus statin producing significantly greater reductions in LDL-C, total-cholesterol, non-HDL-C, ApoB, triglycerides, lipid ratios, hs-CRP; significantly larger increases in HDL-C and ApoA1; and significantly higher achievement of LDL-C (< 70mg/dl, < 100mg/dl), non-HDL-C (< 100mg/dl, < 130mg/dl), and ApoB (< 80mg/dl, < 90mg/dl) targets than statin monotherapy at statin potencies compared (p < 0.0001 for all). Differential treatment effects were seen with first-/second-line therapy and statin potency.

Conclusion

These results suggest that patient characteristics have a limited influence on response to lipid-lowering therapy and demonstrate the consistent treatment effect of ezetimibe combined with statin and statin monotherapy across a diverse patient population.

Ezetimibe benefit estimates — modeled numbers needed to treat (NNT): For patients with LDL-C near 70 mg/dL, the calculated 5-year NNTs range from 131 to 56 as 10-year ASCVD risk increases from 20% to 45%. Even for patients with very high 10-year ASCVD risk of 30%, the 5-year NNT is 88 when LDL-C is close to 70 mg/dL, 61 when LDL-C is close to 100 mg/dL, and 47 when LDL-C is close to 130 mg/dL. These calculations used the 22% relative risk reduction per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C observed in the CTT meta-analysis.

### Therapeutic practice patterns related to statin potency and ezetimibe / simvastatin combination therapies in lowering LDL-C in patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease [^112oKuMk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Statin combination therapy and statin uptitration have been shown to be efficacious in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering and are recommended for patients with high-risk coronary heart disease (CHD) who do not reach guideline-endorsed LDL-C goals on statin monotherapy.

Objective

This analysis evaluated treatment practice patterns and LDL-C lowering for patients with CHD/CHD risk equivalent on statin monotherapy in a real-world practice setting in the United States.

Methods

In this retrospective, observational study, patients with CHD/CHD risk equivalent on statin therapy were identified during 2004 to 2008 in a US managed care database. Prescribing patterns and effect of switching from statin monotherapy to combination ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy vs uptitration to higher statin dose/potency level and no change from initial statin potency on LDL-C lowering were assessed. Percentage of change from baseline in LDL-C levels and odds ratios for LDL-C goal attainment were estimated with analyses of covariance and logistic regression.

Results

Of 27,919 eligible patients on statin therapy, 2671 (9.6%) switched to ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy, 11,035 (39.5%) uptitrated statins, and 14,213 (50.9%) remained on the same statin monotherapy. LDL-C reduction from baseline and attainment of LDL-C < 100 and < 70 mg/dL were substantially greater for patients who switched to ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy (-24.0%, 81.2%, and 35.2%, respectively) than for patients who titrated (-9.6%, 68.0%, and 18.4%, respectively) or remained on initial statin therapy (4.9%, 72.2%, and 23.7%, respectively). The odds ratios for attainment of LDL-C < 100 and < 70 mg/dL were also higher for patients who switched than for patients who uptitrated and had no therapy change than for patients who titrated vs no therapy change. Similarly, among a subgroup of patients not at LDL-C < 100 mg/dL on baseline therapy, attainment of LDL-C < 100 and < 70 mg/dL was greater for patients who switched than for statin uptitration vs no change, as well as for patients who uptritrated statins vs no therapy change.

Conclusion

In this study, LDL-C lowering and goal attainment rates improved substantially for patients with high-risk CHD on statin monotherapy who switched to combination ezetimibe/statin or uptitrated their statin therapies; however, approximately one-third of these patients still did not attain the optional recommended LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL. Moreover, these higher efficacy lipid-lowering therapies were infrequently prescribed, indicating the need for further assessment of barriers to LDL-C goal attainment in actual practice settings.

### Rationale and design of IMPROVE-IT (IMProved reduction of outcomes: vytorin efficacy international trial): comparison of ezetimbe / simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^113TKfnw]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) improves clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). The combination of ezetimibe/simvastatin produces greater reductions in LDL-C compared to simvastatin monotherapy. The IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-control trial designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy, using ezetimibe/simvastatin, will translate into increased clinical benefit on cardiovascular outcomes relative to simvastatin monotherapy in patients with ACS.

Study Design

The study will recruit up to 18,000 moderate- to high-risk patients stabilized after ACS. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to once-daily doses of either ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 mg or simvastatin monotherapy 40 mg. Follow-up visits are at 1 and 4 months, and every 4 months thereafter. If consecutive measures of LDL-C are > 79 mg/dL at follow-up visits, the simvastatin dose will be increased to 80 mg in a double-blind manner. The primary end point is the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, rehospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization (occurring at least 30 days after randomization), or stroke. Patients will be followed for a minimum of 2.5 years and until at least 5,250 patients experience a primary end point.

Summary

IMPROVE-IT will determine whether the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy, using ezetimibe/simvastatin, improves cardiovascular outcomes compared with simvastatin monotherapy in patients after ACS. In addition, the difference in achieved LDL-C levels between the groups will provide data on whether the target for LDL-C lowering should be reduced further.

### Combination therapy with ezetimibe / simvastatin versus statin monotherapy for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and goal attainment in a real-world clinical setting [^114r7HqS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized studies have demonstrated improved attainment of target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values when ezetimibe is combined with statins for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, the efficacy of an intervention in randomized controlled clinical studies may not correlate with its efficacy in a real-world (community practice) setting. Data to support the LDL-C lowering efficacy of ezetimibe/simvastatin (EZE/SMV) outside of controlled clinical studies are currently lacking.

Objective

Using patient data from a large, national, administrative claims database, this retrospective observational study evaluated the efficacy of EZE/SMV in lowering LDL-C values and achieving LDL-C target values in newly initiating users and compared the results with those from several statin monotherapies.

Methods

Patients with hypercholesterolemia who had filled their first prescription for EZE/SMV or statin monotherapy between July 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007, and were ≥ 18 years old were evaluated. Pertinent data taken from the database included lipid-lowering drug name, date of first prescription, dose, serum lipid levels, and sample dates. Data on cardiovascular history, diabetes, and other concurrent diseases and therapies were also available. Following propensity score matching, multivariate regression models were constructed to estimate the impact of the choice of therapy on key treatment outcomes including the reduction of LDL-C (absolute and percent) as well as the percent of patients achieving goal LDL-C levels as defined by the updated American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Guidelines for 2006.

Results

In the total population, both the percent decrease and the absolute reduction in LDL-C values were significantly greater with the use of EZE/SMV than with the 3 statin monotherapies (P < 0.005 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of patients achieved AHA/ACC LDL-C goals in the first 3 months of EZE/SMV treatment compared with those using each statin monotherapy (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Among matched patients with diagnosed diabetes, the percent reduction in LDL-C was also higher with the use of EZE/SMV than with each statin monotherapy (P < 0.005 for all comparisons).

Conclusion

In a real-world setting, EZE/SMV appeared to be more effective than simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin monotherapy for attaining therapeutic goals set forth by national and professional societies in patients being initiated on statin-based lipid-lowering therapy.

### Intensity of and adherence to lipid-lowering therapy as predictors of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease [^116HeKiJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Exposure Assessment

The use of LLT over time was ascertained through longitudinal evaluation of all pharmacy dispensations in Swedish pharmacies, which was obtained through linkage with the prescribed drug register. We extracted information on pharmacy fills with statins (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code C10AA) and ezetimibe (ATC code C10AX09) before and after the CHD event (Table 1). We summarized the expected percentage reduction in LDL‐C for each dose of each statin, using data derived from pivotal trials (Table 1). The percentage reduction with ezetimibe monotherapy of 19% classifies it as low intensity. When ezetimibe was combined with a statin we calculated the additional LDL‐C reduction on top of the percent reduction with statin therapy. We did not consider PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors in our analysis, because they were rarely prescribed. For each dispensation, the expected percent reduction in absolute LDL‐C is defined as its intensity.

### Evaluating cardiovascular event reduction with ezetimibe as an adjunct to simvastatin in 18, 144 patients after acute coronary syndromes: final baseline characteristics of the IMPROVE-IT study population [^1119tmNC]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) is evaluating the potential benefit for reduction in major cardiovascular (CV) events from the addition of ezetimibe versus placebo to 40 mg/d of simvastatin therapy in patients who present with acute coronary syndromes and have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≤ 125 mg/dL.

Methods

The primary composite end point is CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, rehospitalization for unstable angina (UA), and coronary revascularization (≥ 30 days postrandomization). The simvastatin monotherapy arm's LDL-C target is < 70 mg/dL. Ezetimibe was assumed to further lower LDL-C by 15 mg/dL and produce an estimated ~8% to 9% treatment effect. The targeted number of events is 5,250.

Results

We enrolled 18,144 patients with either ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI, n = 5,192) or UA/non-ST-segment elevation MI (UA/NSTEMI, n = 12,952) from October 2005 to July 2010. Western Europe (40%) and North America (38%) were the leading enrolling regions. The STEMI cohort was younger and had a higher percentage of patients naive to lipid-lowering treatment compared with the UA/NSTEMI cohort. The UA/NSTEMI group had a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and prior MI. Median LDL-C at entry was 100 mg/dL for STEMI and 93 mg/dL for UA/NSTEMI patients.

Conclusions

This trial is evaluating LDL-C lowering beyond previously targeted LDL-C levels. The results depend on achieving the desired separation of LDL-C with ezetimibe and on the assumption that ezetimibe's lowering of LDL-C will have similar event reduction efficacy as the LDL-C lowering from a statin. The results could affect future therapies and guidelines.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VQNXt]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high-intensity statin regimens.

Hypothesis

A combination of low/moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high-intensity statin monotherapy.

Methods

We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug-related adverse events, and MACE components between high-intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = -6.6, 95% CI: -10.6 to -2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate-intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL-C levels, a lower rate of myalgia, and less drug discontinuation compared to high-intensity statin monotherapy in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. However, according to our meta-analysis, the observed reduction in LDL-C levels in the combination group did not correlate with a reduction in MACE compared to the high-intensity statin group.

### Projected outcomes of optimized statin and ezetimibe therapy in US military veterans with coronary artery disease [^116B7Y8h]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Projected LDL-C With Optimized LLT

During the observation period, time-varying optimal LDL-C levels were projected for each patient as the observed LDL-C value minus the expected reduction in LDL-C with clinically appropriate optimized statin therapy alone or optimized statin therapy with ezetimibe (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Optimized statin therapy was individualized (reduced dose or no statin) for patients with relative or absolute contraindications to treatment (eMethods in Supplement 1). For patients without contraindications, optimized statin therapy was considered high-intensity treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg daily, assumed to result in a 54% reduction in LDL-C from an untreated baseline. Treatment with ezetimibe 10-mg was considered an appropriate addition in all cases. Ezetimibe treatment was assumed to result in a further 15% reduction in LDL-C levels from the LDL-C level on an optimized statin regimen.

Outcomes

The outcomes evaluated were all-cause death, rehospitalization for myocardial infarction, rehospitalization for stroke, and coronary revascularization more than 30 days after the index angiography. All patients had a minimum follow-up period of 30 days and were followed up to death, 4 years, or September 30, 2021, whichever came first.

3 Results

The search strategy yielded a total of 3060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening of articles, 32 trials were included in the meta‐analysis (Figure 1). Inter‐reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow chart.

The included articles consisted of 12 042 ASCVD patients, among which 5880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, whereas 6162 participants received high‐intensity statin monotherapy. The included studies employed various statins, namely rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), whereas blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline. Supporting Information S1: Table 3 provides an overview of the key characteristics of the included studies.

3.1 Laboratory Data

Twenty‐one studies compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL‐C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5). However, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted among the included studies (I 2 = 84%, p < 0.01) (Figure 2A). The preliminary inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's regression showed no statistical evidence of publication bias (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1A). The observed effects remained consistent when considering treatment durations of less than 12 months or more than 12 months (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2A). The reduction in LDL‐C levels was exclusively observed in atorvastatin and rosuvastatin subgroups (p < 0.001) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2B). Considering different subgroups, the heterogeneity of effect was not due to variations in used statins or treatment durations across the included studies.

### Fixed-dose combination of obicetrapib and ezetimibe for LDL cholesterol reduction (TANDEM): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116P1tFw]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Reducing LDL cholesterol prevents atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of obicetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, and ezetimibe.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind trial across 48 US sites including hospitals, private and group practices, and independent research centres included participants at least 18 years old with pre-existing or high risk for ASVCD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia with LDL cholesterol concentrations of 1·8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or greater despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy excluding ezetimibe, or having statin intolerance. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to obicetrapib 10 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg FDC, obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy, ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy, or placebo administered daily for 84 days. The co-primary endpoints in the intention-to-treat population were the percent LDL cholesterol changes in the FDC group compared with placebo, ezetimibe monotherapy, and obicetrapib monotherapy, and the placebo-adjusted change in the obicetrapib monotherapy group. The trial was prospectively registered (NCT06005597) and is completed.

Findings

Between March 4 and July 3, 2024, 407 participants were randomly assigned. The median age was 68·0 years (IQR 62·0–73·0) and 177 (43%) were female. Mean baseline LDL cholesterol was 2·4 mmol/L, 2·5 mmol/L, 2·6 mmol/L, and 2·5 mmol/L in the placebo (n = 102), ezetimibe monotherapy (n = 101), obicetrapib monotherapy (n = 102), and FDC groups (n = 102), respectively. At day 84, percent differences in LDL cholesterol reduction with the FDC were -48·6% (95% CI -58·3 to -38·9) versus placebo, -27·9% (-37·5 to -18·4) versus ezetimibe, and -16·8% (-26·4 to -7·1) versus obicetrapib. Obicetrapib monotherapy decreased LDL cholesterol by 31·9% (22·1 to 41·6) versus placebo. Adverse event rates were similar in the FDC (52 [51%] of 102), obicetrapib (55 [54%] of 102), and ezetimibe (54 [53%] of 101) groups and lowest with placebo (38 [37%] of 102). Serious adverse event rates were generally similar across FDC (three [3%] of 102), obicetrapib (six [6%] of 102), ezetimibe (seven [7%] of 101), and placebo (four [4%] of 102) groups. Deaths occurred in one [1%] of 102 participants with FDC, one [1%] of 102 with obicetrapib, one [1%] of 101 with ezetimibe, and none with placebo.

Interpretation

Combination therapy of obicetrapib and ezetimibe significantly reduced LDL cholesterol. This oral, single-pill therapy could improve LDL cholesterol management in patients with pre-existing or high risk for ASCVD.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HeVpa]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The meta‐analysis by Zhu et al. published in 2020 compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin and ezetimibe combination therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk. Consistent with the present study, it reported that the combination therapy was more efficient in reaching target LDL‐C levels compared to statin monotherapy by including 14 studies. However, in contrast to our findings, a greater reduction in non‐HDL and TC levels was observed in the combination therapy group. The findings of this meta‐analysis have been updated through our meta‐analysis by including a larger number of recent studies. Additionally, the results of the aforementioned study were limited to treatment durations under 1 year, whereas our study demonstrated that the benefits of combination therapy on LDL‐C levels persist even in longer treatment durations. It is worth noting that LDL‐C reduction is the primary treatment goal for patients with CVD. By combining a low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, clinicians can achieve more LDL‐C reduction, which may translate to improved long‐term cardiovascular outcomes. However, the lack of significant difference in other lipid parameters suggests that the benefits of combination therapy may be primarily driven by the enhanced LDL‐C lowering effect. One reason for this observation is that the regulation of LDL‐C is more directly linked to the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway inhibited by statins. Additionally, patients with different baseline lipid abnormalities may respond differently to statin therapy. For example, individuals with predominantly elevated LDL‐C may experience more robust LDL‐C reduction, whereas those with hypertriglyceridemia may have more variable effects on TG levels.

Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults

Ezetimibe Tablet reduces total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with hyperlipidemia. Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 2 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy.

Monotherapy

In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials in 1719 patients (age range 18 to 86 years, 52% females; 91% White, 5% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other races mostly identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with primary hyperlipidemia, ezetimibe tablet significantly lowered total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (see Table 6). Reduction in LDL-C was consistent across age, sex, and baseline LDL-C.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) not at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — treatment targets and next steps: The writing committee considered a desirable response to therapy as having achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL). Meta-analysis in this patient population has shown a 22% proportional risk reduction for major vascular events for each 38-mg/dL (1-mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C, and this is true even if baseline LDL is < 77 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). After achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline, further reductions in LDL-C should be discussed with the patient if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL. If patients who are not at very high risk have a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and continue to monitor adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications and ongoing LDL-C response to therapy. If a patient has a less-than-anticipated response (< 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if LDL-C lowering remains inadequate, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen, and if no additional medication is chosen, it is reasonable to continue current therapy with ongoing monitoring. Although there is a gap in RCT evidence in this group, the writing committee supports consideration of adding ezetimibe 10 mg daily as the initial nonstatin agent, given the benefits on ASCVD outcomes and demonstrated safety of ezetimibe in patients with ACS treated with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus simvastatin monotherapy.

### Ezetimibe monotherapy for cholesterol lowering in 2, 722 people: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LxuBB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the evidence on the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe monotherapy for the treatment of primary (heterozygous familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Eleven electronic bibliographic databases covering the biomedical, scientific and grey literature were searched from inception and supplemented by contact with experts in the field. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of RCTs, with a minimum treatment duration of 12 weeks, which compared ezetimibe monotherapy (10 mg per day) with placebo.

Results

In the absence of data from clinical outcome trials, surrogate endpoints such as changes in lipid concentrations were used as indicators of clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of eight randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (all 12 weeks) showed that ezetimibe monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL cholesterol (from baseline to endpoint) of -18.58%, (95% CI: -19.67 to -17.48, P < 0.00001) compared with placebo. Significant (P < 0.00001) changes were also found in total cholesterol (-13.46%, 95% CI: -14.22 to -12.70), HDL cholesterol (3.00%, 95% CI: 2.06–3.94) and triglyceride levels (-8.06%, 95% CI: -10.92 to -5.20). Ezetimibe monotherapy appeared to be well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis restricted to short-term trials in hypercholesterolaemia, significant potentially favourable changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels relative to baseline occurred with ezetimibe monotherapy. Further long-term studies with cardiovascular and other clinical outcome data are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe more fully.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL on statin therapy should be managed by response thresholds and stepwise intensification: If patients have ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and ongoing LDL-C response; if response is less than anticipated on maximally tolerated statin therapy, with < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted and such patients should be considered for referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN, especially if they have documented HeFH or HoFH; if after these interventions the patient still has < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL), the addition of a nonstatin medication to the current regimen should be considered, and the addition of either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 mAb as the initial nonstatin agent should be considered; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for these patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired, with selection favored when < 25% additional lowering is required and acknowledging interindividual variability with some patients experiencing > 25% reduction in LDL-C.

### Ezetimibe for management of hypercholesterolemia [^113wm6P5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the primary literature describing the pharmacology of ezetimibe and clinical trials investigating its use in the management of hypercholesterolemia.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-December 2002) was performed using SCH 48461, SCH 58235, ezetimibe, and 2-azetidinone as key words. English-language articles were identified and the references of these articles were used to further identify pertinent articles and abstracts. Given the paucity of published articles available on ezetimibe, many of the references cited are abstracts.

Study Selection

All acquired articles that discussed the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, chemistry, and clinical efficacy of ezetimibe were reviewed.

Data Extraction

Articles were selected based on content regarding the medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical use of ezetimibe.

Data Synthesis

Ezetimibe, approved for use in October 2002, belongs to a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents that uniquely inhibit the absorption of cholesterol by inhibiting the cholesterol transport system located within intestinal cell walls. In humans, ezetimibe reduced cholesterol absorption by > 50%. In clinical trials, ezetimibe 10 mg/d reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 18% and further enhanced the LDL-C-lowering effect of statin medications by an additional 15–20%. In addition, ezetimibe lowered triglycerides about 5% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) approximately 3%. Ezetimibe is well tolerated. At present, no serious adverse effects have been directly attributable to ezetimibe.

Conclusions

Based on the data currently available, it appears that ezetimibe has a potential role in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia; however further data are needed to determine its long-term tolerability and efficacy. The potential roles for ezetimibe include its concurrent use with a statin to further enhance the lowering of LDL-C. Other possible roles for ezetimibe include its concurrent use with a statin to permit a lowering of statin dosage to avoid statin-related complications or its use as monotherapy to treat hypercholesterolemia when statin use cannot be tolerated or is contraindicated. Outcome data demonstrating that cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality are reduced by ezetimibe therapy have yet to be generated.

### Ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^111gLo5t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe administered with simvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Background

Despite the availability of statins, many patients do not achieve lipid targets. Combination therapy with lipid-lowering agents that act via a complementary pathway may allow additional patients to achieve recommended cholesterol goals.

Methods

After dietary stabilization, a 2- to 12-week washout period, and a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, patients with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 145 mg/dl to ≤ 250 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) ≤ 350 mg/dl were randomized to one of the following 10 groups administered daily for 12 consecutive weeks: ezetimibe 10 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was percentage reduction from baseline to end point in direct LDL-C for the pooled ezetimibe plus simvastatin groups versus pooled simvastatin groups.

Results

Ezetimibe plus simvastatin significantly improved LDL-C (p < 0.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.03), and TG (p < 0.01) compared with simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus simvastatin (pooled doses) provided an incremental 13.8% LDL-C reduction, 2.4% HDL-C increase, and 7.5% TG reduction compared with pooled simvastatin alone. Coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin provided LDL-C reductions of 44% to 57%, TG reductions of 20% to 28%, and HDL-C increases of 8% to 11%, depending on the simvastatin dose. Ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 80 mg alone each provided a 44% LDL-C reduction. The coadministration of ezetimibe with simvastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to those of simvastatin and of placebo.

Conclusions

When coadministered with simvastatin, ezetimibe provided significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and TG, as well as increases in HDL-C. Coadministration of ezetimibe with simvastatin was well tolerated and comparable to statin alone.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^116oEh5T]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) — In children and adolescents, ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C); in adults its effect with statins is additive, giving "an additional 20 percent lowering of LDL–C levels", and "a dose of 10 mg/day is recommended". A pediatric randomized controlled trial in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) ages "10–17 years" found that ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin produced "significantly greater reductions in LDL–C levels than did simvastatin alone" and was "safe and well-tolerated for up to 53 weeks". Current guidance states ezetimibe "might be considered for children and adolescents" who do not meet LDL–C targets on a statin or as "potential monotherapy" for selected patients, and until more safety data are available, "ezetimibe should be used only in consultation with a lipid specialist".

### Association of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and percentage low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibition [^116NyvuC]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether the percentage LDL-C lowering with pharmacotherapies differs on the basis of baseline LDL-C levels.

Objective

To evaluate the association between baseline LDL-C levels and the percentage LDL-C reduction with a statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary exploratory study analyzed data from 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Aggrastat to Zocor-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 21 [A to Z-TIMI 21], Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial [IMPROVE-IT], and Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk [FOURIER]) of lipid-lowering therapies (statin, ezetimibe, and a PCSK9 inhibitor) and included participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Analyses took place form April to October 2020.

Interventions

In A to Z-TIMI 21, 1:1 randomization to simvastatin, 40 mg, daily for 30 days followed by 80 mg daily thereafter vs placebo for 4 months followed by simvastatin, 20 mg, daily thereafter. In IMPROVE-IT, 1:1 randomization to ezetimibe, 10 mg, dailyplussimvastatin, 40 mg, daily vs placeboplussimvastatin, 40 mg, daily. In FOURIER, 1:1 randomization to evolocumab, 140 mg, every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly vs matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The percentage LDL-C reduction at either 1 month (A to Z-TIMI 21, IMPROVE-IT) or 3 months (FOURIER) as a function of baseline LDL-C level. Data were modeled using a generalized linear regression model.

Results

A total of 3187 patients from A to Z-TIMI 21, 10 680 patients from IMPROVE-IT, and 25 847 patients from FOURIER were analyzed. There was a higher percentage reduction in LDL-C levels with evolocumab in patients with lower baseline LDL-C levels, ranging from 59.4% (95% CI, 59.1%-59.8%) in patients with a baseline LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL to 66.1% (95% CI, 65.6%-66.6%) in patients with a baseline LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL (P < .001). In contrast, across the same range of baseline LDL-C level, there was a more modest difference for simvastatin (44.6% [95% CI, 43.9%-45.2%] vs 47.8% [95% CI, 46.4%-49.2%]; P < .001) and minimal difference with ezetimibe (25.0% [95% CI, 23.3%-26.6%] vs 26.2% [95% CI, 24.2%-28.1%]; p = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

The percentage LDL-C reduction with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibition is not attenuated in patients starting with lower baseline LDL-C levels and is 6.6% greater for PCSK9 inhibition. These data are encouraging for the use of intensive LDL-C-lowering therapy even for patients with lower LDL-C levels.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^1147H4Bj]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

### Reductions in atherogenic lipids and major cardiovascular events: a pooled analysis of 10 ODYSSEY trials comparing alirocumab with control [^116fSpdv]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

More recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have argued that most statin trials have tested whether a certain percentage reduction in LDL-C translates into a reduction in clinical events rather than an LDL-C goal and thus recommended LDL-C reductions of at least 30% to 50% for those at elevated risk, again on the basis of what is achievable with the most potent statins. Until recently, it was uncertain from trial data whether consistently achieving LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL or achieving further percentage reductions in LDL-C after maximizing statins would translate into a lower risk of MACE.

The IMPROVE-IT trial extended our evidence base beyond statins, demonstrating that LDL-C levels on average 54 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus statins further reduced MACE compared with the achievement of an LDL-C of ≈70 mg/dL with statins alone. The risk reduction observed in the IMPROVE-IT trial was also entirely consistent with the absolute reduction in LDL-C that would have been predicted by the CTT statin-derived regression line, supporting the notion that LDL-C reduction by statins and ezetimibe confers similar benefits and that the real determinant of the relative risk reduction is the magnitude of the change in LDL-C rather than the mechanism by which this change is achieved. If the findings of IMPROVE-IT are considered as a further percentage reduction in LDL-C, then they support the notion that, starting with a baseline LDL-C of ≈70 mg/dL, a further 20% reduction in LDL-C translates into a 6% to 7% lower risk of MACE. However, the question remains as to whether the additional percentage reduction in LDL-C (of 50% to 60%) and even lower on-treatment LDL-C level (< 50 mg/dL) that can be achieved by adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to a statin will be associated with a lower risk of MACE.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at very high risk — escalation beyond statins is guided by on-treatment response and shared decision-making. In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with less-than-anticipated response defined by < 50% reduction in LDL-C, routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the patient still has < 50% reduction in LDL-C, the patient and clinician should have a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin therapy to maximally tolerated statin therapy. If adding a nonstatin is chosen, the addition of either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) as the initial nonstatin therapy should be considered for this very-high-risk patient group. Factors that may favor starting ezetimibe include patients who require < 25% additional lowering of LDL-C and patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) < 3 months, alongside cost, ease of use, and patient preferences; there may be interindividual variability in response to ezetimibe, with some patients experiencing > 20% reduction in LDL-C.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^113NdmdB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Shared decision-making for ezetimibe versus PCSK9 mAb — The 2018 Cholesterol Guideline recommends that clinicians and patients engage in shared decision-making when considering the addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 mAb to maximal statin and lifestyle therapy, considering ASCVD risk reduction, therapeutic response, adverse effects, preferences (pill vs injection), costs, and medication burden. Clinicians may consider an NNT = 50 as reasonable, whereas patients may consider an NNT = 30, and patients may view treatment as beneficial based on an NNT < 30. Because some patients respond greater than expected to ezetimibe, it is reasonable to add ezetimibe before proceeding to a PCSK9 mAb; for others (lower LDL-C or average ezetimibe reduction), it may be more clinically efficacious to proceed directly to a PCSK9 mAb.

Nonstatin therapy — ezetimibe for LDL-related ASCVD risk — is characterized by the mechanism "Inhibits NPC1L1 protein; reduces cholesterol absorption in small intestine", with dosing "10 mg orally daily, with or without food. Take either ≥ 2 h before or ≥ 4 h after BAS, if used in combination". Mean LDL-C lowering per prescribing information is "Monotherapy — 18%; combination therapy with statin therapy (incremental reduction) — 25%". Additional safety and interactions include "No safety data in humans; avoid use" during pregnancy/lactation and drug–drug interactions with "Cyclosporine, fibrates, BAS". Outcomes evidence notes in IMPROVE-IT that coronary revascularization counted only if " ≥ 30 days after randomization" over "a median follow-up of 6 years", and SHARP reported effects over "a median follow-up of 4.9 years".

### Type of preexisting lipid therapy predicts LDL-C response to ezetimibe [^112gpgyz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Ezetimibe as monotherapy or in combination with statins effectively lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, there are few reports of ezetimibe's effect when added to ongoing non-statin lipid-lowering drugs or combination lipid-lowering therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of preexisting lipid therapy on LDL-C response to ezetimibe.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all patients started on ezetimibe therapy at the Veterans Affairs Long Beach Healthcare System between March 1, 2003, and March 1, 2005. We calculated the ezetimibe-induced percent change in LDL-C in patients without concomitant changes in other lipid-lowering medications. We then stratified the population according to the type and number of preexisting lipid therapies and compared the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe among these groups.

Results

Overall, ezetimibe was associated with a 23.0% reduction in LDL-C. Patients with preexisting statin monotherapy had significantly greater LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe than did those with preexisting non-statin drugs (-26.1% vs -9.3%; p = 0.0138). In patients with no preexisting lipid therapy (n = 58), monotherapy (n = 115), double therapy (n = 36), or triple therapy (n = 9), ezetimibe decreased LDL-C by 17.3%, 21.4%, 33.5%, and 38.1%, respectively. This stepwise trend in increased ezetimibe efficacy was statistically significant, even with adjustments for baseline LDL-C.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe's LDL-C-lowering effects are most pronounced when added to preexisting combination lipid therapy. It appears to be more effective when added to statin therapy compared with other lipid-lowering therapies.

Severe hypercholesterolemia — Ezetimibe add-on therapy: In a very large placebo-controlled RCT in post-acute coronary syndrome patients over 7 years, adding ezetimibe 10 mg to simvastatin 40 mg daily produced greater ASCVD risk reduction than statin monotherapy; in severe hypercholesterolemia, patients adherent to statins who achieve < 50% LDL-C reduction on maximally tolerated statin therapy and have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) are likely to derive additional ASCVD risk reduction from ezetimibe add-on therapy.

### Pharmacology and therapeutics of ezetimibe (SCH 58235), a cholesterol-absorption inhibitor [^112mBp3d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ezetimibe is the first of a new class of antihyperlipidemic agents, the cholesterol-absorption inhibitors. It is indicated for monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, in combination with simvastatin or atorvastatin in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and as monotherapy in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia.

Objective

This article reviews available data on the clinical pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe.

Methods

A literature review was conducted using the search terms ezetimibe and SCH 58235 to identify articles and abstracts indexed in MEDLINE and the Iowa Drug Information Service from 1966 to February 2003. The reference lists of the identified articles were reviewed for additional publications.

Results

In adults, ezetimibe 10 mg PO given once daily has been reported to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54% from baseline in association with a compensatory increase in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Within 2 weeks of its initiation, ezetimibe monotherapy produced a 17% to 20% reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); in combination with statins, ezetimibe produced a reduction in LDL-C of up to 40% over the same period. Based on studies performed to date, ezetimibe appears to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Because ezetimibe is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation and not by cytochrome P450 (CYP) oxidation, it is subject to minimal drug interactions involving the CYP enzyme system.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe is an option for monotherapy in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia or in those requiring adjunctive drug therapy for reduction of LDL-C levels. It may be useful in patients at risk for adverse events (eg, liver toxicity, myopathy) from other hypocholesterolemic agents. Additive LDL-C-lowering effects of ezetimibe may allow use of lower doses of conventional agents (eg, statins, fibric acid derivatives, niacin) to achieve an equivalent effect, thereby reducing the potential for adverse events and drug interactions. However, because trials have lasted no longer than 12 weeks, the long-term effect of ezetimibe on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be determined.

Very high-risk ASCVD — rapid intensification using combination therapy: It may be reasonable to consider the simultaneous addition of 2 agents to reduce the risk of recurrent events more rapidly, and options may include either combination therapy with high-intensity or maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe or maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe and a PCSK9 mAb.

### Effects of ezetimibe added to statin therapy on markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis and LDL-C lowering in hyperlipidemic patients [^112PcJBA]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis but can upregulate cholesterol absorption, with higher doses producing larger effects. Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption but also upregulates synthesis. We tested whether ezetimibe added to on-going statin therapy would be most effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects on high-potency statins and whether these effects would be related to alterations in cholesterol absorption (β-sitosterol) and synthesis (lathosterol) markers.

Methods

Hypercholesterolemic subjects (n = 874) on statins received ezetimibe 10 mg/day. Plasma lipids, lathosterol, and β-sitosterol were measured at baseline and on treatment. Subjects were divided into low- (n = 133), medium- (n = 582), and high- (n = 159) statin potency groups defined by predicted LDL-C-lowering effects of each ongoing statin type and dose (reductions of ~20–30%, ~31–45%, or ~46–55%, respectively).

Results

The high-potency group had significantly lower baseline lathosterol (1.93 vs. 2.58 vs. 3.17 μmol/l; p < 0.001) and higher baseline β-sitosterol values (6.21 vs. 4.58 vs. 4.51 μmol/l, p < 0.001) than medium-/low-potency groups. Ezetimibe treatment in the high-potency group produced significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL-C than medium-/low-potency groups (-29.1% vs. -25.0% vs. -22.7%; p < 0.001) when evaluating unadjusted data. These effects and group differences were significantly (p < 0.05) related to greater β-sitosterol reductions and smaller lathosterol increases. However, LDL-C reduction differences between groups were no longer significant after controlling for placebo effects, due mainly to modest LDL-C lowering by placebo in the high-potency group.

Conclusion

Patients on high-potency statins have the lowest levels of cholesterol synthesis markers and the highest levels of cholesterol absorption markers at baseline, and the greatest reduction in absorption markers and the smallest increases in synthesis markers with ezetimibe addition. Therefore, such patients may be good candidates for ezetimibe therapy if additional LDL-C lowering is needed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL and additional high-risk features should be treated first with maximally tolerated statin therapy; if there is a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence, whereas < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) warrants routine clinical assessment and, if persistent, the patient and clinician should enter a discussion focused on shared decision-making regarding the addition of a nonstatin medication. Consideration may be given to either ezetimibe or a PCSK9 mAb in combination with maximally tolerated statin therapy; considerations that may favor ezetimibe include < 25% additional lowering of LDL-C desired and patient/cost factors, while considerations that may favor a PCSK9 mAb include > 25% additional LDL-C lowering desired. If high-risk patients with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL still require additional LDL-C lowering after a single nonstatin agent (ie, ezetimibe), it is reasonable to consider the addition of a second nonstatin agent (ie, ezetimibe plus a PCSK9 mAb), and all such patients should be considered for referral to a lipid specialist and RD/RDN, especially if the patient has documented HoFH.

Primary prevention — patients declining or intolerant of statins: In patients who may not wish to take a statin or may not tolerate the recommended intensity, it may be reasonable to use LDL-C–lowering drugs proven safe and effective in RCTs (monotherapy or combined with a statin); consideration may be given to use of ezetimibe; BAS may be considered as an optional alternative for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL, but there is no evidence for a cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statins; given the marginal additional benefit for this lower-risk group, the writing committee does not recommend routine use of nonstatin therapy for primary prevention patients with ASCVD risk < 20%.

### Effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering by ezetimibe / simvastatin on outcome incidence: overview, meta-analyses, and meta-regression analyses of randomized trials [^113wJ44v]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

This analysis investigated the extent of different outcome reductions from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering following ezetimibe/simvastatin treatment and the proportionality of outcome to LDL-C reductions. The authors searched PubMed between 1997 and mid-June 2015 (any language) and the Cochrane Library to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin with placebo or less intensive LDL-C lowering. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), standardized to 20 mg/dL LDL-C reduction, were calculated for 5 primary outcomes (fatal and nonfatal) and 4 secondary outcomes (non-cardiovascular [CV] death, cancer, myopathy, and hepatopathy). Five ezetimibe/simvastatin RCTs (30 051 individuals) were eligible, 2 comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo and 3 vs less intensive treatment. Outcomes reduced almost to the same extent were stroke (RR: -13%, 95% CI: -21% to -3%), coronary heart disease (CHD; RR: -12%, 95% CI: -19% to -5%), and composite of stroke and CHD (RR: -14%, 95% CI: -20% to -8%). Absolute risk reductions: 5 strokes, 10 CHD events, and 16 stroke and CHD events prevented for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years. Residual risk was almost 7× higher than absolute risk reduction for all the above outcomes. All death outcomes were not reduced, and secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. Logarithmic risk ratios were not associated with LDL-C lowering. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that, in patients with different CV disease burden, major CV events are safely reduced by LDL-C lowering with ezetimibe/simvastatin, while raising the hypothesis that the extent of LDL-C lowering might not be accompanied by incremental clinical-event reduction.

### Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and clinical outcomes of combining ezetimibe with statin therapy in IMPROVE-IT [^113f3qJV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 U.S. cholesterol management guideline recommends additional lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe for secondary prevention in very high-risk patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated statin.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline LDL-C above and below 70 mg/dL and the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin in patients post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo/simvastatin in post-ACS patients followed for 6 years (median). A total of 17,999 patients were stratified by LDL-C at qualifying event into 3 groups (50- < 70, 70- < 100, and 100–125 mg/dL). The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary events, or stroke.

Results

Absolute differences in median LDL-C achieved at 4 months between treatment arms were similar (17–20 mg/dL). The effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo/simvastatin on primary endpoint was consistent regardless of baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.80–1.05]), 70- < 100 mg/dL (HR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.87–1.01]), or 100–125 mg/dL (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.86–1.03]; P interaction = 0.95). Normalized relative risk reductions per 1-mmol/L difference in achieved LDL-C at 4 months between treatment arms were 21% in patients with baseline LDL-C of 50- < 70 mg/dL, 16% in those with 70- < 100 mg/dL, and 13% in those with 100–125 mg/dL (P interaction = 0.91). No significant treatment interactions by baseline LDL-C were present for safety endpoints.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to statin consistently reduced the risk for cardiovascular events in post-ACS patients irrespective of baseline LDL-C values, supporting the use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe even in patients with baseline LDL-C < 70 mg/dL.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^117QyuKf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacological treatment in adults — statin-first approach with evidence-based add-ons. Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may benefit from pharmacotherapy, including those with very high baseline LDL-C levels suggestive of a genetic cause such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), individuals with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or those already diagnosed with ASCVD. Statin therapy, which is the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for LDL-C reduction, reduces ASCVD risk in most individuals, and based on meta-analysis of 27 statin RCTs, for every 1 mmol/L (∼39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C there is a corresponding 22% reduction in ASCVD event risk. It should be noted that statin therapy does not seem to reduce ASCVD in adults receiving hemodialysis or those who have significant heart failure, and stopping statin therapy in these individuals is not advised if it is well tolerated. Given variability in individual response even at full therapeutic doses, routine monitoring for both efficacy and tolerability is essential to guide ongoing management. Based upon contemporary clinical trial evidence, LDL-C lowering therapy should start with statins, then if response is incomplete or a tolerated statin regimen cannot be found, nonstatin LDL-C lowering pharmacotherapy should be considered, with medicine selection based on factors including safety, tolerability, LDL-C lowering efficacy, RCT evidence supporting use, desirable LDL-C and expectations of treatment, patient preference, convenience and cost of therapy, and availability. Nonstatin pharmacotherapy also reduces ASCVD risk, with randomized trials showing risk reduction when ezetimibe is added to moderate intensity statin and when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody inhibition (PCSK9i) is added to high-intensity statin therapy. Additional options include bempedoic acid, which has demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults (especially those with diabetes mellitus) on low dose or no statin because of intolerance, and high dose icosapent ethyl, which has minimal impact on LDL-C but demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in adults with established ASCVD or high-risk patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia. While niacin is no longer recommended as a routine therapy for LDL-C lowering or ASCVD risk reduction due to lack of incremental benefit when added to statins in contemporary trials, it may have a limited role and may be considered in rare cases of multidrug intolerance or if cost or access constraints limit other options. Bile acid sequestrants can be used but have a high degree of limiting side effects and have been mostly abandoned because of their side effects and modest potency.

Side effects associated with statins can be increased by drug interactions and major comorbidities that are more common in older people. Statin combination preparations may be more beneficial than high‐dose statins in elderly patients. In the age‐stratified post‐hoc analysis of the RACING trial, ezetimibe combination therapy was associated with a lower rate of intolerance related drug discontinuation and new‐onset diabetes than high‐intensity statin monotherapy in patients aged ≥ 75 years. In this respect, low intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy may be a good alternative for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in older people who are not at high risk. Moreover, previous studies have shown that Asian populations tend to achieve comparable LDL‐C reductions with lower statin doses than Western populations. For instance, the Japanese Lipid Intervention Trial (J‐LIT) and the MEGA study demonstrated that low‐dose statin therapy significantly reduced both LDL‐C levels and coronary heart disease risk in Japanese patients, with efficacy similar to that of higher statin doses used in Western cohorts. These findings provide further support for the clinical utility of low‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe therapy in Asian patients with dyslipidemia.

4.2 Time to Effect of the Combination of a Statin Plus Ezetimibe

Most previous randomized trials of statin treatment have assessed on evaluating the extent of LDL‐C reduction after 1 year of treatment. However, the PROVE IT‐TIMI 22 trial demonstrated significant LDL‐C reductions within just 1 month, with reductions of 51% in the atorvastatin 80 mg group and 22% in the pravastatin 40 mg group. This highlights the rapid onset of action of atorvastatin, with another study showing that approximately 90% of the maximum LDL‐C reduction from baseline was achieved within the first 2 weeks of treatment. In our study, the combination therapy (A5E10) produced remarkable lipid‐lowering effects, including 98% of the maximum LDL‐C reduction, 92% of the maximum TG reduction, 95% of the maximum non‐HDL‐C reduction, and 97% of the maximum Apo B reduction in just 1 month. Such a rapid action is critical for patients requiring swift LDL‐C reduction to mitigate cardiovascular risks.

Clinicians are interested in how the reduction of these lipid parameters as well as increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) relate to changes in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the additional CHD risk reduction that could potentially be provided by co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy. Data from four double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials were used to predict the level of CHD risk reduction that might be achieved by co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy when compared to those receiving statin as monotherapy. Patients without a previous history of CHD were included in the analysis. Projected CHD risk reduction was calculated as percent change in projected CHD risk from baseline to 12 weeks based on observed lipid levels at those time points. For all the studies combined greater reductions in percent change in 5-year CHD risk were observed for patients receiving ezetimibe and statin as co-therapy, 53.4%, when compared to those receiving statin alone, 39.7%. Co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy provides an additional 13.7% reduction in predicted 5-year CHD risk when compared to statin monotherapy. Reductions in 5-year CHD risk for each of the statin studies ranged from 16.1% for lovastatin to 9.8% for atorvastatin. Co-administration of ezetimibe with statins could significantly reduce CHD events in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Ezetimibe in IMPROVE-IT — At 1 year, levels were 24% lower with ezetimibe versus placebo with simvastatin 40 mg/d background therapy; on-treatment mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was 53.2 mg/dL with ezetimibe versus 69.9 mg/dL on placebo. During the trial, 50.6% on simvastatin plus ezetimibe reached LDL-C < 70 mg/dL compared with 30.5% on simvastatin plus placebo. Over 7 years of follow-up, the absolute risk reduction for the primary endpoint was 1.8% (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84–0.96; NNT: 56), with no statistically significant differences in rates of CVD death or death from any cause; only 46% to 47% were adherent at study end with similar adherence in both arms. Ezetimibe was well tolerated with no statistically significant differences in adverse effects, and among participants achieving LDL-C < 30 mg/dL there was no significant increase in risk for 9 prespecified safety outcomes. Although the net clinical benefit was modest, several prespecified secondary analyses suggested a more substantial reduction in ASCVD risk among higher-risk participants, with evidence of effect modification according to age.

### Effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials [^113Lr7s1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid‐lowering therapy with statins is highly beneficial for prevention of secondary and high‐risk primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, some patients cannot tolerate recommended statin doses 1; a high proportion of patients do not achieve adequate reduction of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), despite high‐intensity statin therapy 2; and even patients who achieve guideline recommended reductions may have high residual ASCVD risk. 3 Consequently, alternative therapies designed to lower LDL‐C and improve outcomes are needed. Improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed recently with combination treatment with ezetimibe; however, these improvements were modest, and outcome data on monotherapy with ezetimibe are limited. 4 The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab have been associated with reduction of LDL‐C levels and recently with improved cardiovascular outcomes in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial. 5 However, questions remain about the patients who are most likely to derive the greatest clinical benefits and the safety profile of this class of drugs. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the cumulative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors, with an emphasis on cardiovascular outcomes.

Then, we computed which treatments would be required for each patient to reach the individualized LDL-c percent reduction and absolute targets suggested by current guidelines. First, we found that 8.7% of the population would not require treatment intensification, while around one-third (37.8%) would require the initiation (or shift towards) a HI-statin (including those with apparently absolute LDL-c on target but not the 50% reduction from their estimated untreated LDL-c levels). Second, more than one-fourth of the population (26.9%) would require a combination of HI-statin + ezetimibe, and another one-fourth (26.6%) the further add-on of PCSK9i to reach the recommended LDL-c levels (Table 2).

Importantly, other therapies that reduce LDL-C without inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase have also been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in large randomized cardiovascular outcome trials. Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol by binding to the NPC1L1 transporter protein. Among the 18 144 persons with acute coronary syndrome enrolled in the IMPROVE-IT trial, treatment with ezetimibe plus a statin vs. statin monotherapy reduced LDL-C levels by 0.40 mmol/L over the trial duration, and was associated with a 6.5% proportional reduction in major cardiovascular events. Supportive evidence is available from the SHARP trial in 9270 persons with chronic kidney disease, which compared treatment with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe with placebo. Combination treatment reduced LDL-C levels by 0.85 mmol/L (33 mg/dL) and reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events by 17% relative to placebo. In both trials, the magnitude of the observed proportional risk reduction was consistent with the clinical benefit that would be expected from similar absolute reductions in LDL-C during treatment with statin monotherapy. These data suggest that statins and ezetimibe have therapeutically equivalent effects on the risk of cardiovascular events per unit lower LDL-C (Figure 3 B). These findings also agree closely with the naturally randomized genetic data that have demonstrated that variants in the HMGCR and NPC1L1 genes have biologically equivalent effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease per unit lower LDL-C, (Figure 3 A).

Ezetimibe add-on therapy after acute coronary syndromes — Ezetimibe has been shown to produce significant additional improvements in LDL-C levels and goal attainment when added to statin therapy, and in IMPROVE-IT (18,444 patients) 7-year event rates were 32.7% with ezetimibe plus simvastatin versus 34.7% with simvastatin alone (hazard ratio, 0.936; confidence interval, 0.887–0.988). Median LDL-C levels at 1 year were 53.2 mg/dL with ezetimibe plus simvastatin vs 69.9 mg/dL with simvastatin alone. According to the reported relationship of a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction from statin therapies, the predicted reduction with combination therapy would be 9.5%, which is nearly identical to the reported reduction of 10.6%, and the number needed to treat for prevention of the primary end point was 50 using 7-year event rates.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy".

Other High-Intensity Statin Regimens

Although the effectiveness of regimens other than simvastatin plus ezetimibe was not assessed directly in SHARP, we conducted scenario analyses with other high-intensity statin regimens that can achieve a 40% or higher LDL cholesterol reduction. Table S2 summarizes the reductions in LDL cholesterol level achieved with such regimens and their UK daily cost. Based on the known linear relationship between mean absolute LDL cholesterol level reduction and risk reduction in a wide range of patients in a meta-analysis of large statin trialsand in a trial of ezetimibe added to a statin regimen, we calculated the likely reductions in major atherosclerotic events with different regimens by scaling the proportional reduction observed in SHARP by the ratios of proportional reductions in LDL cholesterol level achieved (Table S2).

### Effect on serum lipid levels of switching dose of ezetimibe from 10 to 5 mg [^116xeZTL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although during its initial development, lower doses of ezetimibe reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) significantly, ezetimibe is available only in 10-mg form. Compliant patients receiving ezetimibe 10 mg were randomized in a blinded fashion to continue therapy with ezetimibe 10 mg or to convert to a split-tablet 5-mg dose. Lipid panels were collected at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy. The impact of the 2 ezetimibe dosing strategies on LDL and the achievement of the Adult Treatment Panel III LDL goal was evaluated. One hundred thirty patients receiving ezetimibe 10 mg were screened for eligibility. Thirty-nine of the 130 patients were randomized; 36 patients successfully completed the study. All patients who had achieved their Adult Treatment Panel III LDL goals at baseline remained at their LDL goals after conversion to 5 mg. In conclusion, conversion to the lower dose of ezetimibe did not result in any clinically meaningful or statistically significant changes in any lipid parameter.

Discussion

Our systematic review of lipid‐lowering therapies added to medium‐ to high‐intensity statin therapy and subsequent network meta‐analysis confirms the substantial LDL‐C reductions of PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe in individual trials. Among the PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab appeared to have a greater reduction than alirocumab (75 mg Q2W, ≈20%; 150 mg Q2W, ≈10%; 300 mg QM, ≈20%). These treatment differences were directionally consistent in the various analyses we conducted (ie, exclusion of studies leading to heterogeneity, variation of dosing amount and interval, broader background therapy spectrum). There was also some evidence of proportional treatment differences between evolocumab and other therapies in HDL‐C, non‐HDL‐C, ApoB, and Lp(a). The incidence of AEs was similar between individual therapies and placebo except for significantly higher treatment‐related AEs for evolocumab and alirocumab QM versus placebo.

Our work provides information on PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe added to statin therapy in those requiring further LDL‐C reduction. The trials generally evaluated patients either with CVD or at high risk of a CVD event, which is the expected target population for PCSK9 inhibitors both now and after cardiovascular outcomes trials for these medications are completed. 50, 51 We also characterized the reductions observed for PCSK9 inhibitors in other parameters including non‐HDL‐C and Lp(a). Non‐HDL‐C is emerging as a meaningful measure of CVD event risk, 52 and Lp(a) is associated with CVD event risk but is not reduced by statins. 53, 54

Finally, we analyzed dose‐specific LDL‐C reductions between PCSK9 inhibitors, which have not been a focus of published meta‐analyses. 16, 17, 18 The classwide reduction of LDL‐C with PCSK9 inhibitors observed in these meta‐analyses 16, 17, 18 is consistent with what we observed in the comparison of individual PCSK9 inhibitors versus placebo or ezetimibe.

administered every 2 weeks, which reduced LDL-C values by 61% to 62%. The addition of monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C values by 62% to 65% from baseline. In atorvastatin-treated patients, the addition of ezetimibe resulted in achievement of an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL in 17% to 20% of patients receiving moderate-intensity statins and 51% to 62% of those receiving high-intensity statins. In contrast, an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL was achieved by 86% to 94% of evolocumab-treated patients receiving background atorvastatin therapy.

This 12-week trial examined the safety, tolerability, and LDL-C–lowering efficacy of a PCSK9 inhibitor compared with placebo and ezetimibe in patients with hypercholesterolemia randomized to receive background statin therapy. The additional LDL-C lowering with evolocumab was significantly greater than that observed with ezetimibe. Evolocumab was well tolerated, with comparable rates of adverse events vs placebo and ezetimibe over the 12-week treatment period. Neurocognitive events were uncommon in this study, and data from an ongoing, longer-term evolocumab extension study reported 1% or less incidence of these events in patients receiving evolocumab.

ABSTRACT

Background

It remains controversial whether adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins has a more beneficial impact on the treatment efficacy and safety of patients with existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to high‐intensity statin regimens.

Hypothesis

A combination of low/moderate‐intensity statins plus ezetimibe might be more effective and safer than high‐intensity statin monotherapy.

Methods

We searched databases for randomized controlled trials comparing lipid profile alterations, drug‐related adverse events, and MACE components between high‐intensity statin monotherapy and low/moderate‐intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy. Pooled risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using a random‐effects model.

Results

Our comprehensive search resulted in 32 studies comprising 6162 patients treated with monotherapy against 5880 patients on combination therapy. Combination therapy was more effective in reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5); however, no significant differences were observed in other lipid parameters. Furthermore, the combination therapy group experienced a lower risk of myalgia (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13–0.57) and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.51–0.74). The occurrence of MACE was similar between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Adding ezetimibe to low/moderate‐intensity statins resulted in a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels, a lower rate of myalgia, and less drug discontinuation compared to high‐intensity statin monotherapy in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. However, according to our meta‐analysis, the observed reduction in LDL‐C levels in the combination group did not correlate with a reduction in MACE compared to the high‐intensity statin group.

### Optimizing lipid lowering in patients at risk [^115AuaAm]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The efficacy of statins in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing coronary heart disease risk is well established; however, recent evidence suggests that more aggressive lipid management, even beyond achievement of currently recommended LDL-C goals, may provide additional clinical benefits. A novel approach to the aggressive lowering of LDL-C is the combination of statins with agents that affect different aspects of cholesterol metabolism. Because absorption of cholesterol is an important contributor to cholesterol balance, the simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis is an attractive approach to achieving greater LDL-C reductions. In clinical trials, the combination of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a statin resulted in greater improvements in lipids than statin monotherapy and allowed a greater percentage of patients to achieve treatment goals. In addition, this combination may offer benefits through reduction of phytosterols, chylomicron remnants, and C-reactive protein. Several ongoing trials are evaluating whether the benefit of simultaneously blocking cholesterol synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption translates into better clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy for treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^11764zMU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for ≥ 6 weeks were randomized to receive concurrent treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to end point after intervention (secondary variables: high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides). Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p < 0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p < 0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p < 0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy. Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached goal at end point (odds ratio 23.7; p < 0.001). The co-administration of statin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. Adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy led to substantial additional reduction in LDL cholesterol levels, facilitating attainment of NCEP goals. Ezetimibe offers a new therapeutic option for patients receiving statins who require further reduction in LDL cholesterol.

### Cost-effectiveness of lipid lowering with statins and ezetimibe in chronic kidney disease [^115ryrXe]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

see commentary on page 22

With over 250 million people affected worldwide, CKD is a common disease, and its prevalence is expected to increase further with rising levels of obesity and diabetes and an aging population. In the US, approximately 7% of adults have stage 3–5 CKD. People with reduced kidney function have increased cardiovascular risk, which is a key treatment target.

The SHARP trial showed that lowering LDL cholesterol with a combination of simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily for about 5 years safely reduced the risk of major atherosclerotic events (i.e. nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, nonhemorrhagic stroke, or arterial revascularization procedure) in nondialysis patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Subsequently, a large meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 trials of statin therapy, or, in the case of SHARP, statin plus ezetimibe, was coordinated by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration. This showed that the relative reduction in major vascular events (i.e. major atherosclerotic event, noncoronary cardiac death, or hemorrhagic stroke) per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol ranged from 22% among participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 to 15% among nondialysis participants with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with a trend toward smaller risk reductions with lower eGFR and no evidence of clinical efficacy in dialysis patients. By design, SHARP did not assess the separate clinical effects of ezetimibe, but evidence of the effects on vascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin, albeit in patients with an acute coronary syndrome and without established CKD, has been provided by the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT). In this trial, for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, the relative reduction in vascular events resulting from ezetimibe was consistent with that predicted by a meta-analysis of randomized trials of statin therapy alone.

Patients considered at high enough risk to warrant treating to a goal of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels include, as in case 1 (figure 3), those who are asymptomatic but have a cardiometabolic disorder or high LDL-C due to inherited conditions such as FH. On combination therapy, case 1 should achieve both goals. Patients at very high risk, such as case 2, are recommended to reach an LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L and a greater than 50% decrease from baseline levels. In this example, statin-associated muscle symptoms limited the dose of statin used, and while the patient should be maintained on the maximum tolerated dose, the LDL-C goal will likely only be achieved with combination therapy. A clinical judgement has to be made whether to (1) accept the slightly higher than optimal predicted LDL-C of 1.8 mmol/L on statin plus ezetimibe, while achieving a greater than 50% decrease from the notional baseline of 4.0 mmol/L (estimated from the measured LDL-C on statin monotherapy and the average LDL-C decrease on that statin dose), or (2) prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor to achieve the more aggressive goal. The additional 0.9 mmol/L drop is predicted to deliver a further 20% reduction in riskand the cost–benefit decision will be dependent on the perceived ongoing ASCVD risk for this patient. Case 3 is an example of ASCVD that follows an aggressive course with a major coronary event occurring a relatively short time after the initial clinical presentation. Despite recommendations to use the maximum dose of a statin, the patient (as is common) was on a less than optimal dose of atorvastatin after angioplasty, which was only increased in steps to 80 mg after the second event. While the new guidelines set experiencing a second vascular event 'within 2 years' as the benchmark for defining this highest risk category, application of clinical judgement would again lead to the adoption of the most aggressive goal of LDL-C < 1.0 mmol/L.

### Projected outcomes of optimized statin and ezetimibe therapy in veterans with coronary artery disease… [^111c5b8Q]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The mean LDL-C levels and 95% CIs for observed lipid-lowering therapy are presented, along with those projected for an optimized statin regimen alone and for an optimized statin regimen with ezetimibe. Compared with observed LDL-C levels, optimized statin treatment was associated with a 21. 9 mg/dL projected reduction at 1 year and a
23. 0 mg/dL projected reduction at 3 years. Compared with optimized statin therapy alone, the addition of ezetimibe was associated with an additional 8. 7 mg/dL projected LDL-C value reduction at both 1 and 3 years, corresponding to
30. 6 mg/dL and 31. 7 mg/dL reductions from observed levels. Thus, the addition of ezetimibe to an optimized statin regimen resulted in a further 39. 7% and
37. 8% reduction of LDL-C levels of the reductions achieved by optimized statin alone at 1 and 3 years, respectively. At 6 months, ezetimibe use remained low, and LDL-C levels were 70 mg/dL or more in 56 405 patients. With optimized statin treatment, projected absolute reductions in these incidences were 1. 3%,
0. 8%, 0. 2%, and
2. 3%, respectively. With optimized statin and ezetimibe treatment, projected absolute reductions were 1. 8%,
1. 1%, 0. 3%, and
3. 1%, respectively. Thus, on a cohort level, adding ezetimibe to optimized statin was projected to provide an additional reduction of LDL-C concentration approximately 40% as great as the reduction from augmenting observed statin therapy to optimized statin therapy.

The key inclusion criteria were that the study was a randomized clinical trial and the reported clinical outcomes included myocardial infarction (MI). Studies were excluded if the duration was less than 6 months or had fewer than 50 clinical events. Studies of 9 different types of LDL-C reduction approaches were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted and entered data into standardized data sheets and data were analyzed using meta-regression.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The relative risk (RR) of major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, acute MI or other acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, or stroke) associated with the absolute reduction in LDL-C level; 5-year rate of major coronary events (coronary death or MI) associated with achieved LDL-C level.

Results

A total of 312 175 participants (mean age, 62 years; 24% women; mean baseline LDL-C level of 3.16 mmol/L [122.3 mg/dL]) from 49 trials with 39 645 major vascular events were included. The RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71–0.84; P < .001) for statins and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.66–0.86; p = 0.002) for established nonstatin interventions that work primarily via upregulation of LDL receptor expression (ie, diet, bile acid sequestrants, ileal bypass, and ezetimibe) (between-group difference, P = .72). For these 5 therapies combined, the RR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75–0.79, P < .001) for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level. For other interventions, the observed RRs vs the expected RRs based on the degree of LDL-C reduction in the trials were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89–0.99) vs 0.91 (95% CI, 0.90–0.92) for niacin (P = .24); 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.92) vs 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93–0.94) for fibrates (P = .02), which was lower than expected (ie, greater risk reduction); 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94–1.09) vs 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89–0.91) for cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors (P = .002), which was higher than expected (ie, less risk reduction); and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71) vs 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58–0.65) for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (P = .25). The achieved absolute LDL-C level was significantly associated with the absolute rate of major coronary events (11 301 events, including coronary death or MI) for primary prevention trials (1.5% lower event rate [95% CI, 0.5%-2.6%] per each 1-mmol/L lower LDL-C level; p = 0.008) and secondary prevention trials (4.6% lower event rate [95% CI, 2.9%-6.4%] per each 1-mmol/L lower LDL-C level; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-regression analysis, the use of statin and nonstatin therapies that act via upregulation of LDL receptor expression to reduce LDL-C were associated with similar RRs of major vascular events per change in LDL-C. Lower achieved LDL-C levels were associated with lower rates of major coronary events.

### Initial low-density lipoprotein response to statin therapy predicts subsequent low-density lipoprotein response to the addition of ezetimibe [^1174EbGg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

This small retrospective study confirms the hypothesis that patients who are hyporesponders to statin therapy are hyper-responders to ezetimibe therapy and may help identify a patient population in whom ezetimibe would be particularly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypercholesterolemia — synopsis highlights that patients with severe hypercholesterolemia have a high lifetime risk, and decisions about statins in these patients do not require ASCVD risk scoring; these patients derive the greatest ASCVD risk reduction benefit from interventions that increase expression of LDL receptors; the strongest data have been derived from statin RCTs, which have demonstrated greater risk reduction from high-intensity statin therapy than with moderate-intensity statin therapy; ezetimibe plus a moderate-intensity statin is associated with greater LDL-C reduction than statin monotherapy in patients with heterozygous FH, and the combination reduces ASCVD risk more than moderate-intensity statin monotherapy in patients who have had a recent ACS.

ACC nonstatin therapy — ezetimibe selection and continuation is favored for patients who require < 25% additional lowering of LDL-C and for patients with recent ACS < 3 months; a post hoc analysis of IMPROVE-IT identified 9 clinical variables (including age > 75 years and eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) that may help predict benefit, and there may be interindividual variability with some patients experiencing > 25% reduction in LDL-C; if goals are achieved with ezetimibe, it is reasonable to continue the statin-ezetimibe combination therapy and monitor adherence, lifestyle modifications, and LDL-C response.
