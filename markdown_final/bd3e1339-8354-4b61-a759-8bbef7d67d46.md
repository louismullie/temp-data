## Question

A 24-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with complaints of 2 days of profuse diarrhea. He states that his stool started to turn watery and lighter in color beginning yesterday, and he has not noticed any fevers. His diarrhea episodes have become more frequent and white-colored over the past day. He has also noticed dry mouth symptoms and darker urine today. He is otherwise healthy but recently returned from a trip with friends to South Asia. None of his friends have reported any symptoms. On exam, his temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 14/min. The patient has normal skin turgor, but he has noticeably dry oral mucosa and chapped lips. The patient has dull abdominal aching but no tenderness to palpation. The stool is found to contain large quantities of comma-shaped organisms. Fecal occult blood testing is negative and no steatorrhea is found. The provider recommends immediate oral rehydration therapy. Which of the following is the likely mechanism of this patient's diarrhea?
A. Decreased cyclic AMP
B. Increased cyclic AMP
C. Increased cyclic GMP
D. Shortening of intestinal villi

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains the profuse, watery, non-bloody diarrhea in a healthy 24-year-old man returning from South Asia, with stool showing comma-shaped organisms, and to choose among changes in cAMP, cGMP, or villous shortening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits cholera or another secretory diarrheal pathogen. Then, I should verify the organism identification and its classic morphology. Next, I will review the pathophysiology of cholera toxin and confirm the second messenger involved. After that, I need to check the alternative options (cGMP signaling, structural villous injury) and ensure they don't better fit this presentation. Finally, I will align the mechanism with management implications to confirm internal consistency before selecting the answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. Profuse, watery, non-bloody diarrhea with signs of volume depletion (dry mucosa, dark urine) in a traveler from South Asia strongly suggests a secretory, toxin-mediated diarrheal illness rather than an invasive or inflammatory process, and the absence of fever and blood supports a noninflammatory secretory mechanism rather than dysentery or cytotoxin-mediated colitis [^114cvAEG].

> Wait, let me verify the organism morphology. Large quantities of comma-shaped organisms in the stool are classic for Vibrio cholerae, which is gram-negative, curved, and often described as "comma-shaped"; this morphologic clue, together with the epidemiology and clinical picture, points toward cholera as the leading diagnosis here [^1163y9kz].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Cholera toxin is an AB5 enterotoxin whose A subunit ADP-ribosylates the Gsα protein, leading to sustained activation of adenylate cyclase, increased intracellular cAMP, activation of protein kinase A, phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and net chloride secretion with osmotic movement of water into the lumen, producing the characteristic voluminous "rice-water" stools. This is a prototypical cAMP-mediated secretory diarrhea [^112oznxc] [^1163y9kz] [^114k5si5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should review the distractors. Increased cGMP is a recognized pathway for some enterotoxins (for example, ETEC heat-stable toxin), but the morphology and epidemiology here fit Vibrio cholerae rather than ETEC, and the canonical mechanism for cholera is cAMP-driven, not cGMP-driven; villous shortening reflects structural mucosal injury typical of invasive or attaching-effacing pathogens and is not the primary mechanism of pure secretory cholera diarrhea, so those alternatives do not match this presentation as well as increased cAMP does [^111R3ViM] [^112oznxc].

> Let me consider management alignment as a sanity check. Immediate oral rehydration therapy is the cornerstone for cholera because the pathophysiology is massive isotonic fluid and electrolyte loss driven by cAMP-mediated secretion; guidelines emphasize balanced electrolyte ORS for cholera-like watery diarrhea, which fits the expected mechanism and supports the inference that the mechanism is increased cAMP signaling [^117NKqpB] [^111anBNk].

> Putting this together, the most likely mechanism is increased cyclic AMP due to cholera toxin, which explains the profuse, watery, non-bloody diarrhea, the comma-shaped organisms, and the clinical context of travel to South Asia. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased cyclic AMP [^112oznxc] [^1163y9kz] [^114k5si5].

---

The most likely mechanism of this patient's profuse, watery diarrhea is **increased cyclic AMP** [^1163y9kz] due to cholera toxin, which activates adenylate cyclase, drives chloride secretion, and produces large-volume secretory diarrhea [^111NaiBk]. This fits the clinical picture of travel to South Asia, comma-shaped organisms, and rice-water stools [^111NaiBk]. Management is **oral rehydration therapy** [^117NKqpB]; antibiotics can shorten illness and reduce stool volume [^113FYm6P].

---

## Pathophysiology of cholera toxin-induced diarrhea

Cholera toxin is an **AB5 toxin** [^114k5si5] comprising one A subunit and five B subunits. The B subunits bind GM1 ganglioside receptors on intestinal epithelial cells, facilitating entry of the A subunit, which ADP-ribosylates the Gsα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, irreversibly activating adenylate cyclase [^114k5si5]. This increases intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, phosphorylates CFTR, and drives chloride secretion with sodium and water, causing profuse watery diarrhea [^111NaiBk].

---

## Clinical features supporting cholera diagnosis

- **Travel history**: Recent travel to South Asia, where cholera is endemic [^112oznxc].
- **Stool characteristics**: Profuse, watery, rice-water stools with comma-shaped organisms [^1163y9kz].
- **Absence of fever**: Typical for cholera, distinguishing it from inflammatory diarrheas [^notfound].
- **Dehydration signs**: Dry mucous membranes, dark urine, indicating significant fluid loss [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Pathogen example** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to patient** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Increased cAMP | Vibrio cholerae | Profuse, watery, rice-water stools, no fever | Strongly consistent |
| Increased cGMP | ETEC (ST toxin) | Watery diarrhea, mild abdominal cramps | Less consistent |
| Shortening of intestinal villi | Rotavirus, Giardia | Malabsorption, steatorrhea, prolonged diarrhea | Not consistent |

---

Increased cGMP is less likely because ETEC is **less associated with rice-water stools** and comma-shaped organisms [^111R3ViM]. Villous shortening is inconsistent with the acute, profuse, non-steatorrheic presentation [^111R3ViM].

---

## Management implications

- **Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)**: Mainstay of treatment to replace fluid and electrolyte losses [^117NKqpB].
- **Antibiotics**: Azithromycin or doxycycline can shorten illness duration and reduce stool volume [^113FYm6P].
- **Supportive care**: Monitor for complications such as electrolyte imbalances and renal dysfunction [^111NaiBk].

---

The most likely mechanism is **increased cyclic AMP** [^1163y9kz] from cholera toxin, causing profuse secretory diarrhea; management centers on **oral rehydration** [^117NKqpB] with adjunctive antibiotics.

Results

Distribution and Geographic Origin of Species Causing Traveler's Diarrhea

Aeromonas spp. were isolated as a cause of traveler's diarrhea in 18 (2%) of 863 patients. A. veronii biotype sobria was isolated in nine patients, A. caviae in seven patients, and A. jandaei and A. hydrophila in one patient each (Table 1). In three of these patients, another enteropathogen was also found: in one patient who had traveled to Mexico, Shigella sonnei was isolated together with A. veronii; in another patient traveling to India, Giardia lamblia was detected together with A. veronii; in the third patient, who had traveled to Thailand, Salmonella Typhimurium was found with A. veronii. The frequency of Aeromonas spp. as a cause of traveler's diarrhea was similar in patients returning from Africa (1.7%), Latin America (1.8%), and Asia (2.3%) (Table 1).

Clinical Features

The signs and symptoms of Aeromonas enteritis in these 18 patients are summarized in Table 2. Sixteen of the 18 patients had watery diarrhea; these were the cases associated with A. veronii biotype sobria and A. caviae. The patients with enteritis caused by A. hydrophila and A. jandaei had loose stools. Fifty percent of the patients had fever and abdominal cramps, whereas nausea and vomiting were uncommon complaints. Gross blood was observed in the stools of one patient, but this could be attributed to the S. sonnei isolated in the same stool. In 9 of the 18 patients, diarrhea was persistent.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

The 5 Main Clinical Syndromes of Diarrheal Disease Seen Among Infants and Young Children Presenting to Health Centers and Hospitals in Developing Countries

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

### Etiology, presentation, and risk factors for diarrheal syndromes in 3 sub-saharan African countries after the introduction of rotavirus vaccines from the vaccine impact on diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study [^113d8UNF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of mortality among children < 5 years of age globally, with 1 in 10 deaths attributed to diarrhea in 2019, and the greatest burden among children in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Although commonly described as a single entity, diarrheal disease comprises multiple clinical syndromes, each associated with different risk factors, causes, geographic distribution, pathophysiology, and sequelae. These include acute watery diarrhea (AWD) and bloody diarrhea (ie, dysentery), some cases of which progress to persistent diarrhea (PD). AWD is predominant in young children and characterized by frequent nonbloody loose or watery stools that can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Less common is bloody diarrhea, which historically has been associated with an increased risk of stunting, episodes of longer duration, and, in some settings, an increased risk of death compared with watery diarrhea (WD). Diarrheal episodes lasting ≥ 14 days, termed PD, are seen disproportionately among children in low- and middle-income countries and have been associated with more growth faltering and higher mortality rates.

During the past 3 decades, remarkable improvement has been observed in mortality rates associated with diarrheal disease in children < 5 years old, attributed to declines in risks, such as unsafe water and sanitation and stunting, in association with social and economic development in low- and middle-income countries, coupled with improvements in case management and rotavirus vaccine introduction. It is reasonable to expect that these ongoing shifts will result in changes in the etiology, manifestations, and outcomes of diarrhea in young children. However, progress has not been distributed equitably, in particular leaving areas of sub-Saharan Africa with a high prevalence of risk factors and poor outcomes. Therefore, it is important to update our understanding of diarrheal diseases in sub-Saharan Africa to inform initiatives for preventing disease and death associated with diarrhea.

The Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study was an age-stratified, matched case-control study that examined the incidence, etiology, and adverse clinical outcomes of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among infants and young children after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine at 3 sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Herein we describe the features of WD and dysentery, and determinants for progression to and sequelae from PD in the VIDA study. We also examine temporal trends in PD, comparing the results with those from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a similarly designed study conducted at the same sites 1 decade earlier.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of giardiasis in children include an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with presentations ranging from short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain to a more protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Stools can initially be profuse and watery then become greasy and foul smelling, with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent; malabsorption with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients and this syndrome may take several weeks to resolve, while asymptomatic Giardia infection is common. Extraintestinal features include invasion into bile or pancreatic ducts, long term extraintestinal symptoms in one third of patients, and subsequent development of reactive arthritis associated with giardiasis.

### Prevalence of common diarrheagenic enterobacteriaceae in iran (2000–2023): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mXwwf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary mechanisms underlying bacterial gastroenteritis encompass three main pathways. Firstly, enteric pathogens or minimally invasive bacteria induce excessive fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, leading to profuse diarrhea. Secondly, inflammatory or cytotoxic damage to the ileal or colonic mucosa can result in the production of blood and pus, complicating the clinical presentation. Lastly, in cases such as typhoid fever, certain bacteria penetrate the intestinal mucosa, gaining access to the reticuloendothelial system. These distinct mechanisms contribute to the varied manifestations and severities of bacterial gastroenteritis, emphasizing the complex interplay between the pathogen, host immune response, and gastrointestinal tract function. Gastroenteritis pathogens are classified into three primary categories based on their mechanisms of action and disease presentation. Secretory gastroenteritis is caused by Vibrio cholerae, ETEC (Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli), Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria produce toxins that stimulate intestinal secretion, leading to watery diarrhea without significant inflammation. Inflammatory gastroenteritis, characterized by bloody diarrhea and tissue damage, is primarily associated with Shigella, STEC (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli), Salmonella (excluding Typhi and Paratyphi), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, and Campylobacter. These pathogens induce an inflammatory response in the intestinal lining. Finally, invasive gastroenteritis involves organisms that penetrate the intestinal wall, including Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, as well as Yersinia enterocolitica. These pathogens invade the intestinal mucosa, potentially causing systemic infections.

### Effectiveness of rifaximin in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^114qx8fF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Travellers' diarrhoea causes substantial acute and long-term morbidity. Chemoprophylaxis with fluoroquinolones or rifaximin is effective in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to Latin America and Africa. Little evidence is available to support the protective effect of antimicrobial drugs in south and southeast Asia, where enteroinvasive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause a substantial proportion of diarrhoeal episodes. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of rifaximin in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia.

Methods

We did this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, parallel-group, clinical trial in Tübingen, Germany, between Nov 12, 2009, and Sept 3, 2012. Individuals aged 18–64 years who were planning a 6–28 day journey to south and southeast Asia were randomly assigned (1:1), according to a randomisation list (permuted block size of eight) generated by an independent statistician, to receive placebo or rifaximin 200 mg tablets twice daily. All members of the study team, including investigators, those assessing outcomes, and data analysts, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time to the first episode of classic travellers' diarrhoea, defined as three or more loose stools in 24 h, accompanied by one or more enteric symptoms. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol.

Findings

We randomly assigned 258 participants to rifaximin (n = 129) or placebo (n = 129), of whom 239 (93%) returned a completed diary and were included in the primary effectiveness analysis. 48 (41%) of 117 participants in the placebo group and 30 (25%) of 122 in the rifaximin group reported classic episodes of travellers' diarrhoea. From departure to 7 days after return, rifaximin provided 48% protection (95% CI 16–68) by lowering the incidence of travellers' diarrhoea from 1·99 (1·50–2·64) per 100 person-days in the placebo group to 1·04 (0·72–1·48) in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio 0·52, 95% CI 0·32–0·84; p = 0·005). The number needed to treat was 5·70 (95% CI 3·44–16·69) to prevent one case of classic travellers' diarrhoea during the first 3 weeks of follow-up. The per-protocol analysis essentially corroborated the findings from the intention-to-treat analysis. We recorded one serious adverse event in a participant in the rifaximin group who had grade 3 right lower quadrant abdominal pain 72 h after the last intake of study drug. The complaints were considered unlikely to be related to use of the drug.

Interpretation

Rifaximin is moderately effective in prevention of diarrhoea in individuals travelling to south and southeast Asia. Similar studies are needed to inform travellers and practitioners about the effectiveness of this drug at other popular destinations.

ACG acute diarrheal infections — clinical definitions delineate that acute diarrhea can be defined as the passage of a greater number of stools of decreased form from the normal lasting < 14 days; some definitions require an individual to present with an abrupt onset 3 or more loose or liquid stools above baseline in a 24-h period to meet the criteria of acute diarrhea, while persistent diarrhea is typically defined as diarrhea lasting between 14 and 30 days, with chronic diarrhea generally considered as diarrheal symptoms lasting for greater than a month.

### Management of the returning traveler with diarrhea [^111AiAys]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea (TD) strikes 20–60% of travelers visiting developing countries. It occurs shortly after the return and can be distinguished into two categories: acute and persistent TD. Acute TD, mostly caused by bacterial and viral pathogens, is usually mild and self-limited, and deserves empirical symptomatic and/or antibiotic therapy in selected cases. Fluoroquinolones are progressively superseded in this indication by azithromycin, a well tolerated macrolide active against most bacteria responsible for TD, including the quinolone-resistant species of Campylobacter jejuni that are now pervasive, especially in Southeast Asia and India. Persistent TD in the returning traveler is much rarer than its acute counterpart and may be associated with three types of causes. Persistent infections, among which Giardia and possibly Entamoeba predominate, account for a significant proportion of cases. Postinfectious processes represent a second cause and comprise temporary lactose malabsorption and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, now considered a major cause of persistent TD. Finally, apparently unrelated chronic diseases causing diarrhea are occasionally unmasked by TD and represent a third type of persistent TD, among which the well established case of incident inflammatory bowel disease poses intriguing pathogenesis questions. This review discusses recent advances in the field and provides practical recommendations for the management of TD in adult, immunocompetent returning travelers.

### Global etiology of travelers' diarrhea: systematic review from 1973 to the present [^115zVnWA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

Fifty-one published studies of travelers' diarrhea (TD) were examined to look for regional differences in pathogens identified. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was detected in 1,678/5,518 (30.4%) of TD cases overall, with rates in Latin America/Caribbean (L. America), Africa, south Asia, and Southeast Asia of 1,109/3,302 (33.6%), 389/1,217 (31.2%), 153/499 (30.6%), and 36/500 (7.2%), respectively (P < 0.001). Enteroaggregative E. coli was the second most common agent in L. America, found in 166/689 (24.1%), compared with 3/165 (1.8%) in Africa and 33/206 (16%) in south Asia (P < 0.001). Other significantly regional differences were seen for enteropathogenic E. coli, diffusely adherent E. coli, Campylobacter, Shigella spp. Salmonella, Aeromonas spp. Plesiomonas, Vibrios, rotavirus, noroviruses, Giardia, and Entoamoeba histolytica. The regional differences in pathogen identification identified will serve as a baseline for antimicrobial therapy recommendations and vaccines strategies.

### A prospective multi-center observational study of children hospitalized with diarrhea in Ho chi minh city, Vietnam [^114NdgiB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

The rate of pathogen detection in our non-diarrheal control population was much lower than that identified in the GEMS study (13% versus 72%). The GEMS study screened for a wider variety of pathogens, often using more sensitive assays, which could in part explain the difference. The exclusion of children who had received recent antimicrobial treatment may have biased our non-diarrheal control population as well. Also, the controls were more likely to report higher socioeconomic status indicators, and are thus likely from a different epidemiological population than the cases, which also may explain the low rate of pathogen detection in this group. However, one of the more notable findings from this study was that Salmonella spp. was detected in a similar proportion in cases and non-diarrheal controls (6%). Campylobacter spp. although more common in cases (5%), was also identified in 3% non-diarrheal controls. Recent case–control studies conducted in southeast Asia have found a high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. from healthy non-diarrheal controls in rural Thailand and Cambodia. These data imply that asymptomatic/transient infection with these organisms may be substantial in these areas; further research is warranted to determine the clinical relevance and role in disease transmission in the community.

We found remarkable levels of antimicrobial resistance in the pathogens isolated as part of this study; > 90% of Campylobacter spp. and Shigella and > 50% of Salmonella spp. isolates exhibited resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. Reduced susceptibility and resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials in enteric pathogens is becoming increasingly reported across Asia, and our data support the notion that resistance to multiple antimicrobial groups is common across multiple genera of enteric pathogens. For example, we found an exceptionally high prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter, which has been recorded in several Asian countries, including Cambodia, India, and China. Antimicrobial therapy is not generally recommended to treat non-dysenteric diarrhea, although ciprofloxacin is commonly used as a first-line antimicrobial in the case of profuse or bloody mucoid diarrhea. As routine identification of any causative agents of diarrhea is not performed in hospitals in Vietnam, patients are treated following standard Vietnamese treatment guidelines (ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone as first- and second-line therapies) based on clinical observations, which may be insensitive in distinguishing viral and bacterial infections. Developing affordable rapid point-of-care diagnosis should be considered to help clinicians choose more appropriate antimicrobial regimens for diarrheal patients in addition to encouraging continued use of rehydration and zinc supplementation.

### Factors that explain excretion of enteric pathogens by persons without diarrhea [^117PzSUh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

With modern, highly sensitive microbiologic methods and tests for pathogens that were unrecognized just a few decades ago, a wide array of enteropathogens can be recovered from cases of diarrhea in the GEMS. Indeed, the vast majority of GEMS patients with diarrhea can be expected to yield 1 or more possible etiologic agents. However, because of the pervasive fecal (human and animal) contamination that constitutes the underprivileged environment in which many young children are living in developing countries, facile transmission of pathogens readily occurs. It is therefore also imperative to assess the prevalence of various enteropathogens among appropriately selected subjects without diarrhea (ie, among matched controls). In a project such as GEMS, one expects to find a proportion of controls asymptomatically excreting known enteric pathogens. In this article we have attempted to review a series of plausible explanations for why healthy subjects without diarrhea may be excreting enteropathogens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these scenarios have been presented in a comprehensive way and from this perspective. Analyses of the GEMS epidemiologic, clinical, and microbiologic data in conjunction with detailed characterization of specimens in the GEMS repository will allow us to address many of the hypotheses and commentaries raised in this review.

### Aeromonas spp. and traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial resistance [^116ELzEi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In our study, 3 (16.7%) of the Aeromonas isolates were detected together with other enteropathogens. This situation allowed us to consider that the symptoms we observed in the patients with traveler's diarrhea associated with Aeromonas spp. were due to the presence of this Aeromonas organisms. In our study, watery stools, fever, and abdominal cramps were the most common symptoms, which is consistent with other reports. Albert et al. suggested that isolates of Aeromonas spp. positive for both the alt and ast genes, which encode enterotoxins, were associated with watery diarrhea but that isolates positive only for the alt gene were associated with loose stools.

Fifty percent of the patients with Aeromonas spp. enteritis had persistent diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea lasting more than 1 year caused by A. caviae has been reported. A direct link between drinking water and food contaminated with Aeromonas spp. and gastrointestinal disease has been demonstrated.

Patients with prolonged enteritis required treatment. A quinolone was the drug of choice, although increased occurrence of quinolone-resistant Aeromonas spp. strains has been reported in industrialized countries. Regarding the β-lactam antibiotics, Aeromonas spp. strains analyzed in this study were, as expected, uniformly resistant to ampicillin, whereas third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotaxime, showed good activity. These results are in accordance with those reported by other authors, showing that third-generation cephalosporins are active against Aeromonas spp. The percentage of strains with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ranged from 22.9% to 45%. These levels of resistance are likely related to the extensive use of these antimicrobial agents in unindustrialized countries.

In summary, A. veronii biotype sobria and A. caviae are the Aeromonas species most frequently associated with traveler's diarrhea; watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps are the predominant clinical features. The persistence of symptoms makes the use of antimicrobial treatment necessary.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute or persistent diarrhea [^117LnuW6]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Studies of microbial pathogens and the toxins they produce are important for determining the mechanisms by which they cause disease and spread throughout a population. Some bacteria produce secretory enterotoxins (such as cholera toxin or the heat-labile or stable enterotoxins produced by Escherichia coli) that invade cells directly. Others invade cells or produce cytotoxins (such as those produced by Shigella, enteroinvasive E coli, or Clostridium difficile) that damage cells or trigger host responses that cause small or large bowel diseases (such as enteroaggregative or enteropathogenic E coli or Salmonella). Viruses (such as noroviruses and rotaviruses) and protozoa (such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, or Entamoeba histolytica) disrupt cell functions and cause short- or long-term disease. Much epidemiologic data about these pathogens have been collected from community- and hospital-acquired settings, as well as from patients with traveler's or persistent diarrhea. These studies have led to practical approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Cryptosporidiosis in people with HIV — clinical manifestations — most commonly presents with acute or subacute watery diarrhea that may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and lower abdominal cramping, with severity ranging from asymptomatic to profuse, watery, voluminous diarrhea. More severe symptoms tend to occur in immunosuppressed people, whereas transient diarrhea alone is typical in people with competent immune systems; fever is present in approximately one-third of patients and malabsorption is common. The epithelium of the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct can be infected, leading to sclerosing cholangitis and to pancreatitis secondary to papillary stenosis, particularly among people with prolonged disease and low CD4 counts, and pulmonary Cryptosporidium infections have been reported and may be under-recognized.

### Spectrum of disease and relation to place of exposure among ill returned travelers [^113SHmcL]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Approximately 8 percent of travelers to the developing world require medical care during or after travel. Current understanding of morbidity profiles among ill returned travelers is based on limited data from the 1980s.

Methods

Thirty GeoSentinel sites, which are specialized travel or tropical-medicine clinics on six continents, contributed clinician-based sentinel surveillance data for 17,353 ill returned travelers. We compared the frequency of occurrence of each diagnosis among travelers returning from six developing regions of the world.

Results

Significant regional differences in proportionate morbidity were detected in 16 of 21 broad syndromic categories. Among travelers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, systemic febrile illness without localizing findings occurred disproportionately among those returning from sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, acute diarrhea among those returning from south central Asia, and dermatologic problems among those returning from the Caribbean or Central or South America. With respect to specific diagnoses, malaria was one of the three most frequent causes of systemic febrile illness among travelers from every region, although travelers from every region except sub-Saharan Africa and Central America had confirmed or probable dengue more frequently than malaria. Among travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, rickettsial infection, primarily tick-borne spotted fever, occurred more frequently than typhoid or dengue. Travelers from all regions except Southeast Asia presented with parasite-induced diarrhea more often than with bacterial diarrhea.

Conclusions

When patients present to specialized clinics after travel to the developing world, travel destinations are associated with the probability of the diagnosis of certain diseases. Diagnostic approaches and empiric therapies can be guided by these destination-specific differences.

Circulating agents cause intestinal secretion or changes in motility with decreased intestinal transit time, resulting in secretory-type diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea as opposed to osmotic diarrhea is characterized by large-volume, watery stools, often more than 1 L per day; by persistence of diarrhea when patients fast; and by the fact that on analysis of stool-water, measured osmolarity is identical to that calculated from the electrolytes present. Although sodium plays the main role in water and electrolyte absorption, chloride is the major ion involved in secretion.

### Cholera [^112oznxc]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Intestinal infection with Vibrio cholerae results in the loss of large volumes of watery stool, leading to severe and rapidly progressing dehydration and shock. Without adequate and appropriate rehydration therapy, severe cholera kills about half of affected individuals. Cholera toxin, a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, causes the intestine to secrete watery fluid rich in sodium, bicarbonate, and potassium, in volumes far exceeding the intestinal absorptive capacity. Cholera has spread from the Indian subcontinent where it is endemic to involve nearly the whole world seven times during the past 185 years. V cholerae serogroup O1, biotype El Tor, has moved from Asia to cause pandemic disease in Africa and South America during the past 35 years. A new serogroup, O139, appeared in south Asia in 1992, has become endemic there, and threatens to start the next pandemic. Research on case management of cholera led to the development of rehydration therapy for dehydrating diarrhoea in general, including the proper use of intravenous and oral rehydration solutions. Appropriate case management has reduced deaths from diarrhoeal disease by an estimated 3 million per year compared with 20 years ago. Vaccination was thought to have no role for cholera, but new oral vaccines are showing great promise.

Since first studied more than 5 decades ago the risk of travelers'diarrhea for persons going from industrialized regions to developing countries has remained high. Most cases of illness are caused by bacterial agents. Travelers' diarrhea is associated with temporary disability and it may progress to chronic intestinal illness and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. Exercising care about food and beverage intake, the use of rifaximin prophylaxis for selective patients, and self-treatment of all resultant illness will continue to be the way in which the disease is prevented or managed best by travelers. Future approaches will be aimed at making host regions safer and providing more effective methods of treatment and prevention of enteric disease during short-term international travel.

### Pathogenesis of diarrhea in the adult: diagnostic challenges and life-threatening conditions [^1164xuvE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms that regulate ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract are complex. Disturbance of this homeostatic state by bile acids, bacterial enterotoxins and neoplasm-derived secretagogues, for example, can lead to diarrhea. Determining the causes of chronic diarrhea in individual patients may, therefore, represent a diagnostic challenge. The gastrointestinal tract has finely tuned mechanisms to maintain ionic balance, fluid absorption and secretion. To achieve this homeostasis, various ionic transport proteins/complexes are targeted to the apical, basal or basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. Na, K and Cl ion transport proteins are regulated by endogenous activators (e.g. cAMP, PGE2, Ca), dietary-related factors (e.g. bile acids) and through post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). In certain pathophysiologic states, this homeostatic ionic/fluid exchange becomes dysfunctional as a result of failure of compensatory pro-absorptive/anti-secretory mechanisms. The excessive secretion of Na and Cl ions followed by the release of a large amount of H2O into the colonic lumen results in diarrhea, which may be acute or chronic, and can be life-threatening if not ameliorated. Diverse infectious organisms (e.g. bacteria, protozoa, viruses) utilize different mechanisms to cause intestinal disease and diarrhea. These pathophysiologic mechanisms include alterations in ion transport, disruption of tight junctions and elicitation of inflammatory responses. Studies of patients infected with certain pathogens, those with ulcerative colitis and those harboring extra-colonic or colonic neoplasms have elucidated some of these pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea. Determining the etiology of chronic diarrhea in specific cases may be a diagnostic challenge for both gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.

### Comparing sociocultural features of cholera in three endemic African settings [^111Xz13E]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Cholera is an ancient enteric disease that originated from the Ganges delta. It is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that exists in the aquatic environment independent from human hosts. V. cholerae produces an enterotoxin, which is the direct cause of acute watery diarrhea in humans. Cholera is characterized by loss of large volumes of rice-water-like stool leading to severe dehydration and concurrent electrolyte depletion. Case fatality rates without treatment may reach 50%. Timely administration of oral rehydration solutions or infusions is the principal treatment.

Global cholera burden and sub-Saharan Africa as a hotspot

Cholera case estimates officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) ranged between 190,000 and 320,000 for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, and between 5,000 and 7,500 deaths were reported. These figures, however, are highly under-reported because of limitations in surveillance, including case definitions, and also fear of trade-related and travel-related sanctions; they likely represent less than 10% of the true burden. A recent study estimated the number of people at risk of endemic cholera globally at 1.4 billion, with an annual burden of endemic cholera of 2.8 million cases and 91,000 deaths. Cholera thrives mostly in low-income and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

According to the latest estimates, 39% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived without safe water in 2010 (vs 51% in 1990), with an urban share of 17% and a rural share of 51%. Use of improved sanitation in the same region has been increasing from 26% to 30% since 1990. Similar to the estimates on water supply, there is also an urban/rural divide: 43% of urban people benefited from improved sanitation in 2010 versus only 23% in rural areas.

The public health burden of cholera is still intolerable in sub-Saharan Africa despite the above noted progress in the provision of safe water and sanitation. Consequently, and because of the recent huge outbreaks in Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Haiti, the 64th World Health Assembly adopted a new resolution in 2011 to strengthen the global fight against cholera.

The WHO recommends provision of sufficient, safe water and adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as the mainstay to prevent cholera. Official recommendations also include the use of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) as a supplementary public health tool for preemptive or reactive control of cholera outbreaks.

Introduction

Cholera is one of the most rapidly fatal infectious diseases known. It is caused by Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae), a Gram-negative, comma-shaped, facultatively anaerobic and acid-labile bacteria, which lives in an aqueous environment. V. cholerae acts on the intestinal lining or mucosa via a secreted exotoxin which leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and causes purging diarrhoea of somewhat 'fishy smelling', voluminous 'rice-water' stools. If the volume is not restored quickly, it frequently results in death. The case fatality rate is 30–50%. Prompt, timely and adequate replacement of volume loss reduces the case fatality rate to less than 1%. A healthy individual may develop hypotension, vascular collapse, shock, confusion and lethargy, which can result in death in 18–24 hours if left untreated. In extreme cases, death can occur in less than 6–8 hours.

V.cholerae is transmitted faecal–orally. Two patterns of transmission have been suggested for cholera: the environment-to-human pathway and the human-to-human pathway. Human-to-human transmission and household contacts are the basis of explosive outbreaks: the majority of cholera sufferers are poor and often victims of war or large-scale, socially disruptive migrations in crowded, unsanitary settings. Caregivers of infected patients are at high risk to become victims. Contacts are severely exposed through contaminated water and food, and outbreaks become explosive due to the significant amount of uncontrolled diarrhoea which is polluting the household, including drinking water, food preparation and bathing. Often, the rites of bathing the deceased in many cultures further expand and accelerate outbreaks of cholera. In essence, V. cholerae uses its victims to drastically increase and amplify its numbers, thus enhancing its spread. Any deficiency in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services plays a key role in cholera outbreaks and larger epidemics. Populations that are poor and crowded with little access to sanitation or safe water supplies are the most vulnerable and are increasing due to wars, displacement of populations of refugees and famine.

Oral rehydration — elderly with severe diarrhea or travelers with cholera-like watery diarrhea: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral options "is recommended" for these groups (Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). For most otherwise healthy adults with traveler's diarrhea (TD), "Formal ORS is not needed" because they can replace losses with salty soups, fruit juices, and carbohydrates to drive glucose–sodium cotransport. Travelers with diarrhea "should keep up with fluids and electrolytes" to pass urine regularly and maintain moist mucous membranes. In severe diarrhea, a balanced oral rehydration solution (ORS) available at pharmacies typically contains "sodium of 60–75 mEq/l and glucose of 75–90 mmol/l"; sports drinks "while not adequate alone to treat severe diarrhea can provide partial sodium and potassium replacement".

The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

Giardia clinical manifestations in children are characterized by an incubation period that usually lasts 1 to 2 weeks and averages 7 days, with children usually presenting with short-lasting, acute watery diarrhea with or without low-grade fever, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain; others may have a protracted intermittent course with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distension, and anorexia. Malabsorption combined with anorexia can lead to significant weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition in children, and stools can initially be profuse and watery and later become greasy and foul smelling with blood, mucus, and fecal leukocytes absent. Post-Giardia infection lactose intolerance can occur in 20% to 40% of patients, asymptomatic Giardia infection is common, and extraintestinal invasion can occur with trophozoites migrating into bile or pancreatic ducts; recent evidence demonstrates that one third of patients will express long term extraintestinal symptoms, including ocular, muscular and metabolic complications, and reactive arthritis has also been associated with giardiasis.

### Rise in cholera amid COVID-19: spotlight on Pakistan and Bangladesh [^111NaiBk]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Despite seven pandemics and widespread epidemics throughout the globe, the combat against cholera is not over yet. The disease is characterised by severe watery diarrhoea leading to dehydration and hypovolemic shock resulting from exposure to the flagellum-possessing highly-motile, gram-negative, comma-shaped bacilli, the Vibrio cholerae, predominantly transmitted via the faecal-oral route and occasionally shellfish consumption. Although numerous pathologic and non-pathologic serogroups exist, majorly only two have been implicated in breakouts, i.e. O1 and O139. Following ingestion of contaminated food, the bacteria battle their way through the stomach acid barrier paving towards the small intestine epithelium via chemotaxis. Upon reaching, it proliferates and colonizes the epithelial cells, initiating the secretion of cholera toxin. Regarded as the major virulence factor, the cholera toxin is composed of two subunits: A and B. While subunit-B assists in adherence to the cell surface, the A subunit enzymatically stimulates adenylate cyclase to enhance cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis, which in turn activates protein kinase A. Hence, inhibiting the absorption of sodium chloride and culminating in the increased efflux of chloride, hydrogen-carbonate, sodium ions, potassium, and water.

The incubation period varies from half to 5 days, following which the disease manifests as diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, and dehydration. If not managed properly, it can exacerbate causing hypovolemic shock, renal failure, and death. Since rehydration therapy is the mainstay of treatment for diarrhoeal diseases, the diagnostic tests are often not ordered as they do not significantly impact the course of treatment. However, they play a substantial role in recognising outbreaks. While culture followed by agglutination remains the gold standard diagnostic technique, the rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) employing antibody-based immunochromatographic assays, are more commonly employed, owing to their adequate sensitivity specificity and rapid results.

Over the last few decades, substantial work has been done to ensure safe water accessibility, improved sanitation, increased awareness, and mass cholera vaccination. The currently available oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are live attenuated vaccines that require the administration of two subsequent doses with a gap of two weeks. It demonstrates a 56 percent efficacy and 83 percent effectiveness during the first year and effects lasting for as long as five years. Furthermore, to improve global vaccine accessibility and affordability, the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside multiple partner institutions, initiated the OCV stockpile in 2011, aiming to combat both emergency and emerging outbreaks.

### Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic watery diarrhea [^1174bXkA]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic watery diarrhea poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and is often a disabling condition for patients. Although acute diarrhea is likely to be caused by infection, the causes of chronic diarrhea (> 4 weeks in duration) are more elusive. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic diarrhea. Drawing on recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial transport and barrier function, we discuss how diarrhea can result from a decrease in luminal solute absorption, an increase in secretion, or both, as well as derangements in barrier properties. We also describe the various extraepithelial factors that activate diarrheal mechanisms. Finally, clinical evaluation and tests used in the assessment of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea are reviewed, and an algorithm guiding therapeutic decisions and pharmacotherapy is presented.

Other considerations in bacterial enteric infections: MSM may be at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant enteric infections; diarrhea is a common illness of international travelers and antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacterial pathogens outside the United States is common, so clinicians should consider the possibility of resistant infections when prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for travelers with HIV while traveling or upon return to the United States, particularly among travelers to South and Southeast Asia or Africa; for patients with persistent diarrhea (> 14 days) but no other severe clinical signs, antibiotic therapy can be withheld until a diagnosis is confirmed and noninfectious etiologies can be considered in the differential diagnosis (BIII); azithromycin should not be used to treat bacteremia; before susceptibilities are known, empiric IV ceftriaxone is recommended, and updated outbreak information, local susceptibility patterns, and travel history should always be considered.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^1122cn6a]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

The context in which the diarrhea definition is applied will also influence its validity. The accuracy of a definition is inevitably higher when applied to a population already conditioned on caregiver perception of illness. Therefore, the accuracy of a diarrhea definition in correctly classifying true, clinically relevant disease is likely higher when applied at a healthcare facility than applied in a community active surveillance setting. Diarrhea can be caused by a range of enteric infections and local and systemic inflammatory processes that may or may not be captured by any single diarrhea definition. For diarrhea caused by pathogens that produce profuse secretory diarrhea, such as rotavirus and Vibrio cholerae, a definition based on number of loose stools may be optimal. For diarrhea etiologies that result in less acute fluid loss but may be associated with chronic linear growth failure or other more chronic pathologies, such as Cryptosporidium, a definition that includes mother's perception of child's overall health may be warranted. Noninfectious causes of diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease, recent administration of antibiotics, or other non-gastrointestinal infections such as malaria and dengue, for which diarrhea is a common secondary consequence, also complicate the accuracy of diarrhea definitions.

The validity of a diarrhea definition will also depend on the underlying pathophysiology the definition is intended to measure and the goal of its diagnosis. If identifying children with dehydrating diarrhea is the goal, as in the case of cross-sectional surveys aimed at assessing the coverage success of oral rehydration solution, a definition that maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of identifying cases at risk of progressing to dehydration should be used. This definition may differ from one used in efforts to estimate attribution of diarrhea to other outcomes, such as environmental enteric dysfunction or malnutrition, where a definition should be optimized to disaggregate children with the highest and lowest likelihood of experiencing these sequelae.

Infectious diarrhea — initial assessment and Shiga toxin–producing organisms: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults. When the clinical or epidemic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish Escherichia coli O157:H7 from other Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) in stool; if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used. In addition, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially in people with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler. Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

INTRODUCTION

Morbidity, mortality, and poor nutritional outcomes of young children because of diarrheal illnesses are leading health concerns particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is a leading cause of malnutrition and the third leading cause of death in children aged < 5 years, accounting for nearly half a million deaths in this age group each year. Of these diarrheal deaths, ∼90% occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are the foremost pathotypes of E. coli associated with childhood diarrheal illnesses. According to the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), Shigella and heat stable (ST)-toxin producing ETEC, either alone or along with heat labile (LT)-toxin producing ETEC, are the leading enteric pathogens associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children aged < 5 years. Pathogens associated with increased risk of infant mortality were ST- ETEC and typical EPEC and the risk of mortality was 8.5 times higher in MSD children than the asymptomatic children within the first 2 years of life. Apart from diarrheal morbidity and mortality, ETEC and EPEC also have been reported to be linked with other symptoms or conditions caused by undernutrition, especially stunting, among children aged < 5 years. Both ST-ETEC and LT-ETEC develop increasing virulence because of colonization and adherence to the intestinal mucosal membrane which results in profuse loss of water and electrolytes leading to exacerbation of dehydrating diarrheal illnesses. On the other hand, EPEC produces non-Shiga toxins and causes diarrhea by attaching to and effacing the gut mucosa. An EPEC infection results in abundant watery diarrhea and occasionally bloody diarrhea with mucus, whereas vomiting and low-grade fever are common in infants. Additionally, EPEC causes prolonged diarrhea (≥ 7 days) or persistent diarrhea (≥ 14 days), and children with prolonged or persistent diarrhea are more susceptible to growth faltering when compared with children with acute diarrheal episodes. Given the global burden of ETEC and EPEC strains and the absence of any licensed vaccines, it is essential to find the clinical and epidemiological risk factors of ETEC and EPEC infections to mitigate diarrheal disease burden and minimize long-term nutritional consequences. The clinical presentation of E. coli diarrhea and its effect on malnutrition are quite evident, and the GEMS database gives the unique opportunity to illustrate epidemiology and clinical representations of ETEC and EPEC diarrhea in three age groups (0–11 months, 12–23 months, and 24–59 months) to justify the existing knowledge gap. In the present study, we investigate the association of socioeconomic characteristics (breast-feeding; clinical features; existing water, sanitation, and hygeine [WASH] conditions and practice) with childhood ETEC and EPEC infection. We also analyze the effect of MSD episodes and asymptomatic infections because of ETEC and EPEC in z-scores of the children studied under 5 years of age.

Dysentery is diagnosed clinically as the presence of gross blood in diarrheal stools. Dysentery stools can be quite scanty and composed mainly of mucus and blood (shown here). Bacillary dysentery is typically preceded by 18–24 hours of watery diarrhea, accompanied by high fever and toxemia, before the loose stools become scanty and bloody. Dysentery indicates substantial damage to the mucosa of the colon and terminal ileum.

### Orally delivered toxin-binding protein protects against diarrhoea in a murine cholera model [^114k5si5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The severe diarrhoeal disease cholera is caused by the comma-shaped Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The pathogen is readily transmitted through contaminated water or food. After ingestion, bacteria proliferate in the small intestine (SI), where they initiate the production of cholera toxin (CTX) –. CTX is an AB 5 toxin comprised of five B-subunits (CTXB), which bind to the human ganglioside receptor GM1 with high affinity (K D = 0.73 nM), and an enzymatically active A-subunit (CTXA) –. Upon release into the cytosol, CTXA stimulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production which leads to chloride ion efflux across the epithelial cell membrane and ultimately to fluid secretion observed as severe watery diarrhoea. CTX also promotes release of nutrients into the lumen of the SI and thus enhances V. cholerae proliferation. The sequence of CTXB has been conserved in V. cholerae evolution, and there are only two amino acid substitutions in the mature CTXB protein between the two O1 serogroup biotypes (classical and El Tor) that have caused pandemic cholera.

Mechanisms of postinfection IBS

Postinfection IBS (PI-IBS) is a diagnosis that may be established in patients who meet Rome criteria for IBS soon after they experience an episode of acute gastroenteritis (positive stool culture test result in symptomatic patient, or presence of at least two of the three symptoms of fever, vomiting, or diarrhea); notably, IBS symptoms were not present before the occurrence of gastroenteritis. A systematic review of 45 studies (n = 21,421 patients) estimated a 10.1% prevalence rate of PI-IBS for individuals within 12 months after a case of gastroenteritis. The analysis also indicated that the 1-year relative risk (RR) for PI-IBS was significantly higher for patients who had gastroenteritis versus those who did not in studies conducted in Asia or Europe, versus those conducted in North America. Based on data from 23 of the studies, individuals with gastroenteritis were at a 4.2-fold greater risk of developing IBS compared with unaffected individuals. Another systematic review of six studies reported that patients with travelers' diarrhea were at a 3.4-fold greater risk of developing PI-IBS compared with healthy individuals. Further, a prospective cohort study identified an increased risk of developing PI-IBS in patients who had Salmonella exposure in childhood compared with individuals without known Salmonella exposure [odds ratio (OR) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2–3.0]. Survey data suggested that individuals who experienced acute gastroenteritis attributed mostly to Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Shigella, with diarrhea lasting > 2 weeks, were at an increased risk of developing PI-IBS compared with patients with diarrhea lasting ≤ 1 week [RR 6.5 (95% CI, 1.3–34) for diarrhea duration 15–21 days; RR 11.4 (95% CI, 2.2–58) for duration ⩾22 days]. A prospective study reported that 16.5% of 345 patients with acute gastroenteritis and 2.6% of 345 age- and sex-matched controls developed PI-IBS after 12 months [p < 0.001; RR, 6.4 (95% CI, 3.2–12.7)]. In addition to the role of bacteria in development of PI-IBS, norovirus was significantly associated with development of PI-IBS in individuals affected during a waterborne gastroenteritis outbreak in Italy in 2009 compared with unaffected individuals (OR, 11.4; 95% CI, 3.4–37.8; p < 0.0001). As well, a prospective study found that a food-borne norovirus illness was associated with a higher risk of PI-IBS at 3 months after the illness compared with individuals who did not contract norovirus during a Canadian outbreak in 2002 (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.0–48.7).

Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

Traveler setting — In a comparative report of travelers who attended a travel clinic before travel ('exposed') versus similar travelers who did not ('non-exposed'), 13 (4.3%) of those interviewed reported drinking unsafe water, with similar proportions in exposed (n = 7/150, 4.6%) and non-exposed subjects (n = 6/150, 4%) (P = 0.78). Forty-five (15%) of enrolled subjects ate some food with elevated risk of traveler's diarrhea; this proportion was higher in the non-exposed people (n = 36/150; 24%) than in the people attending the Travel Clinic (n = 9/150; 6%) (P < 0.0001). Fifty (16.7%) reported diarrhea or gastrointestinal symptoms, 9 (6%) in the group of exposed subjects and 41 (27.3%) in the non-exposed group (P < 0.0001), suggesting some effect of pretravel counseling, although there could have been other factors related to the self-selection of exposed more cautious given their seeking out of pretravel counseling and non-exposed travelers, which could explain these differences.

### A high burden of asymptomatic gastrointestinal infections in traditional communities in Papua New Guinea [^111PnsFN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

The most concerning finding of this study is the evidence of a high rate of asymptomatic carriage of Shigella in highland communities. The Global Burden of Disease Study determined that shigellosis was one of the most important contributors to all-age DALYs in both 1990 and 2010, and within the diarrheal diseases, it was the second leading cause of all-age deaths. Similarly, the recent Global Enteric Multicenter Study conducted in four African and three Asian nations showed Shigella to be a significant cause of moderate to severe diarrhea. Shigella is arguably the leading cause of moderate to severe diarrhea/dysentery in adults globally; and with the recommendation by WHO for the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in all countries, Shigella is likely to become the leading cause of serious diarrheal illness and death due to diarrhea in children globally. Furthermore, the clinical management of Shigella is increasingly challenging because of the widespread prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains.

Evidence presented here along with previous data from diarrheal etiology studies suggests that this setting is highly endemic for Shigella; resulting in high exposure and temporary carriage. Currently, there is no reliable way to distinguish Shigella from EIEC when using molecular detection directly on stool samples, as both pathogens contain the ipah gene. However, EIEC is rarely isolated in Papua New Guinea. The limited number of diarrheal etiology studies conducted to date in Papua New Guinea provide evidence that Shigella spp. are among the most common cause of diarrheal illnesses, for both children, and the general population. Indeed, this pathogen has also been linked with large, mortality-associated outbreaks in displaced populations in this country. Because of the cross-sectional design of this study, we cannot account for dynamic fluctuations in microbiota "normal flora" and enteric pathogen carriage. Indeed, persistent shedding of Shigella sp. has been documented in some people after infection, so a recent outbreak of Shigella in highland communities > 2 weeks before the sampling missions cannot be discounted. However, the high rate of Shigella positivity in both highland communities, separated by considerable distance geographically (> 14 hours by road transport) and both relatively isolated from mainstream PNG society, would suggest that any such outbreaks would be unrelated. Further analysis on other remote highland communities, ideally with larger cohorts of participants and longitudinal sampling, are needed to further investigate the mechanism responsible for this high carriage rate and the possibility of an association with gut microbiota.

Empiric management of infectious diarrhea — bloody diarrhea indications and agents: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of bacterial etiology, ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella, and people who have recently traveled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). In adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate).

IDSA infectious diarrhea — features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

### Mechanisms of infectious diarrhea [^114cvAEG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea is an important public health problem worldwide. Research has provided new insights into the mechanisms of diarrhea caused by various pathogens that are classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory or invasive. These three groups of organisms cause two diarrheal syndromes — noninflammatory diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea. The noninflammatory diarrheas are caused by enterotoxin-producing organisms such as Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, or by viruses that adhere to the mucosa and disrupt the absorptive and/or secretory processes of the enterocyte without causing acute inflammation or mucosal destruction. Inflammatory diarrhea is caused by two groups of organisms — cytotoxin-producing, noninvasive bacteria (e.g. enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile), or by invasive organisms (e.g. Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. Campylobacter spp. Entamoeba histolytica). The cytotoxin-producing organisms adhere to the mucosa, activate cytokines and stimulate the intestinal mucosa to release inflammatory mediators. Invasive organisms, which can also produce cytotoxins, invade the intestinal mucosa to induce an acute inflammatory reaction, involving the activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Regardless of the underlying mechanism they use, these various types of pathogen have all successfully evolved to evade and modulate the host defense systems. The mechanisms by which the different pathogens invade the host and cause infectious diarrhea are the topic of this Review.

### Pharmacological management of diarrhea [^116hnCGW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 2 billion annual cases of diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years and kills 1.5 million children each year. It is especially prevalent in the developing world, where mortality is related to dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and the resultant acidosis, and in 2001, it accounted for 1.78 million deaths (3.7% of total deaths) in low- and middle-income countries. However, diarrhea is also a common problem in the developed world, with 211 million to 375 million episodes of infectious diarrheal illnesses in the United States annually, resulting in 73 million physician consultations, 1.8 million hospitalizations, and 3100 deaths. Furthermore, 4% to 5% of the Western population suffers from chronic diarrhea. Given the high prevalence of diarrhea, research has been directed at learning more about the cellular mechanisms underlying diarrheal illnesses in order to develop new medications directed at novel cellular targets. These cellular mechanisms and targets are discussed in this article.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

Infectious diarrhea — patient education on transmission risk after illness: All patients should be educated about mode of spread of diarrheal diseases, typically fecal-oral, and warned that they potentially may be infectious to others after symptom resolution and for ensuing weeks to months, and careful hand hygiene should be observed, particularly for those involved in food preparation, education, or healthcare.

### Antimicrobial drugs for treating cholera [^113FYm6P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cholera is an acute watery diarrhoea caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which if severe can cause rapid dehydration and death. Effective management requires early diagnosis and rehydration using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids. In this review, we evaluate the additional benefits of treating cholera with antimicrobial drugs.

Objectives

To quantify the benefit of antimicrobial treatment for patients with cholera, and determine whether there are differences between classes of antimicrobials or dosing schedules.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; African Index Medicus; LILACS; Science Citation Index; metaRegister of Controlled Trials; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; conference proceedings; and reference lists to March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials in adults and children with cholera that compared: 1) any antimicrobial treatment with placebo or no treatment; 2) different antimicrobials head-to-head; or 3) different dosing schedules or different durations of treatment with the same antimicrobial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extracted data from included trials. Diarrhoea duration and stool volume were defined as primary outcomes. We calculated mean difference (MD) or ratio of means (ROM) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled data using a random-effects meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-nine trials were included in this review with 4623 participants. Antimicrobials versus placebo or no treatment Overall, antimicrobial therapy shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea by about a day and a half compared to placebo or no treatment (MD -36.77 hours, 95% CI -43.51 to -30.03, 19 trials, 1013 participants, moderate quality evidence). Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50% (ROM 0.5, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.56, 18 trials, 1042 participants, moderate quality evidence) and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40% (ROM 0.60, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, 11 trials, 1201 participants, moderate quality evidence). The mean duration of fecal excretion of vibrios was reduced by almost three days (MD 2.74 days, 95% CI -3.07 to -2.40, 12 trials, 740 participants, moderate quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity in the size of these benefits, probably due to differences in the antibiotic used, the trial methods (particularly effective randomization), and the timing of outcome assessment. The benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting only patients with severe dehydration and in those recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration. Comparisons of antimicrobials In head-to-head comparisons, there were no differences detected in diarrhoea duration or stool volume for tetracycline compared to doxycycline (three trials, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); or tetracycline compared to ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin (three trials, 259 participants, moderate quality evidence). In indirect comparisons with substantially more trials, tetracycline appeared to have larger benefits than doxycycline, norfloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the primary review outcomes. Single dose azithromycin shortened the duration of diarrhoea by over a day compared to ciprofloxacin (MD -32.43, 95% CI -62.90 to -1.95, two trials, 375 participants, moderate quality evidence) and by half a day compared to erythromycin (MD -12.05, 95% CI -22.02 to -2.08, two trials, 179 participants, moderate quality evidence). It was not compared with tetracycline.

Authors' Conclusions

In treating cholera, antimicrobials result in substantial improvements in clinical and microbiological outcomes, with similar effects observed in severely and non-severely ill patients. Azithromycin and tetracycline may have some advantages over other antibiotics.

### Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin drives enteropathic changes in small intestinal epithelia [^111R3ViM]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Infectious diarrhea remains a leading cause of death and morbidity among young children in low-middle-income countries where access to clean water and sanitation remains in short supply. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), initially discovered as a cause of severe, cholera-like illness, are one of the most common pathogens associated with moderate-severe diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years, and are perennially the most common cause of diarrhea in travelersto endemic regions where these organisms are thought to account for hundreds of millions of cases of diarrheal illness each year.

Importantly, ETEC infections have been linked to non-diarrheal sequelae, including "environmental enteric dysfunction (EED)", a condition characterized by impaired nutrient absorption, impaired growth, and malnutrition, adding significantly to the morbidity as well as deaths from diarrhea and other infections. The risk of stunting multiplies with each episode of diarrheal illness in children under the age of two years, a period during which children residing in impoverished areas commonly sustain multiple ETEC infections. However, the molecular pathogenesis underlying the intestinal changes associated with EED, and the contribution of individual pathogens, including ETEC, remain poorly understood.

Similarly, toxin-producing E. coli have also been repeatedly identified in patients with tropical sprue –, a condition classically described in adults residing for extended periods of time in areas where ETEC diarrheal disease is common. Like EED, tropical sprue is associated with changes to the small intestinal villous architecture, including ultrastructural alteration of the epithelial brush border formed by the microvilli, nutrient malabsorption, and wasting.

The basic molecular mechanisms underpinning acute watery diarrhea caused by ETEC are well-established. ETEC produces heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins that activate the production of cAMP and cGMP second messengers, respectively, leading to activation of cellular kinases that in turn modulate the activity of sodium and chloride channels in the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells to promote net efflux of salt and water into the intestinal lumen resulting in watery diarrhea.

Persistent watery diarrhea — etiology and approach emphasize identifying a cause rather than empiric therapy: persistent watery diarrhea generally should not be treated in the absence of an identified cause, is only rarely due to bacterial infection in otherwise healthy adults and children, and organisms reported with prolonged diarrhea (such as Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, C. difficile, and EAEC) are not detected on routine stool culture. When infection is responsible, the most common etiologic agents are protozoa and are best managed with pathogen-specific therapy rather than empiric therapy before diagnosis; an exception is in severely immunocompromised patients (including people with AIDS), in whom more conventional pathogens such as Campylobacter and Salmonella may persist, and in such cases an empiric trial with an antimicrobial agent may be considered to provide symptomatic benefit to optimize tolerance of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Cryptosporidiosis — clinical manifestations: Patients most commonly have acute or subacute onset of watery diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and lower abdominal cramping, and disease severity can range from asymptomatic to profuse, cholera-like diarrhea, with more severe symptoms tending to occur in immune-suppressed patients. Fever is present in approximately one-third of patients, and malabsorption is common. Infection of the epithelium of the biliary tract and the pancreatic duct can lead to sclerosing cholangitis and pancreatitis secondary to papillary stenosis, particularly among patients with prolonged disease and low CD4 counts. Pulmonary Cryptosporidium infections also have been reported, and may be under-recognized.

### Crofelemer, a novel agent for treatment of secretory diarrhea [^111Qg5sD]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of crofelemer.

Data Sources

A literature search using the terms SP-303, Provir, and crofelemer was performed with PubMed (up to April 2010), Google Scholar, and selected Ovid bibliography searches. Additional references from the bibliographies of articles included in the search, as well as company and Food and Drug Administration Web sites, were also assessed.

Data Extraction

English-language in vitro and clinical studies associated with the safety and efficacy of crofelemer were included.

Data Synthesis

Crofelemer is a first-in-class agent that may be useful for different types of secretory diarrhea, since it prevents chloride and fluid secretion into the bowel by directly inhibiting 2 distinct intestinal chloride channels. Crofelemer significantly brought about faster symptom resolution in patients with traveler's diarrhea, along with lower rates of treatment failure compared to placebo-treated patients. In a post hoc analysis, crofelemer compared to placebo also appears to have reduced abnormal stool weight and frequency in patients with AIDS-associated diarrhea. In a third trial, crofelemer did not offer a significant benefit in improving stool consistency after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, a significant increase in pain-free days was noted in female patients. Preliminary studies also show that crofelemer may reduce watery stool output in patients with infectious diarrhea such as cholera. Oral crofelemer seemed to be well tolerated in clinical trials, with adverse effect profiles comparable to those with placebo.

Conclusions

Crofelemer possesses a novel mechanism of action that shows promise in treating secretory diarrhea of several etiologies. However, results from further Phase 3 clinical trials are still needed in order to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of this agent.
