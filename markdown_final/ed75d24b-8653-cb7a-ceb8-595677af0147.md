D. False, True

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether every field is a ring and whether every ring has a multiplicative identity, and to choose the correct option among A. True, True; B. False, False; C. True, False; D. False, True. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definitions of a field and a ring. Then, I should verify whether a field satisfies the ring axioms. Next, I will check whether rings are required to have a multiplicative identity and whether there are exceptions. Finally, I will align the conclusions with the answer choices and double-check for any subtle definitional variations that could change the outcome.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, which means it is a ring with additional properties, so by definition a field is a ring, albeit a very special one. A ring, in its most general algebraic sense, is a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, such that the set is an abelian group under addition and multiplication is associative and distributes over addition; critically, some authors require a multiplicative identity (unity), while others do not, and the latter are sometimes called rngs to distinguish them from rings with unity.

> Now, I will examine Statement 1: "Every field is also a ring". Wait, let me verify the containment. Since a field is defined as a commutative ring with unity plus the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements, it automatically satisfies all ring axioms, so every field is indeed a ring; in fact, it is a commutative ring with unity, which is a stronger statement than just "ring", but still within the category of rings, so Statement 1 is true.

> Next, I should review Statement 2: "Every ring has a multiplicative identity". Hold on, I should verify the convention. In many standard algebra texts, "ring" includes a multiplicative identity by default, but in others, particularly in advanced or foundational contexts, a ring is not required to have a multiplicative identity, and those structures without unity are sometimes explicitly called rngs; therefore, the truth of this statement depends on the definition being used, and because there are respectable sources that define rings without requiring a multiplicative identity, the universal claim "every ring has a multiplicative identity" is false across all conventions, even though it is true under some conventions.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought Statement 2 might be true because many undergraduate texts assume unity, but that would be too hasty; I need to ensure I account for the broader mathematical literature where rings without identity are studied, which means the correct assessment is that Statement 2 is false in general, even if it is true under certain restrictive definitions of "ring".

> Putting this together, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, which corresponds to option C. I should double-check that no definitional twist reverses this, but the field-to-ring inclusion is definitional, and the existence of rings without identity is well established, so the conclusion stands.

> Final answer: C. True, False.

---

The correct answer is **C. True, False**. Every field is a ring because a field satisfies all ring axioms (abelian group under addition, associative multiplication, and distributivity) and has a multiplicative identity and inverses for nonzero elements. However, **not every ring has a multiplicative identity**; rings without a multiplicative identity are called rngs, so Statement 2 is false.

## Statement 1: Every field is also a ring

A field is a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying the following axioms:

- **Abelian group under addition**: Closure, associativity, commutativity, identity (0), and inverses.
- **Associative multiplication**: Closure, associativity, and distributivity over addition.
- **Commutative multiplication**: Multiplication is commutative.
- **Multiplicative identity**: There exists a 1 ≠ 0 such that 1 · a = a for all a.
- **Multiplicative inverses**: For every a ≠ 0, there exists b such that a · b = 1.

A ring is a set with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying:

- **Abelian group under addition**: Same as above.
- **Associative multiplication**: Same as above.
- **Distributivity**: Multiplication distributes over addition.

Thus, every field satisfies all ring axioms, making **every field a ring**. In fact, a field is a commutative ring with unity and inverses for nonzero elements.

---

## Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity

This statement is **false**. By definition, a ring does not necessarily have a multiplicative identity. Rings without a multiplicative identity are sometimes called rngs. For example, the set of even integers with standard addition and multiplication is a ring but has no multiplicative identity.

---

## Conclusion

Statement 1 is **true** because every field satisfies the ring axioms. Statement 2 is **false** because not every ring has a multiplicative identity. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**.

### Telling the truth to patients with cancer: what is the truth? [^774eabaf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2006). Medium credibility.

Attitudes and practices of truth-telling to people with cancer have shifted substantially in the past few years. However, cultural and individual differences persist, and some difficulties common to all medical specialties are magnified in oncology. In this Personal View, I review and analyse data for attitudes and practices of truth-telling worldwide. I also assess ethical justifications, with special reference to interpersonal aspects of patients' autonomy and the dynamic nature of truth in the clinical context. Examples are provided to show how this ethical perspective can help oncologists to frame the discourse on truth-telling and to find solutions to the dilemmas of whether, when, and how to tell the truth to their patients in clinical practice. Finally, I identify future targets for research.

### Discovering the truth beyond the truth [^6315c4b3]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

The question "What is truth?" is one of the oldest questions in philosophy. Truth within the field of medicine has gained relevance because of its fundamental relationship to the principle of patient autonomy. To fully participate in their medical care, patients must be told the truth-even in the most difficult of situations. Palliative care emphasizes patient autonomy and a patient-centered approach, and it is precisely among patients with chronic, life-threatening, or terminal illnesses that truth plays a particularly crucial role. For these patients, finding out the truth about their disease forces them to confront existential fears. As physicians, we must understand that truth, similar to the complexity of pain, is multidimensional. In this article, we discuss the truth from three linguistic perspectives: the Latin veritas, the Greek aletheia, and the Hebrew emeth. Veritas conveys an understanding of truth focused on facts and reality. Aletheia reveals truth as a process, and emeth shows that truth is experienced in truthful encounters with others. In everyday clinical practice, truth is typically equated with the facts. However, this limited understanding of the truth does not account for the uniqueness of each patient. Although two patients may receive the same diagnosis (or facts), each will be affected by this truth in a very individual way. To help patients apprehend the truth, physicians are called to engage in a delicate back-and-forth of multiple difficult conversations in which each patient is accepted as a unique individual.

### Tragic knowledge: truth telling and the maintenance of hope in surgery [^c9732515]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgeons often are faced with the challenge of balancing truth telling and the maintenance of hope in the setting of a poor prognosis. This ethical dilemma is informed by conflicting appeals to principles of autonomy and nonmaleficence, where a patient's right to be told important medical information must be weighed against the potential harm that may result from the knowledge of an unfavourable diagnosis. Truth telling in surgery raises questions on the nature of truth itself, how much information ought to be shared, what information can be withheld, and how surgeons should share tragic knowledge with patients. This paper will address these questions and provide some insight on how surgeons may navigate the sharing of tragic knowledge.

### Updating the OMERACT filter: implications of filter 2.0 to select outcome instruments through assessment of "truth": content, face, and construct validity [^ab19dbf7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Filter provides guidelines for the development and validation of outcome measures for use in clinical research. The "Truth" section of the OMERACT Filter requires that criteria be met to demonstrate that the outcome instrument meets the criteria for content, face, and construct validity.

Methods

Discussion groups critically reviewed a variety of ways in which case studies of current OMERACT Working Groups complied with the Truth component of the Filter and what issues remained to be resolved.

Results

The case studies showed that there is broad agreement on criteria for meeting the Truth criteria through demonstration of content, face, and construct validity; however, several issues were identified that the Filter Working Group will need to address.

Conclusion

These issues will require resolution to reach consensus on how Truth will be assessed for the proposed Filter 2.0 framework, for instruments to be endorsed by OMERACT.

### Is there truth in fiction? Lessons from readers' responses to dementia fiction [^8ade19d8]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

This paper addresses the question 'is there truth in fiction?', by synthesising a range of disciplinary approaches to the issue, as well as drawing on empirical research carried out with readers of fiction about dementia (hereafter, dementia fiction). We argue that fiction-perhaps because of its fictional status and apparatus-invites readers to consider its truth value, to explore the possibilities of human experience and interrogate issues relative to their subjective experience, community or society. The findings have significant implications for the Medical Humanities' use of fictional texts to explore lived medical conditions and experiences, as well as claims made about the potential for fiction to affect real-world understandings, awareness and empathy around the conditions depicted. We show that the techniques used in fictional language may be artifice, but they simulate a truth that corresponds with reality.

### Fake news, alternative facts, and things that just are not true: can science survive the post-truth era? [^41abc5fa]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps more than at any time in history, we are graced by scientific achievements that promise to revolutionize the health and well-being of people all over the world. Given that science has been so successful, the threat imposed by post-truth thinking seems distant, and unlikely to emerge within the modern scientific community. However, it bears emphasis that scientists engage in post-truth thinking, often with the best intentions, and often without knowing it. There are several likely explanations for how this might occur. First, the rapidly changing nature of science means it can disrupt existing paradigms, so that scientists whose body of scientific work depends on existing paradigms may be slow(er) and or resistant to adopt new ideas. I can recall sitting in various study sections listening to rigorous discussions from learned colleagues about how a new idea proposed in a grant could not possibly be true because that new idea did not conform to the existing paradigms. In this setting, the debate over what is true and false is ultimately determined by the conditions under which what is true and false is decided. Another explanation is that what is deemed as the truth scientifically is often context dependent. Philosophers have termed this concept "epistemic relativism", emphasizing that there are no facts, only interpretations of facts. As physician scientists, we study diseases that are the result of perturbations that arise within complex, homeostatic biological systems that have become dysregulated for some reason. In one context, blocking the biological system may lead to loss of homeostasis and worsening outcomes; in another context, blocking the dysregulated system may lead to improved outcomes. Thus, the data provided by rigorously performed scientific studies are rarely black and white and are dependent on the contextual boundaries imposed by the experimental conditions chosen by the investigator. Third, and this may come as a shock, the scientific community is not immune to investigators who purvey fake news, alternative facts, and things that are just not true. Fortunately, in my experience, these individuals are rare. In his 1988 Presidential Address to the American Society for Clinical Investigation, Robert Lefkowitz spoke eloquently about the 3 elements of the spirit of science: enthusiasm for new knowledge, creativity, and integrity. Lefkowitz described integrity as "an unswerving commitment to what we perceive as true and right, and to a set of consistent, personally realized principles of action". He states:

### Is there truth in fiction? Lessons from readers' responses to dementia fiction [^644d7732]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This article has explored the question — is there truth in fiction? — with recourse to a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, as well as a dataset of reader responses to dementia fiction. Our approach has been based on the correspondence theory of truth; that is, that truth corresponds to reality in certain ways. We have empirically investigated the ways that dementia fiction can correspond to readers' truths, drawing on the five different kinds of correspondences outlined by Lamarque and Olsen: accuracy, authentic, affective, epistemological and moral. Our findings show that accuracy and authenticity are key to readers' impressions of truth in fiction and suggest that they create the conditions for readers to establish affective, epistemological and moral truths. That is, once readers identify a fictional text as having an accurate and authentic truth value, they are more likely to respond with feeling, empathy and a change in their understanding or values. Insights from cognitive approaches to fictional reading have informed our analyses of how the reading group participants interpret the fictional extracts, as well as the characters and experiences depicted therein. Our findings lend empirical support to the idea that readers' impressions are informed by combining 'top–down' and 'bottom–up' processing. The findings also indicate that the extent to which a reader has lived experience of a condition depicted in fiction dictates the extent to which they either draw on that experience, or rely on the textual cues to form their impression. Therefore, fiction has an ongoing role in the interrogation and establishment of the 'truth'.

Our reader response data is subject to further analysis regarding these responses (, forthcoming). In the meantime, the present contribution goes some way to addressing the question — is there truth in fiction? — with, for the first time, empirical evidence drawn from a corpus of responses from different kinds of readers. We hope the enhanced understanding of truth in fiction, as offered here, contributes towards the Medical Humanities debate on the relevance of fictional representations of an illness to sociocultural understandings of that illness. Whether or not empathy is an achievable (or desirable) outcome of reading fiction about an illness, our findings have shown that fiction — because of and through its fictional status and form — provides readers with a means to interrogate the truth.

### Why do phase III trials of promising heart failure drugs often fail? The contribution of "regression to the truth" [^1cb06d14]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

There has been considerable recent disappointment with the failure of a number of major new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of chronic heart failure. In turn, there has been much speculation as to why trials of these therapies have not shown benefit. Among a number of plausible and scientifically valid reasons, consideration should be afforded to the potential contribution of "regression to the truth". Regression to the truth derives from the biological concept of regression to the mean, whereby random fluctuations in a biological variable occur over time, such that the true value of the variable is approached with repeated measurements. This same concept can be applied to clinical trial programs for new drugs for heart failure. Because only strongly positive trials generally go on to phase III testing, and some of these early phase studies are positive by chance alone, on retesting in phase III the results are very likely not be as strongly positive. Numerous examples of regression to the truth apply for trials of heart failure therapies, as well as in other areas. A major concern is how to minimize negative outcomes in phase III trials. One approach is to perform major rigorous phase II testing. Alternatively, avoidance of phase II testing will minimize "regression to the truth" because there are no data in phase II from which regression might occur. However, this approach does not obviate the need for an evaluation process in the selection of candidate agents (and their appropriate dose) in order to proceed to definitive testing.

### Truth telling, autonomy and the role of metaphor [^56c9f59f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

This paper examines the potential role of metaphors in helping healthcare professionals to communicate honestly with patients and in helping patients gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of what is being explained. One of the ways in which doctors and nurses may intentionally, or unintentionally, avoid telling the truth to patients is either by using metaphors that obscure the truth or by failing to deploy appropriately powerful and revealing metaphors in their discussions. This failure to tell the truth may partly account for the observation by clinicians that patients sometimes make decisions that, from the perspective of their clinician, and given all that the clinician knows, seem unwise. For example, patients with advanced cancer may choose to undergo further, aggressive, treatment despite the fact that they are likely to accrue little or no benefit as a result. While acknowledging that the immediate task of telling patients the truth can be difficult for all those concerned, I argue that the long-term consequences of denying patients autonomy at the end of life can be harmful to patients and can leave doctors and nurses distressed and confused.

### Tell parents the truth, but tell It slant [^60737e0b]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

This article draws on fiction, poetry, and memoir to suggest that for many people, tragic choices are best dealt with not through explicit conversations that directly confront difficult truths but, instead, through indirect and ambiguous conversations that only suggest what is most important. Telling the truth slant is not easier than telling it directly. It requires more imagination and perhaps more sensitivity to the parents' nonverbal cues. The underlying moral principles are the same in the 2 approaches. The values and preferences of the patient and the family should be given highest priority. But to respect those values and honor those preferences, doctors need to listen carefully to understand what parents are saying, what they are not saying, what they mean, and what they need. Sometimes they may be saying that there are things that they prefer not to discuss or decisions that would prefer not to affirm.

5. Bland-Altman Plot for Antonio A, Antonio B, Antonio C, and Pekar vs Ionized Calcium. We conducted a Bland-Altman analysis and applied a linear transformation to standardize total calcium and ionized calcium onto the same scale. The Bland-Altman plots revealed a negative bias for the Payne and simplified formulas, especially at lower calcium levels.

A similar pattern was present for the other formulas that adjusted for total calcium and those estimating ionized calcium, with a negative bias observed at lower calcium levels. However, these adjustment formulas have been repeatedly shown to be unreliable. 9–11, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 36, 38 As previously mentioned, the original correction formula proposed by Payne and colleagues was derived from a single laboratory using an albumin measurement method no longer available today, and never validated against.

### Is there truth in fiction? Lessons from readers' responses to dementia fiction [^45d36e72]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

Truth in fiction: theoretical approaches

The truth of fiction has been debated by scholars in literary theory, the philosophy of literature and aesthetics for decades (eg, see Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism :;). At the heart of the matter is the paradox inherent in 'truth in fiction': fiction, by its very nature, does not claim to tell the truth and, furthermore, it even uses forms that emphasise its fictionality and constructedness, such as metaphors, internal viewpoints and flashbacks; forms which are replete in our dementia fiction corpus and contribute to the unique ways that fiction can present subjective experience in general and dementia in particular.

advance a 'no-truth' approach to fiction that became so influential it closed off the debate for some time (although see useful developments inand). Underpinning their argument is a narrow, Aristotelian definition of truth: 'to say of what is that it is'. So when literature is said to correspond with the truth — to be like, or about the truth — they hold these looser correlations as invalid. Lamarque and Olsen critique existing scholarship for 'the diffuseness of literary truth' (1994, 11), listing five kinds of theories on the relationship between truth and fiction (1994, 12–14):

### The impact of culture and religion on truth telling at the end of life [^8ba2a73b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Truth telling, a cardinal rule in Western medicine, is not a globally shared moral stance. Honest disclosure of terminal prognosis and diagnosis are regarded as imperative in preparing for the end of life. Yet in many cultures, truth concealment is common practice. In collectivist Asian and Muslim cultures, illness is a shared family affair. Consequently, decision making is family centred and beneficence and non-malfeasance play a dominant role in their ethical model, in contrast to patient autonomy in Western cultures. The 'four principles' are prevalent throughout Eastern and Western cultures, however, the weight with which they are considered and their understanding differ. The belief that a grave diagnosis or prognosis will extinguish hope in patients leads families to protect ill members from the truth. This denial of the truth, however, is linked with not losing faith in a cure. Thus, aggressive futile treatment can be expected. The challenge is to provide a health care service that is equable for all individuals in a given country. The British National Health Service provides care to all cultures but is bound by the legal principles and framework of the UK and aims for equity of provision by working within the UK ethical framework with legal and ethical norms being explained to all patients and relatives. This requires truth telling about prognosis and efficacy of potential treatments so that unrealistic expectations are not raised.

### Ethical considerations in dementia diagnosis and care: AAN position statement [^18914492]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) position statement — truth-telling and disclosure in dementia: Clinicians should ascertain patients' preferences for receiving diagnostic information before communicating a diagnosis, and unless capacitated patients specifically request that information be given to others rather than directly to them, nondisclosure violates patient autonomy; for patients without decisional capacity, the diagnosis should be disclosed to a legally recognized surrogate decision-maker and in most cases also to the patient when feasible. To minimize emotional harm, consider the setting and manner of disclosure and involve trusted clinicians or family members to provide support; frameworks such as the SPIKES protocol can guide these discussions, and family members' fears can often be assuaged by thoughtful and compassionate disclosure using these strategies.

### Exploring how to tell the truth and preserve hope: can a balance between communication and empathy be calculated? [^b2c02e39]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

When told the harsh truth about severe disease, a patient might despair and lose all hope. Without knowing the truth, however, the patient cannot participate in decision making and adjust life according to his illness. The present study aims to analyze the relationships between hope and truth in the decision on how much information to disclose to a patient with severe gastrointestinal disease.

Methods

The decision analysis is based on the economic concepts of indifference curves and utility function. An inverse linear relationship exists between hope and truth; as more truth becomes revealed, the amount of hope declines. The utility function and the corresponding indifference curve of hope plotted versus truth describe the patient's personal choices among different combinations of hope and truth. The optimal choice among various combinations of hope and truth corresponds with the point at which the inverse hope-truth line meets the indifference curve.

Results

In situations in which hope drops steeply as more medical facts are being revealed, the utility to the patient is maximized with less truth being told. With a less pronounced truth-related decline in hope, utility is maximized at higher levels of truth, and, occasionally, utility is maximized only after all medical facts have been disclosed. The lesser the impact of truth on hope, the more truth is being tolerated.

Conclusions

A caring gastroenterologist trying to optimize his/her patient's well-being should try to assess the potential influence of truth on the patient's psyche and dispense it accordingly.

### "Do I want to know it all? " A qualitative study of glioma patients' perspectives on receiving information about their diagnosis and prognosis [^b7f89db9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Truth

All respondents stated that being told the truth about diagnosis and prognosis was important, and they did not want to be told lies. However, they had different perceptions on what constituted "the truth" and how it should be told. We identified three categories.

The good truth

A few participants stated that they wanted to know the truth, but only the good truth, meaning favourable information which would enable them to focus on what was positive. They felt it was better not to hear negative information, since receiving bad news could make them lose hope and become depressed. To cope with a poor prognosis, some wanted information to focus on short-term events, here and now. Even though they preferred not knowing the full prognosis, they still labelled information as "the truth" as opposed to being lied to.

If something can be done, then I'd like to know, but otherwise I don't want to know. I guess I'll notice if it ends badly. Woman, age 76, LGG

Being told [about a poor prognosis] might just cause you to die faster, as you don´t see any hope. If you aren´t told, you can build up hope that makes you live longer. That is the reason I wouldn´t want to know. Woman, age 45, GBM

The big picture

Some patients wanted truthful information on the overall prognosis, good or bad, but only the big picture. By not providing detailed information of the future and likely outcomes, hope could be preserved.

Maybe you don't have to go into the details, but say enough, so that you know the kind of general direction you´re heading. Woman, age 36, LGG

I want honest information, but if I want to know it all, that I don´t really know… that's a difficult question to answer. Honest? It should be truthful but there must still be some hope. Man, age 56, GBM

### Artificial intelligence for ultrasound scanning in regional anaesthesia: a scoping review of the evidence from multiple disciplines [^8a2ca478]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Ground truth for model training/development

Ground truth refers to information known to be real and is used as the reference standard to train and test an AI technology. When training models in a supervised machine learning approach, raw data are presented alongside the ground truth and the model learns data patterns underlying this interpretation of the data. When evaluating models, the ground truth is used as a benchmark against which the models are assessed. It is therefore important to use a ground truth of the highest calibre to train models to the highest standard and assess them accurately.

In the available sources, a variety of human image interpretation was used as the ground truth. This included a range in the number of humans used in the ground truth from one, two, three, and up to 15. Some sources cited 'multiple' humans, used a plural term (e.g. experts), or simply did not state the number. Where multiple humans contributed to the ground truth, it was often unclear whether a single human assessed each image (with different humans assessing a different sample of the image dataset) or whether multiple humans assessed each image.

In addition to the varying number of humans contributing to the ground truth in model development, there was variation in the specialty and experience of those contributing. Sources described their ground truth human(s) as a volunteer, doctor/physician, sonographer, clinical professional, or (regional) anaesthetist. The level of expertise of those providing the ground truth was described as trained, experienced, expert, professional, specialist, or the level was unstated. However, sources did not typically define what was required to meet the definition of these levels and there is no universally recognised definition of 'expert' in regional anaesthesia.

For some sources, it is not clear how the ground truth for training data was obtained.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^ff62faed]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO final grade for overall quality of evidence — category definitions — uses four levels: A, B, C, and D. Category A states "High quality of evidence. We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". Category B states "Moderate quality of evidence. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". Category C states "Low quality of evidence. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". Category D states "Very low quality of evidence. The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Are the concepts of truth and lying shared across cultures? [^3ad2413a]. The American Psychologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Lies and falsehoods play an important role in our lives, be they lies told in everyday conversation or false information spread on social media websites. But when exactly do people consider a statement to be an instance of lying, or to be false, and do these judgments differ between cultures? In the present article, we shed new light on these questions by examining to what extent implicit content affects judgments of lying and falsity. Three thousand six hundred sixty participants from 10 countries (Chile, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States) were presented with deceptive implicatures-that is, utterances that are literally true but implicitly convey false information-and were then asked whether each speaker lied and whether something true or false was said. Our results show that implicit content plays an important role in people's judgments, leading certain utterances to be judged as lies or false even when they are explicitly true. Most strikingly, the result patterns were highly similar across countries. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).

### Evidence-based practice guidelines for plasma transfusion [^6ce70c60]. Transfusion (2010). Medium credibility.

GRADE methodology — quality-of-evidence assessment separates evidence quality from the strength of recommendations and considers multiple factors that affect quality, including study design, methodologic factors that may decrease quality of evidence, factors that may increase quality of evidence, consistency or inconsistency of results, directness or indirectness, precision or imprecision, and reporting bias; quality represents an estimate of the "correctness" or "truth" of results, while strength of recommendations depends in addition on tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects.

### Placebo: the lie that comes true? [^463ac326]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Over the decades of experimentation on the placebo effect, it has become clear that it is driven largely by expectation, and that strong expectations of efficacy are more likely to give rise to the experience of benefit. No wonder the placebo effect has come to resemble a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, this resemblance is considerably exaggerated. The placebo effect does not work as strongly as it is advertised to do in some efforts to elicit it. Half-truths about the placebo effect are now in circulation, reinforced by a number of other equivocations that it seems to attract. As the deceptive use of placebos has fallen into discredit, the use of half-truths and exaggerations-neither of which is technically a deception-becomes an ever more inviting possibility. However, there are risks and costs associated with the half-truth that the doctor possesses the power to make his or her words come true by the alchemy of the placebo effect.

### Fake news, alternative facts, and things that just are not true: can science survive the post-truth era? [^25eb7e5d]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

"If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?"

Like many Americans, I am increasingly concerned about the growing partisan divide in the United States. What is most troubling is not that we the people hold widely disparate political views in America, for that has gone on since the dawn of the Republic, but rather that as Americans we have lost the ability to discuss our differences in an open, civil, and forthright manner. Worse yet is that we seem to be unable to agree on what we disagree on. In the setting of this political maelstrom, it perhaps comes as no great surprise that the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2016 was post-truth, which is an adjective defined as "relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief". In the world of politics, the term post-truth has come to refer to a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion that are disconnected from the details of policy, and by the adherence to talking points that often ignore the facts. Given that the scientific method consists of a series of experiments and factual observations that lead to the formulation and testing of hypotheses, one might reasonably question whether scientists are also at risk of wandering off into their individual post-truth silos, and if we will also lose our ability to engage in meaningful rigorous scientific debate to advance the field.

### Chapter 9: options for summarizing medical test performance in the absence of a "gold standard" [^4e0871e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The classical paradigm for evaluating test performance compares the results of an index test with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the "truth" adequately well (e.g. is an "imperfect" reference standard), the typical ("naïve") estimates of sensitivity and specificity are biased. One has at least four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is "imperfect": (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the index test's ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i.e., treat the index test as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether the results of the two tests (index and reference) agree or disagree (i.e., treat them as two alternative measurement methods); (c) to calculate "naïve" estimates of the index test's sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the "naïve" estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the index test to account for the imperfect reference standard. We discuss these options and illustrate some of them through examples.

### Big tobacco focuses on the facts to hide the truth: an algorithmic exploration of courtroom tropes and taboos [^72c9e40f]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 6
Weaponising facts versus exposing the truth

By contrast, truth — about the tobacco industry and its conduct — is a crucial weapon in the plaintiffs' rhetorical armamentarium, along with doubt and conspiracy. Their argument is that for decades, the tobacco industry has been engaged in a conspiracy to create doubt and hide the truth: "So when (the smoker) started way back in that other time and place, they were years into conspiracy, hiding addiction, hiding the truth (while offering) false, fraudulent, safe-seeming fixes". The plaintiffs' lawyers claim they do not need to show how the industry's disinformation campaign affected their client in particular: "You do not have to put anything particular directly in the man's hands, because there was nothing personal about the public doubt campaign, there was nothing personal about the Traveling Truth Squad, the College of Tobacco Knowledge, Anne Browder, and all these different folks that went around the country saying that it is an open controversy… meant for the population in whole, of which Mr. Banks was a part".

This radical divergence between general 'truths' and specific 'facts' shows that it is wrong to think of a denialist enterprise like Big Tobacco having some kind of antipathy towards facts. The broader truth is that compartmentalised facts, suitably framed, can be harnessed to serve a vital purpose in the industry's efforts to thwart justice. Cigarette makers are very good at creating macromyths out of microfacts, which also helps explain why they have such an aversion to any mention of the 'truth', both as a concept and a linguistic expression.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1777a63c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) recommendations — rating framework and implications are defined as follows: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Assessment of radiologist performance in the detection of lung nodules: dependence on the definition of "truth" [^a4413ac7]. Academic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Studies that evaluate the lung nodule detection performance of radiologists or computerized methods depend on an initial inventory of the nodules within the thoracic images (the "truth"). The purpose of this study was to analyze (1) variability in the "truth" defined by different combinations of experienced thoracic radiologists and (2) variability in the performance of other experienced thoracic radiologists based on these definitions of "truth" in the context of lung nodule detection in computed tomographic (CT) scans.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-five thoracic CT scans were reviewed by four thoracic radiologists, who independently marked lesions they considered to be nodules ≥ 3 mm in maximum diameter. Panel "truth" sets of nodules were then derived from the nodules marked by different combinations of two and three of these four radiologists. The nodule detection performance of the other radiologists was evaluated based on these panel "truth" sets.

Results

The number of "true" nodules in the different panel "truth" sets ranged from 15 to 89 (mean 49.8 ± 25.6). The mean radiologist nodule detection sensitivities across radiologists and panel "truth" sets for different panel "truth" conditions ranged from 51.0 to 83.2%; mean false-positive rates ranged from 0.33 to 1.39 per case.

Conclusions

Substantial variability exists across radiologists in the task of lung nodule identification in CT scans. The definition of "truth" on which lung nodule detection studies are based must be carefully considered, because even experienced thoracic radiologists may not perform well when measured against the "truth" established by other experienced thoracic radiologists.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of nephrotic syndrome in children [^8a4d13bb]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

KDIGO nomenclature for grading guideline recommendations defines Level 1 and Level 2 with implications for patients, clinicians, and policy, and provides quality-of-evidence definitions for grades A, B, C, and D. For Level 1, patient implication is "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not"; clinician implication is "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action"; and policy implication is "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". For Level 2, patient implication is "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not"; clinician implication is "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences"; and policy implication is "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" is used "to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", with examples including "monitoring intervals, counseling, and referral to other clinical specialists", and such statements are "not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A "High" — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect"; B "Moderate" — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C "Low" — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; and D "Very low" — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Telling truth from lie in individual subjects with fast event-related fMRI [^c4716eba]. Human Brain Mapping (2005). Low credibility.

Deception is a clinically important behavior with poorly understood neurobiological correlates. Published functional MRI (fMRI) data on the brain activity during deception indicates that, on a multisubject group level, lie is distinguished from truth by increased prefrontal and parietal activity. These findings are theoretically important; however, their applied value will be determined by the accuracy of the discrimination between single deceptive and truthful responses in individual subjects. This study presents the first quantitative estimate of the accuracy of fMRI in conjunction with a formal forced-choice paradigm in detecting deception in individual subjects. We used a paradigm balancing the salience of the target cues to elicit deceptive and truthful responses and determined the accuracy of this model in the classification of single lie and truth events. The relative salience of the task cues affected the net activation associated with lie in the superior medial and inferolateral prefrontal cortices. Lie was discriminated from truth on a single-event level with an accuracy of 78%, while the predictive ability expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was 85%. Our findings confirm that fMRI, in conjunction with a carefully controlled query procedure, could be used to detect deception in individual subjects. Salience of the task cues is a potential confounding factor in the fMRI pattern attributed to deception in forced choice deception paradigms.

### Deception and the death of ilyusha: truth and the best interest of a dying child in the brothers karamazov [^52dbe186]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

For centuries, many physicians and parents assumed that it was ethically justifiable to lie to a dying child. The reasoning was clear. Because the lie would likely eliminate or prevent a concrete harm (the child's fear), and the lie is about a harm that is unavoidable anyway, a lie appeared to be the morally desirable thing to do. Today, the ethical consensus has shifted. Many doctors and other health professionals now argue that we have an obligation to tell children the cold, hard truth. In this article, I argue that "the cold, hard truth" (assuming we can know it with certainty) might not always be in the best interest of the patient. To illustrate the point, I analyze an episode in Dostoevsky's novel, The Brothers Karamazov, in which a child is dying, his father lies to him about it, and 2 doctors take very different approaches to the truth. Each of these individuals has a particular interest when it comes to the question of "the truth" about the death of Ilyusha. I use this story to ask whether it is ethically permissible to lie to a dying child and, if so, who has the moral authority to tell that lie.

### Ethical decision-making on communication in palliative cancer care: a personalist approach [^b63c64e9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Perhaps one of the main ethical dilemmas physicians face in cancer medicine is the question of truthfulness with terminally ill cancer patients. Reluctance to share the truth with the patient about his or her diagnosis and/or prognosis is frequently associated with cultural pressures. Based on two cases, the authors illustrate how ethical analysis can help in solving dilemmas related to truth disclosure to terminally ill cancer patients and their families. A personalist approach reveals that the often-adduced conflict between nonmaleficence/beneficence and autonomy with regard to truth telling originates from a narrow understanding of the concept of autonomy. This confrontation is, therefore, more apparent than real. A brief review of the main ethical systems and the results of their application to clinical decision-making follow the discussion of the cases.

### Detecting spontaneous deception in the brain [^17122fc9]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Deception detection can be of great value during the juristic investigation. Although the neural signatures of deception have been widely documented, most prior studies were biased by difficulty levels. That is, deceptive behavior typically required more effort, making deception detection possibly effort detection. Furthermore, no study has examined the generalizability across instructed and spontaneous responses and across participants. To explore these issues, we used a dual-task paradigm, where the difficulty level was balanced between truth-telling and lying, and the instructed and spontaneous truth-telling and lying were collected independently. Using Multivoxel pattern analysis, we were able to decode truth-telling versus lying with a balanced difficulty level. Results showed that the angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and postcentral gyrus could differentiate lying from truth-telling. Critically, linear classifiers trained to distinguish instructed truthful and deceptive responses could correctly differentiate spontaneous truthful and deceptive responses in AG and IFG with above-chance accuracy. In addition, with a leave-one-participant-out analysis, multivoxel neural patterns from AG could classify if the left-out participant was lying or not in a trial. These results indicate the commonality of neural responses subserved instructed and spontaneous deceptive behavior as well as the feasibility of cross-participant deception validation.

### Should non-disclosures be considered as morally equivalent to lies within the doctor-patient relationship? [^6c3a38f7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

While doctor A was honest, doctor B made effective use of euphemism, occupying an ill-defined middle ground through the employment of neither complete honesty nor outright lies. The manipulation of language produced very different perceptions of the same ailment in different patients. Was doctor B's turn of phrase deceptive? Neither doctor actually spoke a falsehood, yet clearly Anderson received a more accurate picture of the 'truth' than Bailey did.

Consider what we mean by 'truth', a concept which Bok distinguishes from 'truthfulness'. Correspondence theory considers the 'truth' to correspond with the actual state of affairs. Some maintain that as this can never really be known, discussions of 'truth' are flawed: 'telling the truth is impossible, there can be no sharp distinction between what is true and what is false'. The concept of 'truthfulness' is perhaps a more meaningful measure by which we might assess our doctors, as it reflects the intentions of the speaker. The 'truthfulness' of a statement is not determined by an objective standard of reality; it is rather determined by whether it coheres to the speaker's own beliefs about what is true and is thus intended to impart accurate information. In the above hypothetical, we must accept that as the recovery from the heart failure is uncertain, the doctor cannot definitely be sure that what he says aligns with reality. We can, however, reasonably expect the doctor's statements to reflect his own beliefs about the outcome: just because the full truth is out of reach, the same cannot be said for truthfulness. If Doctor B intended to mislead with his explanation — even if his motivations were good — he was in a sense not as 'truthful' as doctor A.

### Nudges in a post-truth world [^8f5b09cb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Appeals to the mechanisms that weigh testimony by reference to their source are very plausibly appeals to mechanisms that are partially constitutive of rationality, because we likely have such mechanisms in virtue of the role they played in enabling better decision-making. As we saw above, these mechanisms are sensitive to the previous track record of the source. That is, very obviously, sensitivity to a property that is truth-conducive. We should put less weight on the testimony of those who are frequently wrong than those who have better records. Similarly, sensitivity to the ideological orientation of the source is also truth-conducive. We should be wary of the claims of people who lack benevolence towards us, because they may be motivated to exploit us. We also should put more stock in testimony from agents who have an incentive to reject the claim they affirm. Thresholds for being convinced of a claim are sensitive to the stakes for the person: it takes weaker evidence to convince people of claims they are motivated to accept than claims they are motivated to reject. When someone testifies that a claim is true and we have good reason to think that they are motivated to reject the claim, we should think that the evidence in favour of the claim is especially strong. Sensitivity to these properties is sensitivity to considerations that are relevant to the credence we should place on testimony. Appealing to them is appealing to capacities that have as their proper function the assessment of reasons for belief — a function that is obviously partially constitutive of reasoning — in their role as reasoning mechanisms.

Nudges to reason are therefore appeals to our deliberative capacities. But if appeals to these mechanisms are appeals to our deliberative capacities, we should not think that in so appealing we fail to treat one another as responsible or autonomous agents. Nor should we think that appeals like these limit our substantive freedom; arguably, our freedom consists in the capacity to respond and react to reasons. Appeals to these capacities therefore enable responsible decision-making on the part of the agents whose capacities they are. As far as this set of interlinked considerations (autonomy; responsibility; dignity; freedom) are concerned, there is no reason to worry about nudges to reason. We should think that such nudges are permissible (perhaps we even have an obligation, stemming from the respect we owe to rational agents, to frame our arguments such that are maximally truth-conducive, and therefore to make such appeals).

### SAGES guidelines for the surgical treatment of hiatal hernias [^e0265932]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES guidelines — mesh use in hiatal hernia repair: Tension on the crural repair, the use and need for a relaxing incision, and the tissue quality of the crura were identified as subgroups that warrant additional consideration when deciding whether to use mesh in hiatal hernia repair. After extensive discussion and debate, the guideline panel decided against making a recommendation because the necessary evidence is simply lacking; although the panel considered conditionally recommending against routine mesh use, the confidence intervals for each outcome are wide such that the truth may range from mesh being quite beneficial to quite harmful, and it is possible there are different morbidity profiles with mesh use. Given these uncertainties, the decision for the use of mesh must continue to be a joint decision between surgeon and patient.

### Different attitudes of oncology clinicians toward truth telling of different stages of cancer [^848ded95]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate different attitudes of oncology clinicians toward whether and how to disclose diagnosis to patients with different stages of cancer.

Materials and Methods

A questionnaire investigating physician's demographic information and attitude toward truth telling was delivered to 256 Chinese oncology clinicians.

Results

Two hundred thirty-two (90.6%) physicians completed the questionnaire. Of these oncology clinicians, 87.5% reported that a patient with early-stage cancer should be informed of the diagnosis, while only 40.5% believed that a patient with terminal illness should know the truth (P < 0.001). Physicians who preferred to tell the truth reported that patients with early or terminal stage of cancer should be informed by the doctor-in-charge (81.3 vs 77.7%, respectively; P > 0.05), immediately after the diagnosis (83.7 vs 87.2%, respectively), and in a quiet and undisturbed room (63.5 vs 68.1%, respectively; P > 0.05). In stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses, no demographic information showed association with truth telling of early-stage cancer. Women doctors [odds ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.89; P = 0.004] were more likely than men to want the patient to be informed of the terminal illness. Physicians with cancer relatives (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.97; P = 0.04) were less likely than physicians without cancer relatives to want the patient to be informed of the terminal illness.

Conclusion

Oncology clinicians differed in their attitudes toward truth telling of different stages of cancer. Physicians reported that the doctor-in-charge should be the ones to disclose the condition of the patient, immediately after the diagnosis, and in a quiet and undisturbed room.

### Nudges to reason: not guilty [^31230577]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

I am to grateful to Geoff Keeling for his perceptive responseto my paper. In this brief reply, I will argue that he does not succeed in his goal of showing that nudges to reason do not respect autonomy. At most, he establishes only that such nudges may threaten autonomy when used in certain ways and in certain circumstances. As I will show, this is not a conclusion that should give us grounds for particular concerns about nudges.

Before turning to this issue, let me correct some small issues of interpretation of my paper. Keeling takes me to be committed to three descriptive claims: (1) that we have entered a post-truth era, (2) that our problem with the rational assessment of evidence is explained by or stems from the backfire effect and (3) that nudges to reason work by exploiting affective mechanisms. I am not committed to accepting any of these claims. I am not competent to assess whether we live in an age that is qualitatively different from previous eras, so far as our responsiveness to evidence is concerned. That is a question for historians and political scientists to settle. I am committed to claiming only that the label 'post-truth' identifies a genuine and serious problem, not necessarily a novel phenomenon. I deny that the backfire effect is at the heart of this genuine and serious problem. The backfire effect is not a mechanism: it is rather (at most) the upshot of mechanisms. There is extensive and undisputed evidence for a variety of phenomena (motivated reasoning, the confirmation bias, etc), which together explain resistance to good evidence. The backfire effect is illustrative of the problem not itself the problem. Similarly, my discussion of how affective mechanisms are partially constitutive (rather than independent) of reasoning is intended to be illustrative. It is not intended to suggest that all the non-deliberative or non-conscious ways in which we process information are affective.

### What should we say? [^5319ee25]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract ethics mostly focuses on what we do. One form of action is a speech act. What we say can have profound effects. We can and should choose our words and how we speak wisely. When someone close to us suffers an injury or serious illness, a duty of beneficence requires that we support that person through beneficial words or actions. Though our intentions are most often benign, by what we say we often make the unfortunate person feel worse. Beginning with two personal accounts, this article explains what can go wrong in the compassionate speech of wellwishers, and uncovers some of the reasons why people say things that are hurtful or harmful. Despite a large body of clinical evidence, there is no perfect strategy for comforting a friend or relative who is ill, and sometimes even the best thing to say can still be perceived as insensitive and hurtful. In some cases, we may have good reason to knowingly say a hurtful or insensitive thing. Saying these 'wrong' things can sometimes be the best way to help a person in the long term. To complicate matters, there can be moral reasons for overriding what is good for the patient. What kind of admonishments should we make to a badly behaved patient? What is the value of authenticity in our communication with the people we love? These questions demand an ethical defence of those speech acts which are painful to hear but which need to be said, and of those which go wrong despite the best efforts of the wellwisher. We offer an ethical account, identifying permissible and impermissible justifications for the things we say to a person with a serious injury or illness.

### The 2016 QSM challenge: lessons learned and considerations for a future challenge design [^9dcfde53]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The 4th International Workshop on MRI Phase Contrast and QSM (2016, Graz, Austria) hosted the first QSM Challenge. A single-orientation gradient recalled echo acquisition was provided, along with COSMOS and the χ 33 STI component as ground truths. The submitted solutions differed more than expected depending on the error metric used for optimization and were generally over-regularized. This raised (unanswered) questions about the ground truths and the metrics utilized.

Methods

We investigated the influence of background field remnants by applying additional filters. We also estimated the anisotropic contributions from the STI tensor to the apparent susceptibility to amend the χ 33 ground truth and to investigate the impact on the reconstructions. Lastly, we used forward simulations from the COSMOS reconstruction to investigate the impact noise had on the metric scores.

Results

Reconstructions compared against the amended STI ground truth returned lower errors. We show that the background field remnants had a minor impact in the errors. In the absence of inconsistencies, all metrics converged to the same regularization weights, whereas structural similarity index metric was more insensitive to such inconsistencies.

Conclusion

There was a mismatch between the provided data and the ground truths due to the presence of unaccounted anisotropic susceptibility contributions and noise. Given the lack of reliable ground truths when using in vivo acquisitions, simulations are suggested for future QSM Challenges.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Partnering with parents to disclose Klinefelter syndrome to their child [^95c62f2f]. Acta Paediatrica (2016). Medium credibility.

Child's right to know — ethical framing — states that decisions made by parents should respect the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, yet sometimes these may conflict with autonomy; for example, a child's desire to know the truth regarding his condition may conflict with parents' desire to keep it secret. The page notes that a child's autonomy and right to know should also be taken into consideration, and for children with genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome, discussions about the diagnosis and treatment are recommended as soon as the child is able to understand or discuss the diagnosis.

### How to communicate evidence to patients [^e500b2a1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Understanding the problem

One problem is what do we mean by 'good understanding' of a risk or benefit? Clearly, we do not just mean someone can recall a number — the percentage chance of something happening. Knowledge of a fact is not the same as understanding. We want a patient to imagine the range of things that might happen to them and to understand how likely each is compared with other things that they are familiar with; to slot these new scenarios into their personal framework of 'what might happen in my life' in an appropriate way, allowing them to weigh up evidence and to make a decision that is right for them. What an 'appropriate' way to imagine them is, will depend very much on their individual experiences and perception. That personalised, internalised concept of risk or chance is, then, very hard to define, let alone measure.

A patient's concept of the numbers involved is also only a part of what feeds into their final decision. Their emotions and personal values will all have a huge influence on their risk perception and decision-making, so we cannot assess their understanding of the facts by what decision they make either. Some of these (such as their feelings about a particular outcome) are entirely appropriate factors to weigh in their decision. Others (such as their feelings towards their doctor) we may wish to minimise. There are so many things that can affect a patient's understanding, especially when we are considering a personal interaction, that minimising these unwanted biases is very hard.

This complexity means that it is not easy to create simple guidance on how to communicate evidence clearly to patients.

However, there are some useful findings from research that are worth every healthcare professional knowing.

### The "differential diagnosis" for multiple diseases: comparison with the binary-truth state experiment in two empirical studies [^8a1a645a]. Academic Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In practice readers must often choose between multiple diagnoses. For assessing reader accuracy in these settings. Obuchowski et al have proposed the "differential diagnosis" method, which derives all pairwise estimates of accuracy for the various diagnoses, along with summary measures of accuracy. The current study assessed the correspondence between the differential diagnosis method and conventional binary-truth state experiments.

Materials and Methods

Two empirical studies were conducted at two institutions with different readers and diagnostic tests. Readers used the differential diagnosis format to interpret a set of cases. In subsequent readings they interpreted the cases in binary-truth state experiments. Spearman rank correlation coefficients and the percentages of agreement in scores were computed, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were estimated and compared.

Results

The between-format Spearman rank correlation coefficients were 0.697–0.718 and 0.750–0.780 for the two studies; the between-reader correlations were 0.417 and 0.792, respectively. The percentages of agreement between formats for the two studies were 50.0%-51.7% and 72.9%-78.8%; the percentages of agreement between readers were 45.0% and 80%, respectively. In the first study there were several significant differences in the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves; in the second study these differences were small.

Conclusion

The differences observed between the two formats can be attributed to within-reader variability and inherent differences in the questions posed to readers in the multiple-diagnoses versus binary-truth state reading sessions. The differential diagnosis format is useful for estimating accuracy when there are multiple possible diagnoses.

### When should a new test become the current reference standard? [^f03ed8ea]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of claims that a new diagnostic test is better than the current gold standard test is hindered by the lack of a perfect reference judge. However, this problem may be sidestepped by focusing on the clinical consequences of the decision rather than on estimation of accuracy. Consequences can be assessed by use of a "fair umpire" test that is not perfect yet can discriminate between disease and nondisease cases and is not biased in favor of 1 test. This article discusses 3 principles to aid judgments about the value of new tests. First, the consequences are best examined in cases with disagreement between the current and new tests. Second, resolving these disagreements requires a fair, but not necessarily perfect, umpire test. Finally, umpire tests include consequences, such as prognosis and response to treatment, as well as causal exposures and other test results.

### How to communicate evidence to patients [^f05a805e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, there is no right way to communicate evidence; although there are a few ways that are definitely wrong: those that confuse or push people in one direction or another. If you are preparing information for distribution, then test it with your intended audiences to see what they understand from it, and if you are talking to patients in person, keep asking them what they have understood so far. Moreover, remember: decisions are based on far more than just factual information. If a patient makes a decision that seems to contradict the evidence, it does not mean they have necessarily misunderstood; they could be making the right decision for them, all things considered.

### Comprehensive analysis of synthetic learning applied to neonatal brain MRI segmentation [^a5f98c6b]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.3 Robustness of synthesis‐based approaches relative to the definition of the ground truth

In general, the quantitative evaluation of a supervised segmentation method, such as dataT2 in this work, measures the network's ability to learn the ground truth from the training set (i.e. to learn the mapping between an image and the corresponding label map), regardless of the quality of the ground truth. The high DICE scores observed for dataT2 in Exp. #1 confirms this capacity to learn very accurately the ground truth. Consequently, the predictions are highly dependent on the ground truth, and any systematic bias affecting the ground truth would be learnt by such models. The bias would in turn affect the predictions. This was confirmed by the result of Exp. #3 where the predictions of DataT2 models (GT_drawEM and GT_surf) show the same dice score (0.85) as the ground truth labels.

In contrast, the synthetic approaches do not learn the relationship between real image intensities and segmentation maps. By design, the synthetic framework relies on a generative model to simulate images, which allows to control for the precision of the correspondence between the boundaries of the structures of interest and image intensities in the synthetic training set. When applying the model to real (unseen) data, the location of the boundaries in the predicted segmentation maps are not affected by the same systematic bias that we observed for dataT2. This explains the robustness of the predictions from the SynthMotInh method with respect to variations in the ground truth (see Exp. #3). Synthesis‐based models are thus less biased by the quality of the ground truth than classical supervised models.

4.4 Limitations

The main limitation of this study is the use of pseudo ground truths. The absence of anatomical validation of our ground truths precludes the interpretation in terms of accuracy and limits our conclusions to robustness and consistency aspects. We did not consider manual segmentation as an option because human experts are also subject to various sources of bias that are very difficult to control for. We believe that synthetic learning constitutes a new path to define boundaries between adjacent tissues with better control on the potential sources of bias. Using synthetic learning as means to define the initial segmentation to be manually refined by human experts will pave the way to the design of better ground truth, which is a major bottleneck for quantitative analysis.

### Resolution limit of image analysis algorithms [^d8306aa4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Resolution has been analyzed in microscopy going back to the classical criteria by Rayleigh and Abbe. Those criteria address the performance of the imaging optics. Using an information-theoretic approach, Rayleigh's resolution criterion was generalized and put in the context of modern imaging where data consist of noise-corrupted photon count measurements acquired through quantum-limited detectors. A resolution measure based on the Fourier ring coefficient was introduced that can be computed directly from an acquired image and takes into account the standard deviation with which a single molecule can be localized. Common to these recent approaches is they do not take into account that different object-based image analysis algorithms can have very different algorithmic resolution limits.

The evaluation of algorithms for single-molecule image analysis is complex and a number of approaches have been used in the past, many of those comparing the estimated locations with the ground truth of simulated data. The introduction of the concept of algorithmic resolution in this paper provides an additional tool by determining the minimum distance beyond which the algorithm can reliably distinguish different objects. The analysis presented here also provides important insights into why algorithms perform differently on more classical evaluation approaches (see e.g. Fig. 3a).

### Professional recommendations: disclosing facts and values [^b676eafb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

It is not unusual for patients and their families, when confronted with difficult medical choices, to ask their physicians for advice. This paper outlines the shades of meaning of two questions frequently put to physicians: "What should I do?" and "What would you do?" It is argued that these are not questions about objective matters of fact. Hence, any response to such questions requires an understanding, appreciation, and disclosure of the personal context and values that inform the recommendation. A framework for considering and articulating a response to these questions is suggested, using as a heuristic the phrasing "If I were you… /If it were me… "

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^a81504c3]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Expert testimony at trial — Before providing expert testimony, the medical expert may experience additional scrutiny of qualifications and the bases for expert opinion (ie, voir dire, a Daubert or Frye hearing, or other pretrial motion). During questioning, the expert will be asked about educational background, current practice, board certifications, relevant research or publications, membership and activity in professional societies, and previous court recognitions as an expert. The expert must be stringently honest because credentials will be checked by the "other side", and the expert could be charged with perjury if not truthful under oath. Because expert opinions presumably carry greater weight than lay opinions or fact witnesses, such scrutiny offers the court greater assurance of reliability before the designation of "expert".

### Too much medicine: not enough trust? [^4b36cf48]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Our contention is that trust is a significant factor in influencing these choices, and that understanding the relationship between trust and investigations and treatments will help clinicians and policymakers ensure ethical decisions are more consistently made.

If, in our first case, the patient trusts the doctor, she is likely to be able to reassure him without recourse to the proof of a scan. This reassurance might take the form of explaining her reasoning, including what she believes is the most probable cause for his symptoms, being open about the remaining level of uncertainty and encouraging him to get in touch if his symptoms change — what medics call 'leaving the door open'.

If he does not trust her, or if she doubts that he does, she is more likely to feel compelled to request the CTPA even if she does not think it is truly indicated. Various motivations might underlie such a request in this context: (1) a desire to reassure him that she feels cannot be achieved without further evidence, especially evidence provided by impressive technology; (2) a desire to end the consultation quickly due to time pressures (easier to order a scan than take time explaining to a sceptical patient why one is not needed); (3) a desire to protect against potential litigation; and (4) a desire to create trust in her clinical abilities for future consultations. As the doctor might say: 'I don't think you have a PE, but, to be on the safe side, we'll order a test, and then we'll both know for sure'.
Trust is also important in the opposite direction. If the doctor trusts the patient she will think both that he is accurately reporting his symptoms, and, perhaps more importantly, that if they were to change in a worrying way, he would come back. But if she lacks that confidence, again she is more likely to order tests.

Our aim here is to provide a synthesis of discussions of the nature of trust, drawing on both philosophical and medical literature; to investigate the empirical grounds for thinking that its lack may lead to overinvestigation and overtreatment; and finally to suggest some ways that clinicians and patients can work together to establish well-placed trust in the limited time they have.

### Digital profiling of gene expression from histology images with linearized attention [^80b7c631]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For comparison of the predicted spatial gene expression with the spatial transcriptomics measurement in the ground truth, we resampled the ground truth resolution to match the predicted resolution. Namely, the ground truth resolution was 55 μm per spot, which is higher than the predicted resolution of 256 μm per spot. Hence, we compared each spot in the prediction with the average of the four nearest spots in the ground truth (nearest in terms of smallest Euclidean distance between the x, y coordinates of the spots). We also performed median filtering on the ground truth map to remove noise (window size 3 × 3), and we only considered genes with ≥ 10 unique measured values in the spatial ground truth map (to avoid incorporating noisy measurements). Finally, we converted both the predicted and ground truth values to normalized percentile scores between 0 and 100.

Earth Mover's distance

For a quantitative evaluation of the spatial visualization capabilities of the model, we used the two-dimensional Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) (implemented with the c v 2.000000000000000e+00 E M D function from opencv-python). Intuitively, the metric captures the minimum amount of 'work' required to transform one distribution into the other. Often the two distributions are informally described as different ways of piling up earth/dirt, and the 'work' to transform one distribution into another is defined as the amount of dirt multiplied by the distance (Euclidean distance in our case) over which it is moved. In the context of spatial gene expression maps, EMD considers not only the similarity of values between the ground truth and prediction at individual points but also the spatial arrangement and distribution of those values across the tissue. Hence, this metric takes into account the spatial context to determine how well the prediction map corresponds to the ground truth. In contrast, a pixel-level metrics like PCC/RMSE calculate the difference between the predicted and ground truth values at each pixel independently, without explicitly considering the spatial relationships between pixels.

### Should non-disclosures be considered as morally equivalent to lies within the doctor-patient relationship? [^c693a322]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the past, doctors commonly lied to patients: in 1927, Collins concluded, 'the longer I practice medicine, the more I am convinced that every physician should cultivate lying as a fine art'. Today, we would not accept such levels of deception from our physicians.

There are, however, more ways than one to mislead: careful manipulations of language can mould our perceptions of a situation, and false impressions can be cultivated through calculated silence. Several recent scandals and court cases have emphasised the need for clinicians to work with increased levels of openness: the Francis report concluded with the need for a 'duty of candour' about clinical mistakes. The court of appeal judged that it was against an individual's human rights (article 8) not to be told about a resuscitation decision, and the supreme court held that women have a right to information about 'any material risk'.

Nevertheless, we continue to accept non-disclosure of information that we would be outraged to find a doctor lying about. The puzzling intuition that not telling someone something is somehow more excusable than lying about it — 'a preference for one mode of deception over another' — is rarely subjected to critical scrutiny in the bioethics domain.

Using illustrative hypothetical situations, all based on common clinical practice, we will explore the extent to which we should consider other deceptive practices in medicine to be morally equivalent to lying.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^ed4f4909]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Health care proxy — ethical guidance states that the ethical basis for surrogate decision-making rests on the concepts of substituted judgment and best interest standard, and surrogates make decisions based on the patient's established or probable wishes, even if they conflict with their own personal wishes for the patient. This decision-making is often difficult, particularly in the absence of an advance directive, and providers need to encourage surrogates to make the decisions that the patient would want, reassuring them that they are respecting the patient's autonomy and dignity by carrying out the patient's wishes. In cases where the patient's wishes cannot be ascertained, surrogates are expected to use the best interest standard, which means they choose the option that is best for the patient based on what a "reasonable" person would want.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline rating keys — Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is graded as A, B, C, or D. Level 1 "We recommend" implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 "We suggest" implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty of evidence meanings are: A "High" — "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect"; B "Moderate" — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C "Low" — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; and D "Very low" — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect". Practice points are "consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded", issued "to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendations" or for "good practice statements", and "should not be seen as less important or a downgrade from graded recommendations".

GRADE recommendation strength — "Strong recommendations can be made when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence" that "the net benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the net harms", and "can also be made even if the level of evidence is poor but values and preferences strongly support the action". Strong recommendations mean "there is certainty that the desirable consequences of the intervention exceed the undesirable consequences", that further research is unlikely to change certainty, and that "nearly all patients would desire the intervention when given the choice". In contrast, "weak recommendations are common, reflecting residual uncertainty about the quality of evidence, the ratio of benefits to harms, and/or variation in patient preferences", yet they remain important because "they explicitly acknowledge uncertainty while still providing evidence-based guidance to clinical practice", and help identify gaps and justify some practice variation.

### An alternative point of view: getting by with less: what's wrong with perfection? [^45488bed]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Predictions about the future impact of technologic and process innovations inspire optimistic visions. Optimism and speculation require a counterweight. Because results often do not turn out as expected, anticipating failure is useful, and anticipating unintended consequences is visionary.

Measurements

A history of unfulfilled prognostications was explored with the intent of finding something essential to the complexities of medicine. Do missed predictions signal another side to innovation that also helps us uncover new information about our world?

Main Results

Serendipity is an important theme in medical innovation. There is no reason to think this will change. Things do not necessarily go as planned, but often the results are as important as the original prediction was supposed to be. It will not be clear where we end up until we get there.

Conclusions

Ideal goals are useful but speculative and subjective. There in fact might be several ideals and contingency is important. The detours and incidental stops on the way to an ideal are more fruitful than the goal itself.

In an atmosphere of trust, where the patient understands what is happening, giving discretion in this way does not infringe their autonomy: by removing some of the weight of uncertainty, it can enable it to function more effectively. The doctor can seek to understand the patient's preferences in terms of the level of uncertainty they are comfortable with, as well as the levels of investigations and treatments the patient prefers. It is only in the give and take of questioning — questioning that reveals the concerns of both doctor and patient — that an appropriate balance can be established.

### Florbetaben f 18 (Neuraceq) [^e772615e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Evaluation of AD and Other Causes of Cognitive Decline

The effectiveness of NEURACEQ was evaluated in two single-arm clinical studies (i.e. Studies 1 and 2) in subjects with a range of cognitive function, including some end-of-life subjects who had agreed to participate in a postmortem brain donation program as well as healthy subjects. Subjects underwent a NEURACEQ injection and scan. Images were interpreted using a clinically applicable binary image interpretation method (negative or positive) by independent readers blinded to all clinical information [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Before image interpretation, all readers underwent either in-person or electronic media training on image interpretation.

The truth standard was based on the histopathologic examination using Bielschowsky silver staining (BSS) of six brain regions assessed by a pathology consensus panel blinded to all clinical information (including PET scan results). NEURACEQ results (negative or positive) were pre-specified to correspond with specific histopathology-derived plaque density scores, based upon a modification of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease (CERAD) criteria, which use neuritic plaque counts as a necessary pathological feature of AD (Table 6). For the subject-level truth standard, if any of the six regions were scored as more than sparse, the subject was classified as positive; if none of the regions were assessed as being more than sparse, the subject was classified as negative.

### Iobenguane I-123 (Adreview) [^df3ef506]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1	Pheochromocytoma and Neuroblastoma

The safety and efficacy of AdreView were assessed in an open-label, multicenter, multinational trial of 251 subjects with known or suspected neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma. Diagnostic efficacy for the detection of metabolically active neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma was determined by comparison of focal increased radionuclide uptake on planar scintigraphy at 24 ± 6 hours post-administration of AdreView against the definitive diagnosis (standard of truth). Anterior and posterior planar whole-body images, or alternatively whole-body overlapping spot images, were acquired from the head to below the knees. Additional spot images were performed as deemed appropriate at the discretion of the clinical image reviewer. SPECT imaging of the thorax and abdomen was then obtained when possible.

Of the 251 subjects dosed with AdreView, 100 had known or suspected neuroblastoma and 151 had known or suspected pheochromocytoma. The population included 154 adults and 97 pediatric patients; the majority of adults were female (59%), the majority of pediatric subjects were male (58%). The adult subjects had a mean age of 49 years (range 17 to 88 years). The pediatric patients (56 males and 41 females) consisted of 32 infants (1 month up to 2 years of age), 62 children (2 years up to 12 years) and three adolescents (12 years up to 16 years).

The definitive diagnosis (standard of truth) for the presence or absence of metabolically active pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma was determined by histopathology or, when histopathology was unavailable, a composite of imaging (i.e. CT, MRI, [131I]- m IBG scintigraphy), plasma/urine catecholamine and/or catecholamine metabolite measurements, and clinical follow-up.

A standard of truth was available for 211 subjects (127 with pheochromocytoma, 84 with neuroblastoma) and this group comprised the diagnostic efficacy population. For 93 of these subjects, the standard of truth was based solely upon histopathology. Of 211 subjects in the efficacy population, all had planar scintigraphy and 167 subjects had SPECT in addition to planar imaging. All images were assessed independently by three readers blinded to all clinical data. Table 5 summarizes the AdreView performance characteristics, by reader.

Performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of AdreView planar imaging in patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma were similar to those in patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma. Among the selected patients who also underwent SPECT imaging, similar performance characteristics of AdreView scintigraphy were observed when SPECT plus planar imaging was compared to planar imaging alone.

### A frugal spiking neural network for unsupervised multivariate temporal pattern classification and multichannel spike sorting [^bee7ea6a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Inference and evaluation

To assess the classification performance of the network, we first matched the truth spike trains and the output spike trains to get truth-output pairs. To perform this matching, we convolved all the truth spike trains and output spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (n = 31, σ = 3 time steps) and then computed the cross-correlation between each of the truth spike trains and the output spike trains. In case of spike-sorting data, we performed the matching between the ground truth spike trains and the output neurons' spike trains by maximizing the number of correct hits.

For each pair of truth-output, the f-score was computed as:wherewas the number of spikes of theth truth spike train, was the number of spikes emitted by theth output neuron andwas the number of output spikes coinciding with a truth spike within a coincidence window. The coincidence window was 400 ms for the artificial patterns and vowel data, 2.5 s in the case of the multiunit neural data, and 4 ms in the case of spike-sorting data. These values corresponded to the time needed by a LTS neuron to generate its rebound and cross its threshold. We also computed a global f-score across all truth neurons and all output neurons as:wherewas the total number of truth spikes, was the total number of output spikes andwas the total number of hits. In the case of the vowels, a confusion matrix was also computed to evaluate the classification performance of the model.

When comparing our SNN to other spike-sorting algorithms of the SpikeForest framework, we used the metrics used on the SpikeForest platform.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of LUPUS NEPHRITIS [^90277cd1]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 lupus nephritis guideline — recommendation rating key states that recommendation strength is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2 and the certainty of supporting evidence is graded A, B, C, or D. Level 1 implies for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action" and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 implies for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Certainty grades are defined as A High ("We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect".), B Moderate ("The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), C Low ("The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect".), and D Very low ("The estimate of the effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".). Practice points are described as "consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded" and "should not be seen as less important or a downgrade from graded recommendations".

### One byte at a time: evidencing the quality of clinical service next-generation sequencing for germline and somatic variants [^c1dc2aca]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Concordance analysis

Variant comparison was performed on SNPs and small indels (< 50 bp) submitted by the participant in the intersection of the assessable regions (described above) and the submitted ROI. Before comparison, MNPs were split into SNPs and indels were normalised by left alignment using 'bcftools norm' to ensure that the comparison was correct to their minimal representation. In 2016, variants were compared against the EQA truth set augmented with the participant consensus truth set. Variants were primarily compared against the EQA truth set, but if there was a difference between the EQA truth set and the participant consensus where there was a strong consensus (at least seven7 participants targeting the position, with at least 75% of the variant calls in agreement with each other) the participant consensus was used as the truth. In 2017 only the consensus truth set was used for all concordance analysis. When comparing variants in the germline scheme, it was required that the called genotype matches. When comparing variants in the somatic scheme, it was required that the called alternate allele matches. Each comparison result was assigned to one of four categories:
Agree (TP): The submitted variant was identical to the expected variant in the EQA truth set, or participant consensus truth set.
Disagree (FP, FN): The submitted variant was different to the expected variant in the EQA participant consensus set, or the EQA truth set.
Extra (FP): The submitted variant was in a location where none was expected, neither by the EQA participant consensus set, or the EQA truth set
Missing (FN): No submitted variant was found in a location where one was expected according to the EQA participant consensus set, or the EQA truth set.

Quality metrics analysis

Participant data for each sample were also analysed in the 2016 and 2017 scheme for a number of different quality metrics selected based on the EuroGentest and College of American Pathology (CAP) best practice guidelines. The specific metrics assessed from each file type were: (a) FASTQ: Average base quality (Phred quality score), bases above Q20 and Q30; (b) BAM: Reads uniformity (%), off target (%), error rate on target, coverage at 20× (%) and at 30× and (in 2017 somatic) 500× (%), insert size average and standard deviation (for paired-end data only); (c) VCF: Ti/Tv ratio, quality of calls, SNP and indel counts, Het:Hom ratio for both SNPs and indels.

### Clinical likelihood ratios and balanced accuracy for 44 in silico tools against multiple large-scale functional assays of cancer susceptibility genes [^e32c96b9]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Tool predictions were generated as per resources/versions specified in Supplementary Table 5. These predictions were compared to five gene-specific functional truth sets, the combined functional truth set of 9,436 variants (ALL) and the ClinVar truth set of 333 variants. For each of the 70 tool–threshold combinations, predictions of DEL, TOL, or missing were generated for each of the 9,436 missense variants. Missing predictions resulted in diminution of the total number of predictions where (1) the tool failed to make a prediction for the variant (indeterminate) and (2) the prediction lay in the range between the defined thresholds for TOL or DEL (indeterminate, e.g. score range 0.4–0.7 for Revel_a). Each prediction was assigned true positive (TP) where predicted-DEL and classified DEL in the truth set, true negative (TN) where predicted-TOL and classified TOL in the truth set, false positive (FP) where predicted-DEL and classified TOL in truth set, or false negative (FN) where predicted-TOL and classified DEL in truth set recall (Supplementary Table 6). For each functional truth set, the overall prevalence, detection prevalence, sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (PPV, precision), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Balanced accuracy (BA), which combines sensitivity and specificity, was presented as the primary pan-performance metric. We also calculated the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), which combines TP, TN, FP, and FN, the area under the curve (AUC), and the F1, which combines precision and recall (Supplementary Tables 7, 8). To adjust for differing contribution of the five gene-specific functional truth sets, the mean of the five outputs was also generated.

### Too much medicine: not enough trust? [^7b713d05]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

A trusting relationship between doctor and patient typically involves the granting of discretion in the light of these asymmetries. Our focus is on the discretion granted to the doctor. This may simply involve the discretion to implement a treatment plan that has already agreed on, but it may go further than that. It may include giving the doctor discretion to weigh evidence and to make decisions on the patient's behalf when they are in no position to make them themselves, perhaps when they do not really understand what is at stake. Uncertainty adds further scope for discretion. Diagnoses are rarely certain; treatment outcomes even less so. Some patients are happy to cope with uncertainty, even if presented in the most abstract statistical ways. But for many, uncertainty can be itself unwelcome, something else that they would rather trust the doctor to look after.

So we can see both why trust is desirable in a medical context, and why it might be hard to achieve. In a world of anonymous emergency departments, team practices with multiple handovers and highly mobile patients, trusting relationships are not built as easily as they might be with a traditional family doctor. The very practices of questioning that may be needed to establish whether trust would be well founded may work to undermine it. And the uncertain information that doctors feel able to give may be not what their patients want from a figure they do not yet trust. Small wonder if doctors order tests and offer treatments as a substitute.

We think though that the situation is far from hopeless: there is much that can be done to establish well-founded trust once the problems are properly understood. The very questioning that can seem to be undermining of trust can be channelled to help build it. First though we examine the empirical evidence.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^23df32f6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV adherence — HIV status disclosure: In adolescents living in sub-Saharan Africa, knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was associated with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) (odds ratio [OR] 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–2.94; P = < 0.001) across 12 studies with 4,422 participants, and in South Africa caregivers who had disclosed to the child were truthful and named HIV whereas those who had not disclosed used deception, deflection, and coercion; the decision to disclose HIV status should not necessarily be expected to improve adherence but should be based on a comprehensive assessment, and data from the Democratic Republic of Congo indicate that disclosure by trained peers may lead to improved adherence, as measured by viral suppression, compared to disclosure by parent or health care workers.

### Florbetapir f 18 (Amyvid) [^ce15a649]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 1 evaluated performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) in terminally ill subjects by comparing premortem AMYVID scans to a postmortem truth standard of amyloid beta neuritic plaque density. A total of 59 subjects underwent autopsy after being dosed with AMYVID and imaged. The mean age was 79 years (range 47 to 103 years), half were females, and most were White (93%). A total of 29 subjects had an AD clinical diagnosis, 13 had another type of dementing disorder, 5 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 12 had no cognitive impairment. The time interval between the AMYVID scan and death was less than one year for 46 subjects and between one and two years for 13 subjects. At autopsy, the global brain neuritic plaque density category (CERAD score as in Table 6) was: frequent (n = 30); moderate (n = 9); sparse (n = 5); and none (n = 15).

Study 2 evaluated inter-reader and intra-reader reproducibility of image interpretation using images from 59 subjects with a truth standard (same subjects as in Study 1) and 92 subjects without a truth standard (52 subjects with MCI, 20 subjects with AD, and 20 healthy subjects). Intra-reader reproducibility was assessed with images from 33 subjects (22%). Among the 151 subjects, the mean age was 75 years (range 47 to 103 years), half were females, and most were White (93%).

### Too much medicine: not enough trust? [^4862672a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Towards a solution: continuity and questioning

A first thought is that, if we need to build trusting relationships, and these take time, then continuity of care is essential. It is not good enough to ensure that records are passed on. Trust is built with individuals, and so the same individuals need to be involved with a patient's care.

What though in cases where this is not possible? Here we want to go back to the tension flagged at the beginning between trust and questioning. How deep does that go? There are certainly personal relationships where questioning is inappropriate. Quizzing a partner on everything they have done in an attempt to establish their fidelity is no way to establish trust. But the medical context is different, and seeing why helps us to see how questioning can actually help to establish trust here.

Questioning in a medical relationship is needed. It is needed for the simple transfer of information, from patient to doctor, and from doctor to patient. Asking questions — and receiving answers — diminishes the clinical information imbalance between doctor and patient. Less obviously, it is needed to establish the form of the relationship that both sides are happy with: the amount of information that is wanted, the ways in which it is to be imparted, the degree to which discretion is to be transferred and over which topics.

Some patients are comfortable with uncertainty, and want, as far as possible, to make their own decisions about treatment and any associated risks. But many are not. Consider the questions that are often asked even when the likelihoods and risks have been presented: 'But do you think I need the scan?' 'Should I worry about that?' 'What would you recommend?' 'What would you do if you were in my shoes?' These are not requests for more information about the odds. Instead they indicate a readiness to transfer some discretion to the doctor: perhaps discretion to take decisions, but equally discretion to mark out the live possibilities within which decisions are to be taken. This is not to give the doctor carte blanche. And it is certainly not to ask the doctor to stop monitoring the possibilities. On the contrary: if the doctor advises not having a scan, and that advice is accepted, the expectation is that the doctor will be keeping track of things so that if a scan comes to be indicated it will be ordered.

### Principles and open questions in functional brain network reconstruction [^00fcbd4b]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the extent to which a network representation genuinely documents the way the brain carries out the functions it is supposed to fulfil is ultimately tantamount to determining whether the topological properties are intrinsic or extrinsic, leading to a better understanding of emergence of functional dynamics (Atmanspacher, 2012). To do so, implies steps at various levels.

At a network representation level, this involves constructing a structure which is able to document, and ideally, to generate, these properties. On the one hand, although several aspects of edge (and node) definition are largely independent of the space in which the network is constructed, and much of what has been said here equally applies to structures such as multi‐layer graphs, hypergraphs, or simplices (Battiston et al. 2020), constructs alternative to the standard network structure may modify microscopic network scale properties and introduce new ones. For instance, in a simplex, not only nodes but also edges have non‐trivial degree. Thus, these structures may affect topology, geometry and underlying physics of the reconstructed network. On the other hand, revisiting the basics of functional network reconstruction and its main goal leads to reconsidering the very identity and role of the structure to be used in pursuit of that goal. Can a structure of time dependent, possibly spatially overlapping nodes still be called a network and analysed as such? In the same vein, network neuroscience will likely undergo a trajectory wherein nodes and connections will be thought of in a different way, possibly integrating different known properties of neural activity such as inhibition or complex feedback loops. Their specification will as a consequence change from its current one. While network features have historically been predicated upon dynamical system and information theory, to render representations more context‐independent, network neuroscience will possibly increasingly summon constructs from disciplines such as computational topology (Carlsson, 2009; Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010; Petri et al. 2014; Reimann et al. 2017; Stolz, 2014; Zomorodian, 2005) or statistical physics (Bianconi & Rahmede, 2016), and explanations at various levels (Marr, 1982) and of different types (Illari & Williamson, 2012; Tozzi & Papo, 2020). New constructs may include neurophysiological properties, such as inherent disorder and lack of translational invariance, and may result in representations with non‐trivial emergent geometry (Bianconi & Rahmede, 2017) accounting for phenomenology as yet poorly documented, at least in network terms, for example, topological phase transitions (Santos et al. 2019) or frustration (Gollo & Breakspear, 2014). Ultimately, this may help changing representations of brain function not just by producing constructs more robust to the specification of the space in which they are embedded as well as inter‐subject variability and noise, but also by changing the underlying vision of brain function in the first place.

### Supporting the grieving child and family [^1a6ff5ab]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Children's developmental understanding of death — before the development of object permanence, something out of view is felt to be "out of mind", and it is unlikely that infants in their first 6 months of life can truly grieve; as children develop object permanence during the second half of the first year of life, they begin to appreciate the possibility of true loss. Research identifies 4 concepts that help children make sense of death — irreversibility, finality (nonfunctionality), causality, and universality (inevitability) — and on average most children understand these by 5 to 7 years of age, with personal loss, terminal illness, or education accelerating understanding. Pediatricians can counsel parents to use simple questions to assess comprehension, encourage patience with repetitive questions over an extended period, and address misinformation or misconceptions by asking children what they are thinking about.

### Randomized multi-reader evaluation of automated detection and segmentation of brain tumors in stereotactic radiosurgery with deep neural networks [^04649ef1]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Expert Consensus for Ground-Truth Establishment

Two months after the completion of all contouring sessions, the ground truth of segmentation was established with consensus from the three experts. They had access to the patients' histories and further follow-up imaging studies. The ground truth of contouring was determined slice-by-slice on the simulation MR and CT images. The GTVs for clinical treatment were not disclosed to the ABS system, the expert group, or other participants. Since the experts participated in the ground-truth determination, only the contours from nonexpert readers were compared with the ground truth for further analyses.

Statistical Analysis

Lesion-wise sensitivity was calculated for both contouring modes (detected tumors divided by all tumors contained in the ground truth). A metastasis was considered detected when the contours of the tumor overlapped with the corresponding ground-truth segmentation. The false-positive rate was also reported by the average number of false-positive lesions per patient. The degree of overlap with ground truth was then measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), defined as, where X is the predicted volume and Y is the corresponding ground-truth volume.

We used Wilcoxon paired-signed tests to compare the DSC, sensitivity of lesion detection, and time consumed between two contouring modes. The statistical significance was set at two-tailed P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.1.3 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

### Present self-represented futures of value are a reason for the wrongness of killing [^5ebc5804]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

In Marquis's recent paper he has not satisfactorily shown that killing does not adversely affect the victim's present self-represented desires for their future. Marquis is correct in believing life and death are distinct, but living and dying are not. In fact, to use a well-known saying, "the second we are born we start to die". During the process of dying, whether it be long as in over our lifetime or short as in as we are being killed, there comes a point when the present realistic desires we have we know will never be satisfied. This is why killing can be wrong. This would imply killing an unconscious person, infant, or fetus cannot be wrong. But such killing can be wrong, despite the person killed not experiencing the desire not to be killed as he was dying. Killing can be wrong because others can have a present self-represented desire for that person not to be killed to have been killed. If this line of reasoning is correct, then the "best interests" principle often applied to life and death considerations regarding unconscious persons, infants, and fetuses, is invalid, as such human beings do not have present desires. All that matters is what relevant others rationally desire, after being informed of the facts and the consequences, for that unconscious person, infant or fetus.

Under "Do this", follow "Inform the audience without sensationalizing the suicide and minimize prominence", "Use school/work or family photo; include hotline logo or local crisis phone numbers", and "Carefully investigate the most recent CDC data and use non-sensational words like 'rise' or 'higher'. Additional directives include "Most, but not all, people who die by suicide exhibit warning signs. Include the 'Warning Signs' and 'What to Do' sidebar (from p. 2) in your article if possible", "Report on suicide as a public health issue", "Seek advice from suicide prevention experts", and "Describe as 'died by suicide' or 'completed' or 'killed him/herself'.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^599a56f6]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care best practices — breaking bad news in the emergency department (ED) prioritizes preparation and clarity. When breaking bad news in the ED, the environmental considerations and strategies described in Tables 2 and 3 are important. In anticipation of breaking bad news, the team needs to review all relevant information, including what transpired in the field. Determine who the recipient of the news might be, particularly when identification of the patient is uncertain. It is important to ensure that the recipient is appropriate and any personal health information is consistent with HIPAA privacy requirements. Introduce yourself and identify the roles of your team members, and confirm the relationship to the deceased with all the recipients of bad news. Families are often on edge waiting for bad news, and typically they first want to know if the patient is dead or alive; deliver this news first in about 30 to 60 seconds. Using the "D" word (died, dying) when delivering news of death is important and is a best practice. Allow for silence, and this is not the time to go into details about the medical care, injuries, or anything else. Expressions of empathy (verbal and nonverbal) are welcome, but they need to come naturally. The goal is to deliver the information in a clear and compassionate manner, free of jargon or medical short hand.

### Florbetaben f 18 (Neuraceq) [^42f16bbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 1 evaluated performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) in subjects who died during the study by comparing premortem NEURACEQ PET images to a postmortem truth standard of amyloid beta neuritic plaque density. A total of 205 subjects were dosed with NEURACEQ and imaged. The mean age was 77 years (range 48 to 98 years) and 52% of the subjects were male. By medical history, 137 subjects had AD, 31 had other non-AD dementia, 5 had dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 32 had no clinical evidence of dementia. Among the imaged subjects, 82 subjects died during the study and were included in the primary analysis. The time interval between the NEURACEQ scan and death was less than one year for 45 subjects, between one and two years for 23 subjects, and more than two years for 14 subjects. At autopsy, the subject-level brain amyloid beta neuritic plaque density category was frequent (n = 31), moderate (n = 21), sparse (n = 17), or none (n = 13). Three readers, after undergoing in-person training, interpreted images from the 82 autopsied subjects. Five independent, blinded readers underwent electronic media training and assessed images from the same 82 end-of-life subjects.

Study 2 evaluated inter-reader and intra-reader reproducibility of image interpretation using images from subjects with a truth standard (60 subjects who participated in Study 1) and subjects without a truth standard (50 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 139 subjects with AD, 30 subjects with other non-AD dementias/disease, 5 subjects with Parkinsons disease (PD), and 170 healthy subjects). Intra-reader reproducibility was assessed with images from 46 subjects (10%). Among the 454 subjects, the mean age was 71 years (range 22 to 98 years), 193 were females, and 353 were White. Readers underwent electronic media training.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^b48f3181]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Breaking bad news — key messages for trauma providers emphasize that breaking bad news is a skill that can be learned and improved with training, and to prepare for the conversation with attention to relevant information related to injuries and possible prognosis while ensuring access to a safe, quiet environment without interruption. In the case of sudden traumatic death, provide an opportunity for the family to see the decedent to allow for closure. Trauma providers are often called upon to deliver bad news, including sudden death, catastrophic brain or spinal cord injury, and amputation or other disfiguring injuries, and in the case of sudden, early death, only one occasion may exist to deliver bad news to families. The manner in which bad news is delivered has a significant impact on staff, patients, and families; however, strategies can be learned to minimize the negative impact when used. An essential ingredient of the conversation includes acknowledging and validating emotion and empathic response, and a general communication framework called "Ask-Tell-Ask" is helpful in which the provider asks the individual what he/she knows, tells the bad news with straightforward language, and asks if the information is understood.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^e7ef9102]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).
