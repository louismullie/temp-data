## Question

Can widal test have false positives?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the Widal test can yield false-positive results and, if so, under what mechanisms and with what clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Widal test measures and how it is intended to be used. Then, I should verify the biological and immunological reasons for cross-reactivity that would generate false positives. Next, I will examine epidemiologic and clinical context effects, including vaccination and endemic background titers. After that, I should review documented examples of false positives and misdiagnoses. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline practical clinical implications and confirmatory strategies, anchoring on high-quality sources and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the test principle and intended use. The Widal agglutination test detects serum antibodies against Salmonella Typhi O (somatic) and H (flagellar) antigens, and it was historically designed to demonstrate a fourfold or greater rise in titer between acute and convalescent samples, not to diagnose from a single acute-phase sample, which is a common misuse that inflates false positives [^114eg1k7] [^11343Q6j].

> Wait, let me verify the core immunologic mechanism for false positives. Cross-reactivity arises because antibodies generated against other Enterobacteriaceae and related pathogens share epitopes with S. Typhi surface antigens, so prior or concurrent infections can drive nonspecific agglutinins that the Widal test cannot distinguish from typhoid-specific responses, lowering specificity substantially [^111NTEC9] [^11343Q6j].

> I will now examine concrete examples of cross-reactivity. Hold on, I should verify the most cited misdiagnosis event: in post-earthquake Nepal, widespread Widal positivity led clinicians to treat presumed typhoid with ceftriaxone, but the outbreak was actually scrub typhus; cross-reactive antibodies delayed appropriate doxycycline and worsened outcomes, a clear false-positive cascade with clinical harm [^114gT1hU] [^1142Vjhw]. Let me also consider dengue and malaria, where febrile patients may show nonspecific stimulation of anti-O responses, yielding false-positive Widal results in the absence of S. Typhi infection, especially when single acute titers are used [^116ChK2f] [^114L264Y].

> Next, I should review vaccination and background seroprevalence effects. Prior typhoid vaccination elevates baseline agglutinin titers, and in endemic regions a meaningful fraction of healthy individuals have elevated titers, so a single acute-phase Widal result is inherently nonspecific and prone to false positivity. This is why paired sera and local cutoff knowledge are critical, though often unavailable in practice [^11343Q6j] [^114SxQbi].

> Let me consider the epidemiologic consequences to ensure I'm not overstating individual-level concerns. Studies and reviews note that reliance on Widal serology inflates outbreak counts and disease burden estimates, contributing to apparent "typhoid outbreaks" that may reflect other febrile etiologies; this overestimation has been documented in Africa and Asia and complicates surveillance and public health planning [^114YQxDE] [^114gbuE5].

> I should double-check guideline positions to anchor clinical implications. The IDSA guidance explicitly advises against using serologic tests, including the Widal test, for diagnosing enteric fever due to poor performance characteristics, reinforcing that false positives are a predictable, non-negligible risk when Widal is used as a standalone diagnostic [^117X43qv]. Contemporary multicenter evaluations of typhoid RDTs, including Widal, consistently show low sensitivity and only moderate specificity, underscoring why these tests should not replace blood culture for diagnosis [^1171hAX4] [^1119a821].

> But wait, what if the pretest probability is high and no culture is available — does that change the calculus? Even in high-prevalence settings, the positive predictive value of a moderately specific test like Widal remains limited by cross-reactivity and background titers; thus, a positive Widal should, at most, raise suspicion and prompt confirmatory testing or careful clinical follow-up, rather than serve as a basis for definitive diagnosis or antibiotic stewardship decisions [^11343Q6j] [^112DhK8M].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Yes, the Widal test can and does yield false-positive results, driven by cross-reactive antibodies from other infections, prior vaccination, and endemic background seropositivity. These false positives have led to documented misdiagnoses and inappropriate therapy, and current evidence and guidelines converge on avoiding Widal as a standalone diagnostic for enteric fever [^114gT1hU] [^117X43qv] [^112DhK8M].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical guidance is clear. Clinicians should prioritize blood culture as the reference standard whenever feasible, recognizing its sensitivity limitations and the need for adequate volume and pre-antibiotic sampling. If Widal is used at all, it should be interpreted only in the context of paired acute and convalescent titers with awareness of local cutoff values, and positive results should trigger confirmatory testing or alternative etiologic workup rather than automatic typhoid treatment [^112DhK8M] [^114eg1k7] [^114yfBWu].

The Widal test can yield **false positives** due to cross-reactivity with other infections (e.g. malaria, dengue, brucellosis, rickettsial infections) [^11343Q6j], prior vaccination or infection [^11343Q6j], and nonspecific antibody responses [^111NTEC9]. False positives are more common when using a **single acute-phase sample** [^112DhK8M] or nonstandardized cutoffs [^112QUFkw] and in endemic settings with high background antibody levels [^114SxQbi]. To reduce false positives, interpret results only with paired sera showing a **fourfold rise** [^114eg1k7] and consider clinical context and alternative diagnoses [^112DhK8M].

---

## Mechanisms of false-positive results

Several factors contribute to **false-positive Widal results**:

- **Cross-reactivity**: Antibodies to other infections (e.g. malaria, dengue, brucellosis, rickettsial infections) can cross-react with Salmonella antigens, causing false positives [^114gT1hU] [^11343Q6j].

- **Prior vaccination or infection**: Previous typhoid vaccination or infection can persistently elevate antibody levels, leading to false positives [^11343Q6j].

- **Nonspecific antibody responses**: Chronic illnesses or autoimmune disorders can cause nonspecific antibody production, resulting in false positives [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios leading to false-positive results

Certain clinical scenarios increase the likelihood of **false-positive Widal results**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Malaria co-infection | Malaria can cause nonspecific antibody responses that cross-react with Salmonella antigens, leading to false positives [^11343Q6j] [^114L264Y]. |
| Dengue fever | Dengue infection can stimulate nonspecific antibody production, resulting in false-positive Widal results [^11343Q6j]. |
| Brucellosis | Brucellosis can cause cross-reactive antibodies, leading to false positives [^11343Q6j]. |
| Rickettsial infections | Scrub typhus and other rickettsial infections can cause cross-reactive antibodies, resulting in false positives [^114gT1hU]. |
| Prior typhoid vaccination | Vaccination can elevate antibody levels, causing false positives [^11343Q6j]. |
| Chronic illnesses | Chronic liver disease, autoimmune disorders, and other chronic conditions can cause nonspecific antibody production, leading to false positives [^notfound]. |

---

## Impact of false-positive results on clinical decision-making

False-positive Widal results can lead to **misdiagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic use**, increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance and delaying treatment of the true underlying condition [^1142Vjhw]. They also contribute to overestimation of typhoid incidence, which can skew public health data and resource allocation [^114gbuE5].

---

## Strategies to minimize false-positive results

To minimize **false-positive Widal results**, clinicians should:

- **Use paired sera**: Interpret results only when there is a fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent samples [^114eg1k7].

- **Consider clinical context**: Integrate clinical findings, patient history, and epidemiological data when interpreting results [^112DhK8M].

- **Use confirmatory tests**: Confirm diagnosis with blood culture, the gold standard for typhoid fever diagnosis [^111gPV1R].

- **Be aware of local epidemiology**: Interpret results in the context of local disease prevalence and background antibody levels [^11343Q6j].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

Alternative diagnostic methods with higher specificity include **blood culture** — the gold standard with high specificity but moderate sensitivity [^1125xWDy] — and **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** assays, which are highly specific but not widely available in resource-limited settings [^114TLBA5]. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) such as Typhidot and TUBEX offer moderate accuracy and may be useful adjuncts, but they are not replacements for blood culture [^1119a821].

---

The Widal test can yield **false positives** due to cross-reactivity, prior vaccination or infection, and nonspecific antibody responses. Clinicians should interpret results cautiously, use paired sera, and confirm diagnoses with blood culture or PCR when possible.

## References

### When is measuring sensitivity and specificity sufficient to evaluate a diagnostic test, and when do we need randomized trials? [^112PxYig]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical value of using a new diagnostic test depends on whether it improves patient outcomes beyond the outcomes achieved using an old diagnostic test. When can studies of diagnostic test accuracy provide sufficient information to infer clinical value, and when do clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials? The authors argue that accuracy studies suffice if a new diagnostic test is safer or more specific than, but of similar sensitivity to, an old test. However, if a new test is more sensitive than an old test, it leads to the detection of extra cases of disease. Results from treatment trials that enrolled only patients detected by the old test may not apply to these extra cases. Clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials assessing treatment efficacy in cases detected by the new diagnostic test, unless they can be satisfied that the new test detects the same spectrum and subtype of disease as the old test or that treatment response is similar across the spectrum of disease.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^116s1Hb4]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Of course, other things being equal, we should choose to implement a more sensitive test. However, if a cheap, quick and reasonably specific test could be used in a population that would not otherwise have testing, or as a supplement to other forms of positive case identification (like contact tracing), then it will identify cases that would otherwise have been missed. That is why a specific but insensitive test can be better than no test. Ensuring that individuals who test positive on an LFAT self-isolate can be justified if the test's rate of false positives is sufficiently low. For greater certainty, LFATs could be used to triage individuals who are sent for RT-PCR testing.

One important consideration is whether the mass use of LFATs is the best use of resources. To ascertain this, we would need to know how many additional asymptomatic cases mass LFAT testing could be expected to identify, and the cost. Although LFATs themselves are relatively low cost tests, rolling them out a mass testing programme will require a considerable amount of supplementary resources.

We now turn to consider how the potential costs of an insensitive LFAT test could be mitigated.

Mitigating false reassurance

The most significant moral cost of false-negative results in mass testing is false reassurance, which may lead individuals to unwittingly spread the virus. The extent to which this moral cost will obtain will depend partly on the context in which the test is deployed, the messaging surrounding the test, and how the results are conveyed. As we now explain, this means that there may be measures that could be employed to mitigate this potential cost of the tests, although they may not succeed in fully addressing this cost.

First, testing strategy could move away from the three-pronged (protect, release, enable) SMART approach. A negative result is more likely to lead a recipient to engage in behaviours that will increase transmission, if the result is used to justify releasing individuals from restrictions affecting those who have not been tested (eg, travelling to France, visiting a care home). Therefore, there is a strong argument against using negative results from an insensitive LFAT to justify exemptions from public health restrictions.

### Comparative analyses of eighteen rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR for COVID-19 quarantine and surveillance-based isolation [^111cAiAu]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Using RA tests can mitigate some of the challenges and costs of serial testing with RT-PCR. However, RA tests can increase the chance of producing a false positive. From an operational standpoint, sending numerous or essential employees home could be critically problematic due to false-positive results. Several factors drive the consequences of surveillance frequency in terms of the number of false positives and extent of transmission, including (i) the sensitivity and specificity of the test, (ii) the number of people tested, (iii) the frequency of testing, and (iv) the background prevalence of the disease. For example, in a low-prevalence setting the probability of obtaining at least one false-positive in a cohort increases geometrically with the number of people tested and similarly with the frequency of testing per individual. Less frequent RA tests will reduce the chances of a false-positive during serial testing in a low-prevalence community, but at the cost of an outbreak occurring upon missing an infectious individual (R E > 1). Assiduous follow-up testing of identified potential cases that are isolated should be incorporated — especially in remote offshore settings where false-positive cases may require extensive and costly measures such as evacuation. Given the higher specificity of RT-PCR, using an initial RA test with an RT-PCR follow-up for any positive can substantially reduce the number of RT-PCR tests, especially in a low-prevalence setting. A challenge to follow-up with RT-PCR testing is not just the increased logistical and economic costs: false-negatives can result in reintroduction into the surveilled population and onward transmission. Multiple follow-up tests are likely necessary to investigate conflicting test results. Accordingly, there are tradeoffs between the risks of transmission, number of tests conducted, processing times, and underlying costs from false positives regardless of the test utilized in surveillance. Therefore, policy decision-makers can adapt the testing schemes based on the current status of the epidemic to a level of risk that they find acceptable.

### Enteric fever [^112DhK8M]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Serological tests, including the Widal test and newer rapid diagnostic tests, are not confirmatory in the acute phase of illness. The Widal test measures antibodies against O and H antigens of S Typhi and S Paratyphi A. It is cheap and simple but lacks sensitivity and specificity. A single measurement in the acute phase of the illness may be false negative or false positive. Other commercially available, point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests detect IgM antibodies against S Typhi antigens. These are insufficiently accurate to be useful in diagnosis (see supplementary table 2). In a diagnostic accuracy review, the TUBEX test (14 studies) had an average sensitivity of 78% (95% CI 71% to 85%) and specificity of 87% (82% to 91%). The Typhidot test had an average sensitivity of 66% (59% to 73%) with a specificity of 81% (58% to 93%)across a number of versions. Novel assays to detect antibodies, antigens, and DNA in blood are being developed.

In endemic areas and returning travellers, rule out malaria and dengue fever with testing. Consider other causes of acute fever based on local disease patterns — such as scrub and murine typhus, leptospirosis, brucellosis, influenza, chikungunya, and covid-19 and other viral conditions.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^111pL38E]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is invaluable in the diagnosis of urologic conditions such as calculi, urinary tract infection, and malignancy. It also can alert the physician to the presence of systemic disease affecting the kidneys. Although urinalysis is not recommended as a routine screening tool except in women who may be pregnant, physicians should know how to interpret urinalysis results correctly. This article reviews the correct method for performing urinalysis and the differential diagnosis for several abnormal results. Specimen Collection A midstream clean-catch technique usually is adequate in men and women. Although prior cleansing of the external genitalia often is recommended in women, it has no proven benefit. In fact, a recent study 1 found that contamination rates were similar in specimens obtained with and without prior cleansing.

Urine must be refrigerated if it cannot be examined promptly; delays of more than two hours between collection and examination often cause unreliable results.
2. The reagent on most dipstick tests is sensitive to albumin but may not detect low concentrations of γ-globulins and Bence Jones proteins. Dipstick tests for trace amounts of protein yield positive results at concentrations of 5 to 10 mg per dL — lower than the threshold for clinically significant proteinuria. 6 The nitrite dipstick reagent is sensitive to air exposure, so containers should be closed immediately after removing a strip. After one week of exposure, one third of strips give false-positive results, and after two weeks, three fourths give false-positive results. 36 Non-nitrate–reducing organisms also may cause false-negative results, and patients who consume a low-nitrate diet may have false-negative results.

BACTERIURIA Under high-powered magnification, gram-negative rods, streptococci, and staphylococci can be distinguished by their characteristic appearance. Gram staining can help guide antibiotic therapy, but it is not indicated in routine outpatient practice. Clean-catch specimens from female patients frequently are contaminated by vaginal flora. In these patients, five bacteria per HPF represents roughly 100, 000 colony-forming units per mL, the classic diagnostic criterion for asymptomatic bacteriuria and certainly compatible with a UTI. In symptomatic patients, a colony count as low as 100 CFU per mL suggests UTI, and antibiotics should be considered. The presence of bacteria in a properly collected male urine specimen is suggestive of infection, and a culture should be obtained.

### A systematic review of typhoid fever occurrence in Africa [^114YQxDE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction, Study Variables, and Analytic Approach

Two authors (J.-H. K. and P. P.) reviewed the literature and extracted the data. In particular, the following variables were extracted: year and country of the typhoid occurrence, year of reporting, diagnostic method, and the number of typhoid cases reported. In reports of typhoid cases from observations that span multiple years without further details broken down by year, we assumed that at least 1 episode of typhoid fever case occurred each year.

We defined a typhoid fever occurrence primarily as a report of at least 1 episode of culture-confirmed typhoid fever where Salmonella Typhi was isolated at a given space and time excluding any duplicate reports from the same cohort. Reports of typhoid fever confirmed through serologic tests (e.g. Widal test or ELISA) or PCR, or suspected clinically (e.g. ileal perforation), were also included for secondary analysis. For imported cases, we assumed that the typhoid episode occurred in the country in which the infection was presumed to have been acquired (according to the report). If the imported cases led to local transmission, we assumed that typhoid occurred in both countries. Outbreaks were defined according to the author of the respective study.

Risk of Bias

Difference in language use across Africa may introduce a bias in our study if we limit the source of information to one specific language. We therefore included studies written in French as well as those written in English because French is the predominant language in many West and Central African countries. Use of diagnostic methods with low specificity is another factor that may introduce a bias in our study. Typhoid fever confirmed by clinical diagnosis or Widal tests will likely include false-positive cases. This may lead to an overestimation, and its extent may vary by time and location. To avoid this potential bias, we included typhoid fever confirmed by culturing blood, stool, urine, or bone marrow samples in the primary analysis and included the rest in the secondary analysis for comparison. On the other hand, isolation of Salmonella Typhi from blood, a definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever, is known to have < 60% sensitivity, leading to underestimation.

Antigen testing in patients having symptoms for 5 or fewer days with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is presented as per 1000 patients tested across 5%, 20%, and 50% pre-test probabilities. At 5%, true positives are 45 (42 to 47) and false negatives are 5 (3 to 8). At 20%, true positives are 178 (166 to 188) and false negatives are 22 (14 to 34). At 50%, true positives are 445 (415 to 465) and false negatives are 55 (35 to 85).

### Algorithm in the diagnosis of febrile illness using pathogen-specific rapid diagnostic tests [^116P1NQo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests in clinical practice are often arbitrarily applied in the order of presumed prevalence without considering test accuracy. The Widal test for typhoid is an example of a test that is widely available and often is the first test used in the diagnosis of AUFIs despite its limited accuracy. However, the diagnostic outcome of an algorithm is very sensitive to the accuracies of component diagnostic tests. Correct identification of a component disease in an algorithm depends on the prevalence of the disease in the specific setting, and the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of all prior tests in the algorithm. Our algorithmic approach to optimize the cumulative correct identification of the project AUFIs — taking into account the prevalence of all component diseases and their respective diagnostic test characteristics — predicted better diagnosis.

The large spatial heterogeneity in the etiologies of AUFIs, the effect of seasonality on their epidemiology, and nonuniform access to different RDTs limit the generalizability and global adoption of any algorithm. White et al compared the region-specific treatment algorithms with national empirical treatment protocols for AUFIs in the Lao People's Democratic Republic and reported that a spatially explicit treatment algorithm based on local epidemiology significantly improves treatment outcomes. The epidemiological data on AUFIs at the national and local levels are emerging across the world. The web application allows users to select their scenario using the best available epidemiological evidence and run an informal sensitivity analysis varying scenario parameters in choosing an optimally performing algorithms tailored to their setting. The order of tests in the top-performing algorithms may not have a huge effect on the correct identification of AUFIs, opening up an opportunity to deploy the same algorithm in different settings with similar causes of AUFIs. Ultimately, the decision to choose a particular algorithm among the top-performing ones to be made locally can be subjective taking into disease severity and availability to treatment as well as cost and availability of RDTs.

### Streamlining SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory testing to reduce false positive results [^117VNvys]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Confirmatory testing of SARS-CoV-2 results is essential to reduce false positives, but comes at a cost of significant extra workload for laboratories and increased turnaround time. A balance must be sought. We analysed our confirmatory testing pathway to produce a more refined approach in preparation for rising case numbers.

Methods

Over a 10-week low prevalence period we performed confirmatory testing on all newly positive results. Turnaround time was measured and results were analysed to identify a threshold that could be applied as a cut-off for future confirmatory testing and reduce overall workload for the laboratory.

Results

Between 22/06/20 and 31/08/20 confirmatory testing was performed on 108 newly positive samples, identifying 32 false positive results (30%). Turnaround time doubled, increasing by an extra 17h. There was a highly statistically significant difference between initial Relative Light Unit (RLU) of results that confirmed compared to those that did not, 1176 vs 721 (P < 0.00001). RLU = 1000 was identified as a suitable threshold for confirmatory testing in our laboratory: with RLU ≥ 1000, 55/56 (98%) confirmed as positive, whereas with RLU < 1000 only 12/38 (32%) confirmed.

Conclusions

False positive SARS-CoV-2 tests can be identified by confirmatory testing, yet this may significantly delay results. Establishing a threshold for confirmatory testing streamlines this process to focus only on samples where it is most required. We advise all laboratories to follow a similar process to identify thresholds that trigger confirmatory testing for their own assays, increasing accuracy while maintaining efficiency for when case numbers are high.

### Detection of Salmonella typhi by nested polymerase chain reaction in blood, urine, and stool samples [^115Eqi8m]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was used for the detection of the pathogen in blood, urine, and stool samples from 131 patients with clinical suspicion of typhoid fever. The sensitivity of blood culture, the PCRs with blood, urine, and feces, and the Widal test were 61.8%, 84.5%, 69.3%, 46.9%, and 39.0%, respectively. The sensitivity of the PCRs with blood (P < 0.001) and urine (P = 0.01) were significantly higher, and the sensitivity of the PCR with feces (P > 0.05) was similar to that of blood culture. Combined, the PCRs on urine and feces showed positive results for 16 (70%) of 23 typhoid patients with negative results with blood culture and PCR with blood. These results show that the PCR with blood is a sensitive method for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and that the PCRs with urine and feces could be useful complementary tests.

### Comparison of 4th-generation HIV antigen / antibody combination assay with 3rd-generation HIV antibody assays for the occurrence of false-positive and false-negative results [^116n5T8h]. Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the false-positive and false-negative rates of a 4th-generation human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assay, the Abbott ARCHITECT, vs 2 HIV 3rd-generation assays, the Siemens Centaur and the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros.

Methods

We examined 123 patient specimens. In the first phase of the study, we compared 99 specimens that had a positive screening result via the 3rd-generation Vitros assay (10 positive, 82 negative, and 7 indeterminate via confirmatory immunofluorescent assay [IFA]/Western blot [WB] testing). In the second phase, we assessed 24 HIV-1 RNA-positive (positive result via the nuclear acid amplification test [NAAT] and negative/indeterminate results via the WB test) specimens harboring acute HIV infection.

Results

The 4th-generation ARCHITECT assay yielded fewer false-positive results (n = 2) than the 3rd-generation Centaur (n = 9; p = 0.02) and Vitros (n = 82; P < .001) assays. One confirmed positive case had a false-negative result via the Centaur assay. When specimens from the 24 patients with acute HIV-1 infection were tested, the ARCHITECT assay yielded fewer false-negative results (n = 5) than the Centaur (n = 10) (P = .13) and the other 3rd-generation tests (n = 16) (P = .002).

Conclusions

This study indicates that the 4th-generation ARCHITECT HIV assay yields fewer false-positive and false-negative results than the 3rd-generation HIV assays we tested.

### Spatial and temporal patterns of typhoid and paratyphoid fever outbreaks: a worldwide review, 1990–2018 [^114gbuE5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

A growing and more connected world with increased tourism and travel, further complicated by displacement due to sociopolitical events, can be seen to trigger outbreaks in an endemic area. Genotyping suggests that outbreaks often travel beyond borders and continue as global waves of cases, which is an interconnected outbreak (Table 2). Added complexity regarding diagnosis and tracking of outbreaks occurs as chromosomal rearrangement can occur within chronic carriers, producing genomic diversity.

Several methods have been proposed for public health surveillance that relies on a baseline "normal incidence" within a statistical algorithm. More recently, newer and more sensitive methods have been proposed. The challenge of reliably identifying and tracking outbreaks may be greatly assisted with integration of artificial intelligence to identify statistical irregularity in detected cases especially in endemic areas. As surveillance systems mature globally, the scope to apply these methods can increase, especially as the value of these systems is not mutually exclusive with the value of increasing the surveillance capacity (especially in resource-poor settings). This is further validated by the increasing complexity and capacity of algorithms to incorporate disease trends and behavioral and demographic data.

Another limitation is the difference in outbreak detection and confirmation. Outbreak confirmation biological methods varied from Widal test, blood culture, and stool culture to unknown methods; all existing typhoid diagnostics have substantial limitations in accuracy. The Widal test has been shown to be of low specificity for typhoid fever, particularly in endemic settings, and may overestimate the number of cases in typhoid fever outbreaks. Typhoid fever is often difficult to confirm by culture outside of the time window (within the first 2 weeks) and may result in underestimation. The clinical syndrome of enteric fever is nonspecific and difficult to distinguish from other febrile illnesses, including malaria, viral illnesses, and rickettsia infections; studies have indicated that typhoid is frequently misdiagnosed clinically. An outbreak interpreted as "typhoid outbreak" and reported without laboratory confirmation may or may not be a typhoid outbreak. These challenges highlight the need for standardized reporting of outbreaks to allow consistency of outbreak detection and reporting globally.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a reflex treponemal test on the same serum in patients tested positive on a non-treponemal test used alone for primary screening. Repeat the non-treponemal test quantitatively if a quantitative non-treponemal test was not initially obtained.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^1142Vjhw]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever (typhoid) is an enteric bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi; S. Typhi). It is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases worldwide and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B and C (S. Paratyphi) results in a disease that can have an identical clinical syndrome to typhoid fever, but is often less severe. Typhoid fever is most common in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with children predominantly affected. Like many febrile illnesses, typhoid presents with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially in its early stages. In routine healthcare settings in low/middle-income countries (LMICs), typhoid fever is commonly suspected and treated empirically with antibiotics. This overuse of antibiotics creates a selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that has resulted in the emergence and spread of typhoid strains that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics. Similarly, the low specificity of current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can lead to an over diagnosis of typhoid fever that may result in the overuse of antibiotics and delay the proper treatment for underlying conditions. For example, the use of the Widal test during an outbreak of acute febrile illness in Nepal led to misdiagnosis of typhoid which delayed the appropriate treatment of the causative agent (scrub typhus), resulting in dozens of deaths. The potential harms of current typhoid RDTs are compounded by the fact they are widely available, cheap and easy to use.

### How can the typhoid fever surveillance in Africa and the severe typhoid fever in Africa programs contribute to the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines? [^113wZgqM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The TSAP/SETA programs, and other currently ongoing typhoid fever surveillance programs in Asia, have shown that typhoid fever disease incidence is characterized by major spatiotemporal variation. Assessing the epidemiology of typhoid fever in endemic countries poses an important challenge to national decision makers. Blood culture–based surveillance is not easily implemented in remote settings, as was highlighted in the TSAP and SETA programs. Many countries still use the Widal test, which has poor sensitivity and specificity, and inappropriate use reduces the validity of results even further. This has had the unfortunate consequence that governments do not believe that they have reliable data and are not moved to act.

We have now entered a new era in which TCVs are ready for deployment with Gavi support. Large, ongoing vaccination trials are in place for the assessment of indirect (herd) protection and long-term effectiveness that will determine optimal coverage rates and long-term immunogenicity and effectiveness of TCVs. While newly developed assays, such as the typhoid and paratyphoid test (TPTest) developed at icddr, b in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the polymerase chain reaction–based enrichment assay developed by the Fondation Mérieux in France (unpublished), and other novel tests under development are not yet ready for introduction into the broader clinical setting, blood culture–based diagnostics remain the mainstay in typhoid diagnosis. Highly sensitive, specific, and easy-to-use high-throughput diagnostic tools coupled with environmental surveillance confirming the presence of Salmonella Typhi are not yet available, and it will take time until those are ready for use. In the meantime, laboratories in endemic countries that can conduct blood culture–based diagnostics should be supported and receive training to determine disease incidence and develop country-specific interventions, consequently protecting the populations in endemic countries against this deadly disease.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^114eg1k7]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Serological tests are limited by low antibody titers in the early stage of infection and may produce false-negative results for IgM-based assays depending on the timing of testing. The Widal test is a quantitative agglutination test that identifies serum antibodies against Salmonella antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar. The test is considered positive if a convalescent phase serum sample has a fourfold higher titer than an acute sample. But the Widal test is often applied incorrectly with just a single acute phase sample used for diagnosis and treatment. A Cochrane review of the accuracy of the commercially available antibody-based rapid RDTs showed moderate sensitivity and specificity for the TUBEX colorimetric test that detects anti-O:9 antibody titres (78%, 87%), the Typhidot dot ELISA that measures IgG and IgM antibodies against the outer membrane proteins of S. Typhi (84%, 79%) and the Test-it Typhoid immunochromatographic lateral flow assay that detects IgM antibodies against S. Typhi O antigen (69%, 90%). The TPTest is a newer serological test that detects circulating IgA using ELISA with a sensitivity and specificity of > 95%. But this assay is not commercially available, takes 24–48 hours to produce a result, and requires isolation and culturing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells which is technically challenging, utilising equipment not widely available in resource-limited settings. Due to the limited sensitivity of all current typhoid POC tests they cannot be relied on to guide treatment prescribing.

### Epidemiologic notes and reports false-positive results with the use of Chlamydia tests in the evaluation of suspected sexual abuse – Ohio, 1990… [^1135Lh3v]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

On July 6, to compare the EIA culture confirmation and standard IF culture confirmation methods, duplicate rectal and pharyngeal specimens were obtained from the three residents identified as infected during the week of June 25 and from three residents who had tested negative; these specimens were tested by both the commercial laboratory and the chlamydia laboratory of CDC's Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory Research, Center for Infectious Diseases. IgG antibody to C. pneumoniae, consistent with a past infection, was detected in one resident. Based on the failure to detect C. trachomatis in any specimens by conventional culture techniques, negative PCR results, and the absence of serologic evidence of infection, the investigators concluded that the initial reports of positive chlamydia cultures represented false-positive results.

In this report, the index resident was tested for chlamydia because of suspicion of sexual abuse, and a nonculture chlamydia test performed on a vaginal specimen was positive. However, because the physical findings were not consistent with sexual abuse and serologic evidence of infection was not present, the nonculture results appear to have been false-positive. When used on specimens from sites for which they are not approved, the likelihood of false-positive results is higher. False-positive results have been reported with the use of EIA on vaginal specimens from children and rectal specimens from adults and children and with DIF staining of rectal smears from adults and children. IF staining is the most sensitive detection method available. False-positive results should not occur with IF staining since the chlamydial inclusions have a characteristic morphology and unique staining pattern.

Nonculture tests for chlamydia are not recommended and should not be used in the evaluation of suspected sexual abuse because of the possibility of false-positive results. EIA involves an automated optical density endpoint reading that is proportional to the amount of antigen present. EIA detection has the potential to generate false-positive results because EIA detects solubilized chlamydial antigens that would be derived from the inoculated cell culture, as well as cross-reacting antigens from other organisms present in clinical specimens.

### Typhoid, hepatitis E, or typhoid and hepatitis E: the cause of fulminant hepatic failure – a diagnostic dilemma [^112QnekR]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of hepatitis E-induced fulminant hepatic failure associated with typhoid fever, diagnosed with the Widal test.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Eight-bed medical/surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patient

A 15-yr-old, 50-kg male with grade IV hepatic encephalopathy was admitted to the intensive care unit for ventilatory support. On admission to the intensive care unit he had had fever associated with loss of appetite and nausea for 15 days, jaundice for 4 days, and altered sensorium for 2 days.

Intervention

He was intubated and kept on elective ventilation. Tracheal aspirate, blood, urine, and stool were sterile. Anti-coma measures were instituted in the form of 20 degrees head elevation; mannitol, lactulose, and ampicillin through a nasogastric tube; and bowel wash. The mainstay of fluid therapy was 20% dextrose. Viral marker was positive for hepatitis E. He showed a favorable recovery but continued to have high-grade fever (39–40 degrees C). On investigation, peripheral blood smear was negative for malarial parasite, and Widal was positive. Fever responded to treatment with Ceftazidime.

Result

The patient recovered with anti-coma and anti-typhoid therapy.

Conclusion

In viral hepatitis, fever is usually present in the prodromal phase but subsides before appearance of the icteric phase. In endemic areas, if fever is present in the icteric phase of hepatitis, typhoid also should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever, even in the absence of positive cultures for Salmonella typhi. The Widal test may be helpful in reaching a diagnosis.

Methodological quality of included studies

We have summarized the methodological quality of the 37 included studies in Figure 3. We extracted this data using a modified QUADAS‐2 criteria proforma (Appendix 3) that focused on four domains of methodological quality: patient selection; index test; reference standard; and flow and timing. The domain with the highest level of risk for bias across all studies was that of patient selection (> 50%). We have summarized the risk of bias and the review authors' judgements about the applicability concerns of these domains for each included study in Figure 4.

Risk of bias and applicability concerns summary: review authors' judgements about each domain for each included study.

Only 11 studies recruited unselected febrile patients. Most included studies selected patients on the basis of a clinical suspicion of enteric fever, although the criteria for suspecting enteric fever were usually not stated. Only three studies employed the Grade 1 reference standard, with blood and bone marrow culture (Bhutta 1999; Gasem 2002; Khan 2002). All studied used peripheral blood culture. Three studies also used blood PCR (Siba 2012; Moore 2014; Maude 2015). One study used stool culture, and another used the Widal Test in a composite reference standard (Gopalakrishnan 2002; Pastoor 2008). Only half of the included studies reported that the index test results were interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard results. Patients were recruited prospectively in 26 of the 37 included studies. Index tests were performed retrospectively on stored samples in 18 studies. Twenty‐three studies reported enrolling a consecutive or random group of patients (see the ' Characteristics of included studies ' section). Sixteen studies used a case control design where diagnostic accuracy results can be overestimated, although all these studies reported results separately for control groups from febrile patients. Nineteen studies used cohort (not case control) designs, and in two studies the reporting was unclear.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114DLjHQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM drug testing — responding to test results states that "All physicians (and others involved in drug testing) should determine the questions the test is intended to answer before the testing is administered and should have a plan for what to do with the results"; drug testing should function as a therapeutic tool, so a provider's response to test results should not be confrontational, and providers should be aware that a positive drug test does not diagnose a SUD and a negative test result does not rule out a SUD, while all tests have some false-positive and false-negative outcomes. A false positive occurs when a negative sample is incorrectly labeled as positive, and the use of a detection threshold, or cutoff limit, is meant to reduce false-positive results; providers without formal toxicology training can participate in available courses and/or should collaborate with a medical toxicologist, a toxicologist from the testing laboratory, or a physician certified as an MRO, and providers could consider MRO training and/or certification. A false negative occurs when a positive sample is incorrectly labeled as negative; sometimes this is the result of the use of a cutoff limit, and in this case, a negative result does not exclude the presence of a drug or metabolite, but reflects it was not a sufficient amount to cross the cutoff limit.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — evidence summary for serology and hematology in STEC and HUS: Although not useful in most circumstances, serologic tests can aid in diagnosing an antecedent Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has validated testing available for serogroups O157 and O111 among patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) if a Shiga toxin–producing organism has not been identified by stool culture and Shiga toxin testing; due to poor performance characteristics, serologic tests, such as the Widal test, should not be used for diagnosis of enteric fever. The total white blood cell count and neutrophil count are often increased with invasive bacterial pathogens, and a high total white blood cell count and neutrophil count often occur in patients with STEC O157 infections who subsequently develop HUS. As HUS evolves, patients with a decreasing platelet count trend during days 1–14 of the diarrheal illness are at greater risk of developing HUS; daily monitoring can stop when the platelet count begins to increase or stabilize, and patients with an increasing creatinine level and blood pressure and signs of volume overload should be monitored closely and should receive care in a center that can manage acute renal failure.

Syphilis laboratory testing and point-of-care diagnostics — If a non-treponemal test is used as the screening test, confirmation is needed because false positives occur in many conditions, whereas many laboratories now use a reverse sequence algorithm starting with a specific treponemal test (EIA or CIA) followed by a non-treponemal test such as RPR; both screening algorithms have shown equivalent performance for detection of active infections. Treponema pallidum is not visualized by Gram stain and cannot be cultured in the routine laboratory. One FDA-cleared rapid HIV-Syphilis test is CLIA waved for point-of-care use on fingerstick blood, and globally evaluated POC syphilis tests showed sensitivity (85%) and specificity (98%).

### Serologic evidence of dengue infection before onset of epidemic, Bangladesh [^116ChK2f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The Widal test is an imperfect test for typhoid, though specificity improves somewhat with rising titers. We did not observe such increases in specificity for typhoid, based on the proportion of patients with various Widal titers who had dengue antibodies. Some febrile patients may have had nonspecific stimulation of antibodies to O-antigens of enteric bacterial commensals resulting in false positive Widal tests. However, the possibility of concomitant infection caused by dengue and typhoid cannot be ruled out for some of these patients, given the exceedingly high incidence of typhoid in this region.

A widely held contention is that preexisting antibodies to dengue following previous exposure to the virus may predispose patients to more severe dengue illnesses, such as DHF and dengue shock syndrome because of antibody-dependent enhancement. In Bangladesh, thus far, only dengue serotypes 2 and 3 have been identified. Our findings suggest that, despite recent recognition of dengue illnesses in Bangladesh, previous exposure is not uncommon. We cannot be certain that DHF was also prevalent well before 2000, since comprehensive medical records needed for retrospective case identification are not available. However, if we assume that the antibody-dependent enhancement-risk hypothesis is correct, earlier dengue transmission within Bangladesh may be responsible for DHF cases now being observed and perhaps represents a substantial risk for greater incidence of DHF in the future, if new dengue serotypes are introduced.

### Comparative analysis of commercially available typhoid point-of-care tests: results of a prospective and hybrid retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study in Kenya and Pakistan [^115RAYmh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood and bone marrow cultures are considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of typhoid, but these methods require infrastructure and skilled staff that are not always available in low- and middle-income countries where typhoid is endemic. The objective of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially available Salmonella Typhi rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) using blood culture as a reference standard in a multicenter study. This was a prospective and retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study conducted in two geographically distant areas where typhoid is endemic (Pakistan and Kenya; NCT04801602). Nine RDTs were evaluated, including the Widal test. Point estimates for sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the Wilson method. Latent class analyses were performed using R to address the imperfect gold standard. A total of 531 serum samples were evaluated (264 blood culture positive; 267 blood culture negative). The sensitivity of RDTs varied widely (range, 0 to 78.8%), with the best overall performance shown by Enterocheck WB (72.7% sensitivity, 86.5% specificity). In latent class modeling, CTK IgG was found to have the highest sensitivity (79.1%), while the highest overall accuracy was observed with Enterocheck (73.8% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity). All commercially available Salmonella Typhi RDTs evaluated in the study had sensitivity and specificity values that fell below the required levels to be recommended for an accurate diagnosis. There were minimal differences in RDT performances between regions of endemicity. These findings highlight the clear need for new and more-accurate Salmonella Typhi tests.

### Global action for local impact: the 11th international conference on typhoid and other invasive salmonelloses [^117JcuNn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

NOVEL TOOLS FOR DETECTION OF ENTERIC FEVER

Accurate diagnoses are imperative for ensuring that those who are sick receive timely medical attention and appropriate treatment. However, enteric fever and iNTS disease are notoriously difficult to diagnose, given the challenging nature of salmonellae organisms and associated symptomatic infections, which often resemble other infectious febrile illnesses, such as malaria or dengue. As a result, misdiagnoses and missed cases are commonplace, which could lead to the underestimation of current disease burden estimates for both enteric fever and iNTS disease. The current gold standard diagnostics for enteric fever rely on either blood culture, which is about 50% as sensitive as bone marrow culture, and which is expensive and resource intensive, and thus less than ideal for use in many low-resource, high-burden countries. In these settings, the more common diagnostic tool is the serological Widal test, which — while simple and inexpensive — was developed > 100 years ago and is frequently inaccurate due to cross-reactivity with other infectious agents. Several new diagnostic tools that aim to be cost-effective and rapidly deliver accurate results have been in development for years, and many of the discussions at the conference urged increased investment and a renewed, concerted effort to bring these new tools to market. In this supplement, Darton et al elaborate on this discussion, detailing these new tools and several approaches to utilizing improved diagnostics for enteric fever detection.

In addition to novel diagnostics, another promising tool for enteric fever detection that emerged at the conference was environmental surveillance. Environmental surveillance, which measures the abundance of Salmonella pathogens in the environment, could be an alternative, cost-efficient method to clinical surveillance in low-resource, high-burden settings. This type of surveillance can be helpful in determining transmission pathways and identifying risk factors within populations. In this supplement, Andrews et al review emerging approaches for environmental surveillance and address some of the associated challenges. Methods of environmental surveillance are further explored by Matrajt et al, while Li et al review advancements in developing new rapid monitoring platform technologies for bacterial detection in environmental samples at the point of collection.

### Social and economic burden associated with typhoid fever in kathmandu and surrounding areas: a qualitative study [^113muzLD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and Treatment

As previously noted, respondents were diagnosed using blood culture, which is considered the gold standard and exhibits greater specificity and sensitivity than more readily available serological tests (eg, Widal). The majority of the respondents reported that the physician provided immediate treatment for typhoid fever based on his/her clinical diagnosis while waiting for the blood test results. A few respondents reported their health provider was uncertain or "doubtful" that the patient had typhoid fever.

In our interviews with physicians, they discussed challenges of diagnosis for typhoid fever, options available for uncertain diagnoses, and decisions regarding treatment.

"… whenever we suspect enteric fever, it's completely based on the clinic findings like high grade fever… a patient complaining they have been having the fever for the past 4 or 5 days and they have been taking paracetamol but it's not working… I suspect those cases if [the patient] doesn't have chest involvement or if they don't seem to have urinary tract infection… and it is a high grade fever, I strongly suspect enteric fever". (physician, rural PHC)

"… your experience says it is typhoid, the patient is toxic. Can you leave this patient without giving any medications, any antibiotic? I prefer to prescribe some broad spectrum antibiotic… " (physician, urban hospital)

A majority of respondents living in urban settings had a choice of possible medical facilities and generally few barriers related to distance. Alternatively, some rural respondents did discuss logistical barriers and complicated traveling routes.

"We got help from a friend to go to Panauti. From Panauti, we took a local bus, then we took another bus to Dhulikhel. But while traveling I was so sick my husband called the ambulance and we went to the hospital in an ambulance". (17-year-old female patient)

While services and medications at PHCs are free or only require a small fee, for some households, even a minimum charge is more than they can afford. In addition, nontreatment costs such as travel can be expensive. FCHVs also discussed low literacy combined with poor economic conditions as barriers to seeking healthcare.

### Can we learn from hidden mistakes? Self-fulfilling prophecy and responsible neuroprognostic innovation [^115SHP4r]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Feedback received when positive test results motivate withdrawal of treatment

In cases of self-fulfilling poor prognosis for a patient in coma, the explanation for the feedback's unreliability is that, discriminating between false positives and true positives is practically impossible due to the death of the patient. Thus, except from exploring ways to confirm the prognosis postmortem, it becomes impossible to know whether the prognosis was transformative or merely operative. 5

Compare this to the case of a negative test result, or any other test that does not yield an SFP. If the test result is negative, and the prognosis is good, then life-sustaining treatment will be continued. 6 If the negative result was a true negative, we will observe a good outcome for the patient. In contrast, if the negative result was a false negative, we will observe a poor outcome for the patient. In the case of the false negative, we can catch our error. The observation of an outcome that was contrary to what we predicted constitutes an error signal (table 2). The problem with positive results yielding SFPs is that, with the death of the patient, they eliminate any possibility for an error signal to alert us that the test result was inaccurate. In contrast, negative test results (test results which do not yield SFPs) produce error signals in instances where the test was incorrect.

Table 2
Feedback received when negative test results motivate continuation of treatment

We have just seen that while we can learn from negative test results, it is impossible to learn from positive test results that produce SFPs. Medical practitioners are usually aware of the potential for transformative SFPs. However, the fact that, in cases of transformative SFPs, the outcome would have been different had the prediction not been made is a condition that pollutes the evidential value of all the similar predictions, including the SFPs that were merely operative. We cannot learn from a true positive if we cannot be certain it was not a false positive. Hence, when a patient's case is also a basis of further research, clinicians and researchers must extend their awareness to all SFPs, including those that are merely operative. Failure to do so perpetuates a bias that produces false positives, and thus limits the value — and leads to misrepresentation of the value — of the innovations that are developed from this research.

### How can the typhoid fever surveillance in Africa and the severe typhoid fever in Africa programs contribute to the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines? [^1122fptM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Testing

During TSAP/SETA, blood culture–based diagnosis was established in all sites. This was a Herculean task, as quality typhoid diagnosis did not solely depend on the presence of a well-equipped microbiological laboratory, but also on the availability of skilled phlebotomists and technicians, contextual factors such as steady availability of materials and electricity, and other extraneous conditions relating to obtaining the sample from the patient, often in impoverished settings and with comorbidities. In some sites, the contamination rate was > 10% (Mogeni et al in this supplement), resulting in a loss of data. For decision making on TCV introduction, it is probably not essential to capture every case, but obtaining valid and representative data through blood culture to confirm the presence of typhoid fever is paramount for in-country decision making and for supranational bodies to support any introduction decision. Establishing systematic, national blood culture–based surveillance is not likely possible in the near future for many low- and middle-income countries, and this has important consequences for estimating burden across varying geographies and population structures within each of Africa's many countries.

Other diagnostic tests, such as the Widal test or rapid diagnostic tests, lack adequate sensitivity and more critically, specificity, and are therefore insufficient for assessing the actual incidence of typhoid fever. A recent publication from Ajibola et al summarizes existing diagnostic tests; at this time, blood culture remains the best available tool for diagnosis and surveillance. While there might also be a significant typhoid fever incidence in African settings beyond large settlements, we need to consider alternative methodologies to determine the presence of Salmonella Typhi in the community. Two more scalable options might be using environmental surveillance to detect the presence of S. Typhi in sewage, implying community-level transmission, or serological surveys to determine age-related exposure to typhoid fever. However, such methods are, to date, not readily available and will need to be further developed, optimized, and validated. Without the ability to assess the population in remote settings, we will not be successful in conducting subregional or subnational campaigns directed to areas of high typhoid transmission and disease.

CI, confidence interval (Wilson method); IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; mITT, modified intent-to-test; RDT, rapid diagnostic test. Note that DiaquickIgG/IgM Ab tests are not done in the subjects of retrospective samples.

Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs was broadly similar (differences < 20%) across both regions of endemicity with three exceptions (Table 2): the Typhoid IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette showed a greater sensitivity in Pakistan (IgG component: 58.0% versus 20.3%; [IgM component: 37.6% versus 11.9%]), the Test-it Typhoid IgM test and Typhidot Rapid IgG/IgM test (IgM component) showed a greater sensitivity in Kenya (81.4% versus 58.5 and 93.2% versus 32.7%, respectively; Table 2). Similar to the overall findings, the highest sensitivities were provided by the IgG component of the Typhoid IgG/IgM Combo Rapid Test CE (82.4% in Pakistan) and the Enterocheck WB IgM test (83.1% in Kenya). A comparison of the best-performing RDTs with the Widal test is presented in Fig. 3.

### Assessing the feasibility of typhoid elimination [^112SDNPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of typhoid is not pathognomonic and laboratory tests are essential to accurately establish a typhoid diagnosis. While commonly used, the Widal test and other serologic approaches have unreliable test characteristics that limit their usefulness as surveillance tools. Blood culture has high specificity, but low sensitivity, and requires laboratory facilities and expertise that make it expensive and difficult to scale. Bone marrow culture has higher sensitivity than blood culture, but its cost and invasiveness make it impractical at scale. With that, the limitations of all current typhoid diagnostics present a challenge and no clear solution exists to the need for an accurate and scalable typhoid diagnostic. Despite being a critical component of a disease elimination strategy, the detection of Salmonella Typhi infection in the absence of disease poses even greater challenges. Salmonella Typhi may be shed in the absence of disease, and acute, convalescent, and chronic shedding may follow disease. Like blood culture, stool culture lacks sensitivity for identifying shedding, and although specificity is high, repeat stool culture is likely impractical at scale. We know that Vi serology may be a useful screening test for chronic carriage in low-incidence settings, but the test has performed less well in endemic areas and may be confounded by vaccines that induce an anti-Vi antibody response. Shedding in the absence of disease and chronic carriage represents a potentially large and difficult-to-detect reservoir of bacteria, similar to that of the silent reservoir that confounded historic schistosomiasis elimination efforts.

The final biological and technical question is whether humans are the only reservoir of Salmonella Typhi. The reservoir is defined as the habitat in which the agent normally lives, grows, and multiplies, often referred to as the site of "amplification" of the pathogen. Several lines of evidence are reassuring that humans are the only reservoir of Salmonella Typhi. These include the experience of detailed epidemiologic investigations in Europe, North America, and elsewhere, where human chronic carriers become the residual reservoir of autochthonous Salmonella Typhi transmission as typhoid incidence approaches zero. Furthermore, there are numerous studies documenting the finite environmental survival of Salmonella Typhi outside of the human host in many matrices. However, past elimination and eradication efforts have been thwarted by incorrect assumptions about the pathogen reservoir, notably the unexpected role of symbionts in cholera and dogs in dracunculiasis, so caution is warranted around such assumptions.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^115dGtTp]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV-1 NAT alternative testing pathways outline specific steps and limitations. Use of HIV-1 NAT as the second test instead of an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is specified: If HIV-1 NAT result is negative, perform an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay or other FDA-approved HIV-1 supplemental antibody test, and if result of an HIV-1 supplemental antibody test is nonreactive or indeterminate, perform an HIV-2 antibody test. Another option is use of HIV-1 NAT (or pooled HIV-1 NAT) after a nonreactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassay; a reactive NAT result provides evidence of acute HIV-1 infection, but false-positive results occur, and follow-up testing to document seroconversion should be conducted if a laboratory HIV diagnosis is based on the result of HIV-1 NAT only. Stated limitations include that this alternative fails to distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from established HIV-1 infection, increases turnaround time for test results and incurs additional costs, and that no HIV-1 NAT is FDA-approved for pooled testing for HIV diagnosis and individual or pooled HIV-1 NAT can detect acute infections not detected by a 4th generation immunoassay, but occasionally produces a false-positive result, requires more tests on each specimen, increases turnaround time for test results, and is more costly than the recommended algorithm.

- It also provides information that can be useful for counseling patients who travel to places where these diseases are common. Diagnosis Blood culture is the mainstay of diagnosis. Bone marrow cultures have sensitivity of 80% in some studies and can remain positive despite antibiotic therapy. Stool and urine cultures are positive less frequently. Usually, multiple cultures are needed to identify the pathogen. Serologic tests, such as the Widal test, are not recommended because of the high rate of false positives. CDC offers testing for Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi. CDC accepts specimens for analysis only from state public health laboratories and other federal agencies. Private healthcare providers and institutions must submit specimens to their state public health laboratory for processing.

Prevention The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination for people 2 years and older traveling to areas where the diseases are endemic or an outbreak is occurring. Additional resources Typhoid vaccines are not 100% effective. All travelers should follow recommended food and water precautions to prevent infections during travel. Safe eating and drinking habits also help protect travelers from other illnesses, including travelers' diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis A.
- Travelers should wash hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing food or eating.
- Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Treatment Antibiotic use helps patients recover faster and lowers the risk of complications and death. High rates of antimicrobial resistance can limit treatment options.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing can help guide treatment decisions. While waiting for culture results, obtain a thorough travel history to inform empiric treatment.
- Ceftriaxone resistance is now common among travelers returning from Iraq and Pakistan. It has been observed less frequently in travelers returning from neighboring countries, including India and Afghanistan. For patients who. About 10% of inadequately treated patients experience relapse, with an illness that is often milder than the initial one. Relapse can happen 1–3 weeks after recovery from the initial illness. About 1%–4% of people with typhoid fever become chronic carriers and remain positive for Salmonella Typhi for more than one year.

### Serology of typhoid fever in an area of endemicity and its relevance to diagnosis [^114SxQbi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Currently, the laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever is dependent upon either the isolation of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Typhi from a clinical sample or the detection of raised titers of agglutinating serum antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (O) or flagellum (H) antigens of serotype Typhi (the Widal test). In this study, the serum antibody responses to the LPS and flagellum antigens of serotype Typhi were investigated with individuals from a region of Vietnam in which typhoid is endemic, and their usefulness for the diagnosis of typhoid fever was evaluated. The antibody responses to both antigens were highly variable among individuals infected with serotype Typhi, and elevated antibody titers were also detected in a high proportion of serum samples from healthy subjects from the community. In-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of specific classes of anti-LPS and antiflagellum antibodies were compared with other serologically based tests for the diagnosis of typhoid fever (Widal TO and TH, anti-serotype Typhi immunoglobulin M [IgM] dipstick, and IDeaL TUBEX). At a specificity of ≥ 0.93, the sensitivities of the different tests were 0.75, 0.55, and 0.52 for the anti-LPS IgM, IgG, and IgA ELISAs, respectively; 0.28 for the antiflagellum IgG ELISA; 0.47 and 0.32 for the Widal TO and TH tests, respectively; and 0.77 for the anti-serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay. The specificity of the IDeaL TUBEX was below 0.90 (sensitivity, 0.87; specificity, 0.76). The serological assays based on the detection of IgM antibodies against either serotype Typhi LPS (ELISA) or whole bacteria (dipstick) had a significantly higher sensitivity than the Widal TO test when used with a single acute-phase serum sample (P ≤ 0.007). These tests could be of use for the diagnosis of typhoid fever in patients who have clinical typhoid fever but are culture negative or in regions where bacterial culturing facilities are not available.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^111Lk4WP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Thriemer 2013 described the differences in sensitivity and specificity from one study (Kawano 2007) in three different ways: when indeterminate results were excluded; when indeterminate results were considered negative; and when indeterminate results were included in the denominator. In our Cochrane Review, this is illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6. These demonstrate a roughly 20% decrease in sensitivity when we included indeterminate results in the analysis. It is important to acknowledge variation in the classification of indeterminate results as a limitation in the analysis of results for Typhidot.

Data extraction from certain case control studies, Fadeel 2011, required careful recalculation where different categories of negative patients were described, for example, blood culture negative and Widal Test positive, versus known negatives. Index tests were then tested against different sub‐groups within the cohort. This change in sampling meant that the prevalence of disease changed depending on which subgroup the index test was used in.

This review covers both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, but there were no suitable studies related to paratyphoid alone. Another weakness of this review was the variability in the treatment of paratyphoid cases as part of the diagnostic test accuracy data between studies. In one study, authors excluded cases of blood culture positive Salmonella Paratyphi A (Jesudason 2006). A number of studies classified blood culture positive cases of paratyphoid as true negatives (Gasem 2002; Dutta 2006; Hosamani 2013; Sanjeev 2013). In contrast, paratyphoid fever was classified as a target condition along with typhoid fever in two studies (Dong 2007; Prasad 2015).

Applicability of findings to the review question

A low number of studies have evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of enteric fever RDTs. Furthermore, the number of good quality studies was low. The main issues relating to quality include: utility of a second‐class reference standard; recruitment of clinically suspected enteric fever patients as opposed to unselected febrile patients; poor reporting of whether investigators were blinded to reference test results when interpreting the index tests; and frequent use of a case control design. The sensitivity and specificity of TUBEX, Typhidot and its variants, and Test‐it Typhoid test and its KIT protypes are not robust enough to replace existing diagnostic tools in enteric fever.

### Clinical evaluation of a multiplex PCR for the detection ofSerovars typhi and paratyphi A from blood specimens in a high-endemic setting [^114TLBA5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of self-medication with antimicrobials before consultations, the classic "textbook" presentation of enteric fever with a slow "step-ladder" rise in fever and toxicity is now rarely seen. Consequently, differentiating enteric fever in endemic settings from other undifferentiated febrile illnesses, such as influenza, leptospirosis, dengue, or malaria, is very challenging, particularly in children who may present with atypical signs. The WHO recommends bacterial isolation from blood or bone marrow for definitive diagnosis of enteric fever. However, because of its invasive nature, bone marrow aspirates are rarely collected, although their culture yields good sensitivity (≈90%) and is relatively refractory to prior antibiotic consumption of patients. In current clinical practice in most endemic countries, blood culture and Widal test are the most common diagnostic procedures used despite poor sensitivity and specificity. Indeed, blood culture sensitivity has been estimated at 59% of presumptive cases, ranging from 51% to 65% according to specimen volume, whereas Widal test is hampered by the lack of standardization of reagents and/or misuse and misinterpretation of results. Serological rapid diagnostic tests such as Typhidot-M or Tubex may represent some improvement over the Widal test, but still have suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. Another diagnostic assay that shows promise is the TPTestthat detects the S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A antibody secreted by isolated lymphocytes.

### Can we learn from hidden mistakes? Self-fulfilling prophecy and responsible neuroprognostic innovation [^116d2cXw]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Three ways that the SFP distorts prognostic research

We have shown that, in research, when SFPs occur, we cannot tell the difference between false and true positives. However, we know from cases where life-sustaining treatment was not withdrawn, that false positives do occur, even with the most reliable tests. 8 If there are indeed false positives, they remain hidden after WLST due to the epistemic challenge of SFPs. We now describe three ways in which these hidden errors can persist through various iterations of prognostic innovation.

First, past SFPs hide past false positive results occurring in established testing protocols, thus influencing clinical decision making in the contexts in which novel tests are being evaluated. Cases of this type proceed along the lines of this pattern: A new prognostic test is being evaluated. In the case of postanoxic coma, this may be a combination of continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring with machine learning for data analysis. Unknown to the treating clinician, who is kept blinded from the new test, the new test outputs a prognosis for a particular patient. Yet care for this patient proceeds not according to the deliverances of this novel test, but according to a series of established testing methods, perhaps including a somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) test. If one of the established test results is positive, even if it is a false positive, the ensuing poor prognosis justifies (perhaps even demands) WLST. This constitutes a poor outcome, and this is the very outcome recorded and compared with the prediction derived from the novel test. Hence, any bias towards false positives in the established test is present in the evaluation of the novel test, and is thus propagated to the novel test as it is calibrated.

This problem would be averted only if the established tests were perfectly accurate, or at least perfect in their specificity, never issuing false positives. But this will likely not be the case. One primary motivation for the development of a new test is to improve on the accuracy of the established tests. SSEP tests, for instance, have an estimated false positive rate of 7.7%. 9 Hence, the self-fulfilment of the prognosis obscures the fact that bias towards false positives in the earlier generation of tests informs clinical practice in ways that distort the evaluation of novel tests. To avoid letting new techniques inherit the undiscovered false positives of established techniques, estimates of extant false positive rates (if only statistically determined) must be considered when evaluating the new test.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for syphilis, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend to repeat the non-treponemal test quantitatively (if not initially done) in patients with positive or discrepant results if both a treponemal test and a non-treponemal test are used for primary screening tests, such as enzyme immunoassay/ELISA/chemiluminescence immunoassay/Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test/Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test plus VDRL/RPR.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^113HGmtE]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value

The first dimension of a VDT's accuracy relates to how sensitive it is to the presence of the virus among infected individuals. A VDT is sensitive when it correctly identifies a high proportion of those who are actually infected with the virus. The more sensitive the test, the less likely it is to incorrectly deliver a false-negative result to an individual who is in fact infected.

False-negative results can have significant moral costs. If the VDT is used to confirm a diagnosis, then a false-negative result may contribute to a missed diagnosis and delay in treatment. Furthermore, individuals who believe that they are not infected (on the basis of a negative result) are less likely to engage in behaviours that will reduce viral transmission. If we assume that at least some individuals with false-negative results will be not only infected but also infectious, then low-sensitivity VDTs will likely increase the risk of viral transmission due to the false reassurance they provide.

A second dimension of a VDT's accuracy relates to how specific it is — this dimension assesses the test's true negative rate. A VDT is specific when it only identifies a small proportion of people as being infected when in fact, they are not. The more specific a test is, the less likely it is to deliver such false-positive results.

False-positive results also have moral costs. If the VDT is used to confirm a diagnosis, then a false-positive result may contribute to misdiagnosis. A false-positive result in hospital screening may also lead to the postponement or cancellation of an elective procedure, and at a societal level such results will lead to overestimations of the prevalence of the virus. It may also result in wasteful further investigation or treatment. Finally, given other public health restrictions, a false-positive test may result in individuals having to self-isolate despite not posing a high risk of transmission. VDTs with low specificity may thus lead to the unnecessary infringement of individual liberties.

### Reliable means of diagnosis and serovar determination of blood-borne Salmonella strains: quick PCR amplification of unique genomic loci by novel primer sets [^1119AF57]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Typhoid fever is becoming an ever increasing threat in the developing countries. We have improved considerably upon the existing PCR-based diagnosis method by designing primers against a region that is unique to Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi A, corresponding to the STY0312 gene in S. Typhi and its homolog SPA2476 in S. Paratyphi A. An additional set of primers amplify another region in S. Typhi CT18 and S. Typhi Ty2 corresponding to the region between genes STY0313 to STY0316 but which is absent in S. Paratyphi A. The possibility of a false-negative result arising due to mutation in hypervariable genes has been reduced by targeting a gene unique to typhoidal Salmonella serovars as a diagnostic marker. The amplified region has been tested for genomic stability by amplifying the region from clinical isolates of patients from various geographical locations in India, thereby showing that this region is potentially stable. These set of primers can also differentiate between S. Typhi CT18, S. Typhi Ty2, and S. Paratyphi A, which have stable deletions in this specific locus. The PCR assay designed in this study has a sensitivity of 95% compared to the Widal test which has a sensitivity of only 63%. As observed, in certain cases, the PCR assay was more sensitive than the blood culture test was, as the PCR-based detection could also detect dead bacteria.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^116gx17A]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV testing algorithm — benefits, harms, and turnaround time are summarized as follows: the recommended algorithm is associated with additional health benefits and fewer harms for patients than the previous algorithm and, by reducing the number of false-negative and indeterminate results and misclassified HIV-2 infections, is more accurate; the previous algorithm produces indeterminate results in from 2% to 4.5% of persons with repeatedly reactive 3rd or 4th generation immunoassays, and reducing indeterminate test results reduces delays, anxiety, and the inconvenience and cost of collecting additional specimens for more testing; one program that expedited shipping found the laboratory considered only 1.6% of specimens submitted unsuitable for testing; the recommended algorithm can also reduce turnaround time, with one public health laboratory reporting 96% of antibody-positive test results in 2 workdays or less compared with 22% previously, and another program shortening the interval between specimen collection and routine notification of test results by 1 week; however, turnaround time is longer for specimens that required HIV-1 NAT testing and no studies documented the time necessary to obtain the NAT results.

### Bacteremia among febrile patients attending selected healthcare facilities in ibadan, Nigeria [^114LyJqs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to doubts about the relative contribution of invasive pathogens to febrile disease in our setting, recent studies from elsewhere appear to suggest that these pathogens interact. Malaria may predispose individuals to nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) bacteremia by increasing iron availability to the pathogen (while depriving the host); in contrast, by incapacitating macrophage function, it is possible that bacteremia may also predispose susceptible individuals to malaria. Altogether, the real and presumed high burdens of bacteremia and coinfection with malaria lead to patients in settings like ours receiving both antibacterials and antimalarials when they present with fever. This, in turn, increases the likely selective pressure for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and plasmodia.

Determining the etiology of nonmalarial febrile illness remains challenging in Nigeria, even though malaria can be reliably diagnosed by microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. Other leading causes of fever are not as easy to rule in or rule out due to limited diagnostic infrastructure. The near absence of a decision algorithm following a negative malaria test in most primary and secondary healthcare facilities compromises the potential diagnosis of nonmalarial febrile illness and increases unnecessary antimicrobial use.

Typhoid fever and other bacteremias are best detected in clinical settings by blood culture, but serological alternatives exist as well. The Widal test, for example, commonly used by African diagnosticians, can be performed with little skill and equipment and is cheap. However, although the Widal test can support clinical diagnosis, it is characterized by nonspecificity, poor standardization, typical misuse, and often confusing results. Blood culture services may circumvent many of these limitations but are slow and generally unavailable in low- and middle-income countries. Blood culture is not used routinely in Nigerian hospitals, particularly in outpatients, and is rarely accessible outside tertiary care facilities. Even when blood culture facilities are available, they are often unaffordable for the majority of patients.

The World Health Organization has stressed the need for improved data on invasive Salmonella disease from countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with priority given to strengthening surveillance systems, including the surveillance of disease in children aged < 15 years. This study therefore aimed to profile bacteremia among febrile patients in selected hospitals in Ibadan, southwest Nigeria.

### Comparative analysis of commercially available typhoid point-of-care tests: results of a prospective and hybrid retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study in Kenya and Pakistan [^111pYb4o]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Blood and bone marrow cultures are considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of typhoid, but these methods require infrastructure and skilled staff that are not always available in low- and middle-income countries where typhoid is endemic. The objective of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of nine commercially availablerapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) using blood culture as a reference standard in a multicenter study. This was a prospective and retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study conducted in two geographically distant areas where typhoid is endemic (Pakistan and Kenya; NCT04801602). Nine RDTs were evaluated, including the Widal test. Point estimates for sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the Wilson method. Latent class analyses were performed using R to address the imperfect gold standard. A total of 531 serum samples were evaluated (264 blood culture positive; 267 blood culture negative). The sensitivity of RDTs varied widely (range, 0 to 78.8%), with the best overall performance shown by Enterocheck WB (72.7% sensitivity, 86.5% specificity). In latent class modeling, CTK IgG was found to have the highest sensitivity (79.1%), while the highest overall accuracy was observed with Enterocheck (73.8% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity). All commercially availableRDTs evaluated in the study had sensitivity and specificity values that fell below the required levels to be recommended for an accurate diagnosis. There were minimal differences in RDT performances between regions of endemicity. These findings highlight the clear need for new and more-accuratetests.

Widal test

The Widal test (WT) is a serological test that detects agglutinating antibodies to LPS (O antigen) and flagella (H antigen). The WT is the principal alternative test and is widely used but is neither sensitive nor specific (Olopoenia 2000). In its original format the WT required both acute and convalescent‐phase serum samples taken approximately 10 days apart. The test has also been evaluated as a single, acute‐phase serum sample (Saha 1996). In people with enteric fever, titres often rise before the clinical onset, making it very difficult to demonstrate the diagnostic four‐fold rise between initial and subsequent samples (Gill 2009).

The role of the WT is controversial because the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values vary considerably between geographical areas (Parry 2002). Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of previous history of enteric fever and vaccination. Interpretation of the result is also greatly helped by knowledge of the background levels of antibodies in the local healthy population (House 2001). The increasing use of enteric fever vaccines and the occurrence of infection with other Salmonella enterica serovars lower the specificity of the WT (Waddington 2014). Infection with non‐ Salmonella organisms (for example, malaria, dengue, brucellosis) also leads to cross‐reactivity in the WT in enteric fever‐endemic regions (Olopoenia 2000). There is considerable variation in agglutinin levels among non‐infected populations. These levels are susceptible to change over time and depend on the degree of endemicity (Parry 2002). Despite these shortcomings of both sensitivity and specificity, because the WT is simple and inexpensive, it is still widely used as a diagnostic test (Fadeel 2004).

DISCUSSION

This study evaluated the performance of nine commercially availableRDTs in two geographically distant regions of endemicity using a single, established test as a reference standard (blood culture). In general, the RDTs showed poor sensitivity (0 to 79%) compared to the rigorous standards set by World Health Organization (WHO) for an effective laboratory test for the diagnosis of typhoid. The specificity of the RDTs was higher but still not always > 90%. In particular, the Widal test showed very low sensitivity and specificity (47.7 and 79.4%, respectively) and the SD Bioline S. Typhi IgG/IgM Fast test showed very low sensitivity (21.6% for IgM, 9.1% for IgG) but nearly 100% specificity. For most of the tests, the difference between regions was minimal, with only the IgM component of Typhoid IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (spectrum), the Test-it Typhoid IgM test, and the IgM component of Typhidot Rapid IgG/IgM showing > 20% differences in sensitivity (one greater in Pakistan, later two greater in Kenya). Overall, the best-performing RDT was the Enterocheck WB, with 72.7% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity. While the Typhoid IgG/IgM Combo Rapid Test CE showed a higher sensitivity for IgG, this typically reflects a previous infection, and the sensitivity for acute infection (IgM) was very low.

In general, the findings of this study are supported by those of previous studies. A study in Bangladesh reported similar findings for the SD Bioline S. Typhi IgG/IgM Fast, the Typhoid IgG/IgM Combo Rapid Test CE (IgM component) and Test-it Typhoid IgM. The specificity findings for the Typhidot Rapid IgG/IgM Combo test are also consistent with a recent study conducted in Fiji, as are the Test-it Typhoid IgM findings. The sensitivity and/or specificity results for the TUBEX TF test were consistent with those reported in studies conducted in various regions, including Bangladesh, Southern Vietnam and Papua New Guinea, as well as a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in several countries where typhoid is endemic. Finally, the poor sensitivity and specificity showed by the Widal test in this study is in line with established consensus and the findings from many previous studies.

### A critique of the false-positive report probability [^111PAYxS]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The false positive report probability (FPRP) was proposed as a Bayesian prophylactic against false reports of significant associations. Unfortunately, the derivation of the FPRP is unsound. A heuristic derivation fails to make its point, and a formal derivation reveals a probabilistic misrepresentation of an observation. As a result, the FPRP can yield serious inferential errors. In particular, the FPRP can use an observation that is many times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative to infer that the null hypothesis is far less probable than the alternative. Contrary to its intended purpose, the FPRP can promote false positive results. It should not be used. A modified FPRP is derived, but it appears to have limited application and does not address the problem of false reports of significant associations. The conditional error probability is a possible replacement for the FPRP.

### A guide for diagnostic evaluations [^116Ra24Y]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnostic tests have a key role in patient management and the control of most infectious diseases. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, clinical care is often critically compromised by the lack of regulatory controls on the quality of these tests. The information available on the performance of a diagnostic test can be biased or flawed because of failings in the design of the studies which assessed the performance characteristics of the test. As a result, diagnostic tests are sold and used in much of the developing world without evidence of effectiveness. Misdiagnosis leading to failure to treat a serious infection or wasting expensive treatment on people who are not infected remains a serious obstacle to health.

Microbiological procedures and susceptibility testing.

In Lagos, laboratory diagnosis for suspected typhoid cases were first based on Widal agglutination tests with a cut-off titer of 1:160 for O and H agglutinins. Only Widal-positive blood was considered for blood culture as a practice in public facilities in Lagos, except in cases of complications. The blood cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests in Lagos were determined by the agar diffusion method. To determine antimicrobial susceptibility in Kano and Abuja, the Epsilometer test (EtestbioMérieux) was performed in accordance with standard methodology. The minimum inhibitory concentration results were analyzed using the standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.

Analysis of data: Simple descriptive statistics were used to assess trends. We computed the number of S. Typhi–positive cultures out of the total number of blood cultures performed to yield a percent positivity of typhoid as a subset of tabulated by time to describe the temporal trends of typhoid in the dataset. We chose not to pool data from different sites because we judged that the geographical heterogeneity was of primary interest.

Typhoid Surveillance Programs

Overall, 23 (48%) of 48 countries and areas of SEAR and WPR collected data on typhoid cases. Of these, 22 reported that typhoid was a notifiable disease, and 20 conducted surveillance activities, most through passive reporting at the national level (Table 1). Among the 14 countries that reported the year when surveillance started, almost all had existing systems before 2008. Six countries reported surveillance in selected sentinel sites (Table 1). Overall, 15 countries reported having standard case definitions, which varied widely by country. For example, case definitions included different durations of fever, ranging from "no duration specified" to "fever for at least 1 week". Five of eight countries that provided case definitions included "bradycardia" (reduced heart rate), a relatively nonsensitive and nonspecific sign, for classifying a case as suspected or probable typhoid. Laboratory testing was reported by 19 countries; 17 countries reported conducting laboratory confirmation (blood culture [17 of 19], stool culture [15 of 19]), 10 countries reported use of Widal serologic testing, and one reported use of other rapid tests. Data regarding proficiency testing of the laboratories were unavailable. In India and Bangladesh, blood culture data on typhoid cases were available through invasive bacterial disease surveillance sites for pneumonia and meningitis.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^116WoHz1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

However, sensitivity and specificity are not the only dimensions of test accuracy that might interest us. We might also want to know how likely it is that a given result is a true result rather than a false result; that is, we might want to know the test's predictive value.

Crucially, the predictive value of a test is influenced by the prevalence of the virus within the tested population. Suppose you have a test with 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity. This test is highly accurate. However, suppose you use that test in a population of 100 000 people, of which only 1% have the virus. Ex hypothesi, in your population, you will have 99 000 uninfected people, and 1000 infected people. If the test is 99% sensitive, you can thus expect it to generate 990 true positives and 10 false negatives in the infected members of the group. With 99% specificity, you can expect the test to identify 98 010 true negatives, and 990 false positives in the uninfected members of the group. So even with a test that is 99% specific and sensitive, there will be as many false-positive results as true positives in this population. So while the negative predictive value of test in this example is 99.99%, its positive predictive value in this population is only 50%, due to the low prevalence of the virus within the population. See table 1 for an illustration of these figures.

Table 1
Worked example of a specific and sensitive test with low positive predictive value

The moral costs of false positive and false negative provide the basis for the DHSC's claim that 'an unreliable test is worse than no test'. Ultimately though, the standards of specificity and sensitivity that we require of VDTs is an ethical judgement. We can only assess this by attending to the moral costs of false-positive and false-negative results, and the benefits of identifying true positive and negative results. For new point-of-care VDTs, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency target product profile suggests that the minimum threshold for acceptable test sensitivity is 80% (within 95% CIs of 70%–100%), while the respective threshold for specificity is 95% (within 95% CIs of 90%–100%). By point of contrast, it has been suggested that RT-PCR assays used in the UK have a sensitivity and specificity of over 95% in laboratory conditions.(Notably, analytic performance in laboratory settings can differ significantly from real-world operational performance.)

### Challenges and opportunities for typhoid fever control: a call for coordinated action [^111HHZVa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Serological assays, primarily the Felix–Widal test, which measures agglutinating antibody levels against the O and H antigens, are poorly sensitive or specific, and have been largely dismissed as an effective diagnostic tool. However, they are cheap and still widely used in developing countries despite low utility. Rapid diagnostic tests for the identification of S. Typhi bacteria are desirable and several are available; unfortunately, they are also not sensitive or specific and are therefore not useful for diagnosis and treatment. Polymerase chain reaction–based assays are also increasingly available, yet despite early optimism, have failed to meet the challenges of a rapid, reliable, specific, and sensitive diagnostic and require advanced laboratory equipment and technical expertise, which tend to be available only in central higher-end laboratories. Work is under way to develop improved, simple, robust, and field-usable diagnostics as described by Andrews et al, but challenges still exist in this important area and continue to impede progress in the identification and management of enteric fever.

### Accelerating typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction: what can Be learned from prior new vaccine introduction initiatives? [^11422mx8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED TO TCV

While we have learned a considerable amount from prior successful vaccine introductions, it was equally important to understand typhoid-specific challenges. An influential principle for TyVAC is the recognition, informed by the vaccine introduction projects detailed above, that a WHO recommendation is necessary, but not sufficient, for vaccine introduction at the country level. This principle was a driving factor behind the decision to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials, understanding that without information on the impact of vaccine, rather than just immunogenicity and efficacy in a human challenge model, countries will be reluctant to adopt typhoid vaccines. TyVAC developed a strategy to overcome challenges and information gaps in 3 main areas: (1) health impact and evidence; (2) global policies, finance, and vaccine supply; and (3) local policies, uptake, and sustainability. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to successful introduction.

Health Impact and Evidence

Surveillance and disease burden data are essential to new vaccine introduction. Many countries lack or have limited reliable population-based national burden data that can hamper implementation of preventive measures. For typhoid, assessing the burden of disease at the country level will be particularly challenging due to its unique epidemiologic features. These include its epidemic potential, variability in disease burden and healthcare utilization patterns across settings and over time, and the lack of blood culture availability in many settings.

Disease estimates are often based on a clinical diagnosis of typhoid, which can be confused with other febrile illnesses, and the Widal test, which is simple and inexpensive, but frequently inaccurate due to cross-reactivity with other infectious agents. Global agencies are grappling with these challenges, and have emphasized flexibility in defining burden of disease. New WHO surveillance guidelines provide a number of options for countries that are beginning surveillance. Similarly, the Gavi application guidance for typhoid is broad and includes alternative provisions, such as modeling, for countries who do not have robust data on laboratory-confirmed typhoid illness.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1155oUX4]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the recommended laboratory testing algorithm emphasize that no diagnostic test or algorithm can be completely accurate in all cases of HIV infection; rare instances have been reported of persons who remained persistently negative for antibodies despite detectable HIV RNA; false-positive HIV test results have been attributed to specimen mix-up, mislabeling, and to autoimmune disorders; and inconsistent or conflicting test results should be investigated with follow-up testing on a newly collected specimen. The document adds that a small percentage of specimens produce undifferentiated (dually reactive) results on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay, the frequency in the United States is unknown and follow-up data are limited, and one study reported 5 (0.50%) of 993 specimens with repeatedly reactive immunoassay results were dually reactive with the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay approved by the FDA as of March 2013.

### Comparative analysis of commercially available typhoid point-of-care tests: results of a prospective and hybrid retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study in Kenya and Pakistan [^113FZam6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, all of theRDTs evaluated in this study had sensitivity and specificity values that fell below the required levels to be recommended for an accurate diagnosis. However, the Enterocheck WB and Test-it Typhoid IgM tests performed best and were considerably better than the widely used Widal test, despite not being commonly used in clinical practice. There were minimal differences in RDT performances between regions of endemicity, with only the Typhoid IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette and the Test-it Typhoid IgM test showing > 20% differences in sensitivity.

Overall, the performance of theRDTs in this study highlights the clear need for new developments in the typhoid test landscape, and it is hoped the biorepository of characterized serum samples established at the Aga Khan University central laboratory will help in the development and evaluation of this next generation of tests.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^111NTEC9]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Various aspects of S. Typhi biology make diagnosis by standard laboratory methods challenging. S. Typhi is able to bypass the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier that restricts other enteric bacteria and can evade the typical innate immune responses with limited activation of inflammatory pathways. S. Typhi infection begins with invasion of the mucosa of the terminal ileum, and the organism is thought to only be transiently present in the blood before dissemination throughout the reticuloendothelial system into the bone marrow, liver and spleen. The bacterial load in peripheral blood peaks in the first week of illness, but is still very low with a median of 0.1–1.0 colony-forming units/mL in symptomatic patients. This concentration is difficult to detect by blood culture or PCR, resulting in lower sensitivity for these diagnostic tests. S. Typhi is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, and antibodies that have been produced in response to prior infections with other Enterobacteriaceae tend to cross-react with S. Typhi, due to significant conservation of surface antigens. This cross-reactivity lowers the specificity of antibody-based diagnostic assays that otherwise are well suited for a simple, rapid and inexpensive test format. Compounding the challenge, the muted immune response that occurs through expression of the Vi capsular polysaccharidemay further hinder the utility of serological tests for typhoid diagnosis.

In clinical settings supported by a microbiology laboratory, invasive typhoid infection is confirmed through isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures, but this is relatively expensive, can take > 48 hours, has low sensitivity and requires laboratory infrastructure and trained staff that are not commonly available in LMIC where typhoid is most prevalent. Bone marrow cultures have high sensitivity for detection of S. Typhi but are not routinely used because of the invasive techniques needed to obtain bone marrow aspirates. PCR testing for typhoid is expensive and has a low diagnostic sensitivity when used on peripheral blood samples. Other available point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests include the Widal test, TUBEX, Typhidot, Test-it Typhoidand the Typhoid-Paratyphoid diagnostic assay (TPTest). However, these tests all have significant drawbacks that limit their clinical use.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^115JTEFs]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Analytic framework — CDC writing group members conducted a systematic literature review to compare outcomes of previous and proposed HIV testing algorithm recommendations, and evaluated evidence using criteria adapted to relevant study designs within an analytic framework linking key questions to outcomes related to performance of individual assays and their use in combinations. The evidence synthesis focused on the relative effects of previous and recommended testing algorithms on diagnostic accuracy and yield. Benefits were defined as tests or algorithms classifying specimens as true-positive or true-negative for HIV-1 or HIV-2, and as reduced turnaround time, whereas harms included being classified as false-positive or false-negative, receiving indeterminate or inconclusive results, and delayed diagnosis due to the need for additional specimens or follow-up testing. Services after diagnosis for persons with HIV and for those identified as uninfected would be needed regardless of which testing algorithm is used.

### Multidrug resistant enteric fever in south Asia: unmet medical needs and opportunities [^114gT1hU]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In the absence of reliable and quick diagnostic tests, the Widal test is widely used by clinicians in South Asia to diagnose typhoid. It is a serological test that relies on a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre against the H and O antigens of S Typhi between the acute and convalescent stages of disease to confirm diagnosis and is intended as a tool to increase the index of suspicion for typhoid. Difficulties remain with the test's performance and with interpretation of results, particularly when it is used as a standalone test in the acute stage. Cross reactivity with other infectious agentsmay result in false positive results and lead to overdiagnosis of typhoid fever. A striking example of this was noted in post-earthquake Nepal, where a cross reaction of the test with rickettsia (scrub typhus) infection resulted in misdiagnosis and delay in initiating appropriate treatment. Ceftriaxone was prescribed for typhoid rather than doxycycline, which is the drug of choice for scrub typhus.

### Notes from the field: high prevalence of fentanyl detected… [^1165oCbh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The toxicology screens of many hospitals include tests for common substances of abuse, including amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabis, phencyclidine, and opiates. These tests, often enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, might be limited by cross-reactivity and false-positives and false-negatives, and might only detect a specific set of substances. 1), suggesting that another opioid, not heroin, was the cause. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry can be used to analyze urine specimens and identify a much wider variety of substances to which a person might be exposed. Unfortunately, LC-MS/MS is difficult to implement for point-of-care testing, and it would be cost-prohibitive to test every patient. Since 2016, EDDS has obtained quarterly exports of deidentified encounter data and routine urine drug screen results for patients with an.

On-site fentanyl testing by urine rapid chromatographic immunoassay found that 83% of 76 patients had used fentanyl, whereas only 25% of these patients had positive test results for opiates using the hospital's opiate screen. These findings suggested that fentanyl alone, not in combination with heroin, was being used more frequently and would otherwise be undetected among patients. In late January 2019, MTC and the University of Maryland Medical Center initiated routine fentanyl testing for all patients who undergo urine drug testing using the Vitros 5600 Immunoanalyzer with fentanyl immunoassay reagents. Fentanyl test results were available for 408 of 441 patients with specimens submitted to EDDS by UMMC and MTC for January–December 2019. Seventy-two of the 408 patients had only an ICD-10 T40 encounter code, 236 had one or more of the listed complaint codes, and 100 had both.

The high frequency of fentanyl use found in the population, especially in those patients who tested negative for opiates, demonstrates that regular fentanyl testing addressed a gap in patient care. A hybrid approach of rapid testing for the most common substances combined with limited LC-MS/MS testing to detect emerging substances enabled researchers and hospital systems to respond to the latest trends in substance use affecting patients.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^115mNN5g]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, it might also be possible to communicate test results in a manner that clarifies that positive results are robust in a way that negative results are not. This would help to maintain a degree of uncertainty regarding negative results that would serve as a guard against false reassurance. For instance, positive results could be communicated as definite confirmation of infection, while negative results could be framed as inconclusive.

The problem with all of these strategies is that they are difficult public health messages to communicate effectively, and there is a danger that they may reduce willingness to undergo testing. It is thus not clear that they would be sufficient to ensure that the benefits of the test ultimately outweigh the cost of false reassurance.

However, the Liverpool data suggesting that the LFAT used in the study had a higher sensitivity to higher viral load (in conjunction with other LFAT trials suggesting a similar relationship) suggest an alternative way in which further study could help. The moral cost of false reassurance only obtains if we assume that the individuals who receive a false-negative result are also infectious; so the crucial question here is what proportion of false-negative results are infectious. We currently lack crucial data to answer this question. However, if we were to find stronger evidence of the relationship between higher viral loads and increased infectiousness, 7 this could have two important implications for LFATs that are more sensitive to higher viral loads. First, it would mean that the true positive cases that the tests detect would be in those that are most likely to be infectious. Second, it would mean that many of the the false-negative results would be in individuals who are less infectious. The low sensitivity of a test matters less if false negatives are mostly in individuals who will not go on to transmit the virus.

### Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid fever [^111aUA4N]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever requires isolation and identification of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. In many areas where this disease is endemic, laboratory capability is limited. Recent advances in molecular immunology have led to the identification of sensitive and specific markers for typhoid fever and technology to manufacture practical and inexpensive kits for their rapid detection. We evaluated three commercial kits for serologic diagnosis of typhoid fever. Patients presenting with ≥ 4 days of fever were enrolled at two hospitals in Southern Vietnam. Cases were patients with serotype Typhi isolated from blood samples, and controls were patients with other laboratory-confirmed illnesses. Serotype Typhi isolates were confirmed and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. The Widal test was run at the hospitals and the Pasteur Institute. Sera were shipped frozen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and tested by using Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, TyphiDot, and TUBEX to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG and IgM, and IgM, respectively. Package insert protocol instructions were followed. We enrolled 59 patients and 21 controls. The sensitivity and specificity findings were as follows: 89 and 53% for Multi-Test Dip-S-Ticks, 79 and 89% for TyphiDot, 78 and 89% for TUBEX, and 64 and 76% for Widal testing in hospitals and 61% and 100% for Widal testing at the Pasteur Institute. For all assays, the sensitivity was highest in the second week of illness. The Widal test was insensitive and displayed interoperator variability. Two rapid kits, TyphiDot and TUBEX, demonstrated promising results.

### Factors predicting blood culture positivity in children with enteric fever [^115JH1TA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever was estimated to be 14.3 million cases with 135 900 deaths in 2017. South Asia accounted for approximately 72% of global enteric fever cases, with a substantial burden in India. The pooled incidence of typhoid fever in India was 377 per 100 000 population, with children being at the highest risk. Given the substantial burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of typhoid vaccines in endemic settings.

The introduction of typhoid vaccines in India requires an accurate estimate of enteric fever burden based on blood culture since blood culture is the gold standard diagnostic for typhoid/paratyphoid fever. However, blood culture has a low sensitivity of 40%–60%, requires special equipment and care to prevent contamination, and is not available everywhere. On the other hand, the Widal test, which is widely available at low cost in India, has high false positivity, resulting in overdiagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Thus, in the absence of alternative standardized and validated tests, blood culture remains crucial in the accurate estimation of typhoid disease burden in low- and middle-income settings.

Studies based on blood culture have shown that duration of illness at the time of culture, age of the patient, prior use of antibiotics, and inoculating higher blood volumes in the culture bottle are associated with higher typhoid culture positivity. Prospective population-based surveillance of acute febrile illness additionally allows investigation of clinical and demographic characteristics that affect health care seeking and blood culture testing, as well as blood culture positivity. Identifying the participant-level characteristics associated with culture positivity could potentially allow the comparative application of these findings to those participants who presented with fever in the surveillance but refused a blood culture. This information is crucial in surveillance studies in developing settings to compute an accurate estimate of typhoid disease burden, by factoring in the underestimation, if any, that could have resulted due to the missing blood cultures from those subjects who were otherwise eligible to receive a blood culture for suspected typhoid fever. Furthermore, studying the clinical characteristics that predict blood culture positivity could help clinicians in urban settings to prioritize patients with febrile presentations to receive a blood culture, particularly during the early phase of illness to optimize the yield from blood culture, especially in those settings with limited resources.

### The relationship between blood sample volume and diagnostic sensitivity of blood culture for typhoid and paratyphoid fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113U8TVN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi is the causative agent of typhoid fever, for which there are an estimated 17.8 million cases per year; S enterica serovars Paratyphi A, B, and C cause a clinically indistinguishable syndrome and contribute an additional 4.6 million cases per year. Most of this burden occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the clinical presentation of typhoid fever overlaps with the symptoms of many other diseases, such as malaria and dengue.

For a definitive diagnosis of typhoid or paratyphoid (enteric) fever, the World Health Organization recommends bacterial isolation from blood or bone marrow. Bone marrow culture (the gold standard) is acquired via aspirate of the iliac crest or sternum and has a suggested sensitivity of ~90% after 4 days of culture. However, due to the invasive nature of bone marrow biopsies, the diagnosis of enteric fever in LMICs typically depends on blood culture or the Widal test, an antibody titer test with markedly poor specificity (~77%). Blood culture has been the de facto diagnostic test for population-based incidence studies, vaccine trials, as well as the reference standard for novel diagnostics.

Blood culture diagnostic sensitivity is characterized by heterogeneity, with estimates ranging between 40% and 87%. Some of this variation could be explained by blood sample volume — a relationship that is commonly acknowledged but has never been quantified. Specimen volume varies markedly between studies depending on local regulations and/or the patient's age. Moreover, factors such as patient age (independent of specimen volume), symptom duration, previous antimicrobial use, and laboratory culture conditions (broth and agar used, automated culture systems) are hypothesized to influence blood culture sensitivity.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how patient attributes and specimen volume contribute to heterogeneity in estimates of blood culture sensitivity. We investigated how the relationship between blood volume and culture sensitivity could be impacted by the age of the patient, the duration of disease before specimen collection, and prior antimicrobial use.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^116F556V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating both typhoid (Salmonella Typhi) and paratyphoid (Salmonella Paratyphi A) infection from other causes of fever in endemic areas is a diagnostic challenge. Although commercial point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for enteric fever are available as alternatives to the current reference standard test of blood or bone marrow culture, or to the widely used Widal Test, their diagnostic accuracy is unclear. If accurate, they could potentially replace blood culture as the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended main diagnostic test for enteric fever.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and prototypes for detecting Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi A infection in symptomatic persons living in endemic areas.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, IndMED, African Index Medicus, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 4 March 2016. We manually searched WHO reports, and papers from international conferences on Salmonella infections. We also contacted test manufacturers to identify studies.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of enteric fever RDTs in patients with fever or with symptoms suggestive of enteric fever living in endemic areas. We classified the reference standard used as either Grade 1 (result from a blood culture and a bone marrow culture) or Grade 2 (result from blood culture and blood polymerase chain reaction, or from blood culture alone).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the test result data. We used a modified QUADAS-2 extraction form to assess methodological quality. We performed a meta-analysis when there were sufficient studies for the test and heterogeneity was reasonable.

Main Results

Thirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 5080 participants (range 50 to 1732). Enteric fever prevalence rates in the study populations ranged from 1% to 75% (median prevalence 24%, interquartile range (IQR) 11% to 46%). The included studies evaluated 16 different RDTs, and 16 studies compared two or more different RDTs. Only three studies used the Grade 1 reference standard, and only 11 studies recruited unselected febrile patients. Most included studies were from Asia, with five studies from sub-Saharan Africa. All of the RDTs were designed to detect S. Typhi infection only. Most studies evaluated three RDTs and their variants: TUBEX in 14 studies; Typhidot (Typhidot, Typhidot-M, and TyphiRapid-Tr02) in 22 studies; and the Test-It Typhoid immunochromatographic lateral flow assay, and its earlier prototypes (dipstick, latex agglutination) developed by the Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam (KIT) in nine studies. Meta-analyses showed an average sensitivity of 78% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71% to 85%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI 82% to 91%) for TUBEX; and an average sensitivity of 69% (95% CI 59% to 78%) and specificity of 90% (95% CI 78% to 93%) for all Test-It Typhoid and prototype tests (KIT). Across all forms of the Typhidot test, the average sensitivity was 84% (95% CI 73% to 91%) and specificity was 79% (95% CI 70% to 87%). When we based the analysis on the 13 studies of the Typhidot test that either reported indeterminate test results or where the test format means there are no indeterminate results, the average sensitivity was 78% (95% CI 65% to 87%) and specificity was 77% (95% CI 66% to 86%). We did not identify any difference in either sensitivity or specificity between TUBEX, Typhidot, and Test-it Typhoid tests when based on comparison to the 13 Typhidot studies where indeterminate results are either reported or not applicable. If TUBEX and Test-it Typhoid are compared to all Typhidot studies, the sensitivity of Typhidot was higher than Test-it Typhoid (15% (95% CI 2% to 28%), but other comparisons did not show a difference at the 95% level of CIs. In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients presenting with fever where 30% (300 patients) have enteric fever, on average Typhidot tests reporting indeterminate results or where tests do not produce indeterminate results will miss the diagnosis in 66 patients with enteric fever, TUBEX will miss 66, and Test-It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests will miss 93. In the 700 people without enteric fever, the number of people incorrectly diagnosed with enteric fever would be 161 with Typhidot tests, 91 with TUBEX, and 70 with Test-It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests. The CIs around these estimates were wide, with no difference in false positive results shown between tests. The quality of the data for each study was evaluated using a standardized checklist called QUADAS-2. Overall, the certainty of the evidence in the studies that evaluated enteric fever RDTs was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In 37 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for enteric fever, few studies were at a low risk of bias. The three main RDT tests and variants had moderate diagnostic accuracy. There was no evidence of a difference between the average sensitivity and specificity of the three main RDT tests. More robust evaluations of alternative RDTs for enteric fever are needed.

### Blood culture-PCR to optimise typhoid fever diagnosis after controlled human infection identifies frequent asymptomatic cases and evidence of primary bacteraemia [^111jxvaE]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever, a non-specific febrile illness caused by infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is common in tropical regions. A key limitation to improving the control of typhoid fever is the lack of reliable diagnostic tests. In addition to confirming infection in individuals, accurate laboratory diagnostics are needed to ascertain true disease burden, to improve understanding of the natural history of infection in humans, and to evaluate vaccine efficacy.

Diagnostic approaches for typhoid infection are broadly aimed either at directly detecting bacteria or bacterial products or measuring the host response in clinical samples. Blood culture remains the diagnostic technique of choice, but only identifies 45–70% of confirmed cases, even with the availability of newer continuous automated culture systems. Serological tests including the Widal test are widely available in endemic settings, although in the absence of paired clinical samples or background population serosurveillance data these tests perform poorly with low sensitivity and specificity.

Given the poor accuracy of currently available diagnostic tests, attempts have been made to develop PCR-based assays to detect bacterial DNA. Few, if any, of these approaches have been instituted in clinical settings mainly due to the difficulty of validating tests when using 'real-life' specimens, in which only few, mostly intracellular bacteria (median, 0.5 CFU/mL blood) are present. One method to increase the sensitivity of S. Typhi detection from blood is to use ox-bile as a selective culture media. Ox-bile reduces both coagulation and serum complement killing activity and causes the selective lysis of human rather than Salmonella cells. Recently, we developed a culture-PCR assay incorporating a brief pre-incubation in ox-bile along with PCR amplification of the S. Typhi flagellin gene, fliC. Here, we have evaluated this culture-PCR assay as a diagnostic for detecting S. Typhi in the blood of healthy adult volunteers developing typhoid while participating in a human challenge model.

### COVID-19 testing [^1152aBCb]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To illustrate how patient risk and clinical costs are driven by false-positive and false-negative results.

Methods

Molecular, antigen, and antibody testing are the mainstay to identify infected patients and fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To evaluate the test methods, sensitivity (percent positive agreement [PPA]) and specificity (percent negative agreement [PNA]) are the most common metrics utilized, followed by the positive and negative predictive value-the probability that a positive or negative test result represents a true positive or negative patient. The number, probability, and cost of false results are driven by combinations of prevalence, PPA, and PNA of the individual test selected by the laboratory.

Results

Molecular and antigen tests that detect the presence of the virus are relevant in the acute phase only. Serologic assays detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the recovering and recovered phase. Each testing methodology has its advantages and disadvantages.

Conclusions

We demonstrate the value of reporting probability of false-positive results, probability of false-negative results, and costs to patients and health care. These risk metrics can be calculated from the risk drivers of PPA and PNA combined with estimates of prevalence, cost, and Reff number (people infected by 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 carrier).

### Serologic evidence of dengue infection before onset of epidemic, Bangladesh [^112QUFkw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

OD values were used to calculate binding index and units of IgM and IgG. Binding index was defined as OD of test sample minus OD of negative control divided by OD of weak positive control (defined as 100 U) minus OD of the negative control. We multiplied binding index by 100 to obtain units of respective antibodies. Borderline results (± 5 of 40 U) were repeated for validation.

IgM and IgG antibody values of > 40 U were considered positive for dengue or JEV. When anti-dengue IgM or IgG values were > 40 U, primary infection (first-time exposure) was defined as a ratio of IgM to IgG > 1.8 and secondary infection (> 1 previous exposure) was defined as a ratio of < 1.8.

Widal test was performed by rapid slide titration technique, as described by the manufacturer (Murex Biotech Ltd, Dartford, UK). A single test was performed on all acute-phase serum. A test was defined as positive when the titer was > 1:80. However, recognizing the nonspecificity of this break point, we also considered titers of > 1:320 or fourfold rise in serum antibody between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples as representing "likely typhoid".

### Comparative analysis of commercially available typhoid point-of-care tests: results of a prospective and hybrid retrospective multicenter diagnostic accuracy study in Kenya and Pakistan [^111gPV1R]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

An accurate diagnosis of typhoid can prove difficult, since the characteristic symptoms are similar to other undifferentiated febrile illnesses such as malaria or dengue fever, and typhoid can also be mistaken for vector borne febrile illnesses such as scrub typhus. As such, microbiological testing is usually required to confirm a diagnosis of, with blood and bone marrow cultures currently considered the gold-standard tests. However, blood culture testing can be expensive, has a low sensitivity, and requires infrastructure and skilled staff that are not always available in LMICs and are not adequate for rapid patient management. Tests using bone marrow cultures may have a higher sensitivity than blood culture tests, but they are not routinely performed as obtaining bone marrow aspirates involves skilled invasive techniques. As a result, alternative tests have been widely adopted, especially in LMICs. The most widely used rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the Widal test, despite numerous reports of poor sensitivity and specificity, which in some cases has led to multiple misdiagnoses in disease outbreaks, treatment delays, and even deaths. Limitations have also been reported for other typhoid RDTs, such as Typhidot (Reszon Diagnostics), Tubex (IDL Biotech), and Test-it Typhoid IgM (LifeAssay Diagnostics). While these show improvements over the Widal test, they still only exhibit moderate sensitivity and specificity. However, many accuracy studies into the effectiveness of typhoid RDTs have variations in methodology and reference standards, making it difficult for health care providers and policymakers to make robust decisions or recommendations for the utility of commercial tests in different settings.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various commercially available typhoid RDTs using the same protocol in different endemic settings and comparing against a single reference standard available in regions of endemicity. In parallel, we aimed (i) to develop a biorepository of well-characterized specimens for use in evaluating emerging diagnostic tests for typhoid and for supporting future test development and (ii) to evaluate the operational characteristics (including invalid and indeterminate testing rates) of the RDTs.

### Plasma immunoglobulin A responses against 2 Salmonella typhi antigens identify patients with typhoid fever [^113pGYmy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a need for a reliable, simple diagnostic assay for typhoid fever. Available commercial serologic assays for typhoid fever have limited sensitivity and specificity. Using high-throughput immunoscreening technologies, we previously identified several immunoreactive Salmonella Typhi antigens that seem promising for possible inclusion in a new diagnostic assay: hemolysin E (HlyE), cytolethal distending toxin, S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and S. Typhi membrane preparation.

Methods

We assessed plasma antibody responses (immunoglobulin [Ig] M, IgA, and IgG) to these antigens by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with suspected enteric fever, controls with other febrile illnesses, and healthy controls in Dhaka, Bangladesh and performed Tubex and Typhidot tests, the Widal assay, and the typhoid/paratyphoid test (TPTest) in each patient. Using machine learning methods, we identified a parsimonious serology signature to distinguish acute typhoid cases from controls and then validated our findings in an independent test cohort from Nepal of patients with culture-confirmed S. Typhi and controls with other bacteremic illnesses.

Results

We demonstrated that the use of 2 antigens (HlyE and LPS) with 1 antibody isotype (IgA) could distinguish typhoid from other invasive bacterial infections (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.95; sensitivity, 90%, specificity, 92%). Use of a single antigen (HlyE) and isotype (IgA) had an AUC of 0.93.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that development of a diagnostic assay for acute typhoid fever focused on detecting IgA responses against HlyE, with or without LPS, is warranted.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^112UCGkq]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study estimated that S. Paratyphi affected 3.4 million people annually, with 19.1 thousand deaths, compared with 10.9 million cases and 116.8 thousand deaths for S. Typhi. The higher morbidity and mortality of S. Typhi makes it a greater public health concern, but the increasing prevalence of S. Paratyphi in certain regions makes it prudent for a next-generation test to detect S. Paratyphi as well as S. Typhi. Delphi survey feedback noted that not being able to detect S. Paratyphi could undermine clinician confidence in a next-generation typhoid POC test as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi may cause indistinguishable clinical syndromes. As drug-resistant typhoid continues to spread, it may become necessary to differentiate between these two serovars prior to starting therapy due to different antibiotic susceptibility profiles.

The minimum diagnostic requirement for a typhoid RDT in this TPP was ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 95% specificity, with an optimum threshold of ≥ 95% sensitivity and ≥ 98% specificity. Consensus agreement was achieved in the Delphi survey for specificity but not sensitivity, reflecting the substantial variability seen in the published literature with proposed targets ranging from 80%–90% for sensitivity and 90%–98% for specificity. The poor sensitivity of blood culture as a reference standard for typhoid diagnosis makes it difficult to accurately assess the performance of novel diagnostic tests. Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by reliably identifying alternative infections and by using a CRS that incorporates the results of multiple tests.CRSs that have been used for typhoid diagnosis include culture and/or clinical findings; culture and/or Widal test; culture and/or PCR; culture, Widal test and/or clinical finding; and culture, PCR and/or Widal test. Evaluation of CRSs has been limited by a lack of consistency between studies, with a systematic review identifying 21 studies that stated use of a CRS as the reference method for a typhoid diagnostic test, but no 2 studies utilised an identical CRS. For a CRS to be reproducible, it has been proposed that the individual test components need to be standardised, with clinical signs that match the WHO definition of suspected typhoid fever, assays that are commercially available and well-defined blood culture parameters. Further work is needed to identify a standardised CRS before it can be included in a typhoid TPP.

### Introductory article on global burden and epidemiology of typhoid fever [^114yfBWu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Not all diagnostic methods perform equally well. Bacterial culture with bone marrow offers the greatest sensitivity at upward of 80%. However, bone marrow aspiration and culture is expensive and invasive and is not commonly used in practice. Consequently, although less sensitive, blood culture remains the practical standard for typhoid fever diagnosis. A recent systematic review of 10 studies examined the sensitivity of blood cultures relative to bone marrow cultures from a sample of 529 positive Salmonella Typhi cases (using blood and bone marrow positivity as a composite measure) and found that bone marrow cultures were positive in 96% of typhoid fever cases whereas blood cultures were positive in 61%. A study by Lee et al.states to accurately detect bloodstream infections such as S. Typhi, two to three 20 mL samples are required for adults. Blood culture sensitivity is the greatest in the initial stages of the infection and, with an adequate sample, has been observed to approach the sensitivity of bone marrow culture. Still, relying on blood cultures alone will underestimate the true incidence of typhoid fever. Stool cultures are still used in many endemic regions. However, a positive result may occur in acute disease, convalescent shedding, or chronic carriage. The Widal agglutination test works by measuring antibodies in serum. Although still used in resource-poor settings, the Widal test is inferior to blood culture in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. Other serological detection tests, although sometimes superior to Widal, also lack accuracy for typhoid fever diagnosis.

Because sensitivity is < 100%, and has the potential to be influenced by over- or underfill of sample vials and contaminants within samples, case detection with a single-blood culture underestimates typhoid fever incidence. Antimicrobial use, which is a particular concern in high-burden regions, can inhibit bacterial growth and produce false-negative blood cultures, also resulting in underestimating typhoid fever prevalence in febrile patients. Additional diagnostic challenges in low-resource settings include capacity limitations (i.e. shortages in trained staff, diagnostic tools, quality control etc.) that make it difficult to distinguish typhoid from paratyphoid fevers and other causes of acute febrile illness.

### Treatment of enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) with cephalosporins [^113AAtwi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever present a challenge to diagnose clinically, especially in children, as symptoms overlap with other causes of fever. The optimum method to confirm diagnosis is through blood or bone marrow culture, which can take days for a result, and are often not easily available in low‐resource, endemic regions (Baker 2010). A negative blood culture does not exclude the diagnosis. Culture of faeces, urine or bile can be undertaken, however a positive result may indicate chronic carriage rather than acute infection (Wain 1998).

Bacterial culture facilitates antimicrobial susceptibility testing which is helpful in guiding the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints incorporate an 'intermediate' or decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) category as well as a resistant category (CLSI 2021). Older options for detecting the intermediate category include a test for nalidixic acid susceptibility or perfloxacin susceptibility: nalidixic acid‐resistant (NaR) or perfloxacin‐resistant organisms have intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CLSI 2021; Crump 2003). It is important to note that the possibility of an 'intermediate' or DCS category was not appreciated when fluoroquinolones were first evaluated in RCTs and so was not determined in the isolates in these early trials. Susceptibility breakpoints for azithromycin have been proposed based on MIC distributions and limited clinical data (CLSI 2021; Sjolund‐Karlsson 2011).

The benefit of serological tests for the diagnosis of enteric fever is limited by the persistence of positive results following from previous infection. Newer diagnostic tests using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatographic platforms and nucleic acid amplification are in development, but none have proven to be sensitive and specific enough to be widely adopted in routine clinical diagnostics (Neupane 2021; Parry 2002). Further, serological tests, such as the Widal test and commercial rapid diagnostic tests, are not confirmatory in the acute phase of illness. The Widal test lacks sensitivity and specificity, and the moderate sensitivity and specificity of available rapid diagnostic tests (such as Typhidot‐M, TUBEX, and Test‐it typhoid tests) does not support their use as a replacement for blood culture for diagnosing enteric fever (Levine 1982; Parry 1999; Wijedoru 2017).

Item 6: Included studies

Indicate the number and type of included studies and the participants and relevant characteristics of the studies (including the reference standard).

Examples

6a: "We included 27 unique studies involving 9557 participants. Sixteen studies (59%) were performed in low‐ or middle‐income countries".

6b: "For the diagnostic accuracy of HBsAg from dried blood spot compared to venous blood, 19 studies were included in a quantitative meta-analysis, and 23 in a narrative review".

6c: "Of the 40 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 33 compared rapid diagnostic test and/or enzyme immunoassays against enzyme immunoassays and 7 against nucleic-acid test as reference standards. Thirty studies assessed diagnostic accuracy of 33 brands of rapid diagnostic tests in 23,716 individuals from 23 countries using enzyme immunoassays as the reference standard".

6d: "All studies were at high risk of bias for the index test domain because no reported thresholds were prespecified".

Explanation

Authors should report the number of included studies and participants (and, if possible, the number of participants with the target condition) and any other key characteristics (example 6a). Some studies may be included in the qualitative part of the review but not in the quantitative synthesis (example 6b). If the included studies use multiple reference standards, this should be reported (example 6c). This information enables readers to gauge the amount of summarised evidence and its applicability to the review question. Reviews with few included studies and a limited number of participants may produce imprecise accuracy estimates and may not add substantive value compared with the individual studies. Review authors are also invited to summarise their assessment of the quality of evidence (that is, risk of bias and concerns about applicability) and highlight their main source of concern (example 6d).

Item 7: Synthesis of results

Include the results for the analysis of diagnostic accuracy, preferably indicating the number of studies and participants. Describe test accuracy including variability; if meta-analysis was done, include summary results and confidence intervals.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing — false positives and confirmatory testing: Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the expected number of false-positive Ag results is very small, on the order of 0–10 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested, and confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, < 1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant and detrimental. Concerns about false-positive Ag results were not borne out in the medical literature.

### Salmonella enterica serovar typhi O: 1, 9, 12 polysaccharide-protein conjugate as a diagnostic tool for typhoid fever [^1116gexV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Serologic tests play an important role in diagnosis of typhoid fever. In an effort to develop a more defined reagent for these tests, purified Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (ST) O:1,9,12 polysaccharide was conjugated to human serum albumin (HSA), and the conjugate was purified chromatographically to yield a reagent with 2 moles ST O polysaccharide per mole HSA. In 40 patients with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever, significant dot immunobinding titers (≥ 20,000) were present in 28 (70%) tested with 100 ng of ST O antigen-HSA (ST O-HSA) conjugate, in 38 (95%) tested with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide, and in 16 (40%) tested with purified unconjugated ST O chains. In sera from 22 patients with other nontyphoid fevers, 2 (9.1%) had such reactivities with 100 ng of ST O-HSA, 1 (4.5%) had such reactivity with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide (4.5%), and none reacted with 100 ng of unconjugated ST O chains. None of the 17 healthy-control sera reacted significantly with any of the ST reagents. None of the patient or control sera reacted with unconjugated HSA. The sensitivity of dot immunobinding for typhoid fever was 70% with 100 ng of ST O-HSA, somewhat lower than that with 100 ng of ST lipopolysaccharide (95%) but similar to that of the Widal H agglutination test with a ≥ 1/160 cutoff (74%). Specificities of these tests were 91%, 95%, and 86%, respectively. These preliminary results suggest that ST O polysaccharide-protein conjugates could provide a nontoxic, easily quality-controlled synthetic reagent for analysis of human immune responses to ST as well as for the development of new diagnostics and vaccines for typhoid fever.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^1119a821]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Differentiating both typhoid (Salmonella Typhi) and paratyphoid (Salmonella Paratyphi A) infection from other causes of fever in endemic areas is a diagnostic challenge. Although commercial point‐of‐care rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for enteric fever are available as alternatives to the current reference standard test of blood or bone marrow culture, or to the widely used Widal Test, their diagnostic accuracy is unclear. If accurate, they could potentially replace blood culture as the World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended main diagnostic test for enteric fever.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and prototypes for detecting Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi A infection in symptomatic persons living in endemic areas.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, IndMED, African Index Medicus, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 4 March 2016. We manually searched WHO reports, and papers from international conferences on Salmonella infections. We also contacted test manufacturers to identify studies.

Selection criteria

We included diagnostic accuracy studies of enteric fever RDTs in patients with fever or with symptoms suggestive of enteric fever living in endemic areas. We classified the reference standard used as either Grade 1 (result from a blood culture and a bone marrow culture) or Grade 2 (result from blood culture and blood polymerase chain reaction, or from blood culture alone).

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the test result data. We used a modified QUADAS‐2 extraction form to assess methodological quality. We performed a meta‐analysis when there were sufficient studies for the test and heterogeneity was reasonable.

Main results

Thirty‐seven studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total of 5080 participants (range 50 to 1732). Enteric fever prevalence rates in the study populations ranged from 1% to 75% (median prevalence 24%, interquartile range (IQR) 11% to 46%). The included studies evaluated 16 different RDTs, and 16 studies compared two or more different RDTs. Only three studies used the Grade 1 reference standard, and only 11 studies recruited unselected febrile patients. Most included studies were from Asia, with five studies from sub‐Saharan Africa. All of the RDTs were designed to detect S. Typhi infection only.

Most studies evaluated three RDTs and their variants: TUBEX in 14 studies; Typhidot (Typhidot, Typhidot‐M, and TyphiRapid‐Tr02) in 22 studies; and the Test‐It Typhoid immunochromatographic lateral flow assay, and its earlier prototypes (dipstick, latex agglutination) developed by the Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam (KIT) in nine studies. Meta‐analyses showed an average sensitivity of 78% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71% to 85%) and specificity of 87% (95% CI 82% to 91%) for TUBEX; and an average sensitivity of 69% (95% CI 59% to 78%) and specificity of 90% (95% CI 78% to 93%) for all Test‐It Typhoid and prototype tests (KIT). Across all forms of the Typhidot test, the average sensitivity was 84% (95% CI 73% to 91%) and specificity was 79% (95% CI 70% to 87%). When we based the analysis on the 13 studies of the Typhidot test that either reported indeterminate test results or where the test format means there are no indeterminate results, the average sensitivity was 78% (95% CI 65% to 87%) and specificity was 77% (95% CI 66% to 86%). We did not identify any difference in either sensitivity or specificity between TUBEX, Typhidot, and Test‐it Typhoid tests when based on comparison to the 13 Typhidot studies where indeterminate results are either reported or not applicable. If TUBEX and Test‐it Typhoid are compared to all Typhidot studies, the sensitivity of Typhidot was higher than Test‐it Typhoid (15% (95% CI 2% to 28%), but other comparisons did not show a difference at the 95% level of CIs.

In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients presenting with fever where 30% (300 patients) have enteric fever, on average Typhidot tests reporting indeterminate results or where tests do not produce indeterminate results will miss the diagnosis in 66 patients with enteric fever, TUBEX will miss 66, and Test‐It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests will miss 93. In the 700 people without enteric fever, the number of people incorrectly diagnosed with enteric fever would be 161 with Typhidot tests, 91 with TUBEX, and 70 with Test‐It Typhoid and prototype (KIT) tests. The CIs around these estimates were wide, with no difference in false positive results shown between tests.

The quality of the data for each study was evaluated using a standardized checklist called QUADAS‐2. Overall, the certainty of the evidence in the studies that evaluated enteric fever RDTs was low.

Authors' conclusions

In 37 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for enteric fever, few studies were at a low risk of bias. The three main RDT tests and variants had moderate diagnostic accuracy. There was no evidence of a difference between the average sensitivity and specificity of the three main RDT tests. More robust evaluations of alternative RDTs for enteric fever are needed.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^113iU3AF]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Test performance

Blood culture is commonly used as the reference standard for typhoid diagnosis but requires sophisticated equipment not readily available in LMIC where typhoid is endemic. Typhoid blood cultures require a minimum of 2–10 mL of venous blood due to the low bacterial load in peripheral blood, and have poor sensitivity estimated at only 61% in a recent systematic review. A composite reference standard (CRS) that combines multiple tests with high specificity but suboptimal sensitivity has been proposed as a possible way to improve diagnostic accuracy. Various test combinations have been used as a CRS for typhoid, but respondents in this Delphi exercise advised that the adoption of a standardised composite is required before it can be included in a TPP.

The most commonly used typhoid POC tests (Widal, Typhidot, Tubex, Test-It Typhoid, TPTest) require between 5 µL and 1 mL of blood, but have only moderate sensitivity and specificity. Survey respondents agreed that an optimal next-generation typhoid RDT would use a capillary blood sample with a volume of ≤ 100 µL, or a less invasive sample type, excluding urine and stool. However, survey respondents indicated that ≤ 1 mL of venous blood was an acceptable minimum requirement due to the current difficulty in accurately diagnosing typhoid fever (table 3). The TPP allows for up to two sample processing steps as an RDT may require serum to be separated from whole blood, with at most five steps for the test of which no more than two should be timed, and a total hands on time of < 5 min. Based on a published expert consensus TPP for diagnostics for acute febrile illness, RDT performance ideally would entail three or fewer steps, of which at most one step is timed, with a total hands-on time of 1 min or less.

### Bacteremia among febrile patients attending selected healthcare facilities in ibadan, Nigeria [^115t8tXL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired bacteremia causes considerable mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries and most cases occur in children aged < 5 years. Common causes of bacteremia in African countries include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Patients with invasive bacterial infections commonly present with fever, a sign that is a root cause of medical visits, illnesses, and deaths in many tropical countries in Africa, including Nigeria.

In Nigeria, there is considerable uncertainty about the main causes of fever. The country is endemic for malaria and multiple fever-associated viruses. Salmonella Typhi is known to be endemic, although very little is known about the disease epidemiology. For example, the true cause of documented "epidemics" of typhoid fever between 1987 and 1989 was never proven to be S. Typhi bacteriologically, and these outbreaks may have been associated with Plasmodium falciparum malaria or other etiological agents. In the following 3 decades, clinical diagnosis and the Widal test remain the predominant modes of typhoid diagnosis in Nigeria. Overestimation of typhoid fever incidence due to overreliance on the insufficiently specific Widal test is also common in other parts of Africa. While there have been recent blood culture–based surveillance studies in other parts of Nigeria, the true prevalence of invasive Salmonella in Ibadan, Nigeria, was undetermined at the start of this study.

HIV antibody testing algorithm — background explains that accurate laboratory diagnosis relies on testing algorithms that maximize overall sensitivity and specificity by employing a sequence of tests in combination and applying decision rules for resolving discordant test results; since 1989 in the United States, the CDC and Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) recommended initiating testing with a sensitive HIV-1 antibody immunoassay, with specimens that are repeatedly reactive then tested with a more specific HIV-1 antibody test, either the HIV-1 Western blot or HIV-1 indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), to validate those results, and in 1992 CDC recommended specific testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies if demographic or behavioral information suggested that HIV-2 infection might be present.

### Debunking highly prevalent health misinformation using audio dramas delivered by whatsApp: evidence from a randomised controlled trial in Sierra Leone [^114L264Y]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Although typhoid and malaria share symptoms (eg, fever), they are very different diseases: typhoid is caused by bacterial infection, usually transmitted through contaminated food, water and the faecal-oral route. The incidence of typhoid in Sierra Leone is estimated to be low (around 15 000 cases in 2019). Malaria is a disease spread by parasite-infected mosquitoes and is much more common than typhoid in Sierra Leone, with more than 3.7 million cases estimated in 2019.

Typhoid can be diagnosed through blood culture. However, in Sierra Leone only one hospital currently has the necessary equipment, and resource constraints limit the availability of blood culture for clinical diagnosis. Instead, the Widal test is commonly used to diagnose typhoid. The Widal test reportedly has low sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value for typhoid diagnosis, and may cross-react with malaria antigens, raising the risk of a false-positive result for patients with malaria infections. Confirmed coinfection of malaria and typhoid is rarely observed. However, in Sierra Leone patients are frequently diagnosed in health centres with 'typhoid-malaria', often without using a diagnostic test, which in addition to antimalarials often is treated with antibiotics. While there are limited data on typhoid diagnosis and related antibiotic usage in Sierra Leone, the overdiagnosis of typhoid has likely contributed to the unnecessary use of antibiotics, as well as ensuing antibiotic resistance. Countering typhoid misinformation could therefore inform and empower citizens to question a typhoid-malaria diagnosis and potentially avoid unnecessary usage of antibiotics.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^112XjFdr]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

The UK government has put lateral flow antigen tests (LFATs) at the forefront of its strategy to scale-up testing in the coronavirus pandemic. However, evidence from a pilot trial using an LFAT to identify asymptomatic infections in the community suggested that the test missed over half of the positive cases in the tested population. This raises the question of whether it can be ethical to use an inaccurate test to guide public health measures. We begin by explicating different dimensions of test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value), and why they matter morally, before highlighting key data from the Liverpool pilot. We argue that the poor sensitivity of the LFAT in this pilot trial suggests that there are important limitations to what we can expect these tests to achieve. A test with low sensitivity will provide false-negative results, and in doing so generate the risk of false assurance and its attendant moral costs. However, we also suggest that the deployment of an insensitive but specific test could identify many asymptomatic carriers of the virus who are currently being missed under existing arrangements. Having outlined ways in which the costs of false reassurance could potentially be mitigated, we conclude that the use of an insensitive LFAT in mass testing may be ethical if (1) it is used predominantly to identify positive cases, (2) it is a cost-effective method of achieving that goal and (3) if other public health tools can effectively prevent widespread false reassurance.

### Diagnostic tests: how to estimate the positive predictive value [^114EkigV]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2015). Low credibility.

When a patient receives a positive test result from a diagnostic test they assume they have the disease. However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations. The reasons for this miscalculation as well as three ways to calculate the PPV are reviewed here.

### Case fatality rate of enteric fever in endemic countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jhJpL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Only 3 studies identified in our search conducted active surveillance, and among these studies, the CFR was 0.28% (95% CI, 0%–99.66%). Active surveillance might also underestimate the CFR owing to the enhanced clinical management of febrile patients in the context of the study. Ill patients might be encouraged to seek care and receive an appropriate diagnosis earlier than they would otherwise, thereby preventing their illness from progressing, leading to underestimation of the CFR. Similar reasoning can be applied to randomized control trials in which patients receive enhanced care, potentially leading to an underestimate of the CFR.

The CFR was also lower among studies that relied solely on culture confirmation of cases (1.63%; 95% CI,.63%–4.12%) than in those that used both culture and serology to detect cases (3.22%; 95% CI, 2.08%–4.97%), although the difference was not statistically significant (Supplement 5). Serological tests for enteric fever, notably the Widal test, suffer from poor sensitivity. Therefore, studies that included serologically detected cases may include cases (and deaths) with other conditions. This could lead to an overestimate of the CFR if these false-positive cases were more severe than the culture-confirmed cases. In addition, clinical features may be misleading and laboratory tests may be unreliable in the presence of intestinal perforations, resulting in an underestimation of the CFR of enteric fever. The CFR has been found to be higher among patients with intestinal perforation (15.4%), but the proportion of enteric fever episodes leading to severe outcomes is not yet well described. Two ongoing surveillance programs in Africa and Asia will hopefully provide more insights in the near future into the proportion of cases leading to severe complications.

Our search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed to inform our overall estimate of the CFR of enteric fever in the general population. As such, we excluded studies limited, for instance, to certain age groups. Therefore, our results on the relationship between age and AMR and the CFR of enteric fever should be interpreted with caution. Further research on these specific topics is necessary.

The CFR of enteric fever remains high in endemic countries, highlighting the severity of this preventable disease. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of the CFR, and insufficient data on prognostic factors and vulnerable subpopulations. More studies are needed to estimate heterogeneity in the CFR by age and the impact of emerging AMR.

### Implementation of interventions for the control of typhoid fever in low-and middle-income countries [^112BxyC9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Overall, with the exception of South Africa, relatively few typhoid-specific interventions and measures to control the use of antibiotic medication were reportedly implemented in these eight countries. A concern in the lack of control surrounding antibiotic use lies in the diagnosis of typhoid fever and the resultant increase in antibiotic resistance. The availability and quality of diagnostic tests for infectious diseases vary widely in LMICs. Within certain contexts, the capacity to perform culture tests to confirm infectious pathogens is not present either because of a lack of trained personnel or diagnostic tools. In other settings, available tests fall short of the gold standard. For example, Widal tests are used in resource-limited environments; however, it lacks the necessary sensitivity and specificity to accurately diagnose typhoid and paratyphoid fever. This can lead to overestimation of the incidence of typhoid, and in turn, inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. An assessment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi strains, characterized as being resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole, noted that MDR has been on the rise since the 1980s. A study conducted in Cameroon, reviewed how medical professionals were interpreting Widal tests and assigning treatment to patients. This study found that within their sample, 84% of nurses and just less than 50% of doctors had difficulty identifying those who did not need treatment, which in turn led them to prescribe treatment that was unnecessary. The over prescription of antibiotics has played a key role in the increasing burden of drug and MDR strains of S. Typhi being observed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and remains a major public health concern.

However, most of the study countries implemented agricultural and sewage treatment practices and all study countries implemented interventions for diarrheal disease control and regulations for food safety and food handlers. The relationship between outbreaks and carrier interventions was not specifically captured, but it was noted in five countries (Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam) that carrier status testing was performed in food handlers. Vietnam was the only country where respondents confirmed the testing of food handlers for typhoid carriage occurred at the national level, the level of implementation in the remaining four countries was unspecified (Figure 1). Interventions for diarrheal disease control, in particular, public education regarding WASH, were perceived to be the most effective measures for typhoid control by most key informants across the eight countries, whereas typhoid vaccinations were perceived as the least effective typhoid control intervention in six of the eight countries.
