## Question

What is the impact of methane production on interpreting fructose breath test results?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the impact of methane production on interpreting fructose breath test results and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the fructose breath test actually measures and the standard dose and positivity criteria. Then, I should verify how methane alters hydrogen signals and why dual-gas measurement is necessary. Next, I will check methane thresholds and clinical correlates, consider transit-time confounding and the "double-peak" pitfall, outline practical interpretation steps and pre-test preparation, review test limitations and device variability, and finally synthesize the clinical implications for management, anchoring to consensus guidance where possible.

> Let me first confirm what a fructose breath test measures and how it's performed, because if I get the fundamentals wrong, everything downstream will be shaky. The test quantifies the rise in exhaled hydrogen and, ideally, methane after ingesting a fructose load, with 25 g being the recommended dose to optimize sensitivity while avoiding the high false-positive rate seen with 50 g; serial sampling for at least 3 hours is advised to capture malabsorption events and symptom correlation [^113wUrFx] [^114iWzpP]. Wait, let me verify the positivity criteria: I initially thought a rise of hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm within 90 minutes indicates fructose malabsorption, but hold on, that 90-minute window is the SIBO criterion; for carbohydrate maldigestion (including fructose), consensus uses a hydrogen rise of ≥ 20 ppm from baseline during the test without restricting it to 90 minutes, provided the test is conducted for at least 3 hours and proper sample quality and dilution correction (CO2) are ensured [^116yj2Xp] [^114iWzpP] [^116nv63o]. I need to ensure we also measure methane, because mammalian cells do not produce methane and any measurable methane reflects methanogen activity, which can directly affect hydrogen kinetics and thus interpretation [^114iWzpP] [^116LCLPw].

> Why does methane matter for the interpretation of hydrogen? Let me think this through and double-check the "sink effect". In methane producers, methanogenic archaea consume hydrogen to generate methane, which can blunt the hydrogen rise and create an apparent false-negative hydrogen profile even when fructose is malabsorbed; this is precisely why dual-gas measurement is recommended and why relying on hydrogen alone risks misclassification [^116LCLPw] [^116nv63o]. I should confirm terminology before proceeding so I don't propagate confusion: excess methane on breath testing is categorized as intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO), not SIBO, because methanogens are archaea rather than bacteria, and this distinction is now standard in ACG guidance [^116LCLPw]. Also, given that a substantial fraction of healthy individuals are methane producers, I need to be cautious about baseline methane status when interpreting any carbohydrate breath test [^112HDS59].

> Next, I should review methane thresholds and clinical correlates to avoid overcalling low-level methane. The North American Consensus defined methane ≥ 10 ppm at any point as methane-positive, a convention that is widely used and aligns with ACG guidance on IMO; conversely, the consensus explicitly found insufficient evidence to use a 3 ppm cutoff, which I should keep in mind when confronted with low-level methane traces [^111vPQV3] [^1118HZJt] [^116LCLPw]. I need to check the constipation linkage carefully: higher methane levels correlate with constipation and slower transit in several datasets, though some studies show that only higher baseline thresholds (≥ 10 or ≥ 20 ppm) discriminate constipation from diarrhea, whereas low-level methane (3–5 ppm) does not, so I should avoid overinterpreting small methane signals [^114DVcrc] [^113YKi44] [^113WbTCw].

> Now, the impact of IMO on fructose breath test timing and the notorious "double peak" needs careful handling. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: an early gas rise is often due to rapid orocecal transit with colonic fermentation rather than true small-intestinal overgrowth, and concurrent scintigraphy studies show that most early rises occur when substrate has already reached the cecum; this is why double-peak criteria lack validity and should not be used to diagnose SIBO or to overcall early "malabsorption" without context [^116RKziw] [^113KLUiv] [^113pHv8r]. Because methane is associated with slower oro-anal transit, the timing of methane peaks can be shifted, and symptom-gas trajectories vary with transit time; therefore, I should consider measured or suspected transit characteristics when deciding whether an early or late rise reflects true malabsorption versus transit-driven colonic fermentation or delay [^113YKi44] [^113WbTCw].

> With that context, I will now outline practical interpretation steps, but I should double-check each against consensus so I don't misstate practice. First, always measure hydrogen, methane, and CO2 simultaneously to ensure dual-gas interpretation with alveolar correction, using a 25 g fructose dose and sampling for at least 3 hours; this reduces false negatives from the hydrogen "sink effect" and improves trace quality control [^114iWzpP] [^116nv63o] [^113wUrFx]. Next, I should review pre-test preparation: avoid antibiotics for 4 weeks, fast 8–12 hours, avoid fermentable foods the day prior, and refrain from smoking and vigorous exercise on test day; PPIs do not need to be stopped, and if tolerated, promotility drugs and laxatives should be held for about a week to minimize transit confounding, though I should individualize based on the indication [^116WFTh7] [^116UTZ9T] [^115LT3gW]. I need to ensure SIBO/IMO is ruled out or addressed before testing for fructose malabsorption, because overgrowth can cause premature fermentation and false-positive carbohydrate malabsorption results; in methane-positive traces (≥ 10 ppm), I should annotate IMO irrespective of the hydrogen profile, then interpret fructose malabsorption cautiously in that context [^116LCLPw] [^111vPQV3].

> Wait, I should also acknowledge limitations and device variability so we don't overstate test certainty. Fructose breath testing shows only moderate repeatability for symptoms and gases and limited repeatability for "malabsorber" status in FGID populations, and device differences can meaningfully change fructose hydrogen readings, with stationary gas chromatography sometimes reading higher than handheld sensors; this variability underscores the need to correlate with symptoms and use consistent methodology when monitoring over time [^114EzB2A] [^116WM3JK]. Moreover, major guidelines for IBS caution against routine breath testing to rule out SIBO or carbohydrate intolerance in typical IBS presentations, which reminds me to use breath tests judiciously and only when results will change management [^11481KB1].

> I should now consider the clinical implications of methane positivity, but let me verify effect sizes and quality of evidence. In methane-positive patients, particularly those with constipation, ACG suggests considering glucose or lactulose methane breath testing to diagnose IMO, and antibiotic regimens that include rifaximin plus neomycin have shown higher clinical response rates than rifaximin alone in retrospective cohorts, although prospective randomized data remain limited and patient selection matters [^111bdD9E] [^114jhTKD]. There are also small studies suggesting that eradicating breath methane may improve constipation and even metabolic parameters in certain populations, but these findings need confirmation before broad application, so I should frame them as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^112EuAZL] [^111zqCvJ].

> Putting it all together, I need to ensure my final interpretation remains transit-aware and dual-gas informed. Methane production can suppress hydrogen via the "sink effect", creating false-negative hydrogen traces unless methane is measured; a methane level ≥ 10 ppm indicates IMO and should be annotated regardless of hydrogen, while low-level methane (3–5 ppm) should not be overinterpreted; and transit can shift gas timing, so early rises should not automatically be ascribed to small-intestinal fermentation without considering OATT or corroborative data [^116LCLPw] [^111vPQV3] [^114DVcrc] [^113YKi44]. Therefore, accurate fructose breath test interpretation requires dual-gas testing with a validated 25 g protocol, proper pre-test preparation, attention to sample quality and CO2 correction, assessment for SIBO/IMO beforehand, and integration of clinical context and transit considerations, aligned with NAC and ACG guidance [^114iWzpP] [^116nv63o] [^116WFTh7] [^111zqCvJ].

Methane production by gut methanogens can **mask hydrogen rises** on fructose breath tests, causing **false negatives** if only hydrogen is measured. Methanogens **consume hydrogen to produce methane**, so hydrogen may stay low despite malabsorption; therefore, **measure both gases** and use a methane threshold of ≥ 10 ppm to improve detection and avoid misclassification [^111vPQV3] [^111zqCvJ].

---

## Methane production and hydrogen consumption

Methanogens, mainly Methanobrevibacter smithii, **consume hydrogen to produce methane**, reducing exhaled hydrogen and potentially causing false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^111zqCvJ] [^116LCLPw]. Methane production is also associated with **slower intestinal transit and constipation**, further confounding breath test interpretation [^1115KfQx] [^113m1pJH].

---

## Impact on fructose breath test interpretation

In fructose breath testing, methane production **consumes hydrogen to produce methane**, which can lead to false negatives if only hydrogen is measured [^111zqCvJ] [^114mEdTf]. Methane producers may also show elevated baseline methane with minimal hydrogen rise, complicating interpretation [^111zqCvJ] [^114mEdTf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Measure hydrogen, methane, and CO2** simultaneously during breath testing to improve accuracy [^116nv63o].

- **Interpret methane ≥ 10 ppm as positive** for intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) [^111vPQV3].

- Recognize that **excessive methane does not indicate SIBO**, as methanogens are archaea; use the term IMO [^111zqCvJ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Methane production is **linked to constipation and slower transit**; consider IMO in methane-positive patients with constipation [^1115KfQx] [^113m1pJH]. Treatment may require targeted antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin plus neomycin) to reduce methane and improve symptoms [^114jhTKD].

## Summary of key points

| **Key point** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Methanogens consume hydrogen | Potential false negatives if only hydrogen is measured |
| Methane ≥ 10 ppm | Positive for IMO |
| Methane linked to constipation | Consider IMO in methane-positive patients with constipation |
| Measure hydrogen, methane, and CO2 | Improves accuracy and reduces misclassification |

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, specifically with respect to breath testing interpretation, the ACG 2020 guidelines recommend recognizing that the presence of excessive methane on breath testing does not indicate SIBO, since methanogens are not bacteria (they are archaea). The guidelines suggest using the term "intestinal methanogen overgrowth".

### Detection of bacterial overgrowth in IBS using the lactulose H2 breath test: comparison with 14C-D-xylose and healthy controls [^115qpvdj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent reports suggest that bacterial overgrowth is commonly associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when diagnosed using the lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT). We employed this test to examine whether similar findings exist in a geographically distinct population of Rome II positive IBS patients and compared it to the 14C-D-xylose breath test, a test with acknowledged greater specificity for bacterial overgrowth.

Methods

In the first series, Rome II IBS patients underwent a 10 g lactulose breath test and a standardized 1 g 14C-D-xylose breath test and answered IBS symptom questionnaires. A positive test required an elevated breath hydrogen concentration within 90 minutes, two distinct peaks, and an increase of more than 20 ppm. In a second series, control patients lacking gastrointestinal symptoms underwent a lactulose breath test. A positive test required an elevation of breath hydrogen greater than 20 ppm within 90 or 180 minutes. These criteria were also applied to lactulose breath tests from IBS cases in the first series.

Results

The IBS patients were predominantly female (64%) and most reported severe symptoms (80%). The majority had diarrhea-predominant symptoms (63%) and only 3% were constipation predominant. In the first series, only 10% of patients had a positive lactulose breath test and 13% had a positive 14C-D-xylose test. In the second series, the number of abnormal LHBTs was much higher but no differences were found between IBS patients and controls.

Conclusion

The lactulose breath test did not reliably detect a common association between bacterial overgrowth and IBS in this study population.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^111QX85d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Consensus development process**: The process for the development of the consensus statements is outlined in Figure 1. Specific topics for discussion, including indications for breath testing, the preparation and performance of the test, and the interpretation of results, were identified based on literature reviews. Pre-meeting survey questions (Supplementary Information S1 online) were designed to further delineate the knowledge gaps in breath testing and were sent to the consensus group members. The survey results were collated and summarized prior to the consensus meeting.

- **Selection of the physician-scientists**: The selection was based on several criteria. First, attendees were required to represent those with active and recent research in the area of breath testing. This involved a literature search to identify individuals in North America with active publications in the area. Many of these included physicians from major academic motility programs. Second, there was a need for representation from clinician scientists from high-volume breath testing referral centers to ensure the inclusion of those with vast experience in the use and interpretation of breath tests. Third, it was essential to ensure representation from various regions in the US, as well as Mexico and Canada. An email was sent to those meeting these criteria. A total of 17 clinician scientists from North America were invited to participate in the survey and attend the consensus meeting, with 10 able to attend the meeting in person. The half-day meeting was held on 16 May 2015 in Washington.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^115ZGrZ2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Abnormal oroanal transit time (OATT) and visceral hypersensitivity are key pathophysiological factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose nutrient challenge test (LNCT) has been developed to assess the postprandial symptoms and gut microbial fermentation. We aimed to investigate associations between OATT, rectal sensitivity, and LNCT in IBS patients.

- **Methods**: We included 263 IBS patients from two study cohorts, where the link between pathophysiology and symptoms was investigated. During the LNCT, severity of postprandial symptoms was graded, and breath hydrogen/methane concentrations were measured after ingestion of a combined lactulose nutrient drink every 15 minutes for 4 hours. The patients underwent rectal sensitivity (rectal barostat) and OATT (radiopaque markers) investigations. Comorbid conditions (functional dyspepsia, anxiety, depression, and somatization) were assessed with questionnaires.

- **Key results**: After controlling for comorbid conditions, rectal sensitivity was associated with abdominal pain (p < 0.05), and more rapid OATT was associated with higher severity of abdominal discomfort, rumbling, nausea, and urgency (p < 0.05 for all) both pre- and post-prandially. Postprandial nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain changed differently over time depending on OATT (p < 0.05 for all). OATT, but not rectal sensitivity, was associated with hydrogen and methane concentrations (p = 0.002 for both). Trajectories over time of postprandial symptoms and exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations were correlated with different correlations depending on OATT.

### What defines a healthy gut microbiome [^115C44HL]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The production of various gases, such as hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide, is another significant indicator of gut health and microbial composition. These gases are by-products of microbial fermentation processes in the gut. Hydrogen and methane are primarily produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates, with methane production being specifically linked to the activity of methanogenic archaea. Hydrogen sulfide, on the other hand, is produced from the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids by specific bacteria.

The measurement of these gases has been used in clinical settings to diagnose conditions like SIBO and IBS. The rationale for using gas production as a marker is grounded in the fact that specific gas profiles can indicate particular microbial activities and imbalances. For instance, elevated methane levels and methane-producing organisms have been associated with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), while elevated breath levels of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, as well as a higher relative abundance of hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria, have been found in individuals suffering with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D).

The advantages of using gas production as markers include non-invasive breath tests, which are relatively easy to administer and interpret. However, there are limitations, such as the influence of diet, transit time, and individual variability in gas production. Furthermore, interpreting these gases can be complex due to the overlapping symptoms of different GI conditions.

### A combination of rifaximin and neomycin is most effective in treating irritable bowel syndrome patients with methane on lactulose breath test [^114jhTKD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). High credibility.

There is a growing interest in methane and its association with constipation in functional bowel disease. Neomycin-based treatment of methane-positive subjects has resulted in an improvement of constipation. Rifaximin, although superior for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome compared with other antibiotics, seems less effective in methane-positive subjects. In this study, we evaluate three different antibiotic treatments in patients who have a methane-positive breath test: rifaximin only, neomycin only, and the combination of neomycin and rifaximin.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with methane on their lactulose breath test (≥ 3 ppm of methane) who received one of the following antibiotic treatments: 500 mg b.i.d. for 10 days of neomycin alone, 400 mg t.i.d. for 10 days of rifaximin alone, or a combination of both rifaximin and neomycin for 10 days. All patients received antibiotic treatment after their initial consultation at the medical center and had at least one follow-up to evaluate the effects of the treatment. After meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, all charts were evaluated to determine if the subject was a responder to the antibiotic therapy, which included clinical symptom improvement and eradication of methane on their breath test.

- **Results**: Of the subjects receiving the treatment of rifaximin and neomycin (n = 27), 85% had a clinical response, compared with 63% of subjects in the neomycin-only group (n = 8) (P = 0.15) and 56% of subjects in the rifaximin-only group (n = 39) (P = 0.01).

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^11297qob]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath testing (BT) is performed to aid in the diagnosis of many common gastroenterological conditions, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms, carbohydrate maldigestion, and dysfunction or alterations in oro-cecal transit. Presently, in clinical practice, BT is being performed with various substrates, such as glucose, lactulose, fructose, sorbitol, sucrose, and inulin, using variable doses for a range of established and unestablished indications like SIBO, orocecal-transit time assessment, and carbohydrate maldigestion. The number of BTs being ordered by healthcare professionals is rising, including the use of mail-order breath tests. However, the lack of standardization regarding the indications, preparation, performance, and interpretation of BT has led to considerable heterogeneity between different centers and practitioners. In addition, research gaps are widening due to inter-study variability in methodology. A systematic review found 13 case-control studies that used breath testing to diagnose SIBO, and detailed examination of these studies reveals that they used 13 different methodologies to conduct the breath test or interpret the results.

BT relies on the measurement of gases produced in the intestine, which diffuse into the systemic circulation and are expired through the lungs. There are four main sources for intestinal gases: swallowed air and air mixed with food, chemical reactions in the gut, diffusion of gases from the bloodstream, and microbial metabolism. Healthy subjects have an average of about 10.

### The degree of breath methane production in IBS correlates with the severity of constipation [^115LR566]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent work has demonstrated that among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) subjects, methane on lactulose breath test (LBT) is nearly universally associated with constipation predominance. This work has been based on subjective constipation outcomes. In this study, methane is compared to constipation in another population of IBS subjects, with constipation being determined both subjectively and objectively.

- **Methods**: A nested study was conducted in subjects enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. After consent, subjects were asked to complete a stool diary for 7 days, logging all bowel movements and documenting stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Score. After 7 days, subjects rated their symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS) score (0–100 mm) for diarrhea and constipation. They then underwent an LBT to evaluate both methane and hydrogen profiles over 180 minutes. Subjects with methane were compared to those without methane for Bristol Stool Score, stool frequency, as well as VAS scores for diarrhea and constipation. The degree of constipation was then compared to the quantity of methane production on LBT based on area under the curve.

- **Results**: Among 87 subjects, 20 (23.8%) produced methane. IBS subjects with methane had a mean constipation severity of 66.1 ± 36.7 compared to 36.2 ± 30.8 for nonmethane producers (P < 0.001). The opposite was noted for diarrhea (P < 0.01). On LBT, the quantity of methane seen on breath test was directly proportional to the degree of constipation.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^113YKi44]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

The study examines the association between oral-anal transit time (OATT), exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations, and rectal sensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients.

- **Exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations and OATT associations**: OATT was negatively associated with exhaled hydrogen, indicating that a more rapid OATT was linked to higher exhaled hydrogen concentrations. The hydrogen levels also vary over time depending on OATT (OATT: β = −0.11 [−0.18, −0.04], p < 0.01; Time: F = 17.1, p < 0.001; Time‐by‐OATT interaction effect: F = 4.2, p < 0.05). Conversely, OATT was positively associated with exhaled methane, meaning that a slower OATT correlated with higher methane concentrations (OATT: β = 0.08 [0.03, 0.13], p < 0.01; Time: F = 11.8, p < 0.001; Time‐by‐OATT interaction effect: F = 0.16, p = 0.69). The curves of hydrogen and methane generally increased over time, with hydrogen curves shifted upwards for rapid OATT, and methane curves shifted upwards for slower OATT.

- **Rectal sensitivity associations**: There were no significant associations observed between rectal sensitivity and either hydrogen (Rectal sensitivity: β = < 0.01 [−0.01, 0.01], p = 0.17; Time: F = 50.9, p < 0.001; Time‐by‐Rectal sensitivity interaction effect: F = 0.88, p = 0.59) or methane (Rectal sensitivity: β = < 0.01 [−0.01, 0.01], p = 0.34; Time: F = 27.4, p < 0.001; Time‐by‐Rectal sensitivity interaction effect: F = 0.97, p = 0.49).

The presented curves (Figure 3) illustrate that associations between OATT and breath hydrogen and methane concentrations are depicted as estimated marginal means with standard error of the mean.

### Metabolic effects of eradicating breath methane using antibiotics in prediabetic subjects with obesity [^112EuAZL]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Methanogens colonizing the human gut produce methane and influence host metabolism. This study examined metabolic parameters in methane-producing subjects before and after antibiotic treatment.

- **Methods**: Eleven prediabetic methane-positive subjects (9F, 2M) with obesity (BMI 35.17 ± 7.71 kg/m²) aged 47 ± 9 years were recruited. Subjects underwent breath testing, symptom questionnaire, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), lipid profile, stool Methanobrevibacter smithii levels, gastric transit, and energy utilization analyses. After a 10-day antibiotic therapy (neomycin 500 mg BID/rifaximin 550 mg TID), all testing was repeated.

- **Results**: Baseline stool M. smithii levels correlated with breath methane (R = 0.7, P = 0.05). Eight subjects (73%) eradicated breath methane and showed reduced stool M. smithii (P = 0.16). After therapy, methane-eradicated subjects showed significant improvements in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.028), total cholesterol (P = 0.01), and insulin levels on OGTT (P = 0.05 at 120 minutes), lower blood glucose levels on OGTT (P = 0.054 at 90 minutes), significant reductions in bloating (P = 0.018) and straining (P = 0.059), and a trend toward lower stool dry weight. No changes were detected in gastric emptying time or energy harvest.

- **Conclusions**: Breath methane eradication and M. smithii reduction are associated with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL, and insulin levels and with lower glucose levels in prediabetic subjects with obesity. The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation.

### Diagnostic reliability of glucose and lactulose breath tests: Insights from a test-retest study in healthy adults [^113ESNYi]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) are commonly diagnosed using glucose (GBT) and lactulose (LBT) breath tests. Despite their widespread use, concerns remain regarding their reproducibility and reliability, especially in asymptomatic individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic variability and test-retest reliability of GBT and LBT in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective observational diagnostic concordance study in 40 healthy adults. Participants underwent both GBT (75g glucose) and LBT (10g lactulose) with hydrogen (H₂) and methane (CH₄) measured at 15-minute intervals. Testing was repeated 2 weeks later. A positive result was defined as an increase of ≥ 20 ppm in H₂ or CH₄ level of ≥ 10 ppm at any point during the breath testing. Symptoms were recorded during the tests. Agreement and reliability were assessed using kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), respectively.

- **Results**: At baseline, 15.0% of participants had a positive GBT, and 60.0% had a positive LBT, predominantly for H₂. In the retest, 10.0% remained GBT-positive, whereas LBT results were consistent (60.0%). ICC for GBT was 0.56 for H₂ and 0.87 for CH₄; for LBT, ICCs were 0.88 and 0.85, respectively. Symptoms occurred more frequently with LBT, and the median time to symptom onset (75 min) coincided with physiological orocecal transit.

- **Conclusions**: GBT and LBT showed good test-retest reliability in healthy individuals. However, the high rate of positive LBT results and symptom occurrence suggests potential challenges in interpreting these tests.

### Ability of the normal human small intestine to absorb fructose: Evaluation by breath testing [^113wUrFx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Fructose consumption is increasing, and its malabsorption causes common gastrointestinal symptoms. Because its absorption capacity is poorly understood, there is no standard method of assessing fructose absorption. We performed a dose-response study of fructose absorption in healthy subjects to develop a breath test to distinguish normal from abnormal fructose absorption capacity.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, 20 healthy subjects received 10% solutions of 15, 25, and 50 g of fructose and a 33% solution of 50-g fructose on four separate days at weekly intervals. Breath samples were assessed for hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) during a period of 5 hours, and symptoms were recorded.

- **Results**: No subject tested positive with 15 g. Two (10%) tested positive with 25 g fructose but were asymptomatic. Sixteen (80%) tested positive with 50 g (10% solution), and 11 (55%) had symptoms. Breath H2 was elevated in 13 (65%), CH4 in 1 (5%), and both in 2 (10%). Twelve (60%) tested positive with 50 g (33% solution), and 9 (45%) experienced symptoms. The area under the curve for H2 and CH4 was higher (P < .01) with 50 g compared with lower doses. There were no gender differences.

- **Conclusions**: Healthy subjects have the capacity to absorb up to 25 g fructose, whereas many exhibit malabsorption and intolerance with 50 g fructose. Hence, we recommend 25 g as the dose for testing subjects with suspected fructose malabsorption. Breath samples measured for H2 and CH4 concentration at 30-minute intervals and for 3 hours will detect most subjects with fructose malabsorption.

### Breath testing to evaluate lactose intolerance in irritable bowel syndrome correlates with lactulose testing and may not reflect true lactose malabsorption [^116wamXE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

An increased prevalence of lactose intolerance is seen in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Recently, we demonstrated a high prevalence of abnormal lactulose breath test results in IBS, suggesting bacterial overgrowth. Because symptoms of lactose intolerance result from bacterial fermentation, the purpose of this study was to determine whether an abnormal lactose breath test is reflective of malabsorption or early presentation to bacteria.

- **Methods**: Subjects with diarrhea-predominant IBS were enrolled. On day 1, subjects underwent a lactulose breath test after an overnight fast. Within one week, subjects returned, fasting for a lactose breath test with simultaneous blood glucose measurements every 15 minutes to complete a lactose tolerance test (LTT). Symptoms were evaluated three hours after lactose administration.

- **Results**: Twenty subjects completed the study. One subject inadvertently received dextrose intravenously and was excluded. Of the remaining 19 subjects, three (16%) had an abnormal LTT suggesting malabsorption. Overall, 10 subjects (53%) had an abnormal lactose breath test, 14 (74%) had an abnormal lactulose breath test, and 11 (58%) had symptoms after lactose administration. The agreement with symptoms was moderate (kappa = 0.47) and fair (kappa = 0.24) when compared to the lactose breath test and LTT, respectively. There was a fair correlation between the lactose breath test and LTT (kappa = 0.29). However, lactose breath test hydrogen levels greater than 166 ppm were universally predictive of an abnormal LTT. Finally, a significant correlation was seen between the hydrogen levels of different tests.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^113pBjn9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

A previous study from our group found that OATT and GI symptoms were poorly correlated in a large IBS population. Our findings seem to contradict this, as associations were observed between several GI symptoms and OATT. However, there are major differences between the two studies regarding symptom reports. In the previous study, solely three symptoms were investigated daily for 7 days, whereas in this study, eight symptoms were assessed at regular time intervals. Furthermore, we assessed symptoms following a provocative test meal, including a non-absorbable carbohydrate, where it can be expected that symptoms are induced in IBS. Several GI symptoms were associated with OATT, as well as different postprandial symptom responses over time depending on OATT. These associations indicate that different underlying mechanisms might be involved in symptom generation in IBS patients with different transit times. Our results indicate that GI motility could play a central role in the generation of GI symptoms, and that treatments targeting transit time could improve pre- and postprandial symptoms.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the gut microbiota in IBS, and they produce intestinal gases through carbohydrate fermentation, which are proposed to be involved in symptom generation. Studies in IBS populations have found that methane production was associated with hard stools, slower transit, and constipation in general. Our results are in line with this, as we showed that patients with slower OATT have higher concentrations of methane than patients with more rapid OATT.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113mASEr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests (BTs) are important for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, standardization is lacking regarding indications for testing, test methodology, and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting of experts was convened to develop guidelines for clinicians and research.

Pre-meeting survey questions encompassing five domains — indications, preparation, performance, interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps — were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, and 10 attended a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were finalized and voted on anonymously by a working group of specialists.

Consensus was reached on 26 statements encompassing all five domains. Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose, and lactose BT were 10, 75, 25, and 25g, respectively. Glucose and lactulose BTs remain the least invasive alternatives to diagnose SIBO. BT is useful in the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluation of bloating/gas but not in the assessment of oro-cecal transit. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. by 90 minutes during glucose or lactulose BT for SIBO was considered positive. Methane levels ≥ 10 p.p.m. were considered methane-positive. SIBO should be excluded prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to avoid false positives. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline during BT was considered positive for maldigestion.

BT is a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic test in the evaluation of…

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113pHv8r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Erdogan et al. assessed the optimal cut-off of glucose breath testing (75 g glucose) for the detection of SIBO and correlated this with duodenal aspirates and culture (both at ≥ 10³ and ≥ 10⁵ c.f.u./ml) in 150 patients. The sensitivity of the breath test was lower at a 20 p.p.m. vs. 12 p.p.m. rise of H₂, at both ≥ 10³ (32% vs. 42%) and ≥ 10⁵ c.f.u./ml (48% vs. 64%) culture growth levels. Specificity was higher at both ≥ 10³ (90% vs. 81%) and ≥ 10⁵ c.f.u./ml (86% vs. 78%) culture growth.

George et al. compared the utility of a hydrogen rise of 20 p.p.m. above baseline by 90 minutes after ingestion of lactulose vs. dual hydrogen peaks (first peak of 10 p.p.m. above baseline before the second peak of 20 p.p.m.) in 740 patients with gastroparesis. Only the hydrogen rise of 20 p.p.m. above baseline was correlated with the severity of bloating, postprandial fullness, and early satiety. Recently, the assessment of over 15,000 lactulose breath tests shows that median and mean gas production levels do not elicit a double peak.

We suggest using a rise of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline in hydrogen to diagnose SIBO. On the basis of evidence, a double peak should not be used to diagnose SIBO and has no validity.

### Comparative analysis of hydrogen breath test devices for the diagnosis of carbohydrate malabsorption: Fructose tests lack reliability [^116WM3JK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Hydrogen breath tests are commonly used to diagnose lactose and fructose malabsorption. While lactose breath tests are reliable, the utility of fructose tests is debated due to inconsistent results. This study aimed to compare the performance of two hydrogen breath test devices — handheld and stationary — in diagnosing lactose and fructose malabsorption in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: Seventy-eight lactose and 53 fructose breath tests were performed in children (mean age: 11.4 ± 3.1 years) using both a handheld electrochemical detector and a stationary gas chromatograph. Malabsorption was defined as a rise in hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm over baseline. Device performance was compared using Pearson correlation, McNemar's test, and Bland-Altman analysis.

- **Results**: For lactose, 28 (35.9%) tested positive with the handheld device and 31 (39.7%) with the stationary device, showing 93.6% agreement (P = 0.38). For fructose, 16 (30.2%) tested positive with the handheld device and 26 (49.1%) with the stationary device, with only 81.1% agreement (P = 0.002). McNemar's test for marginal homogeneity suggested equivalence of the two instruments for the lactose breath tests (P = 0.38), but there was strong evidence of inequality between the two instruments for the fructose breath tests (P = 0.002). Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias toward higher hydrogen levels with the stationary device, especially in fructose tests.

- **Conclusion**: Lactose breath tests were reliable across both devices, but significant discrepancies in fructose testing were noted, particularly higher hydrogen levels with the stationary device.

### AGA clinical practice update on small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Expert review [^114eRfd5]. Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Thanks to ready access to hydrogen breath testing, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is now commonly diagnosed among individuals presenting with a variety of gastrointestinal and even nongastrointestinal symptoms and is increasingly implicated in the media in the causation of a diverse array of disorders. Its definition, however, remains controversial and its true prevalence undefined. The purpose of this review was to provide a historical background to the concept of SIBO, critically review concepts of SIBO — including symptomatology, pathophysiology, clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment — define unanswered questions, and provide a road map toward their resolution.

- **Methods**: Best practice advice statements were developed following discussion by the three authors. Two authors each developed text around certain best practice advice based on a review of available literature. All three authors reviewed the complete draft and after discussion, redrafting, and further review and revision, all of the authors agreed on a final draft.

- **Best practice advice 1**: The definition of SIBO as a clinical entity lacks precision and consistency; it is generally applied to a clinical disorder where symptoms, clinical signs, and/or laboratory abnormalities are attributed to changes in the numbers of bacteria or in the composition of the bacterial population in the small intestine.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Symptoms traditionally linked to SIBO include bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain/discomfort. Steatorrhea may be seen.

### Breath methane excretion is not an accurate marker of colonic methane production in irritable bowel syndrome [^117T7pKJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The role of colonic methane production in functional bowel disorders remains uncertain. In small samples of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, it has been shown that methane breath excretion correlates with clinical presentation and delayed gastrointestinal transit time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between intestinal production and breath excretion of CH4 and to correlate CH4 production with the presence and severity of symptoms in a large cohort of IBS patients and a group of healthy volunteers.

A group of 103 IBS patients and 28 healthy volunteers were enrolled. The presence and severity of symptoms and gastrointestinal transit time were evaluated in all subjects, who underwent breath H2/CH4 measurement for 7 hours after lactulose administration to identify breath excretors of these gases. H2 and CH4 were also measured in rectal samples to identify colonic producers. Cumulative H2 and CH4 excretion and production were evaluated using the area under the time-concentration curve calculation (AUC).

In IBS patients, CH4 was detected in rectal samples in 48 patients (47%), but only 27 of them (26% of the 103 enrolled patients) excreted this gas via breath. In CH4 producers, the prevalence and severity of symptoms and gastrointestinal transit time were not significantly different compared to non-producers. IBS subtypes were homogeneously represented in CH4 producers and non-producers. Healthy volunteers showed a significantly lower prevalence of CH4 excretion compared with IBS patients.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116vpBFT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

SIBO is a condition in which the small bowel is colonized by excessive numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microbes that are normally found in the large intestine. Aspiration of small bowel fluid, followed by culture and bacterial count, is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of SIBO. Unlike breath testing, small bowel aspiration is invasive, time-consuming, and costly.

In addition, small bowel aspiration has multiple shortcomings. Mid and distal segments of the small bowel are beyond the reach of regular endoscopes; therefore, proximal small bowel aspirates may be falsely negative. Although aseptic techniques for small bowel aspirates have been described, contamination with oral and esophageal flora may lead to a significant number of false-positive results. Quantitative PCR studies have been used to diagnose SIBO with promising results; however, such techniques are not readily available for clinical practice.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^113fTLMd]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). High credibility.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can be associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms, including abdominal pain, malnutrition, diverticular disease, and steatorrhea. Other potential associations include small bowel stricture, positive methane breath test results, anemia, rosacea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, positive xylose breath test results, diarrhea, and radiation enteritis. Additionally, a positive hydrogen breath test, systemic sclerosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, fatigue, gastrointestinal fistula, flatulence, use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), small bowel surgery, and weight loss can also be linked to this condition.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^111BrDtj]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Breath tests have been an attractive alternative to culture of small bowel aspirates for many years. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are generally poor.

Hydrogen breath testing is based on the ability of some bacteria to ferment carbohydrates, with an end product of hydrogen, which is not produced by mammalian cells. It was originally proposed that breath testing following a carbohydrate load resulted in a double peak due to metabolism by small bowel bacteria, followed by a more prolonged peak due to metabolism by colonic bacteria. The reproducibility of this double peak pattern has been challenged, as the appearance of the initial peak is more likely due to fermentation by oropharyngeal flora or variation in orocaecal transit times and fermentation of carbohydrate in the caecum. In addition, a false negative result may occur in the 3–25% of individuals whose bacterial flora are not hydrogen producers. This may in part be due to variations in the particular species of bacteria involved in small bowel colonisation as, for example, none of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci spp. Serratia, or Pseudomonas spp. produce hydrogen.

Because of these problems, it is unsurprising that several studies have now shown the sensitivity and specificity of hydrogen breath tests to be low. Recently, Erdogan et al. found that glucose breath testing had a sensitivity of less than 50% compared with duodenal aspirate, regardless of whether methane measurement was added to hydrogen. Both the positive and negative predictive values for breath testing were

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^115UWt8f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath testing remains a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic tool in gastroenterology. Using an evidence-based approach, consensus was reached on 26 statements providing practical guidance regarding the indications, preparation, performance, and interpretation of breath testing in clinical practice and research. Furthermore, gaps in knowledge are identified for future research directives.

Compared to previous guidelines, these consensus statements are updated based on the most recent literature. They provide detailed recommendations and clarity on drug regimens prior to breath testing, doses of substrates, established indications, limitations, and interpretation of the results based on both hydrogen and methane gases. While unanswered questions remain and there are challenges that need further clarification, it is hoped that these consensus statements create uniformity in the use of breath testing and thus improve and optimize patient care.

### Impact of oral-cecal transit time on the interpretation of lactulose breath tests after RYGB: a personalized approach to the diagnosis of SIBO [^115SDa8G]. Obesity Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Traditionally, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is diagnosed when there is an early peak in breath hydrogen or methane. Given the unclear intestinal transit time in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients, it is unknown if the traditional approach to diagnosing SIBO is adequate in this patient population.

- **Aim**: To assess oral-cecal transit time (OCTT) and its impact on the interpretation of breath tests in the diagnosis of SIBO in patients with RYGB.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on RYGB patients who underwent testing for SIBO using lactulose breath test (LBT) with or without small bowel follow-through (SBFT) to assess OCTT. Outcomes of SIBO tests based on LBT alone versus LBT with OCTT were compared using a chi-squared test.

- **Results**: Sixty-two of the 151 RYGB patients who underwent LBT underwent an additional SBFT to assess OCTT. Median OCTT was 60 min. Of these, 59.7% had OCTT shorter than 90 min. Based on LBT alone, 36/62 patients (58.1%) were classified as positive for SIBO. When LBT results were combined with OCTT, 26/36 patients (72.2%) had hydrogen or methane rise within OCTT, suggesting a 27.8% false positive rate. Patients with true positive SIBO based on LBT and OCTT had a higher response rate to antibiotics compared to those with false positive SIBO (78.3% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.03).

- **Conclusion**: A personalized approach of combining LBT with SBFT to assess OCTT may improve the accuracy of SIBO testing and enhance clinical outcomes in patients with RYGB.

### Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests [^1166yH6q]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Hydrogen breath tests are widely used to explore the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been proposed to be of great importance for symptoms in, for instance, irritable bowel syndrome. However, conclusions drawn from these studies are highly controversial, and divergent results exist. There is also extensive use of these tests in clinical practice, with difficulties regarding interpretation and sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the occasional abuse of these tests can be turned into proper clinical and scientific use in the future.

### Associations between postprandial symptoms, hydrogen and methane production, and transit time in irritable bowel syndrome [^113WbTCw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Abnormal oroanal transit time (OATT) and visceral hypersensitivity are key pathophysiological factors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The lactulose nutrient challenge test (LNCT) has been developed to assess the postprandial symptoms and gut microbial fermentation. We aimed to investigate associations between OATT, rectal sensitivity, and LNCT in IBS patients.

We included 263 IBS patients from two study cohorts, where the link between pathophysiology and symptoms was investigated. During the LNCT, the severity of postprandial symptoms was graded, and breath hydrogen/methane concentrations were measured after the ingestion of a combined lactulose nutrient drink every 15 minutes for four hours. The patients underwent rectal sensitivity (rectal barostat) and OATT (radiopaque markers) investigations. Comorbid conditions, including functional dyspepsia, anxiety, depression, and somatization, were assessed with questionnaires.

- **Key results**: After controlling for comorbid conditions, rectal sensitivity was associated with abdominal pain (p < 0.05), and more rapid OATT was associated with higher severity of abdominal discomfort, rumbling, nausea, and urgency (p < 0.05 for all) both pre‐ and post‐prandially. Postprandial nausea, urgency, and abdominal pain changed differently over time depending on OATT (p < 0.05 for all). OATT, but not rectal sensitivity, was associated with hydrogen and methane concentrations (p = 0.002 for both). Trajectories over time of postprandial symptoms and exhaled hydrogen/methane concentrations were correlated with different correlations depending on OATT.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113Eq2pB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests are also used in the diagnosis of a variety of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes. The lactose breath test is performed to diagnose lactose maldigestion/intolerance, which may result from lactase deficiency. Lactose, which is exclusively found in dairy products, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, and the brush border enzyme lactase phlorizin hydrolase is required for its digestion.

Lactase deficiency can be primary or secondary (i.e. acquired lactase deficiency due to damage to or absence of the brush border). There is no gold standard test to diagnose lactose maldigestion, and large-scale data are lacking to compare the degree of agreement of the currently available tests. Jejunal biopsies, followed by a lactase activity assay, are invasive and unreliable due to patchy lactase distribution in the brush border. Genetic testing only detects primary lactase deficiency, and tests of blood glucose levels following lactose ingestion depend on glucose metabolism and are not reliable.

One limitation of the lactose breath test is false negative results in individuals with fixed hydrogen and non-methane production; however, these only constitute 3.4% of breath tests. As mentioned above, false positive results can also occur.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^1114a5LL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to the aforementioned consensus statements, the committee identified several gaps in knowledge and technology related to breath testing:

- **Lack of standard tests**: There is no validated gold standard test for diagnosing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Additionally, techniques capable of acquiring sterile and anaerobic aspirates from the various segments of the small bowel are lacking.

- **Integration and optimization**: Integration of deep sequencing techniques is needed for further assessment of bacterial diversity in SIBO patients. The optimal doses of lactose for breath testing, as well as the optimal test duration, require clarification. Similarly, determination of various substrate doses in the pediatric population is necessary.

- **Demographic and treatment considerations**: It is important to assess breath testing results in relation to race, ethnicity, age, and gender. Additionally, research is needed to determine the effects of pre/probiotics, absorbable and non-absorbable antibiotics on hydrogen and methane production during breath testing.

- **Specific concerns and methodologies**: Investigations should focus on the role of breath testing in assessing SIBO after therapy, and the cause of the non-methane fixed-hydrogen pattern (i.e. flatline). The significance of elevated baseline hydrogen levels despite fasting and adherence to pre-test diets needs further research. Determination of the optimal time interval for breath test sampling is also critical.

- **Global and technological development**: Studies should explore whether different diets in various parts of the world can affect breath test results, and if a universal standardized pre-breath test diet is necessary. Development of gas chromatographers capable of detecting hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in exhaled air is considered important for expanding breath testing's potential.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^114iWzpP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

We suggest that the correct dose of lactulose for breath testing is 10 g, followed by one cup of water. We also suggest that the correct dose of glucose for breath testing is 75 g, mixed with or followed by one cup of water. For lactose breath testing, a dose of 25 g mixed with or followed by one cup of water is recommended. Similarly, the correct dose of fructose for breath testing is 25 g, mixed with or followed by one cup of water. It is suggested that fructose and lactose breath testing should be performed for at least 3 hours. Additionally, the presence of bacterial overgrowth should be ruled out before performing lactose or fructose breath testing. It is recommended that hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide should all be measured simultaneously during breath testing.

When performing lactulose breath tests for the determination of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), the majority of studies have used a dose of 10 g. Higher doses pose the risk of speeding intestinal transit time, which may affect test data.

Regarding glucose breath testing, variable doses of 50 g and 75–100 g have been used. Comparative studies using 50 g, 75 g, or 100 g have not been performed. Since a 75 g dose is used for oral glucose testing in diabetics, as recommended by the World Health Organization, from a practical standpoint, stocking 75 g doses is less expensive, easier to obtain for breath test centers, and could provide an adequate amount of carbohydrate substrate.

In subjects with lactose and fructose intolerance, unabsorbed substrate is fermented by colonic bacteria.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^117JkfBc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Distinct topics of discussion included indications, preparation, performance, interpretations of results, and future directions in breath testing. Based on the results of these discussions, a series of draft consensus statements was compiled and sent to committee members for online voting using SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA) with revisions as necessary. Using a modified Delphi process, group members anonymously voted on their level of agreement with each statement on a scale of 1–3 (disagree, uncertain, and agree, respectively).

A statement was accepted if more than 70% of participants voted 3 (agree), and it was rejected if more than 50% of participants voted 1 (disagree). If neither of these criteria was met, it was stated that "a firm position statement could not be reached due to lack of conclusive data". The strength of recommendation for each statement was assigned by the consensus group as either strong ("we recommend") or weak ("we suggest"). The strength of each statement was based on resource and cost benefit, patients' values, risk/benefit balance, and quality of evidence.

The quality of evidence for each consensus statement was classified as high (⊕⊕⊕⊕), moderate (⊕⊕⊕), low (⊕⊕⊙), or very low (⊕⊙⊙⊙), based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. The manuscript was circulated to all group members for review, revisions, and approval.

### Combined oro-caecal scintigraphy and lactulose hydrogen breath testing demonstrate that breath testing detects oro-caecal transit, not small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with IBS [^116RKziw]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

The study aims to address the validity of the lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT), which recent studies suggest indicates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The test's reliability is questioned, as it may reflect oro-caecal transit changes. To investigate, researchers combined oro-caecal scintigraphy with LHBT in 40 IBS patients, diagnosed by Rome II criteria, to determine if increases in hydrogen levels are due to the test meal reaching the caecum.

Patients ingested a test meal with (⁹⁹m)Tc and 10 g lactulose. Simultaneous scintigraphic scanning and breath hydrogen level measurements were taken every 10 minutes over 3 hours. The LHBT was deemed positive if H₂ levels rose more than 20 ppm above baseline within 90 and/or 180 minutes. SIBO was excluded if 5% or more of the test meal reached the caecum when the LHBT was positive.

Results showed that 63% of patients had an abnormal LHBT at 180 minutes and 35% at 90 minutes. The oro-caecal transit time from scintigraphic scanning ranged from 10 to 220 minutes, correlating with different IBS sub-types. At the time of the H₂ increase, 88% of cases (22/25) had a (⁹⁹m)Tc accumulation of at least 5% in the caecum.

The study concludes that variations in oro-caecal transit time, rather than the presence of SIBO, explain abnormal H₂ rises in the LHBT for IBS patients.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116WFTh7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The consensus statements achieved for each of the five broad domains are summarized below:

- **Preparation of patients for breath testing**: We recommend that antibiotics should be avoided for 4 weeks prior to the breath test. A firm position statement could not be reached due to a lack of conclusive data on stopping or continuing probiotics or prebiotics prior to breath testing. If tolerated by the patient, we suggest that promotility drugs and laxatives should be stopped at least one week prior to breath testing. Fermentable foods such as complex carbohydrates should be avoided on the day prior to the breath testing. We suggest that the fasting period prior to breath testing should be 8–12 hours. We recommend that smoking should be avoided on the day of the breath testing. Physical activity should be limited during breath testing. It is suggested that it is not necessary to stop proton pump inhibitors prior to breath testing.

Regarding the preparation for breath testing, the use of antibiotics has been clearly shown to alter the H₂ and CH₄ composition of the exhaled breath. Although no clear data exist, a 4-week gap between the cessation of antibiotic therapy and performance of the test is generally recommended. While the effect of antibiotics on hydrogen and methane production is well understood, the extent of this effect based on the bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics is not well understood. This timeline between breath testing and antibiotic use may depend on the purpose for which the test is being performed.

### Evaluation of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^113aTFxi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were threefold: 1) to document the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; 2) to determine the possible influence of gastric bacterial overgrowth and gastroduodenal pH on the efficacy of this test; and 3) to investigate whether reliability is limited by an inability of small intestinal luminal flora to ferment rice or its product of hydrolysis, maltose.

Methods involved investigating twenty adult subjects with microbiological culture of proximal small intestinal aspirate and a 3-g/kg rice breath hydrogen test. Gastroduodenal pH, the presence or absence of gastric bacterial overgrowth, and the in vitro capability of small intestinal luminal flora to ferment rice and maltose, its product of hydrolysis, were determined.

Results showed that the sensitivity of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was 33% and remained low even when subjects with small intestinal overgrowth with oropharyngeal-type (38%) and colonic-type flora (20%), and those with small intestinal and gastric bacterial overgrowth (40%), were considered separately. Sensitivity remained suboptimal despite favorable gastroduodenal luminal pH and documented ability of bacterial isolates to ferment rice and maltose in vitro. The specificity of the rice breath hydrogen test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy were 75%, 63%, and 65%, respectively.

Conclusions regarding the clinical value of the rice breath hydrogen test were not fully detailed due to incomplete text.

### Hydrogen breath test with low-dose rice flour for assessment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^113iHvV6]. Pancreas (2004). Low credibility.

The hydrogen (H2) breath test is widely used in the assessment of carbohydrate malabsorption. Severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency markedly diminishes pancreatic amylase production and results in malabsorption of complex carbohydrates. Thus, the H2 breath test with low-dose rice flour starch was tested to determine its value in detecting exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by comparison with a direct measurement of pancreatic function.

- **Methods**: Ten patients with clinically suspected pancreatic insufficiency, confirmed with a duodenal perfusion technique and measurement of trypsin and lipase output after cerulein stimulation, were included. An H2-rice flour breath test was performed by orally administering 30 g of rice flour. End-alveolar breath samples were obtained before rice load and at 30-minute intervals thereafter for the next 5 hours.

- **Results**: The results are expressed as median (percentile 25–75). Patients included 8 men and 2 women with moderate to severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, or cystic fibrosis. Stimulated duodenal output of lipase and trypsin was abnormally low in all patients (median release, 1.7; range, 0.5–4.5 and 0.8; range, 0.1–11.3 KU/h, respectively). Basal H2 excretion was 9 ppm (range, 7–17) and delta increase over basal H2 excretion was 4 ppm (range, 1–6). Correlation between H2-rice breath test and basal or stimulated duodenal output of lipase and trypsin was not significant.

- **Conclusion**: In exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, an oral load of 30 g rice flour slightly raises H2 excretion.

### Can symptoms and medical history predict outcomes for hydrogen and methane breath testing [^112YcNQ1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Hydrogen and methane breath testing (HMBT) is used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO). There are limited data on whether symptoms and medical history can predict outcomes on lactulose HMBT.

- **Methods**: A large survey-based study was conducted with 731 subjects who completed lactulose HMBT at a single tertiary centre in the UK. The 32-item survey included questions relating to symptoms and medical history. Survey items were statistically analyzed to determine associations with SIBO, IMO, or breath gas production using Fisher's exact tests and regression models. SIBO was determined by a rise of ≥ 20 ppm in breath hydrogen from baseline within 90 minutes, and IMO by the presence of ≥ 10 ppm methane in any breath sample.

- **Results**: Abdominal pain (p = 0.022), excessive belching (p = 0.041), and regurgitation (p = 0.034) were associated with SIBO. Also, daily abdominal pain with diarrhea (p = 0.035) and abdominal pain or discomfort immediately after eating (OR 2.20 [95% CI: 1.29, 3.79]) were noted. Patients reporting at least one skin condition were more likely to test positive for SIBO, with a trend towards significance for eczema (p = 0.051) and rosacea (p = 0.067). IMO was associated with constipation (p < 0.001) and with fatty or greasy stools that tend to float (p < 0.001).

- **Discussion**: This large questionnaire study demonstrated that IBS-like symptoms, refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, and skin conditions are associated with outcomes on HMBT. These findings support the use of HMBT in accordance with patient symptom profiles.

### Does a glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test detect bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum [^115TGHER]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Direct diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) requires the collection and culture of fluid from the jejunal lumen, with a finding of over 10⁵ viable bacteria per mL. More often, SIBO is diagnosed indirectly, using a non-invasive test of the exhaled hydrogen and methane generated by microbial fermentation when ingested glucose reaches the jejunum. Our objective was to determine how well this breath test detects chronic overgrowth of jejunal bacteria that is unrelated to gastrointestinal surgery.

- **Methods**: Eighteen patients reporting symptoms consistent with SIBO received a glucose breath test. On a later day, the jejunal lumen was sampled via aspiration during enteroscopy. Jejunal aspirates were cultured on aerobic and anaerobic media. DNA was extracted from the same samples and analyzed by quantitative pan-bacterial PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal rRNA genes, which provided a culture-independent bacterial cell count.

- **Key results**: Combined bacterial colony counts ranged from 5.7 × 10³ to 7.9 × 10⁶ CFU/mL. DNA-based yields ranged from 1.5 × 10⁵ to 3.1 × 10⁷ bacterial genomes per mL. Microbial viability ranged from 0.3% to near 100%. We found no significant correlation of glucose breath test results with either the number of bacterial colonies or with the DNA-based bacterial cell counts. Instead, higher signals in the hydrogen-methane breath test were significantly correlated with a lower viability of jejunal bacteria, at a P-value of .014.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: The glucose-based hydrogen and methane breath test is not sensitive to detecting bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116hBVpi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The fructose breath test is performed to diagnose fructose maldigestion/intolerance. In fructose-intolerant subjects, unabsorbed fructose is fermented by colonic bacteria, causing IBS-like symptoms. A well-conducted study has shown that ingesting 25 g of fructose is the appropriate dose for fructose breath testing and symptom correlation. Limitations of the test include false negatives, which can occur in individuals who are fixed hydrogen non-methane producers; and false positives, which can occur in individuals with SIBO. Nucera et al. showed that the number of positive fructose breath tests in IBS patients with positive lactulose tests dropped from 62% to 3% after one week of antibiotic treatment. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of breath testing in sorbitol and fructan intolerance.

IBS-like symptoms are commonly seen in patients with SIBO and carbohydrate maldigestion. However, symptom profiles of these patients are non-specific, and clinical history alone cannot differentiate the underlying cause. In an assessment of 144 subjects with IBS-like symptoms, Jacobs et al. found no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain, bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas among patients with or without SIBO, as proven by aerobic/anaerobic/fungal small bowel cultures. Meta-analyses have documented a wide variety of types of breath tests (i.e. different substrates) as well as considerable variability in the performance and interpretation of these breath tests in IBS patients vs. controls.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^112ZefWN]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

This illustrates a key underlying flaw of breath testing in isolation: that transit time is assumed rather than measured. The result of this assumption is that fast orocaecal transit can confound interpretation of an early hydrogen peak, a circumstance that is more likely after intestinal resection. This issue has been demonstrated in high-quality physiological and clinical studies with both lactulose and glucose.

The methodological problems and performance of hydrogen breath testing mean that it may add little when SBBO is suspected. A positive test will reinforce the clinician's prior view that the cause may be SBBO; a negative test will not exclude the diagnosis as a possibility. It is not clear that such an intermediate investigative step is necessary or of value. It would be reasonable to test for SBBO in patients with diarrhoea and a low to moderate pretest probability of SBBO. However, where the pretest probability is high — for example, in those with anatomical abnormalities such as dilation, diverticulosis, prior small bowel surgery, or pseudo-obstruction — the most practical approach would be to proceed straight to an empirical antibiotic trial.

### Breath methane does not correlate with constipation severity or bloating in patients with constipation [^114DVcrc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

We aimed to study if the breath methane level on glucose breath testing (GBT) was associated with constipation severity and compare methane levels between patients with constipation and diarrhea.

The breath methane level has been associated with constipation and its severity. However, a few recent studies have questioned these associations.

Patients presenting consecutively to a tertiary care gastroenterology motility laboratory for GBT were included. GBT was performed using a 75-g glucose load following a standard institutional protocol. Constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) severity were measured using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS).

In the cohort of 79 constipated patients, there was no significant correlation between baseline or maximum methane levels with the total PAC-SYM score. IBS-SSS or bloating severity did not correlate with baseline or maximum methane levels either. The baseline or maximum methane levels of ≥ 3 and 5 ppm were equally distributed among those with constipation (n = 79) and diarrhea (n = 122). Only baseline methane levels of ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 ppm significantly correlated with constipation (P < 0.001 for both).

We found that constipation and bloating severity did not correlate with methane levels on GBT. In addition, only higher baseline methane levels (≥ 10 and ≥ 20 ppm) significantly correlated with constipation, as baseline methane levels up to 5 ppm were equally common in patients with diarrhea and constipation.

### Breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Should we bother [^1128i6Y7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The hydrogen breath test is based on measuring breath hydrogen levels following the administration of a carbohydrate, most commonly lactulose, to a patient with suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. This test relies on the interaction between the administered carbohydrate and the intestinal bacteria, leading to fermentation and hydrogen production. A positive breath test is indicated by a rise in breath hydrogen before the expected arrival time in the highly microbial cecum. Despite the renewed enthusiasm for breath testing in recent years due to its associations with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, breath testing poses many challenges. This argument against breath testing will describe several pitfalls that complicate the process.

### Scintigraphy demonstrates high rate of false-positive results from glucose breath tests for small bowel bacterial overgrowth [^113KLUiv]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The breath tests for hydrogen and/or methane are employed to detect small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO); however, false-positive results can occur due to clinical conditions that accelerate small bowel transit, leading to the delivery of unabsorbed glucose to the colon. This study investigated the prevalence of false-positive results from glucose breath tests by also evaluating patients using scintigraphy.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, data from glucose breath tests performed with scintigraphy on 139 patients with suspected SBBO at the Medical College of Wisconsin, from January 2003 through July 2013, were reviewed. Breath test results were considered abnormal (positive) if there was an increase in hydrogen or methane by more than 15 parts per million above baseline within 90 minutes. Scintigraphy was employed to determine whether this increase occurred before or after the glucose bolus reached the cecum. Additionally, data from a subset of 45 patients with prior upper gastrointestinal surgery were separately analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty-six patients (33%) exhibited abnormal results from breath tests. Based on scintigraphy findings, 22 of these patients (48%) had false-positive results attributed to colon fermentation of unabsorbed glucose. Colon fermentation was responsible for false-positive results in 65% of patients with prior upper gastrointestinal surgery and in 13% of patients without surgery. Patients with false-positive results due to colonic fermentation exhibited shorter mean oro-cecal transit times (18 minutes) compared to patients with positive breath-test results.

### Evidence-based and emerging diet recommendations for small bowel disorders [^112HDS59]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

To overcome the limitations of the culture-dependent methods for diagnosing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), indirect tests, specifically breath tests, were developed. Quantification of hydrogen and methane gas in breath samples remains the most inexpensive, noninvasive, simple, and widely available test for diagnosing SIBO. Human cells are not capable of producing hydrogen or methane gas, so the presence of these gases in human breath indicates the metabolism of nondigested carbohydrates by gut microbes. Currently, the most used substrates are glucose and lactulose.

The North American Consensus statement on hydrogen and methane breath testing defines a rise over baseline of ≥ 20 parts per million for hydrogen by 90 minutes or a level of ≥ 10 parts per million in methane as a positive result consistent with the diagnosis of SIBO. Because more than one-third of healthy adult subjects are predominantly methane producers, it is important to measure both hydrogen and methane during breath tests. The recent American College of Gastroenterology guidelines have coined the term "intestinal methanogen overgrowth" to emphasize the importance of methane production by methanogens belonging to the domain Archaea, rather than focusing solely on SIBO driven by bacteria. Hydrogen sulphide breath testing may be a potential biomarker for SIBO but requires further validation.

Breath tests do have several limitations. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of breath tests for diagnosing SIBO are poor. Compared with the gold standard of small bowel aspiration and culture, the glucose breath test has a sensitivity of…

### Assessing the colonic microbiome, hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes, transit and breath methane in constipation [^114W78Sg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Differences in the gut microbiota and breath methane production have been observed in chronic constipation, but the relationship between colonic microbiota, transit, and breath tests remains unclear.

- **Methods**: In 25 healthy and 25 constipated females, we evaluated the sigmoid colonic mucosal and fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the abundance of hydrogenogenic FeFe (FeFe-hydA) and hydrogenotrophic (methyl coenzyme M reductase A [mrcA] and dissimilatory sulfite reductase A [dsrA]) genes with real-time qPCR assays, breath hydrogen and methane levels after oral lactulose, and colonic transit with scintigraphy.

- **Key results**: Breath hydrogen and methane were not correlated with constipation, slow colon transit, or with the abundance of corresponding genes. After adjusting for colonic transit, the abundance of FeFe-hydA, dsrA, and mcrA were greater (p < 0.005) in the colonic mucosa, but not stool, of constipated patients. The abundance of the selected functional gene targets also correlated with that of selected taxa. The colonic mucosal abundance of FeFe-hydA, but not mcrA, correlated positively (p < 0.05) with breath methane production, slow colonic transit, and overall microbiome composition. In the colonic mucosa and feces, the abundance of hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes were positively correlated (p < 0.05). Breath methane production was not associated with constipation or colonic transit.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Corroborating our earlier findings with 16S rRNA genes, colonic mucosal but not fecal hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes were more abundant.

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^111J3TNZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D) and constipation-predominant (IBS-C) subtypes. We combined breath testing and stool microbiome sequencing to identify potential microbial drivers of IBS subtypes.

- **Methods**: IBS-C and IBS-D subjects from two randomized controlled trials (NCT03763175 and NCT04557215) were included. Baseline breath carbon dioxide, hydrogen (H₂), methane (CH₄), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) levels were measured by gas chromatography, and baseline stool microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbial metabolic pathways were analyzed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes collection databases.

- **Results**: IBS-C subjects had higher breath CH₄ that correlated with higher gut microbial diversity and higher relative abundance (RA) of stool methanogens, predominantly Methanobrevibacter, as well as higher absolute abundance of Methanobrevibacter smithii in stool. IBS-D subjects had higher breath H₂ that correlated with lower microbial diversity and higher breath H₂S that correlated with higher RA of H₂S-producing bacteria, including Fusobacterium and Desulfovibrio spp. The predominant H₂ producers were different in these distinct microtypes, with higher RA of Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae in IBS-C/CH₄+ (which correlated with Methanobacteriaceae RA) and higher Enterobacteriaceae RA in IBS-D. Finally, microbial metabolic pathway analysis revealed enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules associated with methanogenesis and the biosynthesis of methanogenesis cofactors.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^113didhW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Breath tests (BTs) are crucial for diagnosing carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, there is a lack of standardization regarding indications for testing, test methodology, and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting of experts was convened to develop guidelines for clinicians and researchers.

- **Methods**: Pre-meeting survey questions covering five domains — indications, preparation, performance, interpretation of results, and knowledge gaps — were sent to 17 clinician-scientists, with 10 attending a live meeting. Using an evidence-based approach, 28 statements were finalized and voted on anonymously by a working group of specialists.

- **Results**: Consensus was reached on 26 statements encompassing all five domains. Consensus doses for lactulose, glucose, fructose, and lactose BT were 10g, 75g, 25g, and 25g, respectively. Glucose and lactulose BTs remain the least invasive alternatives for diagnosing SIBO. BT is useful for diagnosing carbohydrate maldigestion, methane-associated constipation, and evaluating bloating/gas but not for assessing oro-cecal transit. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. by 90 minutes during glucose or lactulose BT for SIBO was considered positive. Methane levels ≥ 10 p.p.m. were considered methane-positive. SIBO should be excluded prior to BT for carbohydrate malabsorption to avoid false positives. A rise in hydrogen of ≥ 20 p.p.m. from baseline during BT was considered positive for maldigestion.

Breath testing is a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic test in the evaluation of these gastrointestinal conditions.

### Repeatability and effect of blinding of fructose breath tests in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders [^114EzB2A]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Breath tests are used as measures of sugar intolerance or malabsorption in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), although the repeatability or anticipatory bias has not been adequately studied. We examined the repeatability and anticipatory bias during fructose breath testing using a nocebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over, and double-blind study design.

- **Methods**: Gastrointestinal symptoms and breath concentrations of hydrogen and methane were documented during breath tests with fructose (given open twice and blinded once), water (blind neutral nocebo), and a cyclamate/saccharine sweetener (blind sweet nocebo) on 5 days in patients with FGID. Repeatability of fructose breath tests (16 patients) and differences between open and blinded substrate groups (31 patients) were assessed using thresholds for intolerance and malabsorption, and areas-under-the-curve (AUC) of symptoms and breath gas concentrations.

- **Key results**: Fructose breath tests showed moderate repeatability for intolerance status (absolute agreement 87%, kappa 0.72), but limited repeatability for malabsorber status (absolute agreement 53%, kappa 0.05). Repeatability of AUCs of GI symptoms, hydrogen, and methane breath concentrations was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.70, 0.57, and 0.57, respectively). There were no significant differences between open and blinded fructose breath tests in intolerance or malabsorber status, or in AUCs of GI symptoms, hydrogen, and methane concentrations.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Fructose breath tests showed moderate repeatability.

### Intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders: A Rome Foundation report [^115Abwge]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Breath testing has been used to detect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients by non-invasively detecting hydrogen-producing bacteria or methane-producing archaea within the gut lumen. The breath test is based on the concept that hydrogen gases are produced by colonic bacterial fermentation in response to ingestion of a test sugar; these gases rapidly diffuse into the blood, are excreted by breath, and can be collected and quantified. If SIBO exists, the timing of this fermentation would be altered, but the criteria for abnormal tests lack validity.

- **Lactulose hydrogen breath test**: The lactulose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) predominantly measures small intestinal transit rather than SIBO in IBS patients. The upper schematic shows the ingestion of a test meal with subsequent serial measurement of both H₂ gas, resulting from the fermentation of lactulose by intestinal bacteria, and Tc 99 scanning in the caecum. This latter measurement detects when the test meal has reached the caecum. The stylised drawing below shows a representative result from an IBS patient with serial measurements over time. The Tc 99 had already reached the caecum in large quantities before the H₂ PPM level reached the threshold for an abnormal test. This demonstrates that the increased H₂ production results from fermentation by colonic bacteria, not by abnormal bacteria in the small intestine (i.e. SIBO).

### Methanogens and hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria guide distinct gut microbe profiles and irritable bowel syndrome subtypes [^113m1pJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been poorly understood; however, the gut microbiome seems to play a central role. Breath testing is significant in this regard because neither hydrogen (H2) nor methane (CH4) is produced by human cells. Therefore, increased levels of these gases on the breath indicate increased gut colonization with fermenting bacteria and methanogens, respectively. The gases are absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted through exhaled breath. An early breath testing study highlighted the importance of gut microbes in IBS, and three pivotal trials led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of an antibiotic treatment for IBS-D. Moreover, a higher proportion of patients with IBS-D are H2 positive compared to controls, and patients with a positive baseline H2 breath test are more likely to respond to rifaximin. These data suggest that H2 small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is part of the microbiome story in IBS-D. However, H2 levels do not directly correlate with diarrhea, suggesting that other microbes beyond H2 producers may also play a role in IBS-D.

Methane (CH4) on breath testing, now categorized as intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) rather than SIBO, was linked to IBS-C as early as 2001. CH4 is produced by methanogenic archaea, predominantly Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, and it appears to slow intestinal transit by augmenting segmental smooth muscle contractile activity in the intestinal wall. A more recent study suggested that CH4 acts through effects on enteric neurons rather than directly on muscles, proposing that CH4 should also be considered a gasotransmitter.

### Contributions of the microbial hydrogen economy to colonic homeostasis [^114mEdTf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Colonic gases are among the most tangible features of digestion, yet physicians are typically unable to offer long-term relief from clinical complaints of excessive gas. Studies characterizing colonic gases have linked changes in volume or composition with bowel disorders and shown hydrogen gas (H₂), methane, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide to be by-products of the interplay between H₂-producing fermentative bacteria and H₂ consumers, such as reductive acetogens, methanogenic archaea, and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Clinically, H₂ and methane measured in breath can indicate lactose and glucose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and IBS. Methane levels are increased in patients with constipation or IBS. Hydrogen sulfide is a by-product of H₂ metabolism by SRB, which are ubiquitous in the colonic mucosa. Although higher hydrogen sulfide and SRB levels have been detected in patients with IBD, and to a lesser extent in colorectal cancer, this colonic gas might have beneficial effects. Moreover, H₂ has been shown to have antioxidant properties and, in the healthy colon, physiological H₂ concentrations might protect the mucosa from oxidative insults, whereas an impaired H₂ economy might facilitate inflammation or carcinogenesis. Therefore, standardized breath gas measurements, combined with ever-improving molecular methodologies, could provide novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, or manage numerous colonic disorders.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: The North American consensus [^116LCLPw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In the presence of SIBO, fructose and lactose are prematurely exposed to excessive small intestinal bacterial composition, leading to early fermentation and elevation of exhaled gases. Therefore, performing a lactulose or glucose breath test to rule out SIBO should be considered prior to carbohydrate malabsorption breath testing to minimize false positive results.

All breath testing should incorporate the measurement of CO2 (or O2) to adjust the breath sample for non-alveolar dilution of exhaled air. Concomitant measurement of CH4 is also required. The majority of the methanogenic archaea in the human gut (including M. smithii) utilize H2 in the generation of CH4, potentially impacting H2 measurements. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the gut (including M. smithii) utilize 4 mol of H2 and 1 mol of CO2 to produce each mol of CH4.

It has been suggested that by scavenging H2 produced by neighboring microbes in this manner (the "sink effect"), M. smithii and other hydrogen-utilizing methanogens allow increased polysaccharide fermentation by neighboring microbes. Detection rates of an early rise in H2 production significantly decrease in excess methane producers.

Overall, given the importance of methane in association with GI symptoms and its interaction with hydrogen production, measurement of methane should be integrated into all breath tests. It should be noted that measurement of CH4 could increase the cost of breath testing, as portable gas chromatographs do not measure CH4.
