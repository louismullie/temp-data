## Question

Older man with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, microcytic anemia, positive fecal occult blood, and imaging showing a partially obstructing cecal mass with liver lesions.

A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after noticing increasing fatigue over the past several weeks. He now becomes short of breath after going up 1 flight of stairs. He was previously healthy and has not seen a doctor for several years. He denies any fever or changes to his bowel movements. On exam, his temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 116/76 mmHg, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 14/min. On basic labs, his hemoglobin is found to be 9.6 g/dL and MCV is 75 fL. Fecal blood testing is positive for occult blood. Imaging is notable for a mass in the cecum that is partially obstructing the lumen, as well as several small lesions in the liver. Which of the following structures is most at risk for involvement in this patient's disease?

Answer Choices:
A. Inferior mesenteric vein
B. Inferior rectal vein
C. Right gonadal vein
D. Superior mesenteric vein

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which venous structure is most at risk for involvement in a 65-year-old man with a cecal mass and liver lesions, consistent with colorectal cancer and likely hepatic metastases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location of the cecum and its venous drainage. Then, I should verify the venous drainage of the liver and how colorectal metastases reach the liver. Next, I will compare the provided venous options against the expected drainage pathways. Finally, I will confirm which vessel is most directly and consistently involved in cecal cancer spread and why the alternatives are less likely or incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its implications. A cecal mass with positive fecal occult blood and microcytic anemia strongly suggests colorectal cancer, and the presence of liver lesions raises concern for hematogenous metastases via the portal venous system, which is the classic route for colorectal cancer spread to the liver [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check the anatomy of cecal venous drainage. The cecum is part of the right colon, and its venous blood drains via the ileocolic and right colic veins into the superior mesenteric vein, which then joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein en route to the liver; this is the direct pathway for metastatic emboli to reach the liver from a right-sided colonic primary [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the hepatic portal venous anatomy. The portal vein is formed by the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein, so any tumor emboli entering the superior mesenteric vein from the cecum will be delivered to the liver via the portal circulation, explaining the pattern of liver metastases seen here [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the answer choices against this pathway. The superior mesenteric vein is the direct conduit from the cecum to the portal system and thus is the structure most at risk for tumor embolus involvement in cecal cancer with liver metastases; the inferior mesenteric vein drains the left colon and sigmoid and would not typically carry cecal emboli, the inferior rectal vein is part of the external hemorrhoidal plexus and drains to the systemic circulation rather than the portal system, and the right gonadal vein drains to the inferior vena cava and is not part of the cecal-portal pathway [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for excluding the inferior mesenteric vein. The inferior mesenteric vein collects drainage from the descending and sigmoid colon and rectum and joins the splenic vein; it does not drain the cecum, so cecal tumor emboli would not enter the IMV to reach the liver, making option A incorrect despite its portal affiliation [^notfound].

> I should double-check the inferior rectal vein point. The inferior rectal veins drain to the internal pudendal veins and then to the internal iliac veins, bypassing the portal system entirely; thus, they are not involved in portal venous metastatic spread from colonic primaries, which further supports excluding option B [^notfound].

> Let me consider the right gonadal vein. The right gonadal vein drains into the inferior vena cava, placing it in the systemic venous system rather than the portal venous system; therefore, it is not a route for cecal cancer to metastasize to the liver, making option C incorrect [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most accurate answer is D, the superior mesenteric vein, because it is the direct venous channel from the cecum to the portal circulation and thus the structure most at risk for tumor embolus involvement in cecal cancer with liver metastases; the other options either drain different territories or bypass the portal system entirely [^notfound].

---

The superior mesenteric vein is most at risk for involvement in this patient because the cecum drains directly into the SMV, which then carries tumor emboli to the liver via the portal vein, explaining the liver lesions. The inferior mesenteric vein drains the left colon and is not involved in cecal drainage, while the inferior rectal vein drains to the systemic circulation and the right gonadal vein is not part of the colonic venous drainage pathway.

---

## Anatomical and physiological reasoning

- **Cecal venous drainage**: The cecum is part of the right colon and drains primarily into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) via the ileocolic and right colic veins. This venous pathway directly connects the cecum to the portal circulation, which supplies the liver.

- **Portal venous system**: The SMV merges with the splenic vein to form the portal vein, which delivers blood to the liver. Tumor emboli from the cecum can therefore travel via the SMV to the portal vein and lodge in the liver, causing metastatic lesions.

- **Inferior mesenteric vein (IMV)**: The IMV drains the left colon (descending and sigmoid) and rectum, and joins the splenic vein. It does not drain the cecum, making it less likely to be involved in cecal cancer spread.

- **Inferior rectal vein**: The inferior rectal vein drains the lower rectum and anus into the systemic circulation (internal pudendal vein to internal iliac vein), bypassing the portal system. It is not involved in cecal drainage.

- **Right gonadal vein**: The right gonadal vein drains the testis or ovary into the inferior vena cava and is not part of the colonic venous drainage system.

---

## Clinical implications

- **Metastatic spread**: The presence of liver lesions in this patient strongly suggests hematogenous spread via the portal venous system. The SMV is the primary venous channel through which tumor emboli from the cecum reach the liver.

- **Surgical and oncological considerations**: Understanding venous drainage is critical for surgical planning, oncological resection, and targeted therapies. Involvement of the SMV may influence surgical approaches and the extent of vascular resection required.

---

## Conclusion

The superior mesenteric vein is the structure most at risk for involvement in this patient with a cecal mass and liver lesions, as it is the primary venous drainage route from the cecum to the portal circulation and then to the liver. This anatomical pathway explains the hematogenous spread of tumor emboli to the liver, consistent with the clinical presentation.

Invasive thyroid cancer is often asymptomatic and can take the surgeon and the patient by surprise. Maintenance of a high level of suspicion in patients who present with symptoms, an abnormal examination, recurrent disease, or documented metastatic disease lead the clinician to obtain appropriate cross-sectional imaging that helps to define the full extent of the disease. Specific guidelines are provided for the management of the various structures in the neck that are at risk for involvement by disease extension outside the gland or extracapsular extension outside a lymph node with involvement by metastatic disease. This article reviews the prognosis, diagnosis, management, and implications of invasive thyroid cancer affecting the various structures of the central and lateral compartments of the neck.

### Disease modification and cardiovascular risk reduction: two sides of the same coin? [^a5f642a0]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Inflammatory rheumatic diseases are associated with a substantial increase in accelerated atherosclerosis, with complex interactions between traditional and disease-related risk factors. Therefore, cardiovascular risk reduction should be considered as integral to the control of disease activity in the care plans of patients with RA, SLE and, arguably any chronic inflammatory disease. Shared care structures, already established for the monitoring of DMARDs, could be adapted to communicate and monitor cardiovascular risk reduction objectives. We review the evidence for the efficacy of a range of therapeutic strategies, the majority of which impact on both disease activity and cardiovascular risk. The algorithm proposed here attempts to distil the latest advice from specialist panels at the National Cholesterol Education Program and the British Hypertension Society, as well as incorporating the existing data on SLE and RA patients. The algorithm is structured to minimize clinic time and resources necessary to stratify patients into groups for ROUTINE, SUBSTANTIAL or INTENSIVE risk management; the associated table summarizes optimal therapeutic objectives in each of these groups. The implication of this algorithm is that management of cardiovascular risk should be much more aggressive than is currently the norm in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as RA and SLE. Long-term studies of such interventions are needed to further clarify the benefits of intensive cardiovascular risk management in these patients.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^1b360cac]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a leading cause of morbidity, with a considerable variety of clinical presentation and a wide range of etiological pathogens. Of importance, the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains (i.e. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative bacteria) is increasingly reported in some regions. in this review, we summarize the current clinical approach to patients with ABSSSI.

Recent Findings

Accurate diagnosis and identification of risk factors for MDR pathogens are key determinants for administering appropriate therapy in patients with ABSSSI. In daily clinical practice, this can be critical as there are many features defining the 'high risk patient' including both disease and host-associated risk factors.

Summary

Antibiotic therapy should be based according to the different clinical spectrum of disease belonging to the ABSSSI, on the pathogens most likely to be involved and local resistance. Careful evaluation of antibiotic therapy after 48-72h of initial therapy could help clinicians to early identify patients with treatment failure and to consider an alternative approach. Close monitoring of patients with multiple comorbidities, drug-drug interaction or adverse host factors are also necessary.

### Identifying patients with inflammatory bowel diseases at High vs low risk of complications [^ed3cc112]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

People with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have varying presentations and clinical consequences of their disease. Patients commonly ask about their prognosis, and what this diagnosis means for them. They are asking their clinicians to predict the future. The importance of predicting the course of any disease is to guide patient expectations and to guide treatment decisions. In the past decade the strategy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment has shifted to treat patients earlier in the course of their disease, before irreversible damage occurs. Treatment approaches for disease categorized as mild, moderate or severe has most often been based on a current assessment of symptoms or disease activity without including a longitudinal assessment of a patient's disease course including past disease complications and surgeries. While a patient's current disease activity most typically drives these treatment decisions, optimally, treatment decisions would be made accounting for past disease activity and complications and the predicted future disease course. When developing a treatment plan for an individual patient, the immediate goal is to treat the current disease activity for relief of symptoms, and the long-term goal is to prevent progression of their disease due to complications. Since not all patients will progress to a complicated disease course, it is important to be able to select the right patients for the right therapy. Therefore, developing methods of stratifying patients into low-risk versus high-risk of complications will be an important aspect of treating IBD now and in the future.

### A new approach for cognitive impairment pattern in chronic kidney disease [^c45d9b38]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and neurocognitive disorder (NCD) both increase with age. Cognitive impairment can occur early in CKD, i.e. when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or sometimes even earlier. Regardless of the stage, CKD patients have a higher risk of NCD than patients without CKD; the prevalence of NCD can be as high as 40%, depending on the definition of cognitive impairment. Subtle changes in cognition

may impact healthcare engagement, comprehension, decision-making and treatment compliance.

In a previous study, we showed that a lower eGFR was associated with worse cognitive performance and incident cognitive events, independently of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and depression. However, it remains unclear which cognitive functions are most frequently impaired in patients with CKD. Indeed, NCD can affect one or more of the following domains: attention, memory, executive functions (organization, orientation, planning, abstraction, judgment, self-control and flexibility), instrumental functions (language, gnosis, praxis) and visuospatial functions. These functions are governed by various brain structures. Therefore, cognition is complex and involves several interconnected areas of the brain. NCD can appear in very different forms, depending on the mechanisms and structures affected and the person's medical-social context. The patient's cognitive pattern can help the clinician to determine the cause of the NCD (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal degeneration, etc.).

### Systemic sclerosis [^e0f8d2b6]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a rare and complex autoimmune connective-tissue disease. Once considered an untreatable and unpredictable condition, research advancements have improved our understanding of its disease pathogenesis and clinical phenotypes and expanded our treatment armamentarium. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential, while ongoing efforts to risk stratify patients have a central role in predicting both organ involvement and disease progression. A holistic approach is required when choosing the optimal therapeutic strategy, balancing the side-effect profile with efficacy and tailoring the treatment according to the goals of care of the patient. This Seminar reviews the multiple clinical dimensions of systemic sclerosis, beginning at a precursor very early stage of disease, with a focus on timely early detection of organ involvement. This Seminar also summarises management considerations according to the pathological hallmarks of systemic sclerosis (eg, inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy) and highlights unmet needs and opportunities for future research and discovery.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^53712fef]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Neck dissection — classification, indications, and level selection are described as follows: Cervical lymph node dissections are classified as either comprehensive or selective, and a comprehensive neck dissection removes all lymph node groups that would be included in a classic radical neck dissection. Depending on the site, selective neck dissection is often recommended for N0 disease. For oral cavity primaries, a selective neck dissection is recommended that includes nodes above the omohyoid muscle (levels I–III and sometimes the superior parts of level IV); for pharynx and larynx primaries, a selective neck dissection is recommended that includes levels II to IV and level V when appropriate. In SCCHN with no clinical nodal involvement, nodal metastasis beyond the confines of an appropriate selective neck dissection occurs < 10% of the time. The chief role of selective neck dissections is to determine which patients are candidates for possible adjuvant therapy (ie, systemic therapy/RT or RT), although they may be used as treatment when neck tumor burden is low; in general, patients undergoing selective neck dissection should not have clinical nodal disease, and selective neck dissection may prevent morbidity compared with comprehensive neck dissection in low-volume nodal disease, specifically in certain patients with N1–N2 disease. In patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes, radiation with or without chemotherapy should be considered after multidisciplinary evaluation. For cervical node metastasis undergoing operations with therapeutic intent, patients are generally treated with cervical lymphadenectomy to remove all clinically positive nodes, other levels of the neck at high risk, and non-lymphatic structures directly involved with cancer; determining ipsilateral versus bilateral dissection depends on tumor location and midline involvement, and when anatomic imaging and/or fine-needle aspiration identify bilateral pathologic adenopathy, both sides of the neck should be dissected.

### Beyond the NCCN risk factors in colon cancer: an evaluation in a Swedish population-based cohort [^d9d9791a]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Improvements in the care of colon cancer patients, subsequent improvements in prognosis and the wish for personalized medicine require better risk stratification before initiation of adjuvant therapy. Against the baseline of clinicopathological variables recommended in guidelines (like NCCN and ESMO), there is a potential value in assessing sidedness, pT3-subclassification, pN-subclassification, and postoperative CEA when discussing the value of administrating adjuvant chemotherapy and its duration in radically operated colon cancer patients. All emerging factors were associated with worse clinical features; however, only some correlated with increased recurrence risk in adjusted analysis, meaning that they are rather signs of advanced disease and not independent features. The association between factors is evident in the risk groups where the value of adjuvant chemotherapy could be discussed; more pT3a–b were classified as truly low-risk than pT3c–d and the recurrence risks were not different between pT3-substages within these risk groups. When analysing the whole cohort, high pT-stage and substages were associated with several negative prognostic factors, but when adjusting for these, pT-stage was nonsignificant for recurrence. pT3d seems as bad as pT4a and b substage regarding distribution of both recurrences and mortality, telling that the important distinction is not between pT3 and pT4 but within the pT3-tumours. pT3a and b were associated with low risk, node-negative disease, whereas pT3c and definitely pT3d disease was associated with high-risk features and node involvement. Peritoneal involvement (pT4a) correlated with worse HR compared with involvement of other structures (pT4b) confirming what was seen in the national material and another recent large patient series.

### Clinical identification and treatment of a rapidly progressing disease state in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^40808032]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Inflammation is the major factor driving the progression of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, it is critical to achieve rapid suppression of inflammation to maximize disease control. The severity of inflammation and progression of joint damage varies from patient to patient. Some patients have the propensity to change slowly over time and then progress in a more rapid and dynamic fashion. In those where inflammation is more severe, extensive damage can occur within only a few years of disease onset. The progress of joint destruction, as assessed radiographically, results in a decline in functional capacity and quality of life. Consequently, the challenge for clinicians is to identify and treat those patients who develop rapid, progressive disease. Several biological markers and clinical indicators have been identified to help predict or establish which of the patients have rapidly progressing disease or who are at most risk for rapid progression. Early diagnosis of patients with rapidly progressing RA enables immediate and intensive intervention (e.g. with biologic therapy) and a greater opportunity to change the course of disease.

### Imaging patterns of toxic and metabolic brain disorders [^6edcda66]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Toxic and metabolic brain disorders are relatively uncommon diseases that affect the central nervous system, but they are important to recognize as they can lead to catastrophic outcomes if not rapidly and properly managed. Imaging plays a key role in determining the most probable diagnosis, pointing to the next steps of investigation, and providing prognostic information. The majority of cases demonstrate bilateral and symmetric involvement of structures at imaging, affecting the deep gray nuclei, cortical gray matter, and/or periventricular white matter, and some cases show specific imaging manifestations. When an appropriate clinical situation suggests exogenous or endogenous toxic effects, the associated imaging pattern usually indicates a restricted group of diagnostic possibilities. Nonetheless, toxic and metabolic brain disorders in the literature are usually approached in the literature by starting with common causal agents and then reaching imaging abnormalities, frequently mixing many different possible manifestations. Conversely, this article proposes a systematic approach to address this group of diseases based on the most important imaging patterns encountered in clinical practice. Each pattern is suggestive of a most likely differential diagnosis, which more closely resembles real-world scenarios faced by radiologists. Basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding cerebral edemas and their relation to imaging are introduced-an important topic for overall understanding. The most important imaging patterns are presented, and the main differential diagnosis for each pattern is discussed. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2019.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^943b83c4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Infectious disease consultation for device-related SSI — Collaboration with an infectious disease specialist is recommended in certain cases of implanted device-related SSI, particularly in complicated cases of deep SSI; consultation may be considered for patients with pertinent drug allergies or sensitivities, chronic kidney disease, or comorbidities increasing infection risk such as cancer undergoing immunosuppressive treatment or diabetes mellitus; in complicated cases with deep SSI complicated by sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis/discitis, or epidural abscess, partnership with infectious disease colleagues is imperative; consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended in cases of suspected involvement of neuraxial structures; if explantation is delayed due to patient-specific factors such as the need to hold antithrombotic medications, consulting an infectious disease specialist may be helpful for guidance on antibiotic therapy recommendations.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^421e1942]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Background — epidemiology and vascular involvement in pediatric diabetes: Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD), characterized metabolically by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and insulin function and/or secretion in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); both T1DM and T2DM are associated with vascular disease, and autopsy and noninvasive imaging studies suggest that the extent of vascular involvement may reflect disease duration and the severity of the chronic metabolic derangement. T1DM presents at a younger age, with 25 percent of patients diagnosed between ages 5 and 10 years and another 40 percent between ages 10 and 15 years, and if not treated adequately hyperglycemia is severe and patients are highly symptomatic, whereas in T2DM the majority present in adult life, a small and growing number present in adolescence, and most are relatively asymptomatic with only mild to moderate hyperglycemia in combination with obesity.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^adb4869d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — clinical classification and recommended presurgical testing: For clinical purposes, however, most NCCN Member Institutions use a clinical classification system based mainly on results of presurgical imaging studies. For individuals with no evidence of metastatic disease, the Panel recommends chest and pelvis CT (and endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], and/or MRI if clinically indicated for indeterminate liver lesions, and/or PET/CT or MRI for patients with high risk to detect extra-pancreatic metastases), with additional testing that can include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to stent when indicated, liver function tests and baseline CA 19–9 in a decompressed patient, genetic counseling, and germline testing. For patients with confirmed tumors on imaging, disease is classified as: 1) resectable; 2) borderline resectable (ie, tumors that are involved with nearby structures so as to be neither clearly resectable nor clearly unresectable with a high chance of an R1 resection); 3) locally advanced (ie, tumors that are involved with nearby structures to an extent that renders them unresectable despite the absence of evidence of metastatic disease); 4) unresectable at surgery; or 5) metastatic. For patients with evidence of metastatic disease, the Panel recommends a biopsy confirmation preferably from a metastatic site followed by genetic testing for inherited mutations, molecular profiling of tumor tissues, and complete staging with chest and pelvis CT.

### Clinical joint inactivity predicts structural stability in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis [^cbefa1b4]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Importantly, the time spent with a clinically active joint was significantly predicting progression of structural damage in the respective joint. This association was best for the 'overall' activity (swelling and/or tenderness), followed by swelling and tenderness. All these observations support current paradigms and recommendations of achieving full clinical remission (ie, absence of clinical joint activity) in patients with RA, since, on the basis of our findings, this would also warrant the absence of progression in any other joint in most patients.

As expected, patients with progressing joints without clinical activity in these joints showed lower overall disease activity than patients with progressing joints that were clinically active. Interestingly, however, they had significantly higher baseline radiographic scores, further supporting some of the above potential explanations for our findings, as well as the well-established concept that patients with erosive disease are the most likely ones to develop new erosions. Our data suggest that this risk even overrules the risk of progression afflicted with (ongoing) disease activity. Further, it has to be mentioned that patients with progression in clinically inactive joints even improved in HAQ values over time, thus suggesting only a small impact of radiographic progression on physical function in these patients.

### Prevention and management of secondary central nervous system lymphoma [^8c78e7e1]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Identification of patients with a high risk of central nervous system disease

Our approach to CNS prophylaxis is summarized in Figure 1.

Clinical risk factors

The CNS prognostic model (CNS-IPI), including the five standard International Prognostic Index factors (age > 60 years, stage III/IV, ≥ 2 extranodal sites, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and performance status ≥ 2) and kidney or adrenal gland involvement, stratifies patients into three categories: low (0–2 risk factors), intermediate (2–3 risk factors) and high risk (4–6 risk factors) with 2-year rates of CNS relapse of 0.6%, 3.4% and 10.2%, respectively. This is a robust model, but it underestimates the risk of CNS relapse of specific extranodal lymphomas associated with a high risk of CNS recurrence (i.e. testicular, breast), that usually present with limited-stage disease, and therefore fall into the low or intermediate categories. The risk of CNS relapse following disease in other extranodal sites, such as the uterus, bone marrow or epidural space, is controversialand craniofacial structures may no longer be high-risk sites since the introduction of rituximab. The involvement of ≥ 3 extranodal sites determined by PET/CT was also shown to confer a high risk of CNS relapse in a retrospective analysis of 1,532 patients, with a 3-year cumulative risk of CNS relapse of 15% compared to 2.6% among patients with ≤ 2 extranodal sites of disease. The CNS-IPI model does not include biological risk factors recently associated with higher risk of CNS relapse.

### Sore, hot, and at risk: the emerging specialty of cardio-rheumatology [^4824a8f5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Whether these various immunotherapies affect the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular risk similarly is still not known and a crucial area of scientific investigation moving forward. This will require mechanistic studies as well as longer‐term outcome studies. Given the rarity of these conditions compared with the general population, randomized control trials powered for cardiovascular outcomes are often not feasible, and this is where the expanding role of cardiovascular imaging biomarkers as a surrogate of cardiovascular risk and outcomes is well suited. Harnessing these imaging technologies could allow us to identify subclinical risk that can be treated before the development of a cardiovascular event.

We believe that cardiovascular risk prevention is at the forefront of cardio‐rheumatology. Equally important to treating the underlying inflammation process (eg, recurrent pericarditis, myocarditis, vasculitis) is the recognition of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerotic disease, among patients with systemic inflammatory disorders. Patient awareness and education is a key component to prevention. Many academic centers embed the cardio‐rheumatology programs within cardiovascular prevention. However, as this field continues to grow, it could become a separate program or at least allow the programmatic structure for complex medical decision making across multiple different specialties with a footprint in cardiology and rheumatology. It is important for the cardiologist to recognize that our standard risk calculators do not adequately capture risk in these individuals. This has been most studied in RA, found to underestimate at least 2‐fold in women. In fact, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2019 updated guidelines to the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score highlight this by adding systemic inflammatory conditions as a risk enhancer that can be used in shared decision making for those at intermediate risk. Improved risk stratification is needed and is the ongoing area of multiple research efforts and an area where cardiovascular imaging tools may help to advance the field. One example is the recognition of the increased prevalence of coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with systemic inflammatory conditions detected by cardiac myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography imaging or the prevalence of high‐risk plaque features in psoriatic disease detected by coronary computed tomography. Cardiac imaging also plays an important role in cardiovascular inflammatory conditions such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in recurrent pericarditis or cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in inflammatory conditions that affect the myocardium and vasculature. Furthermore, novel imaging markers and modalities are on the horizon; awareness and understanding of the use of these imaging modalities will be critical to the cardio‐rheumatology field moving forward to best enable the diagnosis, prognostication, and monitoring over time of these conditions. The field of cardio‐rheumatology could also adapt and learn from subspecialties such as cardio‐oncology for trial design and management. As the field evolves, we envision integrated multidisciplinary patient care models across cardiology, rheumatology, and immunology, similar to cardio‐oncology, to optimize management and preventive strategies and harmonize guidelines for treatment monitoring. Early detection and initiation of cardioprotective agents or even the choice of the biologic agent could be optimized. As the biologic landscape grows in rheumatology, the balance between the optimal treatment regimen for the disease versus the cardiovascular risk could be different, and these unanswered questions will certainly require future study with adaptative and innovative trial design. One example would be routine protocols of surveillance, such as the application of routine echocardiographic imaging with global longitudinal strain monitoring to detect subclinical myocardial dysfunction and initiation of cardioprotective therapies.

### The assessment of the patient with systemic sclerosis [^7f7ce7fc]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis presents a great deal of variability among different patients in the extent of skin and internal organ involvement, the pace of the disease and consequently, the prognosis. In addition, the single patient, during his/her disease course, can present with distinct manifestations. Each patient must, therefore, be carefully investigated. The assessment should be adapted to the setting, i.e. clinical practice, clinical investigation, therapeutic trials. The clinician cannot confine the diagnostic process to labelling the disease. He must define the subset, the extent of internal organ involvement, and the type of lesions underlying the clinical manifestations, i.e. fibrotic lesions, reflecting irreversible damage should be separated from active lesions (such as alveolitis) which can be reversed by drug treatment. The clinical investigator must assure that his/her patients are comparable to other series. ACR criteria have been shown to not assure such comparability. To this purpose, a core set of variables to be assessed in any clinical investigation study has been proposed. Finally, the clinical researcher should enrol patients with active disease and must rely for his/her conclusions on feasible and sensitive to change measures. An OMERACT committee has recently reviewed the literature selecting those ready for use in clinical trials.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for anal squamous cell cancers (revised 2018) [^acc1e169]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Medium credibility.

Malignant neoplasms of the anal canal and perianal region — pretreatment evaluation should include the following: A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and signs of advanced disease. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Most patients present with a slow-growing mass involving either the anal canal or the perianal skin, and pain and bleeding are common, occurring in approximately half of patients, although < 20% of patients may be asymptomatic. Because the incidence of anal cancer is higher among men practicing anoreceptive intercourse, as well as among patients positive for HIV, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients who present with anorectal complaints. Physical examination should focus primarily on an anorectal examination and evaluation of the inguinofemoral nodes, with digital anorectal examination performed to identify the lesion location and to evaluate for fixation and/or the presence of invasion of local structures, such as the vagina or the anal sphincter mechanism; anoscopy or proctoscopy with biopsy is essential to establish the size of the lesion, to determine its location within the anal canal, and to confirm diagnosis.

### Exploring radiographic patterns of the cervical spine, including zygapophyseal joints, in axial spondyloarthritis [^9e5df90f]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The proportion of patients with CS involvement who also had enthesitis is significant in our cohort. This correlation could be interpreted in light of recent theories suggesting that the enthesis is the pathogenic epicentre in axSpA. According to this theoretical framework, entheses serve as initial points for inflammation, which can later spread to adjacent structures, including the spine. This finding raises the need for further studies that explore the relationship between enthesitis and cervical involvement to better understand underlying mechanisms and guide more effective therapeutic strategies.

This study presents some limitations, such as the use of simple X-rays for the assessment of structural damage. Distinguishing between degenerative and disease-specific changes can be challenging using this technique. However, as mentioned before, the established cut-off points might be reliable for the discrimination between them. Furthermore, while other imaging modalities for evaluating radiographic damage have emerged, the validated scoring methods are currently limited to plain radiographs. The widespread clinical use of X-rays, owing to its accessibility, enables its application in a large patient population.

In conclusion, the performance of CS radiography should be considered routine in clinical practice, especially in men, who seem to constitute a higher-risk group for the development of radiographic damage, as should the evaluation of ZJ since their involvement is common in axSpA and is related to increased disease activity and decreased functionality. According to our results, it seems that there is a close relationship between anterior and posterior cervical involvement, and both can be affected simultaneously as the underlying disease progresses. However, further studies, especially prospective ones, are needed to determine potential risk factors associated with radiographic CS involvement in patients with axSpA.

### The patient presenting with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia. does diabetes influence presentation, limb outcomes and survival? [^90178021]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) confers an elevated risk of major amputation and delayed wound healing in diabetic patients with foot ulcers. The major international vascular societies recently developed evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and management of patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI). CLTI represents the cohort of diabetic and non-diabetic patients who have PAD which is of sufficient severity to delay wound healing and increase amputation risk. Diabetic patients with CLTI are more likely to present with tissue loss, infection and have less favourable anatomy for revascularization than those without diabetes. Although diabetes is not consistently reported as a strong independent risk factor for limb loss, major morbidity and mortality in CLTI patients, it is impossible in clinical practice to isolate diabetes from comorbidities, such as end-stage renal disease and coronary artery disease which occur more commonly in diabetic patients. Treatment of CLTI in the diabetic patient is complex and should involve a multi-disciplinary team to optimize outcomes. Clinicians should use an integrated approach to management based on patient risk assessment, an assessment of the severity of the foot pathology and a structured anatomical assessment of arterial disease as suggested by the Global Vascular Guidelines for CLTI.

### Speckle tracking echocardiography as a new diagnostic tool for an assessment of cardiovascular disease in rheumatic patients [^827fc2bb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammation represents the cornerstone of the raised cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). Standardized mortality ratios are increased in these patients compared to the general population, which can be explained by premature mortality associated with early atherosclerotic events. Thus, IRD patients need appropriate CV risk management in view of this CV disease (CVD) burden. Currently, optimal CV risk management is still lacking in usual care, and early diagnosis of silent and subclinical CVD involvement is mandatory to improve the long-term prognosis of those patients. Although CV involvement in such patients is highly heterogeneous and may affect various structures of the heart, it can now be diagnosed earlier and promptly treated. CV imaging provides valuable information as a reliable diagnostic tool. Currently, different techniques are employed to evaluate CV risk, including transthoracic or trans-esophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography, to investigate valve abnormalities, pericardial disease, and ventricular wall motion defects. All the above methods are reliable in investigating CV involvement, but more recently, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) has been suggested to be diagnostically more accurate. In recent years, the role of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as the gold standard parameter for the evaluation of systolic function has been debated, and many efforts have been focused on the clinical validation of new non-invasive tools for the study of myocardial contractility as well as to characterize the subclinical alterations of the myocardial function. Improvement in the accuracy of STE has resulted in a large amount of research showing the ability of STE to overcome LVEF limitations in the majority of primary and secondary heart diseases. This review summarizes the additional value that STE measurement can provide in the setting of IRD, with a focus in the different clinical stages.

### Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, version 3.2021 [^a8ce77b8]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Principles of staging — pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma state that clinical interpretation of staging at diagnosis should not be based on reports alone and that treating clinician notes should summarize interpretation of sites of involvement prior to initiation of treatment. FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) should be read by an experienced nuclear diagnostic radiologist experienced in reading Deauville scores for FDG-PET–adapted therapy, and this is a visual analysis and does not include standardized uptake value (SUV). There may be FDG-PET–avid lesions that need clinical correlation to determine if it is related to lymphoma. There are inconsistencies in staging between protocols and providers, and careful attention to staging of lung involvement is important as it may change the risk group of the patient. An E-lesion is defined as a contiguous infiltration of a lymph node mass into extralymphatic structures or organs (eg, lung or bone); pleural and pericardial involvement should be considered E-lesions, but a pleural or pericardial effusion alone is not considered an E-lesion. Disease that extends beyond the lymphatic system without adjacent lymphatic involvement is considered stage IV disease; liver or bone marrow involvement is always considered stage IV disease. CNS disease is considered extra-axial. Volume = (a x b x c)/2 where a, b, and c are three dimensions of a node or conglomerate (in cm).

### Role of rehabilitation in spine tumors [^bae7641d]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Primary and metastatic spine tumors can lead to devastating complications, but timely and careful management of these patients can improve outcomes. A multidisciplinary and structured approach is the most effective way to evaluate patients with spine disease and mitigate the risk of complications. The neurologic, oncologic, mechanical and systemic disease framework gives comprehensive guidance to providers regarding appropriate management. Physiatrists play a critical role in these patients' initial evaluation and continued management throughout cancer treatment. Patients with spinal cord involvement have extensive needs, requiring an individualized management approach. Even though patients with nontraumatic spinal cord injury benefit from rehabilitation efforts and have improved outcomes, they are not routinely admitted to inpatient rehabilitation units or referred to outpatient cancer rehabilitation. Ongoing efforts are needed to promote rehabilitation medicine involvement in improving functional outcomes and quality of life for patients with spine involvement.

### Is diagnosis enough to guide interventions in mental health? Using case formulation in clinical practice [^ec7cf532]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

When done well, formulation provides an opportunity for a shared understanding of a person's difficulties, and can offer a way of answering the classic questions of 'why this person?', 'why this problem?', and 'why now?' in ways that diagnosis alone does not. Importantly, it can also provide a rationale and shared agenda for what to target and in what order. While there may be some risks involved in formulation, if done sensitively, collaboratively, and accounting for strengths, we suggest it can be a clinical tool with the potential to provide considerably better outcomes than diagnosis alone. A challenge is the integration of a formulation-based management plan with categorical diagnosis and the current evidence base to provide a broad-based clinical understanding and an individualized therapeutic strategy.

### Practical guidance for the early recognition and follow-up of patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease [^ad34ba8c]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The early detection and management of (progressive) interstitial lung disease in patients with connective tissue diseases requires the attention and skills of a multidisciplinary team. However, there are currently no well-established standards to guide the daily practice of physicians treating this heterogenous group of diseases.

Research Question

This paper aimed to identify gaps in scientific knowledge along the journey of patients with connective tissue disease-related interstitial lung disease and to provide tools for earlier identification of interstitial lung disease and progressive disease.

Study Design and Methods

The opinions of an international expert panel, which consisted of pulmonologists and rheumatologists were collected and interpreted in the light of peer-reviewed data.

Results

Interstitial lung disease is a common complication of connective tissue diseases, but prevalence estimates vary by subtype. Screening and monitoring by means of clinical examination, chest radiography, pulmonary function testing, and disease-specific biomarkers provide insight into the disease activity of patients presenting with connective tissue diseases in a routine setting. Multiple phenotypic and genotypic characteristics have been identified as predictors of the development and progression of interstitial lung disease. However, these risk factors differ between subtypes. To ensure earlier diagnosis of rapidly progressive phenotypes, a risk-based method is necessary for determining the need for HRCT and additional testing.

Interpretation

To reduce the underdiagnosis of CTD-ILDs in clinical practice, a standardized and systematic multidisciplinary risk-based approach is suggested. Collaboration across disciplines is essential for the management of CTD-ILD.

### How should we approach classification of autoinflammatory diseases? [^2a550553]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

The notion of 'autoinflammatory' disease was introduced at the end of the 1990s, and, since then, this concept has rapidly evolved. As a result, multiple definitions of autoinflammatory disease, and classifications of conditions encompassed by these definitions, have been proposed; this succession highlights advances that have been made in understanding of the innate immune system, and especially the roles of IL-1β and the inflammasome in autoinflammtory conditions. However, the definitions and classifications that have been suggested to date face a number of structure and content issues. We therefore propose another, more clinically-oriented, definition: autoinflammatory diseases are diseases with clinical signs of inflammation, associated with elevated levels of acute-phase reactants, which are attributable to dysfunction of the innate immune system, genetically-determined or triggered by an endogenous factor. From this foundation, we propose a clinically-based classification of autoinflammatory diseases, and go on to discuss how immunological diseases as a whole, including autoimmune diseases, can be appropriately located within a continuum only if the classification process is multidimensional. For this purpose, we appeal to the philosophical concepts of family resemblance and signature.

### Bimekizumab complete clearance of both skin and nail psoriasis: comparative efficacy in phase III / IIIb studies [^1852f0ce]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complete skin clearance, or 100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), is becoming an increasingly achievable treatment goal with new biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis. However, the PASI does not include an assessment of nail psoriasis clearance. Importantly, psoriasis of the nails is highly visible and can have a substantial negative impact on both the physical and emotional well-being of patients, relative to the small area of the body affected. Moreover, compared to patients without, patients with nail involvement have higher work absence, more healthcare resource use, higher stress, and a lower health-related quality of life.

In patients with psoriasis, nail involvement has a prevalence of approximately 40–60% and, across their lifetime, an estimated 80–90% of patients with plaque psoriasis will experience nail involvement. The nail is connected to underlying bone in the finger through an enthesis network fused with the extensor tendon, which crosses the distal interphalangeal joint. As a result of the anatomical connection between the nail and the musculoskeletal system, nail psoriasis can be an early indicator and independent risk factor for psoriatic arthritis (PsA); therefore, patients with psoriasis who experience nail involvement are three times more likely to develop PsA. Considering prevalence and that approximately one third of patients with psoriasis progress to PsA over the course of their disease, there is a need for awareness and understanding of nail disease among healthcare professionals to improve the identification and early management of patients at high risk of progression to PsA.

Systemic treatment, including biologic therapies, is recommended for nail psoriasis when it is severe (sometimes defined as involvement on four or more fingernails, or onycholysis/onychodystrophy affecting at least two fingernails) or when there is a large impact on patient health-related quality of life. However, because of their structure and growth rate, nails are often more difficult to treat than skin and can take 6–9 months to completely regrow. Complete resolution of multiple domains of psoriatic disease beyond skin has become an increasingly important treatment goal in patients with psoriasis, as highlighted by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA). Therapies that can effectively treat these domains of psoriatic disease at the same time, including resolving an independent risk factor and controlling underlying inflammation associated with disease progression to PsA, are therefore highly desirable.

### Laryngeal involvement in relapsing polychondritis: clinical and CT findings in 173 patients [^c80a6e6a]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Objectives

Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare autoimmune disorder primarily affecting cartilaginous structures. We aimed to characterise the clinical features and CT findings of laryngeal involvement in RP, hypothesising that specific CT patterns correlate with clinical manifestations.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed 173 patients with confirmed RP. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial CT findings were reviewed. Statistical analyses identified factors associated with laryngeal involvement and airway stenosis.

Results

Notably, 66% of asymptomatic patients displayed CT evidence of airway damage, with laryngeal involvement in 41.1% (44/107), tracheal involvement in 80.9% (140/173), and bronchial involvement in 36.4% (63/107). Cricoid erosion and broadening with mucosal hyperplasia were the predominant laryngeal findings. Significant associations with laryngeal involvement included younger age at disease onset (p < 0.05), longer disease duration (p < 0.01) and multiorgan manifestations (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Laryngeal involvement is common in RP patients with airway manifestations, second only to tracheal involvement. CT findings of cricoid erosion and broadening are characteristic. Vigilant clinical monitoring is recommended for RP patients with identified risk factors to facilitate early detection and management. Future research should focus on developing targeted interventions for this high-risk subgroup of RP patients.

### Risk stratification in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^a7e49cd5]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Although structural abnormalities of the right ventricle predominate, it is well recognized that left ventricular involvement is common, particularly in advanced disease, and that left-dominant forms occur. The pathological characteristic of ARVC is myocyte loss with fibrofatty replacement. Since the first detailed clinical description of the disorder in 1982, significant advances have been made in understanding this disease. Once the diagnosis of ARVC is established, the single most important clinical decision is whether a particular patient's sudden cardiac death risk is sufficient to justify placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. The importance of this decision reflects the fact that ARVC is a common cause of sudden death in young people and that sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease. This decision is particularly important because these are often young patients who are expected to live for many years. Although an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator can save lives in individuals with this disease, it is also well recognized that implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy is associated with both short- and long-term complications. Decisions about the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator are based on an estimate of a patient's risk of sudden cardiac death, as well as their preferences and values. The primary purpose of this article is to provide a review of the literature that concerns risk stratification in patients with ARVC and to place this literature in the framework of the 3 authors' considerable lifetime experiences in caring for patients with ARVC. The most important parameters to consider when determining arrhythmic risk include electric instability, including the frequency of premature ventricular contractions and sustained ventricular arrhythmia; proband status; extent of structural disease; cardiac syncope; male sex; the presence of multiple mutations or a mutation in TMEM43; and the patient's willingness to restrict exercise and to eliminate participation in competitive or endurance exercise.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^409d18ba]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Every neurologist will be familiar with the patient with atypical spinal cord disease and the challenges of taking the diagnosis forward. This is predominantly because of the limited range of possible clinical and investigation findings making most individual features non-specific. The difficulty in obtaining a tissue diagnosis further contributes and patients are often treated empirically based on local prevalence and potential for reversibility. This article focuses on improving the diagnosis of adult non-traumatic, non-compressive spinal cord disorders. It is structured to start with the clinical presentation in order to be of practical use to the clinician. We aim, by combining the onset phenotype with the subsequent course, along with imaging and laboratory features, to improve the diagnostic process.

### A case of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis with intradural extension and cerebritis [^a5f28821]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we present the first report describing intradural extension of disease in AFRS resulting in cerebritis. Advanced cases of AFRS can damage surrounding structures through progressive expansion, leading to pressure‐induced bony erosion and dural atrophy. Complications of other severe AFRS cases include ophthalmic involvement, cavernous venous thrombosis, intracranial extradural expansion, and disseminated disease in immunosuppressed patients. While the mechanisms underlying aggressive behavior remain unclear, recent studies suggest that local sinonasal immunodeficiencies, uncontrolled diabetes, a dysregulated type 2 inflammatory response, and granulomatous inflammation may correlate with mucosal invasion and severity. Erosive changes and dehiscence are more likely in the setting of these risk factors. In our patient, the development of seizures and imaging‐confirmed intracranial extension were initially interpreted within the typical boundaries of AFRS; however, intraoperative findings confirmed dural erosion and intradural extension. In retrospect, the combination of clinical and radiographic findings should raise the index of suspicion for possible dural involvement in similarly atypical cases. While systemic antifungal therapy is not standard of care in the treatment of AFRS, it was initiated postoperatively by the infectious disease team as a precautionary measure due to the atypical intradural involvement and patient's risk profile, raising concern for potential progression to invasive disease. Importantly, African American patients with AFRS are at increased risk of presenting with advanced disease and associated complications. Our patient suffered from both uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and delayed care — factors known to drive more aggressive AFRS. This case highlights the potential for progression to life‐threatening complications in the context of delayed intervention and immunologic vulnerability. Further studies on social determinants of health affecting patients with AFRS may help identify risk factors, promote early intervention, and improve outcomes.

### Hippocampal perfusion predicts impending neurodegeneration in REM sleep behavior disorder [^ea2b9c69]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) are at risk for developing Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We aimed to identify functional brain imaging patterns predicting the emergence of PD and DLB in patients with IRBD, using SPECT with (99m)Tc-ethylene cysteinate dimer (ECD).

Methods

Twenty patients with IRBD were scanned at baseline during wakefulness using (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT. After a follow-up of 3 years on average, patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether or not they developed defined neurodegenerative disease (PD, DLB). SPECT data analysis comparing regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between groups assessed whether specific brain perfusion patterns were associated with subsequent clinical evolution. Regression analysis between rCBF and clinical markers of neurodegeneration (motor, color vision, olfaction) looked for neural structures involved in this process.

Results

Of the 20 patients with IRBD recruited for this study, 10 converted to PD or DLB during the follow-up. rCBF at baseline was increased in the hippocampus of patients who would later convert compared with those who would not (p < 0.05 corrected). Hippocampal perfusion was correlated with motor and color vision scores across all IRBD patients.

Conclusions

(99m)Tc-ECD SPECT identifies patients with IRBD at risk for conversion to other neurodegenerative disorders such as PD or DLB; disease progression in IRBD is predicted by abnormal perfusion in the hippocampus at baseline. Perfusion within this structure is correlated with clinical markers of neurodegeneration, further suggesting its involvement in the development of presumed synucleinopathies.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, more specifically with respect to risk factors, EULAR 2011 guidelines recommend to assess risk factors and associated comorbidities in patients with CPPD, including osteoarthritis, history of joint injury, predisposing metabolic diseases (including hemochromatosis, primary hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia) and rare familial predisposition. Assess metabolic and familial predisposition particularly in younger patients (< 55 years old) or if there is florid polyarticular chondrocalcinosis.

### Will oral food challenges still Be part of allergy care in 10 years' time? [^f8d26e56]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

In research, in addition to diagnostic clarity, OFCs provide data on reaction phenotypes (including symptom patterns, organ system involvement patterns, intervals between exposure and symptoms, symptom severity, and individual reaction thresholds or allergen sensitivity). Although there is often the mistaken assumption that the magnitude of results of alternative tests (eg, skin prick test wheal size) are proportional to sensitivity or reaction severity, this is not evidence-based, and it is currently impossible to obtain information about sensitivity and severity without the OFC. In addition, as demonstrated in Figure 1, sensitivity and severity are not directly proportionally related; rather, reaction severity can vary across all degrees of allergen sensitivity. Greater characterization of differences in reaction phenotypes across allergens as well as patient ages, exposure types, and matrices in which the allergen is delivered is essential to improve our understanding of food allergies and inform discussions with patients and other stakeholders regarding individual and scenario-based risks. This information is currently most accurately ascertained through controlled, supervised food exposuresrather than ad hoc real-world accidental reaction registries. Only by making such rich datasets available will we be able to develop, validate, and improve alternative diagnostic and prognostic tests. The recent use of large, combined datasets demonstrated promise with some ability to group patients into high or low allergen sensitivity using epitope sensitization patternsor reaction severity. Day-to-day variability in the reaction threshold and severityand the impact of cofactorsare also important to our understanding of how a food allergy diagnosis might translate to the clinical phenotype for any given individual and relate to the real-world future risk. Only by collecting such data will it be possible to assess the potential of alternative tests to predict the key elements of these phenotypes.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^10ad70d9]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus — background and epidemiology relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD): Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for early CVD. Metabolically, diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion (type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM]) and insulin function and/or secretion (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]). Both T1DM and T2DM are associated with vascular disease, and autopsy and noninvasive imaging studies suggest that the extent of vascular involvement may reflect the duration of the disease and the severity of the chronic metabolic derangement. The epidemiologies of the two types differ significantly: T1DM presents at a younger age, with 25 percent of patients diagnosed between ages 5 and 10 years and another 40 percent between ages 10 and 15 years, and if not treated adequately, the degree of hyperglycemia is severe and patients are highly symptomatic. By contrast, in T2DM, the majority of patients present in adult life, but a small and growing number present in adolescence, and most are relatively asymptomatic, with only mild to moderate hyperglycemia in combination with obesity.

### From vulnerable plaque to vulnerable patient – part III: executive summary of the screening for heart attack prevention and education (SHAPE) task force report [^d08fd2d5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Screening for early-stage asymptomatic cancers (eg, cancers of breast and colon) to prevent late-stage malignancies has been widely accepted. However, although atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (eg, heart attack and stroke) accounts for more death and disability than all cancers combined, there are no national screening guidelines for asymptomatic (subclinical) atherosclerosis, and there is no government- or healthcare-sponsored reimbursement for atherosclerosis screening. Part I and Part II of this consensus statement elaborated on new discoveries in the field of atherosclerosis that led to the concept of the "vulnerable patient". These landmark discoveries, along with new diagnostic and therapeutic options, have set the stage for the next step: translation of this knowledge into a new practice of preventive cardiology. The identification and treatment of the vulnerable patient are the focuses of this consensus statement. In this report, the Screening for Heart Attack Prevention and Education (SHAPE) Task Force presents a new practice guideline for cardiovascular screening in the asymptomatic at-risk population. In summary, the SHAPE Guideline calls for noninvasive screening of all asymptomatic men 45–75 years of age and asymptomatic women 55–75 years of age (except those defined as very low risk) to detect and treat those with subclinical atherosclerosis. A variety of screening tests are available, and the cost-effectiveness of their use in a comprehensive strategy must be validated. Some of these screening tests, such as measurement of coronary artery calcification by computed tomography scanning and carotid artery intima-media thickness and plaque by ultrasonography, have been available longer than others and are capable of providing direct evidence for the presence and extent of atherosclerosis. Both of these imaging methods provide prognostic information of proven value regarding the future risk of heart attack and stroke. Careful and responsible implementation of these tests as part of a comprehensive risk assessment and reduction approach is warranted and outlined by this report. Other tests for the detection of atherosclerosis and abnormal arterial structure and function, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the great arteries, studies of small and large artery stiffness, and assessment of systemic endothelial dysfunction, are emerging and must be further validated. The screening results (severity of subclinical arterial disease) combined with risk factor assessment are used for risk stratification to identify the vulnerable patient and initiate appropriate therapy. The higher the risk, the more vulnerable an individual is to a near-term adverse event. Because < 10% of the population who test positive for atherosclerosis will experience a near-term event, additional risk stratification based on reliable markers of disease activity is needed and is expected to further focus the search for the vulnerable patient in the future. All individuals with asymptomatic atherosclerosis should be counseled and treated to prevent progression to overt clinical disease. The aggressiveness of the treatment should be proportional to the level of risk. Individuals with no evidence of subclinical disease may be reassured of the low risk of a future near-term event, yet encouraged to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and maintain appropriate risk factor levels. Early heart attack care education is urged for all individuals with a positive test for atherosclerosis. The SHAPE Task Force reinforces existing guidelines for the screening and treatment of risk factors in younger populations. Cardiovascular healthcare professionals and policymakers are urged to adopt the SHAPE proposal and its attendant cost-effectiveness as a new strategy to contain the epidemic of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the rising cost of therapies associated with this epidemic.

Ethmoid sinus tumors — surgery, neck management, and postoperative therapy: Nodal involvement is rare, and patients with ethmoid sinus cancer who have N+ neck disease should undergo neck dissection with adjuvant therapy as appropriate. After incomplete endoscopic resection with no documented residual disease, patients should be treated with surgical resection to obtain oncologically appropriate margins if feasible. If no adverse pathologic features are found, complete surgical resection may obviate the need for postoperative RT in T1 patients only (category 2B). In patients with high-risk pathologic features (positive or close margins adjacent to vital structures, high-grade lesions or other unfavorable histology, intracranial and/or intraorbital extension, cribriform plate or medial wall of orbit location, and/or perineural and lymphovascular space invasion), postoperative systemic therapy/RT can be considered. Patients with high-grade tumors have worse survival outcomes compared to those with low-grade tumors.

### The risk of re-identification versus the need to identify individuals in rare disease research [^20a0c9ef]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The importance of identifying individuals

In order to be able to accurately diagnose; classify the genetic of rare diseases, and to address the complexity of managing many of these diseases there is a need for good knowledge and a reliable high quality of data. A critical component in building the knowledge and evidence is the need for large volume of clinical data collected and biosamples from affected individuals and their families. These collections enable genotype–phenotype studies to understand how particular genetic changes, that is, the genotype, produce the different disease characteristics we see clinically, that is, the phenotype and how other genes moderate or otherwise the pathology of a disease. This is particularly important in rare diseases where the phenotype results often from a single genetic change. The rarity of the condition is particularly powerful from a clinical perspective because it provides a very high degree of clarity of the genotype–phenotype relationship, and the biological pathways involved; but equally the rarity also represents a barrier to diagnosis and discovery as there are limited data due to the relatively small numbers of affected individuals. Consequently, there is a special and well-documented need for research collaboration so that data and biosamples from multiple independent studies can be shared across borders. The two data sets of clinical data and biospecimen data are critical for understanding the pathogenesis and the management of diseases, both common and rare. In relation to empowering clinical diagnosis of diseases and clinical discovery of disease mechanisms, and possible therapies, there are several scenarios where the absence of a re-identification method such as a unique identifier, of data or samples potentially put patients at risk. There is a risk of not reaching scientific objectives in research projects, because data cannot be connected on an individual patient level. Not reaching clinical studies objectives because of insufficient scientific evidence may also put patients at risk by prolonging the period for diagnosis and the options for treatment. Data sets of different experiments and samples of the same patients are held by different research organizations such as samples held at a biobank of university X, clinical or genetic data from a natural history study or registry with hospital Y and biomarker data with research lab Z. Having different organizations involved, including cross border, is a common situation in clinical research for rare diseases. To fully exploit unanticipated, out-of-the normal signals in the biomarker results, the researcher (z) would need to have access to clinical and genetic data (y) of a particular participant from the hospital Y and be in a position to request another sample (x) of the same participant from the biorepository X. In the absence of a re-identification method such as a unique identifier, this research question may remain unanswered. Alternatively, the research needs to be re-done that may not be feasible based on costs and participant/sample availability without access to shared data and resources across borders. In addition, feeding back individual-level results to participants or inclusion in follow-up research may be impossible without a secure way of re-identification.

### Advances in imaging of cardiopulmonary involvement in sarcoidosis [^349035f0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent advances of imaging modalities with focus on interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease and cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis. The contribution of key imaging features to the assessment of disease activity and their impact in the prognostic evaluation and management of sarcoidosis are also described.

Recent Findings

Imaging plays a central role in the management of patients with sarcoidosis, particularly in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity. The correlation of the severity and extent of organ involvement with inflammatory activity helps guide the clinician in determining the optimal treatment strategy for the patient and may also provide prognostic information. The emergence of cardiac MRI and fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography has enabled an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis, particularly in relation to cardiac involvement and pulmonary vascular manifestations.

Summary

In many patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, a confident diagnosis can be made based on clinical and imaging features, without the need for histological sampling. In cardiac sarcoidosis, advanced imaging modalities have an increasing role in the identification of active disease, risk stratification and optimal management.

### Phenotyping Sjögren's syndrome: towards a personalised management of the disease [^c2b00e12]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that mainly targets the exocrine glands. The disease overwhelmingly affects women around 30–60 years old, and more than 95% of patients present with oral and/or ocular dryness, although they may also develop a wide number of organ-specific systemic manifestations. The variable presentation is often linked to the influence of multiple personal determinants. In this review, we analyse the main geoepidemiological, immunological and histopathological determinants involved in the phenotypic expression of SS. With respect to sicca involvement, some patients (Asian, young-onset diagnosis, males and Ro-carriers) present with a less pronounced involvement in contrast to others with more pronounced dryness (seronegative, isolated La-carriers). With respect to the risk of developing systemic disease/poor outcomes, we propose a phenotypic-driven prognostic classification into patients at low risk (elderly-onset diagnosis, seronegative, isolated La-carriers), moderate risk (Black/African-american, young-onset diagnosis, Ro-carriers) and high risk (males, high focus score or presence of germinal centers in histopathological studies, RF-carriers, cryoglobulinaemic and hypocomplementaemic patients). Phenotype-based clustering of systemic autoimmune diseases may help physicians to offer a more personalised, cost-effective medical care of patients affected by these complex chronic diseases.

### Response to therapy assessment in intermediate-risk thyroid cancer patients: is thyroglobulin stimulation required? [^79d18777]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend response to therapy (RTT) assessment 1–2 years after initial treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients to guide thyrotropin (TSH) goals and long-term follow-up. We hypothesized that data collected during the first 2 years of follow-up may be sufficient to determine RTT without thyroglobulin (Tg) stimulation. Materials and Methods: Patients treated with total thyroidectomy and radioiodine for intermediate-risk DTC, followed for > 2 years, and had sufficient follow-up data were included. Data on Tg, ultrasound, scans, and long-term outcomes were collected. Results: One-hundred twenty patients met inclusion criteria, with 68% women and mean age 55 ± 15 years. Intermediate risk was due to lymph-node involvement (72%), extrathyroidal extension (51%), vascular invasion (12%), and high-risk histology (9%). At the end of follow-up of 7 ± 4 years, 26% had persistent disease (14% biochemical, 12% structural). According to the ATA RTT system (using stimulated-Tg), 56% had excellent RTT, of whom only 2% had disease at the end of follow-up. In the "nonstimulated" system (which includes basal Tg, post- 131 I therapy whole-body scan (TxWBS) for assessment of residual lymph-node metastases after surgery, and structural imaging studies), 57% had excellent response, of whom none had disease at the end of follow-up. Only eight patients (7%) were classified differently due to recombinant human thyrotropin stimulation (as either excellent or indeterminate response), with no difference in predictive value, with a receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.903 with Tg-stimulation and of 0.918 without. Conclusions: In patients with no evidence of disease during the first 2 years of follow-up, the addition of stimulated-Tg adds little prognostic information. We suggest the use of excellent RTT based on basal Tg together with TxWBS and structural imaging studies.

### Personalised care planning for adults with chronic or long-term health conditions [^b68ed0fb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Personalised care planning is a collaborative process used in chronic condition management in which patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused by or related to the patient's condition, and develop a plan for tackling these. In essence it is a conversation, or series of conversations, in which they jointly agree goals and actions for managing the patient's condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of personalised care planning for adults with long-term health conditions compared to usual care (i.e. forms of care in which active involvement of patients in treatment and management decisions is not explicitly attempted or achieved).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to July 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and cluster-randomised trials involving adults with long-term conditions where the intervention included collaborative (between individual patients and clinicians) goal setting and action planning. We excluded studies where there was little or no opportunity for the patient to have meaningful influence on goal selection, choice of treatment or support package, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of three review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were effects on physical health, psychological health, subjective health status, and capabilities for self management. Secondary outcomes included effects on health-related behaviours, resource use and costs, and type of intervention. A patient advisory group of people with experience of living with long-term conditions advised on various aspects of the review, including the protocol, selection of outcome measures and emerging findings.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving a total of 10,856 participants. Twelve of these studies focused on diabetes, three on mental health, one on heart failure, one on end-stage renal disease, one on asthma, and one on various chronic conditions. All 19 studies included components that were intended to support behaviour change among patients, involving either face-to-face or telephone support. All but three of the personalised care planning interventions took place in primary care or community settings; the remaining three were located in hospital clinics. There was some concern about risk of bias for each of the included studies in respect of one or more criteria, usually due to inadequate or unclear descriptions of research methods. Physical healthNine studies measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), giving a combined mean difference (MD) between intervention and control of -0.24% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.14), a small positive effect in favour of personalised care planning compared to usual care (moderate quality evidence). Six studies measured systolic blood pressure, a combined mean difference of -2.64 mm/Hg (95% CI -4.47 to -0.82) favouring personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The pooled results from four studies showed no significant effect on diastolic blood pressure, MD -0.71 mm/Hg (95% CI -2.26 to 0.84). We found no evidence of an effect on cholesterol (LDL-C), standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.11) (five studies) or body mass index, MD -0.11 (95% CI -0.35 to 0.13) (four studies). A single study of people with asthma reported that personalised care planning led to improvements in lung function and asthma control. Psychological healthSix studies measured depression. We were able to pool results from five of these, giving an SMD of -0.36 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.20), a small effect in favour of personalised care (moderate quality evidence). The remaining study found greater improvement in the control group than the intervention group. Four other studies used a variety of psychological measures that were conceptually different so could not be pooled. Of these, three found greater improvement for the personalised care group than the usual care group and one was too small to detect differences in outcomes. Subjective health statusTen studies used various patient-reported measures of health status (or health-related quality of life), including both generic health status measures and condition-specific ones. We were able to pool data from three studies that used the SF-36 or SF-12, but found no effect on the physical component summary score SMD 0.16 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.38) or the mental component summary score SMD 0.07 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.28) (moderate quality evidence). Of the three other studies that measured generic health status, two found improvements related to personalised care and one did not. Four studies measured condition-specific health status. The combined results showed no difference between the intervention and control groups, SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.10) (moderate quality evidence). Self-management capabilitiesNine studies looked at the effect of personalised care on self-management capabilities using a variety of outcome measures, but they focused primarily on self efficacy. We were able to pool results from five studies that measured self efficacy, giving a small positive result in favour of personalised care planning: SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) (moderate quality evidence). A further five studies measured other attributes that contribute to self-management capabilities. The results from these were mixed: two studies found evidence of an effect on patient activation, one found an effect on empowerment, and one found improvements in perceived interpersonal support. Other outcomesPooled data from five studies on exercise levels showed no effect due to personalised care planning, but there was a positive effect on people's self-reported ability to carry out self-care activities: SMD 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.52). We found no evidence of adverse effects due to personalised care planning. The effects of personalised care planning were greater when more stages of the care planning cycle were completed, when contacts between patients and health professionals were more frequent, and when the patient's usual clinician was involved in the process.

Authors' Conclusions

Personalised care planning leads to improvements in certain indicators of physical and psychological health status, and people's capability to self-manage their condition when compared to usual care. The effects are not large, but they appear greater when the intervention is more comprehensive, more intensive, and better integrated into routine care.

### Evaluation of temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients [^8c4a5100]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a common, chronic and inflammatory rheumatological disease of childhood. The disease can affect all synovial joints in the body. Temporomandibular joints (TMJs) are important areas of involvement in JIA, which are frequently involved but often not noticed because the involvement is usually asymptomatic. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency and risk factors of TMJ joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients admitted to our clinic, and to guide for early diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

Patients who applied to this study with the diagnosis of JIA between January 2014 and May 2017 at Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic, were followed up regularly in our clinic, had a accessible medical history, and a rheumatology polyclinic record. Patients with contrast-enhanced TMJ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) taken and reported by the radiologist were included.

Results

TMJ involvement was detected in 51.2% of the 41 patients included in the study. It was found that 71.5% of the patients with TMJ involvement were asymptomatic and 71.5% of the patients had chronic involvement. When the patients with and without TMJ involvement were compared according to the contrast-enhanced TMJ MRI results; In the patient group with involvement, the polyarticular onset subtype was seen at a higher rate (p = 0.005), the age of onset was earlier (p = 0.003), the disease duration was longer (p = 0.037), more joints were involved (p = 0.005), the ESR values ​​were higher (p = 0.0001), and the treatment compliance and treatment responses of the patients in this group were worse (p = 0.001, p = 0.0001).

Conclusion

TMJ involvement is common in JIA patients and can occur at any stage of the disease. It is often asymptomatic and progresses insidiously, leading to chronic and degenerative changes in the mandible at an early stage. Due to its asymptomatic nature, the insidious progression, and the risk of causing chronic, irreversible sequelae, it is crucial to screen high-risk JIA patients regularly with contrast-enhanced TMJ MRI, which remains the gold standard method. While specific risk factors are difficult to pinpoint, some factors may increase the likelihood of TMJ involvement. To better identify these high-risk patients and determine which individuals require regular screening, larger-scale and multicenter studies are essential.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^440051ef]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

ATA risk stratification — intrathyroidal papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and lymph node disease: Within the ATA low-risk category, risk of structural disease recurrence varies by tumor size, ranging from 1%–2% in unilateral papillary microcarcinomas, 4%–6% in multifocal papillary microcarcinomas, 5%–6% in 2–4 cm intrathyroidal PTC, and 8%–10% in intrathyroidal PTC > 4 cm. Among differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with locoregional lymph node metastases (2009 ATA intermediate risk), recurrence risk ranges from 4% with fewer than five metastatic lymph nodes, 5% if all involved nodes are < 0.2 cm, 19% if more than five nodes are involved, 21% if more than 10 nodes are involved, 22% with clinical N1 disease, and 27%–32% if any metastatic lymph node is > 3 cm; these estimates apply to both N1a and N1b disease. Extranodal extension of metastatic nodes has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent/persistent disease, although its independent effect is difficult to estimate because this finding is tightly linked to the number of involved lymph nodes and invasion through the thyroid capsule.

### Risk factors for psoriatic arthritis development in psoriasis patients: myths, pitfalls, and pearls [^38eb41e1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) predominantly emerges in individuals previously diagnosed with psoriasis (PsO), offering a unique opportunity to study the transition from PsO to PsA. This progression provides a window to identify characteristics of PsO patients who may develop PsA, facilitating early intervention and potentially informing prevention and treatment strategies. This review evaluates a wide array of research focusing on various risk factors for PsA development. These factors span demographic characteristics, concomitant diseases and habits, characteristics of skin and nail psoriatic disease, and symptoms and imaging abnormalities associated with PsA. By summarising the existing literature, this review critically examines each risk factor, highlighting the strengths and limitations inherent in the studies. Each section of the review not only summarises the current state of knowledge but also includes an expert opinion, culminating in a final concluding remark. This integration allows physicians to utilise the confluence of established literature and ongoing clinical experience, facilitating a rationalised decision-making process that is deeply informed by both empirical evidence and practical insights.

### Multimorbidity and evidence generation [^c1cbc9db]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Most people with a chronic disease actually have more than one, a condition known as multimorbidity. Despite this, the evidence base to prevent adverse disease outcomes has taken a disease-specific approach. Drawing on a conference, Improving Guidelines for Multimorbid Patients, the goal of this paper is to identify challenges to the generation of evidence to support the care of people with multimorbidity and to make recommendations for improvement. We identified three broad categories of challenges: 1) challenges to defining and measuring multimorbidity; 2) challenges related to the effects of multimorbidity on study design, implementation and analysis; and 3) challenges inherent in studying heterogeneity of treatment effects in patients with differing comorbid conditions. We propose a set of recommendations for consideration by investigators and others (reviewers, editors, funding agencies, policymaking organizations) involved in the creation of evidence for this common type of person that address each of these challenges. The recommendations reflect a general approach that emphasizes broader inclusion (recruitment and retention) of patients with multimorbidity, coupled with more rigorous efforts to measure comorbidity and comorbidity burden and the influence of multimorbidity on outcomes and the effects of therapy. More rigorous examination of heterogeneity of treatment effects requires careful attention to prioritizing the most important comorbid-related questions, and also requires studies that provide greater statistical power than conventional trials have provided. Relatively modest changes in the orientation of current research along these lines can be helpful in pointing to and partially addressing selected knowledge gaps. However, producing a robust evidence base to support patient-centered decision making in complex individuals with multimorbidity, exposed to many different combinations of potentially interacting factors that can modify the risks and benefits of therapies, is likely to require a clinical research enterprise fundamentally restructured to be more fully integrated with routine clinical practice.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Summary of major changes — procedural indications: Antibiotic prophylaxis is reasonable for all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissues or periapical region of teeth or perforation of oral mucosa only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE (Box 3), and is reasonable for procedures on respiratory tract or infected skin, skin structures or musculoskeletal tissue only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE (Box 3). Antibiotic prophylaxis solely to prevent IE is not recommended for gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract procedures, and the writing group advises against body piercing or tattooing for patients with conditions listed in Box 3 because of the possibility of bacteremia.

### Metabolic activity in central neural structures of patients with myocardial injury [^8501965f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial function and perfusion are well‐recognized prognostic parameters for cardiovascular risk assessment. 1, 2 However, the ever‐increasing burden of cardiovascular disease across the globe has prompted efforts to discover new and effective risk predicting biomarkers to confront this challenge. In addition, the demographic shift towards an older population will result in an increase of multimorbid and complex cardiovascular patients at high risk of recurrent events after initial myocardial infarction. 3 The latter further emphasizes the need for an optimization of risk predictors and secondary preventive measures in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). 4 In addition, growing awareness of sexual dimorphism in prevalence, pathophysiological features, and clinical manifestation of CAD highlights the need to reconsider the conventional way of cardiovascular risk assessment. 5, 6

The past decade has seen an increasing interest in the field of neurocardiology. Indeed, cognition, structural brain integrity, and heart‐brain interactions have been suggested as potential players in determining outcomes in cardiovascular patients 7, 8, 9; and a recent investigation identified resting metabolic activity of the amygdala, a neural structure involved in emotional stress, as an independent and robust predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients without known CAD. 10 More important, multiple studies have reported sex differences in brain networks, neuroanatomic structure, and function. Indeed, sex differences in volumes of the major cranial compartments have been described, with women having a higher percentage of gray matter and a lower percentage of white matter than men, 11 whereas a greater overall cortical connectivity in women seems to account for some of the documented sex differences in behavior. 12, 13 Likewise, sexual dimorphism has been extensively documented for various cardiovascular pathological conditions, such as CAD and heart failure. 14, 15 However, a comprehensive analysis of how gender and sex modulate the psychosomatic link between myocardial dysfunction and central stress responses has not been performed. Thus, given (1) the known sex differences in neural structure and function and (2) the sexual dimorphism in cardiovascular disease phenotypes, we sought to investigate the interaction between myocardial injury and metabolic alterations in central neural areas in a cohort of aged individuals with suspected or known CAD.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^7ab0884d]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Table A–1. Critical questions — childhood atherosclerosis and risk factor influences are framed by questions asking whether atherosclerosis and/or atherosclerosis-related target organ damage begins in childhood; whether the presence and the number and/or intensity of risk factor(s) in childhood affect development and/or progression during childhood and in adult life; whether risk factors cluster in childhood and persist into adult life; whether risk factor(s) in children can be decreased and sustained; whether decreases in childhood alter atherosclerosis and target organ damage in childhood or adult life and the development of clinical cardiovascular disease in adult life; whether acquisition of risk factors or risk behaviors can be prevented in children and adolescents; and whether preservation of a low-risk state into later adult life is associated with decreased atherosclerosis-related organ damage and decreased incidence of clinical cardiovascular disease.

### Brugada syndrome: a heterogeneous disease with a common ECG phenotype? [^e747e5a1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Our understanding of Brugada syndrome (BrS) has evolved since the syndrome was first described in 1992. BrS is considered to be a primary inherited channelopathy often involving the inward sodium current and the diagnosis has traditionally required the exclusion of overt structural heart disease. In view of recently published observations about BrS, we propose that the term BrS may actually encompass a heterogeneous group of disorders with a variety of genetic and clinical phenotypes. This disease has classically been described as a primary electrical disorder involving the sodium channel leading to the characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of BrS. We challenge the current understanding and propose that patients with structurally normal hearts, family history of sudden cardiac death, with associated genetic abnormalities only account for a subset of patients with the "Brugada pattern" ECG. There may also be some patients with a diagnosis of BrS who may also have features which overlap with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. In these patients there may be an underlying structural abnormality. In this context, it is possible that catheter ablation may abolish the "Brugada pattern" ECG changes as well as abolishing the risk of life threatening arrhythmias in these patients. Given the recent developments in the field, we propose a novel comprehensive multimodality model for risk stratification and assessment of patients with BrS. Identification of variations of diseases may facilitate more specific risk stratification models and management paradigms in patients with Brugada ECG pattern.

### Genetic factors influencing a neurobiological substrate for psychiatric disorders [^060c9e8f]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Numerous studies have identified regional differences in the brain structure of psychiatric patients and described both transdiagnostic and disorder-specific processes of gray matter (GM) reduction in patients –. One of these reports was the large retrospective meta-analysis of 193 studies by Goodkind et al. that compared 7381 psychiatric patients from six diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety) with 8511 psychiatrically healthy controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Across all diagnoses, they found that GM volumes were lower in the left and right anterior insular cortices (AIC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Subsequentially, they performed structural and functional connectivity analyses and confirmed that these three regions were tightly connected and represent hub nodes of the salience network:, This network serves stimulus selection, controls the focus of attention, and is involved in the selection of goal-directed behavior and in saliency detection of exogenous or internal cues –. Independent studies indicate that functional differences in salience processing in these brain regions are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders and their progression. Eventually, Goodkind et al. hypothesized that lower GM of this network represents a common neurobiological substrate for psychiatric disorders.

However, the etiology of the common substrate reductions has not been investigated so far and remains unclear. One possible explanation involves the loss of GM at disease manifestation and during the further course of disease, implying a regionally specific vulnerability toward a degenerative process — similar to known neurodegenerative disease entities. An alternative explanation implies that reduced GM exists before disease onset, shaped by genetic or early environmental influences such as childhood adversity:Here, premorbid structural abnormalities of the salience network could increase a subject's vulnerability to psychiatric disease. More recently, structural salience network integrity was reported to mediate between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations. A third explanation involves brain-aging processes that occur in a network-dependent way and often with a strong non-linear component: – Here, accelerated aging could increase the disease risk over the lifespan by genetic or environmental factors. All three explanation models might apply in parallel and lead to combined effects at the morphological level.

### Periodontal changes after haematopoietic cell transplantation and the role of conditioning regimen intensity [^f18764cc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral complications, affecting various tissue types, are common in patients undergoing haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Periodontal tissues, defined as the supporting and investing structures of the teeth, including the root cementum, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and gingiva, may also be affected. Gingivitis is the mildest form of periodontal disease, is reversible, and does not affect underlying supporting structures of the teeth. Before treatment is initiated, patients with leukaemia may present with gingival bleeding or gingival hyperplasia as a result of disease infiltration. Periodontitis leads to loss of connective tissue and bone support, and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. The initiation and progression of periodontal disease is determined by a complex interplay between pathogenic microorganisms in the biofilm and the host inflammatory response. Genetic factors and environmental factors, as tobacco use, play a central role. Periodontal disease can occur when the individual's host response is impaired. In HCT patients, the conditioning regimen induces immunosuppression, which increases the risk of periodontal disease. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD), a common complication after allogeneic HCT, is generally treated with corticosteroid therapy which further induces immunosuppression. Another risk for the periodontium includes the oral pain often experienced by HCT recipients, and therefore, maintaining good oral hygiene to remove pathogenic microorganisms can be challenging. On the other hand, increased attention to oral health and the use of antibiotics may decrease the number of periodontal pathogens in the mouth. Professional periodontal care pre-HCT, as recommended by the international guideline for dental care providers, includes dental cleaning, oral hygiene instructions and extraction of severely periodontally involved teeth.

### Clinical features in VEXAS syndrome: a systematic review [^26d84e61]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac disease

Though relatively uncommon, cardiac manifestations warrant vigilance given their potential severity. The predominance of inflammatory over structural cardiac disease suggests systemic inflammation, rather than direct tissue infiltration, as the primary pathogenic mechanism.

Recent data from a large French cohort of 299 patients provides additional insight, demonstrating cardiac events in 2.7% and non-ischemic events in 1.7%. The paper noted that these non-ischemic events occurred during inflammatory flares, suggesting a mechanistic link between systemic inflammation and cardiac pathology. The high mortality rate in cardiac-affected patients, and positive response to targeted anti-inflammatory therapy in some cases, reinforces the need for optimal cardiac surveillance in VEXAS syndrome.

Ophthalmic disease

Our analysis identified orbital inflammation (14.9%), episcleritis (10.7%), scleritis (10.2%), and uveitis (8.9%) as significant components of ocular disease in VEXAS syndrome. While periorbital oedema (20.0%) is a well-recognized manifestation of VEXAS, clinicians should be mindful of the heightened risk of associated ocular damage in patients with evident or suspected orbital inflammation, which may involve dacryoadenitis, choroidal detachment and orbital muscle myositis.

Clinical outcomes suggest a favourable prognosis in patients with isolated ocular involvement when treated with medium-dose glucocorticoids (20–40 mg/day), with rapid and good responses observed in most cases. However, the same study also noted that orbital/ocular manifestations were often relapsing-remitting, with recurrent episodes occurring in 75% of cases, requiring careful monitoring. Notably, the international AIDA network registry study found a significant association between relapsing polychondritis (RP) and orbital/ocular involvement in VEXAS syndrome (relative risk: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.03–5.46, P = 0.048), suggesting potential shared pathogenic mechanisms.

Given the high frequency of ocular involvement, significant recurrence rate and potential for structural damage, patients with VEXAS syndrome and eye disease should undergo regular ophthalmological screening, with particular attention paid to those presenting with RP. Early recognition and appropriate immunosuppressive therapy may help prevent permanent ocular complications in those at risk.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that women most likely to benefit from endocrine therapy are those with one or more of the following: a diagnosis of atypical (ductal or lobular) hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ, an estimated 5-year risk (National Cancer Institute Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool) of at least 3%, a 10-year risk (International Breast Intervention Study/Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Calculator) of at least 5%, or a relative risk of at least four times the population risk for their age group if they are age 40 to 44 years or two times the population risk for their age group if they are age 45 to 69 years.

### Brain damage with heart failure: cardiac biomarker alterations and gray matter decline [^2eedbf77]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In line with these facts and as aforementioned in the introduction, Alosco and Hayesdiscussed that the increased risk for Alzheimer disease in patients with HF might be mediated by specific structural brain alterations. The authors reviewed structural MRI studies in patients with HF and revealed neural atrophy and white matter alterations in the Papez circuit, that is, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, and fornix, and cortical and cerebellar regions that are also involved in Alzheimer disease. The authors discuss that reductions in cerebral blood flow due to HF might lead to structural brain changes. Indeed, patients with HF show reduced cerebral blood flow in regions involved in Alzheimer disease, such as hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex. For example, Alves and colleagues reported significant cerebral blood flow reduction in patients with HF compared with controls in posterior brain regions, encompassing the cuneus, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and right temporo-parietal associative areas. Similar findings strengthen the hypothesis that the link between HF, brain structural changes and increased risk for Alzheimer disease might be mediated by altered brain perfusion. Indeed, brain hemodynamic abnormalities could lead to a shortage of glucose and oxygen to the brain that would in turn trigger a cascade of adverse biochemical events eventually leading to metabolic and tissue damages. However, other mediators of the association between HF and GM injury have been proposed, including pathological changes in the neurohormonal axis, increased inflammation, and nutritional (thiamine) deficiency. Of note, vascular dysfunction is considered as an important early event in Alzheimer disease now, at least partly mediated by vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension. Future studies shall disentangle the interplay between cardiovascular risk factors such as HF and development of Alzheimer disease by applying multimodal amyloid and MR imaging in longitudinal studies and considering also genetic risk factors such as apolipoprotein E status. As cognitive impairment was generally rather low in our cohort without significant group differences (Table 2), one might hypothesize that HF makes patients' brains more sensitive to alterations by Alzheimer disease and lead to relevant cognitive deficits at least in the long run; however, this hypothesis has to be proven by future longitudinal studies.

### The assessment of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis [^6f17e601]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of diathrodial joints, with variable extra-articular manifestations. Joint damage begins early in the course of the disease as a consequence of the active inflammation, and can lead to progressive and irreversible disability. Successful treatment relies on patients attaining low disease activity or a state of remission, which have become achievable goals since the improved use of methotrexate (MTX) and the introduction of biological agents, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. To allow physicians to evaluate the indication and effect of particular therapies, accurate assessment of disease activity is necessary. Disease states in RA can be evaluated by a number of measures. These include signs and symptoms, such as counts of tender and swollen joints; laboratory measures like the acute phase response, which is a direct reflection of the underlying inflammatory activity; and patient-focused variables to measure pain and global assessment of disease activity. Some of these (and additional) measures are used in composite indices to assess disease activity or a disease activity state at any point in time and can inform the physician (and patient) about improvement (or deterioration) in disease activity from or states at a particular level at baseline, to that seen at any specific time point. The accurate assessment of disease is, therefore, an important part of the care of patients with RA. However, it can be complex to perform in the clinical setting, so new and simplified measures have evolved. Next to disease activity, the disease outcome is of utmost importance, in particular disability and quality of life, which are assessed using patient reported questionnaires. Radiographic assessment of structural changes is also an important outcome of RA and mirrors joint damage. The latest developments in the field are discussed and will help to identify patients who can benefit most from today's opportunities of pharmacotherapy, allowing optimization of patient care.

### Pathogenesis and management of Brugada syndrome [^1e5889e0]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by an increased risk of sudden cardiac death owing to ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of structural heart disease. Since the first description of the syndrome > 20 years ago, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved and the strategies to stratify at-risk patients. The development of repolarization-depolarization abnormalities in patients with Brugada syndrome can involve genetic alterations, abnormal neural crest cell migration, improper gap junctional communication, or connexome abnormalities. A common phenotype observed on the electrocardiogram of patients with Brugada syndrome might be the result of different pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, risk stratification of this patient cohort is critical, and although some risk factors for Brugada syndrome have been frequently reported, several others remain unconfirmed. Current clinical guidelines offer recommendations for patients at high risk of developing sudden cardiac death, but the management of those at low risk has not yet been defined. In this Review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms that underlie the development of Brugada syndrome and the current risk stratification and therapeutic options available for these patients.

### Prognostic factors for erosive rheumatoid arthritis [^650e8c32]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) varies among patients, ranging from a mild disease with a small impact on patient's functional capacity to a severe, erosive and catastrophic disease accompanied by subluxations, deformities and subsequent poor quality of life. In clinical practice, the prediction of the outcome of RA is substantial in terms of making the right therapeutic decision for each patient. Reliable prognostic factors of long-term outcome are needed, so as to distinguish patients prone to severe disease course from patients with a smaller probability of severe structural damage. For the former group early aggressive treatment is required, whereas in the latter group remission may be achieved with less aggressive and potentially less toxic treatments. In the present review, the predictive role of demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, immunological and genetic characteristics of RA patients is discussed.

### Radiographic assessment of resectability of locoregional disease in children with high-risk neuroblastoma during neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^e05804e8]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal timing for attempting removal of the primary tumor and regional disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate resectability of the primary tumor and regional disease, as determined radiographically, in children with high-risk neuroblastoma during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Procedure

Patients enrolled in our institutional high-risk neuroblastoma protocol were evaluated prospectively by CT scan and/or MRI to determine the resectability of their primary tumor and regional disease at diagnosis, after two cycles of experimental therapy and after standard induction therapy. Tumors were considered to be unresectable if there was significant involvement with major vascular structures or contiguous organs, or would likely require nephrectomy to remove the entire tumor.

Results

Twenty-four patients were referred prior to surgery for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Seven of 24 (29%) patients were felt to be resectable at diagnosis, with an additional 9 patients becoming resectable after the initial experimental therapy. Thus, overall, 16 of 24 (67%) patients were felt to be resectable by the completion of the initial therapy. Only four additional patients of the remaining eight were considered resectable after the completion of standard induction therapy.

Conclusions

Based on these data, we conclude that complete resection of the primary tumor and regional disease in children with high-risk neuroblastoma can be performed after an initial phase therapy in the majority of patients. Since earlier tumor removal may decrease the chance for the subsequent development of chemotherapy-resistant disease, we are recommending surgical resection as soon as the locoregional disease appears to be resectable.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) / Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) / Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS) expert consensus on risk assessment in cardiac arrhythmias: use the right tool for the right outcome, in the right population [^150bc6e2]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) management and testing — risk signals, exercise guidance, and tools are described: in ARVC, the most important features characterized as the high arrhythmic risk include the electric instability, genotype-positive, extent of structural involvement, cardiac syncope, the presence of multiple mutations, and the history of competitive or endurance exercise; in patients without prior VA, an available online prediction model was devised to estimate the risk of VA and to guide the decisions of ICD implantation as primary prevention (www.arvcrisk.com); there is a dose-dependent relationship between endurance exercise and the disease onset and progression in confirmed ARVC patients; exercise restriction is recommended to prevent disease progression and SCD in confirmed ARVC patients with ICD and genotype-positive relatives, and in general, high-level or endurance exercise is not recommended in confirmed ARVC patients or at risk; ambulatory ECG monitoring is crucial to detect the PVCs burden or the presence of non-sustained VT, which also provide prognostic information in ARVC; echocardiography and cardiac MRI provide accurate measurements of right ventricular function, and abnormal cardiac MRI was an independent predictor of clinical events; an EPS may provide help distinguish ARVC from idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract VT, and the positive inducibility of EPS can predict any ICD therapy, including VF, and can be an important parameter for risk stratification in patients with ARVC.

### Definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for neurosarcoidosis: from the neurosarcoidosis consortium consensus group [^3f5bfdfe]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

The Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus Group, an expert panel of physicians experienced in the management of patients with sarcoidosis and neurosarcoidosis, engaged in an iterative process to define neurosarcoidosis and develop a practical diagnostic approach to patients with suspected neurosarcoidosis. This panel aimed to develop a consensus clinical definition of neurosarcoidosis to enhance the clinical care of patients with suspected neurosarcoidosis and to encourage standardization of research initiatives that address this disease.

Observations

The work of this collaboration included a review of the manifestations of neurosarcoidosis and the establishment of an approach to the diagnosis of this disorder. The proposed consensus diagnostic criteria, which reflect current knowledge, provide definitions for possible, probable, and definite central and peripheral nervous system sarcoidosis. The definitions emphasize the need to evaluate patients with findings suggestive of neurosarcoidosis for alternate causal factors, including infection and malignant neoplasm. Also emphasized is the need for biopsy, whenever feasible and advisable according to clinical context and affected anatomy, of nonneural tissue to document the presence of systemic sarcoidosis and support a diagnosis of probable neurosarcoidosis or of neural tissue to support a diagnosis of definite neurosarcoidosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Diverse disease presentations and lack of specificity of relevant diagnostic tests contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. This uncertainty is compounded by the absence of a pathognomonic histologic tissue examination. The diagnostic criteria we propose are designed to focus investigations on NS as accurately as possible, recognizing that multiple pathophysiologic pathways may lead to the clinical manifestations we currently term NS. Research recognizing the clinical heterogeneity of this diagnosis may open the door to identifying meaningful biologic factors that may ultimately contribute to better treatments.

### High-risk multimorbidity patterns on the road to cardiovascular mortality [^ad91d8b1]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Noncommunicable (or chronic) diseases (NCDs) such as dorsalgia, hypertension, respiratory diseases or diabetes affect a large fraction of the world's population and decrease the quality of life of people burdened by them. For example, in 2004, almost 50% of the population of the USA was suffering from at least one chronic condition, and in 2014, approximately 25% of the adults had been diagnosed with more than one NCD, with both numbers strongly increasing with age. Besides having a negative impact on people's well-being, NCDs also pose a substantial burden on the healthcare systems of countries. Apart from combatting common risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyle and diet, which many NCDs are attributed to, early detection and management play a key role in decreasing the burden of chronic diseases. Personalised (or stratified) medicine promises to make care more efficient by tailoring treatments individually to patients while taking their individual risk profile for potential future diseases into account. A necessary precondition to enter into this new era of medicine is a deepened understanding of how the long-term developments of multiple diseases condition each other.

The field of network medicine holds as central tenet that diseases cannot be studied independently from each other but arise from complex interactions between molecular units in the human body in terms of discretised structures such as protein–protein, metabolic, regulatory and RNA networks. For example, the fact that many diseases tend to be comorbid, i.e. that they tend to co-occur in patients, can be understood based on the disease-causing genes or pathways shared by the comorbid diseases. However, not all diseases linked by shared genes exhibit significant comorbidities, as different mutations of the same gene can have different consequences. Conversely, not all comorbidities can be explained from molecular data. One reason is that comorbidities can also be the result of the exposure to the same environmental risk factors, for example, due to a particular lifestyle. In addition, present data on molecular interactions is far from being complete.

### Disease assessment in systemic vasculitis [^df63ec4d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides are complex multi-system disorders with many overlapping clinical features. Their outcome has been transformed by effective immunosuppression, preventing death in over 70% of cases. The quality of survival is affected by the disease course, which is characterized by a significant likelihood of relapse in 38%, chronic effects from the disease and its treatment, as well as emerging or worsening comorbidity, all of which contribute to the patient's clinical condition and outcome. Whilst imaging and laboratory testing including histology are important aspects of diagnosis, they are of limited value in assessing response to therapy or subsequent disease course. We have developed standardized validated clinical methods to quantify disease activity and damage; we are developing effective measures of patient experience to complement these procedures. This approach provides a rational basis for clinical management as well as being essential in the conduct of clinical trials and studies in vasculitis, by providing reproducible definitions of relapse, remission and response to therapy for patients with systemic vasculitis. Clinical assessment remains the current gold standard for evaluating disease progress, but requires regular training to ensure standardization. The development of biomarkers in future may produce a more accurate description of disease and identify potential targets for therapy as well as predictors of response to drugs.

### Indications and management of preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic conditions: a committee opinion [^fabef6df]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

Nondisclosure preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic conditions methods — two approaches are contrasted with explicit advantages and disadvantages. In the nondisclosure/direct approach, "Embryos are only excluded from transfer if they are affected with the variant of interest and/or aneuploid," but "The disease status of the at-risk individual is determined by the laboratory and, therefore, may be accidentally disclosed," and there are "Logistic complications involved with the nondisclosure of cycle outcome measures to avoid prediction of patient status." In the exclusion-based/indirect approach, "The disease status of the at-risk individual is not known to any party and, therefore, cannot be accidentally disclosed," but "Embryos are excluded on the basis of a 50% risk of disease (using linkage analysis to determine the affected and unaffected haplotypes) rather than the presence of disease; therefore, embryos may be unnecessarily excluded if the patient did not inherit the variant from their affected parent."

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^901a66c9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals — ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1 — identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Patient and caregiver factors in ambulatory incident reports: a mixed-methods analysis [^280a2fda]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Objectives

Patients and caregivers are the primary stakeholders in ambulatory safety, given they perform daily chronic disease self-management, medication administration and outpatient follow-up. However, little attention has been given to their role in adverse events. We identified themes related to patient and caregiver factors and challenges in ambulatory safety incident reports from a Patient Safety Organization.

Methods

We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of ambulatory incident reports submitted to the Collaborative Healthcare Patient Safety Organization, including 450 hospitals or clinic members in 13 US states. We included events that had patient and/or caregiver behavioural, socioeconomic and clinical factors that may have contributed to the event. Two members of the team independently coded patient/caregiver factors, with dual coding of 20% of events. We then conducted a 'frequent item set' analysis to identify which factors most frequently co-occurred. We applied inductive analysis to the most frequent sets to interpret themes. Our team included a diverse stakeholder advisory council of patients, caregivers and healthcare staff.

Results

We analysed 522 incident reports and excluded 73 for a final sample of 449 events. Our co-occurrence analysis found the following three themes: (1) clinical advice may conflict with patient priorities; (2) breakdowns in communication and patient education cause medication adverse events and (3) patients with disabilities are vulnerable to the external environment.

Conclusions

Ambulatory safety reports capture both structural and behavioural factors contributing to adverse events. Actionable takeaways include the following: improving clinician counselling of patients to convey medical advice to elicit priorities, enhanced education regarding medication adverse events and expanding safety precautions for patients with disabilities at home. Ambulatory safety reporting must include patients in reporting and event review for better mitigation of future harm.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, risk factors, and outcome trials: comparisons with cardiovascular disease [^47f7a50e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem and now ranks fifth in terms of the global burden of disease. Although COPD is a disease that is characterized by progressive respiratory symptoms and functional decline, exacerbations pose the greatest risk for morbidity and early mortality, have a dramatic effect on quality of life, and are the most significant source of health care expenditure. To improve survival and reduce costs, it is critical to develop effective programs designed to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations for these patients. With limited health care resources, efficient and effective management of COPD ideally involves identifying and focusing efforts on individuals at particular risk. In the development of an appropriate multimodal strategy, lessons could be learned from the evolution of guidelines and management of cardiovascular disease, in particular heart failure, which has many parallels with COPD in terms of prevalence, prognosis, and impact on patient quality of life. There is a need for large prospective trials in COPD, based on hard clinical outcomes such as death, which, together with physician and patient education, will help to drive improvements in clinical management.

### A new piece to help solve the interstitial lung disease diagnostic puzzle [^2650786b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic journey for those with interstitial lung disease (ILD) is often complex, protracted, and overwhelming, impacting physical, emotional, and financial domains. A delay in diagnosis ranges between 7 months and 2 years, leading to lost time in initiating therapies to slow disease progression. Despite significant advances over the past 20 years and the development of iterative versions of diagnostic guidelines, an "accurate" diagnosis remains elusive and delayed for many patients, likely reflecting the complexity of the pathobiology and similarity of clinical manifestations among many ILDs.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with interstitial lung abnormalities is comprehensive, relying upon a thorough history to delineate symptoms, the course of disease, and prior environmental and pharmacologic exposures that may incite lung fibrosis, as well as prior or current medical conditions with pulmonary manifestations. A diagnostic algorithm has been established with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan as a key element, which has a sensitivity > 95% for the detection of ILD and allows for a degree of correlation between the radiographic pattern with predicted histopathologic correlates (e.g. usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP], nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia). Components of data from the history, physiology, and radiology are like pieces of a puzzle. Unto themselves the pieces do not provide a distinct picture, but when placed together, these pieces may provide a more clear-cut picture and lead to a confident clinical diagnosis.

For patients with ILD in whom a confident specific diagnosis cannot be made based on their clinical and radiographic presentation, additional invasive testing is recommended to more accurately classify the ILD. Specific classification may inform on an expected disease course and associated comorbidities, as well as allow for initiation of approved therapies. Surgical lung biopsy has been the "gold standard" for diagnosis of ILD but is not without its interpretive limitations, morbidity, and mortality. The histopathologic pattern is not diagnostic of one disease as histopathology patterns of UIP, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and organizing pneumonia can be present in a variety of ILDs. As in a puzzle, this piece must be integrated with others to most accurately diagnosis patients. To augment the diagnostic accuracy, multidisciplinary discussions with experienced clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists is recommended. However, implementing this process efficiently into an operational workflow can be challenging for a busy clinical practice.

### Correlation between structural heart disease and cardiac SARS-CoV-2 manifestations [^c347144a]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. Despite intensive research and a plethora of newly published data regarding underlying pathomechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and its clinical course, there is an unmet need to identify specific vulnerable groups prone to severe course of the disease by the affection of organs other than the lungs. The viral spike protein infects cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) that serves as a receptor; ACE is a crucial mediator of the renin-angiotensin system –.

As the most prevalent cell types in the heart – namely cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells — express ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be accompanied by cardiovascular involvement.

Infection of endothelial cells may result in endothelial dysfunction with prothrombotic events resulting in myocardial infarction or Takotsubo syndrome. In vitro studies suggest possible infection of cardiomyocytes with SARS-CoV-2 causing cell death and dysfunction indicated by elevated serum levels of troponin T and NT-proBNP and impact on the cardiac conduction system. Infection of fibroblasts might promote cardiac remodeling resulting in fibrosis and impairment of cardiac function.

COVID-19 patients with cardiac involvement exhibit an aggravated clinical course with poor prognosis, including higher morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear whether these symptoms occur due to (a) viral infection of the myocardium or (b) secondary myocardial injury due to a fierce cytokine storm induced by the innate immune system in response to the infection. Despite increasing evidence regarding cardiac involvement in COVID-19, it remains unclear which patients are at high risk for cardiac involvement. ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes is increased in patients with structural heart disease, particularly in patients with cardiac hypertrophy. Expression levels of this receptor crucial for cellular SARS-CoV 2 infection might determine cardiac involvement in COVID-19.

In this study, we provide evidence for a correlation between SHD, altered ACE2 receptor expression, and cardiac SARS-CoV-2 manifestation. These findings suggest that structural heart disease may be considered a distinct risk factor for cardiac involvement upon SARS-CoV2 infections, potentially leading to a severe clinical course.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^2719f529]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Prognosis — risk of death and life‑threatening events states that structural heart disease and primary electrical disease are major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and overall mortality in patients with syncope; orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of death compared with the general population; young patients in whom structural or electrical heart disease have been excluded and who are affected by reflex syncope have an excellent prognosis; most deaths and many poor outcomes seem related to the severity of the underlying disease rather than to syncope per se; and several clinical factors able to predict outcome have been identified in some prospective population studies involving a validation cohort.

### Cardiovascular risk in rheumatoid arthritis: how to lower the risk? [^41155dd7]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) carry an excess risk for cardiovascular disease, which is comparable to the risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mechanisms involved are partly related to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, disease-associated inflammation and undertreatment of traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Since atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, the auto-immune mediated inflammation observed in RA patients contributes to increased endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and activation and vascular migration of leukocytes. This concept is underscored by the CVD risk reduction that is seen by anti-inflammatory disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and TNFα inhibitors. The evidence for underdiagnosis and undertreatment of traditional CVD risk factors in RA strengthens the potential benefit of structured CVD risk management in these patients. Current cardiovascular guidelines recommend screening and treatment of CVD risk factors in RA patients, without well defined treatment targets. At present, there is a lack of scientific evidence to establish treatment targets for CVD risk factors in RA. Therefore, expanding research regarding screening and treatment of traditional CVD risk factors in RA patients is needed.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) intrathoracic radiographic groups and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging — radiographic group A involves mediastinal infiltration that obscures discrete lymph nodes, group B involves measurable mediastinal node enlargement, and the last two groups have normal mediastinal nodes; in radiographic group C, a central tumor or suspected N1 disease makes the chance of N2,3 nodal involvement relatively high (20%-25%) and further confirmation is needed, whereas in the final group (peripheral clinical stage I tumor) the chance of distant metastases or mediastinal involvement is quite low. PET imaging has emerged as a particularly useful test in lung cancer and can be used to help confirm or render less likely a diagnosis, detect extrathoracic metastases in asymptomatic or subtly symptomatic patients, provide information on mediastinal status, and indicate tumor metabolic activity; PET scanning is usually performed for a combination of reasons and the data supporting its role have increased since the previous guidelines.

### Risk assessment for cardiovascular disease with nontraditional risk factors: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^083597d5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit — High certainty is when available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations assessing health outcomes, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by future studies. Moderate certainty is when evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes but confidence is constrained by factors such as the number, size, or quality of individual studies, inconsistency of findings, limited generalizability to routine primary care, or lack of coherence in the chain of evidence, and as more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change enough to alter the conclusion. Low certainty is when available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes due to limitations such as limited number or size of studies, important flaws in study design or methods, inconsistency of findings, gaps in the chain of evidence, findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice, or lack of information on important health outcomes; more information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. The USPSTF defines certainty as the likelihood that its assessment of net benefit is correct and defines net benefit as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population.
