## Question

Akathasia treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about akathisia treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing akathisia from look-alikes. Then, I should verify the causative agent and immediately implement dose reduction or switching when feasible. Next, I will review first-line adjunctive pharmacotherapies with the best evidence, followed by second-line options and special populations. After that, I need to consider tardive akathisia and refractory cases, including ECT. Finally, I should outline monitoring, prevention, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because akathisia is frequently misattributed to anxiety, agitation, or insomnia. I should use a validated scale such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale to quantify subjective distress, objective movements, and global severity, and I should screen for comorbid anxiety, depression, and suicidality given the distress and risk associated with akathisia [^08112937] [^2d81c2db].

> Wait, let me verify the causative agent and the fundamentals before adding drugs. The most effective first step is to reduce the dose of the offending antipsychotic or switch to an agent with lower akathisia liability, ideally within the same class or to a partial agonist with careful cross-titration; this aligns with APA guidance and is supported by clinical practice reviews emphasizing dose adjustment and switching as core strategies [^84386108] [^62ef6a9d] [^531905aa].

> Next, I should review adjunctive pharmacotherapy with the strongest evidence. Hold on, I should verify the hierarchy from the 2024 network meta-analyses: mirtazapine 15 mg/day for at least 5 days, vitamin B6 600–1200 mg/day for at least 5 days, and biperiden 6 mg/day for at least 14 days show the largest and most consistent benefit versus placebo, with vitamin B6 often having the best tolerability profile; trazodone 50–100 mg/day, mianserin 15 mg/day, and propranolol 20–50 mg/day are reasonable alternatives with moderate effect sizes, though propranolol's efficacy may be underestimated in short-duration trials and requires adequate treatment duration [^b00242a1] [^d7aabe4d] [^619b1753] [^c5ce2e5a].

> I need to ensure I weigh benefits against side effects when choosing among these. Mirtazapine can help when comorbid depression or insomnia is present but may cause sedation and weight gain; vitamin B6 is attractive for its favorable tolerability; biperiden is effective but carries anticholinergic burden; propranolol is non-sedating but contraindicated in asthma, bradycardia, and heart block; benzodiazepines like clonazepam can be used short term but have dependence and sedation risks, and the evidence base is smaller and older [^619b1753] [^d483e48b] [^eccbe8d9].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take a beta-blocker or needs a faster-acting option. In acute distress, short-term benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or clonazepam can provide rapid relief, and IV diazepam has case-level evidence for immediate symptom reduction in severe cases; however, I should confirm that benzodiazepines are used cautiously and short term due to sedation, falls, and dependence risks [^d483e48b] [^ca2944b3].

> I should double-check anticholinergics because the evidence is mixed. Older Cochrane reviews found no randomized trials to support anticholinergics for akathisia, yet the 2024 network meta-analysis suggests biperiden is effective; reconciling this, I will consider biperiden when other options are contraindicated or ineffective, monitor for cognitive and anticholinergic adverse effects, and avoid routine prophylaxis [^4fedcc6b] [^286ddae8] [^b00242a1].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I should prioritize non-pharmacologic strategies and dose reduction; if medication is needed, vitamin B6 is a reasonable option given its tolerability, while avoiding teratogenic agents. In older adults, I should start low and go slow, favor vitamin B6 or low-dose mirtazapine, and avoid anticholinergics when possible due to cognitive risks. In children and adolescents, propranolol or diphenhydramine may be considered with careful monitoring, and dose reduction or switching of the antipsychotic remains foundational [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine tardive akathisia, which persists despite withdrawal of the offending agent. Evidence is sparse; case series suggest mirtazapine, clonidine, or ECT may help in refractory cases. I should confirm that standard acute akathisia treatments are tried first, and if symptoms remain severe and life-threatening, consider ECT, documenting the rationale given the limited but encouraging case-level evidence [^d7aabe4d] [^372265b6] [^06c66e23].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and prevention. Akathisia can emerge within days to weeks of antipsychotic initiation or dose escalation, so I should reassess at 1–2 weeks and after any dose change, track suicidality and adherence, and use measurement-based care with BARS. To prevent recurrence, prefer lower effective antipsychotic doses, avoid antipsychotic polypharmacy when possible, and educate patients to report inner restlessness early [^08112937] [^0eb0880f] [^2d81c2db].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. First, confirm diagnosis with BARS and screen for suicidality. Second, reduce the antipsychotic dose or switch to a lower-liability agent. Third, if symptoms persist, add an evidence-based adjunct such as vitamin B6 600 mg/day, mirtazapine 15 mg/day, or biperiden 6 mg/day, chosen based on comorbidities and tolerability. Fourth, consider propranolol 20–50 mg/day, trazodone 50–100 mg/day, or mianserin 15 mg/day if first-line options are unsuitable. Fifth, reserve short-term benzodiazepines for acute distress. Sixth, for refractory or tardive cases, consider clonidine or ECT. Throughout, monitor BARS, vitals, and adverse effects, and adjust the plan iteratively [^84386108] [^b00242a1] [^de025cef].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and correct any overstatements. The 2024 network meta-analyses provide the most robust comparative data to date, but many trials are small and short, and some agents like cyproheptadine show conflicting results; thus, I need to communicate uncertainty, tailor choices to patient context, and document shared decision-making, especially when evidence is low or very low quality [^b00242a1] [^c5ce2e5a] [^45fd7a6b].

---

Akathisia is best managed by **reducing or switching the offending antipsychotic** [^84386108] and adding a **beta-blocker (propranolol)** [^b00242a1] or a **benzodiazepine (lorazepam)** [^d483e48b] for rapid relief. If symptoms persist, consider **mirtazapine** [^b00242a1] or **vitamin B6** [^de025cef] as adjuncts. Anticholinergics are not recommended for akathisia [^4fedcc6b] [^286ddae8]. Monitor closely for suicidality and adherence, and escalate to ECT for refractory cases [^d7aabe4d].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological strategies are **first-line** and should be prioritized:

- **Dose reduction**: Lower the antipsychotic dose to the minimum effective level [^84386108] [^62ef6a9d].

- **Medication switch**: Switch to an antipsychotic with lower akathisia risk (e.g. quetiapine, clozapine) [^84386108] [^531905aa].

- **Patient education**: Explain akathisia, monitor for worsening symptoms, and reinforce adherence [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments are **adjunctive** and should be tailored to severity, comorbidities, and patient preference:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | Propranolol | High | First-line; start 10–20 mg BID, titrate to 40–80 mg/day; avoid in asthma, bradycardia, or heart block [^b00242a1] [^eccbe8d9] |
| Benzodiazepines | Lorazepam, clonazepam | Moderate | Rapid relief; use short-term due to dependence risk [^d483e48b] |
| Antidepressants | Mirtazapine, trazodone | Moderate | Useful with comorbid depression or insomnia; mirtazapine 15–30 mg/day [^b00242a1] [^d562f2ef] |
| Vitamin B6 | Pyridoxine | Moderate | 600–1200 mg/day; favorable tolerability [^b00242a1] [^4d1ded39] |
| Anticholinergics | Benztropine, biperiden | Low | Not recommended; limited evidence and anticholinergic burden [^4fedcc6b] [^286ddae8] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Tardive akathisia**: Persistent despite antipsychotic withdrawal; consider ECT in refractory cases [^d7aabe4d] [^372265b6].

- **Suicidality**: Akathisia increases suicide risk; monitor closely and treat aggressively [^2d81c2db] [^cfac60d7].

- **Pediatric patients**: Use propranolol or benzodiazepines cautiously; monitor growth and development [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess with the **Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)** [^08112937] to track severity and treatment response. Monitor for **adverse effects**, including sedation, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms [^2637883b]. Continue to assess suicidality, adherence, and functional status at each visit [^2637883b].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

APA 2020 recommends **dose reduction, switching antipsychotics, and adding a beta-blocker or benzodiazepine** [^84386108]. VA/DoD guidelines endorse **propranolol** as a first-line adjunct, with dosing up to 120 mg/day [^eccbe8d9]. Network meta-analyses support **mirtazapine and vitamin B6** as effective alternatives [^b00242a1] [^de025cef].

---

Akathisia management centers on **antipsychotic adjustment** with adjunctive propranolol or benzodiazepines, reserving mirtazapine or vitamin B6 for persistent cases. Close monitoring and individualized care are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of treatment strategies for antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^45fd7a6b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antipsychotics are the treatment of choice for schizophrenia, but they often induce akathisia. However, comparative efficacy of treatment strategies for akathisia remains unclear.

Design

We performed a systematic review and network meta-analyses (PROSPERO CRD42023450720). We searched multiple databases on July 24, 2023. We included randomized clinical trials comparing 1 or more treatment strategies for antipsychotic-induced akathisia against each other or control conditions. We included adults with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders treated with antipsychotics. The primary outcome was akathisia severity at posttreatment. Secondary outcomes included akathisia response, all-cause dropout, psychotic symptoms, and long-term akathisia severity. We synthesized data in random effects frequentist network meta-analyses and assessed confidence in the evidence using CINeMA.

Results

We identified 19 trials with 661 randomized participants (mean age 35.9 [standard deviation 12.0]; 36.7% [195 of 532] women). No trials examined dose reduction or switching of antipsychotics. Findings suggested 5-HT2A antagonists (k = 6, n = 108; standardized mean difference [SMD] -1.07 [95% confidence interval, -1.42; -0.71]) and beta-blockers (k = 8, n = 105; SMD -0.46 [-0.85; -0.07]) may improve akathisia severity, but confidence in the evidence was deemed low. We also found that benzodiazepines (k = 2, n = 13; SMD -1.62 [-2.64; -0.59]) and vitamin B6 (k = 3, n = 67; SMD -0.99 [-1.49; -0.50]) might also be beneficial, but confidence in the evidence was very low. Analyses of secondary outcomes did not provide additional insights.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that 5-HT2A antagonists, beta-blockers, and with a lesser certainty, benzodiazepines, and vitamin B6 might improve akathisia. Given the low to very low confidence in the evidence of add-on agents and the absence of evidence of their long-term efficacy, careful consideration of side effects is warranted. These recommendations are extremely preliminary and further trials are needed.

### Benzodiazepines for neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia [^d483e48b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic-induced akathisia is one of the most common and distressing early-onset adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs, being associated with poor compliance with treatment, and thus, ultimately, to an increase risk of relapse. This review assesses the role of benzodiazepines in the pharmacological treatment of this problem.

Objectives

To determine the effects of benzodiazepines versus placebo for people with neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia.

Search Strategy

Biological Abstracts (January 1982-March 1999), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3 1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 2001), EMBASE (January 1980-March 1999), LILACS (January 1982-March 1999), MEDLINE (January 1964-March 1999), PsycLIT (January 1974-March 1999), and SCISEARCH were searched. Further references were sought from published trials and their authors.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo for people with antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers, working independently, selected, quality assessed and extracted data. These data were then analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. For homogeneous dichotomous data the fixed effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, reviewers calculated weighted mean differences.

Main Results

Two small (total N = 27) randomised controlled trials were included. By seven to 14 days, there was a reduction in symptoms for those patients receiving clonazepam compared with placebo (2 RCTs, N = 26, RR 0.09 CI 0.01 to 0.6, NNT 1.2 CI 0.9 to 1.5). No significant difference was found for adverse events (2 RCTs, N = 26, RR 3.00 CI 0.2 to 62) or the need for anticholinergic medication (2 RCTs, N = 26, RR 1.56 CI 0.9 to 2.7). No one left the two studies early. Data on mental, social and family outcomes could not be pooled and there was little or no data on user satisfaction, deaths, violence, criminal behaviour and costs.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Over a short follow-up period, the use of benzodiazepines may reduce the symptoms of antipsychotic-induced acute akathisia. This review highlights the need for well designed, conducted and reported clinical trials to address the claims of open studies.

### The causes of underdiagnosing akathisia [^3c48cf61]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.

### Anticholinergics for neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia [^4fedcc6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic-induced akathisia is one of the most common and distressing early-onset adverse effects of first generation 'typical' antipsychotic drugs. It is associated with poor compliance with treatment, and thus, ultimately, with an increased risk of relapse. We assessed the role of anticholinergic drugs as an adjunct therapy to standard antipsychotic medication in the pharmacological treatment of this adverse effect.

Objectives

To review anticholinergic drugs for neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 1999), Biological Abstracts (1982–1999), CINAHL (1982–1999), Cochrane Library (Issue 4 1999), EMBASE (1980–1999), LILACS (1982–1999), MEDLINE (1966–1999) and PsycLIT (1974–1999). References of all identified studies were inspected for more trials and we contacted first authors. Each included study was sought as a citation on the Science Citation Index database. For this 2005–6 update, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (July 2005).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials of adjunctive anticholinergic drugs in addition to antipsychotic medication compared with placebo, for people with neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We quality assessed and extracted data independently. We calculated the fixed effects relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) for homogeneous dichotomous data on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

We identified no relevant randomised controlled trials.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is no reliable evidence to support or refute the use of anticholinergics for people suffering from neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia. Akathisia is a distressing movement disorder that remains highly prevalent in people with schizophrenia, both in the developed and developing world. This review highlights the need for well designed, conducted and reported clinical trials to address the claims of open studies as regards the effects of the anticholinergic group of drugs for akathisia.

### Anticholinergics for neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia [^286ddae8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic-induced akathisia is one of the most common and distressing early-onset adverse effects of conventional antipsychotic drugs, being associated with poor compliance with treatment, and thus, ultimately, with an increased risk of relapse. This review assesses the role of anticholinergic drugs as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic medication in the pharmacological treatment of this problem.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b00242a1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Antipsychotic-induced akathisia (AIA) occurs in 14% to 35% of patients treated with antipsychotics and is associated with increased suicide and decreased adherence in patients with schizophrenia. However, no comprehensive review and network meta-analysis has been conducted to compare the efficacy of treatments for AIA.

Objective

To compare the efficacy associated with AIA treatments.

Data Sources

Three databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched by multiple researchers for double-blind randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing active drugs for the treatment of AIA with placebo or another treatment between May 30 and June 18, 2023.

Study Selection

Selected studies were RCTs that compared adjunctive drugs for AIA vs placebo or adjunctive treatment in patients treated with antipsychotics fulfilling the criteria for akathisia, RCTs with sample size of 10 patients or more, only trials in which no additional drugs were administered during the study, and RCTs that used a validated akathisia score. Trials with missing data for the main outcome (akathisia score at the end points) were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction and synthesis were performed, estimating standardized mean differences (SMDs) through pairwise and network meta-analysis with a random-effects model. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the severity of akathisia measured by a validated scale at the last available end point.

Results

Fifteen trials involving 492 participants compared 10 treatments with placebo. Mirtazapine (15 mg/d for ≥ 5 days; SMD, -1.20; 95% CI, -1.83 to -0.58), biperiden (6 mg/d for ≥ 14 days; SMD, -1.01; 95% CI, -1.69 to -0.34), vitamin B6 (600–1200 mg/d for ≥ 5 days; SMD, -0.92; 95% CI, -1.57 to -0.26), trazodone (50 mg/d for ≥ 5 days; SMD, -0.84; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.14), mianserin (15 mg/d for ≥ 5 days; SMD, -0.81; 95% CI, -1.44 to -0.19), and propranolol (20 mg/d for ≥ 6 days; SMD, -0.78; 95% CI, -1.35 to -0.22) were associated with greater efficacy than placebo, with low to moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 34.6%; 95% CI, 0.0%-71.1%). Cyproheptadine, clonazepam, zolmitriptan, and valproate did not yield significant effects. Eight trials were rated as having low risk of bias; 2, moderate risk; and 5, high risk. Sensitivity analyses generally confirmed the results for all drugs except for cyproheptadine and propranolol. No association between effect sizes and psychotic severity was found.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, mirtazapine, biperiden, and vitamin B6 were associated with the greatest efficacy for AIA, with vitamin B6 having the best efficacy and tolerance profile. Trazodone, mianserin, and propranolol appeared as effective alternatives with slightly less favorable efficacy and tolerance profiles. These findings should assist prescribers in selecting an appropriate medication for treating AIA.

### Central action β-blockers versus placebo for neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia [^f62f7399]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic-induced akathisia is a common, distressing early-onset adverse effect of neuroleptic drugs. It has been associated with poor treatment compliance and an increased risk of relapse.

Objectives

To determine the effects of central action beta-blockers compared with placebo for people with neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia.

Search Strategy

We updated previous searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (May 1999), Biological Abstracts (January 1982-March 1999), The Cochrane Library (issue 3 1999), EMBASE (January 1980-March 1999), LILACS (January 1982-March 1999), MEDLINE (January 1964-March 1999), PsycLIT (January 1974-March 1999), and SCISEARCH by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (November 2003). We sought further references from published trials and their authors.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials of central action beta-blockers versus placebo for people with neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Working independently, we selected and critically appraised studies, extracted data and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) with the number needed to treat (NNT). For continuous data we calculated Weighted Mean Differences (WMD).

Main Results

We identified three randomised controlled trials (total n = 51, maximum duration 72 hours). We were not able to draw any firm conclusions from such a small data set. In the two 48 hour studies no-one experienced full remission of akathisia, and only one person in each group experienced a 50% remission (n = 11, 1 RCT, RR 1.04 CI 0.59–1.83). One trial stated that no adverse effects occurred in the two groups (n = 20, 1 RCT, RR not estimable). The 72 hour study did not show any statistical difference between the central acting beta-blocker (ICI 118,551) and placebo for the outcome 'no change/worse' (n = 10, RR 0.22 CI 0.0 to 1.5).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There are insufficient data to recommend beta-blocking drugs for akathisia. These drugs are experimental for this problem, and this review highlights the need for more evaluative studies.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2d81c2db]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines akathisia as "subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied by objective excessive movements (such as continuous leg movements, rocking from foot to foot, pacing, or an inability to sit down and remain still)". This movement disorder primarily occurs in patients treated with antipsychotics, where it is known as antipsychotic-induced akathisia (AIA). A meta-analysispublished in 2019 that compared the tolerability of 32 antipsychotics concluded that first-generation antipsychotics carry a higher risk of inducing akathisia compared with second-generation antipsychotics, with risks ranging from 24-fold (zuclopenthixol, a first-generation antipsychotic) to 1.9-fold (aripiprazole, a second-generation antipsychotic). Overall, the prevalence of AIA ranges from 14% to 35% based on studies involving patients treated with antipsychotics. This adverse effect has significant clinical implications, including an increased risk of suicide (which is the primary cause of mortality in early schizophrenia) and nonadherence to treatment (which is the primary cause of relapse).

The primary clinical recommendations for treating AIA are to consider antipsychotic monotherapy, to reduce the antipsychotic dose, and/or to switch to an antipsychotic associated with a lower risk of akathisia. However, these options are not always feasible in clinical practice, and addressing akathisia remains challenging in many cases. Therefore, the use of adjunctive drugs is necessary to alleviate AIA. Because of the lack of comprehensive network meta-analyses that examine the efficacy of treatments in alleviating akathisia, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of drugs in treating AIA. A secondary objective was to assess the acceptability (defined as the proportion of dropout due to tolerance issues) and tolerability (defined by the frequency of adverse events) of each drug.

### Akathisia – seen from the patients' perspective [^1fa36128]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Akathisia is a side-effect that continues to affect a large percentage of psychiatric patients though the focus over recent years has moved away from extrapyramidal side-effects to metabolic problems. As cognitive behavioural therapy has become an integrated part of the management plan for psychotic patients an increased understanding of patients' interpretation of their symptoms and side-effects are encouraged. This case series illustrates different views that patients take on medication induced side-effects.

### Treating movement disorders and akathisia as side effects of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy [^531905aa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most common reasons for switching antipsychotic medication is to reduce the burden of side effects, particularly movement disorders and akathisia associated with typical antipsychotics. Adjusting the antipsychotic dose and, if necessary, switching treatment to an antipsychotic with a low extrapyramidal symptom liability may help to optimize the clinical management of schizophrenia. Switching from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics involves considering a variety of factors relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

Regarding medical management for Huntington's disease, more specifically with respect to management of akathisia and irritability, EHDN 2019 guidelines recommend to assess for an iatrogenic cause of akathisia as a priority.
Recognize that tetrabenazine
, neuroleptics, and SSRIs may cause akathisia in HD. Consider reducing the dose or changing the treatment.

### Akathisia: an updated review focusing on second-generation antipsychotics [^709ba04e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a brief description of the pathophysiology of akathisia, the challenges of diagnosing and treating this condition, and potential associated clinical issues. Also, to provide a review of the literature on the incidence of drug-induced akathisia associated with the use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs).

English-language literature with no date restrictions cited in PubMed was searched for the keywords akathisia, placebo, neuroleptic, or haloperidol, and the generic names of SGAs (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, or aripiprazole).

Study Selection

Limits were set to search clinical trials, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials reviewing data from adult schizophrenia or bipolar disorder clinical trials. Studies including SGA comparisons with placebo and with FGAs, and also between SGAs themselves, were selected. Studies that specifically assessed akathisia (either subjectively or objectively or both) were included. Studies reporting generalized results pertaining to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were excluded.

Data Extraction

The incidence of akathisia, EPS rating scores, and required medications for the management of movement disorders were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Seventy-seven trials were included in the comparative review. Akathisia was observed with the use of all the SGAs. The akathisia incidence reported in bipolar disorder trials was generally higher compared with schizophrenia trials. The incidence reported for FGAs was consistently higher than that reported for SGAs, regardless of the patient population studied.

Conclusion

Akathisia remains a concern with the use of SGAs. More accurate and standardized evaluations are required for a better understanding of the nature and incidence of akathisia.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^180e6b58]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This study follows the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. The protocol has been registered in PROSPERO without any amendments to the provided information.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Two authors (R.B. and G.F.) searched 3 databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) from inception, with no language restriction. In case of no consensus on the inclusion of a study, a third author (L.B.) made the final decision about study inclusion. The systematic review began on May 30, 2023, and ended on June 18, 2023. The search terms were as follows: akathisia AND antipsychotic OR neuroleptic OR schizophrenia OR schizoaffective disorder combined with a list of the different adjunctive drugs. A second search was performed for each drug identified in the first search: biperiden, clonazepam, cyproheptadine, diazepam, diphenhydramine, mianserin, mirtazapine, propranolol, trazodone, valproate, vitamin B 6, and zolmitriptan. Each drug term was combined with the term akathisia. The search identified 847 records.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that (1) compared an adjunctive drug for AIA vs placebo or adjunctive treatment in patients treated with antipsychotics fulfilling the criteria for akathisia, (2) had sample sizes of at least 10 patients, (3) had no additional drugs administered during the study, and (4) used a validated akathisia score. Trials with missing data for the main outcome (akathisia score at the 2 end points) were excluded.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome was the reduction of the mean akathisia score on the last time point with a scale assessing global, subjective, and/or objective akathisia. When repeated assessment time points were recorded, we chose the longest one. For crossover trials, the last scores at the end of the first period were analyzed. Secondary outcomes were tolerance, defined as the total number of adverse effects and the total number of serious adverse effects reported at the end of the trial, and acceptability, defined as the number of dropouts after randomization for tolerance issues (if the reasons for dropout were not available, the total number of dropouts was included).

Figure 5.
Head-to-Head Comparisons for Efficacy of the 10 Treatments in Antipsychotic-Induced Akathisia

Drugs are reported by decreasing rank order. Data are standardized mean differences (SMDs) (95% CIs). Comparisons should be read from left to right. For the lower triangle that reports network estimates, column-defining treatment is compared with row-defining treatment. For the upper triangle that reports direct treatment estimates, row-defining treatment is compared with column-defining treatment. The SMDs above 0 favor the column-defining treatment in the lower triangle, whereas they favor the row-defining treatment in the upper triangle. NA indicates not applicable.

eFigure 2 in Supplement 1 provides a summary of the ranking using SUCRA. The top 5 ranked molecules for treating AIA, in decreasing order of probability, are mirtazapine, biperiden, vitamin B 6, cyproheptadine, and trazodone. Mirtazapine had a 33.4% probability of being the top-ranked molecule, whereas propranolol had a 16.4% probability of being ranked seventh (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). The P-scores support these findings, ranking mirtazapine (P-score = 0.826), biperiden (P-score = 0.703), and vitamin B 6 (P-score = 0.641) as the 3 most effective therapies for treating AIA (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). The results for the efficacy at different time points and the efficacy on subjective and objective symptoms are presented in the eResults in Supplement 1.

Key Points

Question

Which drugs are associated with the greatest efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia?

Findings

This systematic review and network meta-analysis assessed the global akathisia score of 10 drugs in 15 double-blind randomized clinical trials with 492 participants. Mirtazapine, vitamin B 6, and biperiden exhibited the 3 most favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles; trazodone, mianserin, and propranolol demonstrated greater efficacy than the placebo; and cyproheptadine, clonazepam, zolmitriptan, and valproate did not yield significant effects.

Meaning

Vitamin B 6 may have the most favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, followed by mirtazapine and biperiden, for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^d7aabe4d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

The treatment of akathisia is challenging and, in some cases, as we have seen with this patient, akathisia does not remit after the withdrawal of the causative agent. This type of tardive akathisia is extremely challenging to treat, and there are no treatment guidelines in literature to guide clinicians. Evidence is limited to a small number of case studies on tardive akathisia. Two case reports suggest the successful treatment of tardive akathisia with moclobemide and clonidine.

Our case study is one of the first papers to provide evidence of the successful remission of both tardive akathisia and depressive symptoms following treatment with ECT. If confirmed in further cases, these findings can provide a basis for well-designed randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of treatments such as ECT on movement disorders and extrapyramidal symptoms. Furthermore, this case study provides valuable evidence to clinicians who remain unaided in the management of tardive akathisia in patients with depression.

Learning points

Underdiagnosis of tardive akathisia is common in clinical practice. Instead, symptoms of inner restlessness and the inability to sit still are attributed to underlying mental health disorders and anxiety.
Consequently, physicians prescribe further medications to treat the assumed underlying mental health problems. Many of the drugs prescribed can induce and further exacerbate akathisia.
This report serves to increase awareness of this condition and aims to help doctors tackle similar clinical scenarios in the future.
We therefore present a case of tardive akathisia complicated by treatment-resistant depression that completely resolved following a series of electroconvulsive (ECT) sessions.
This case study presents a well-documented treatment intervention, ECT, used effectively in a new clinical situation.

Results

Selection, Inclusion, and Characteristics of Studies

Figure 1 illustrates the flowchart of the study analysis. Of the 847 records identified initially in the databases, we selected 15 double-blind RCTs (1.8%) that met the inclusion criteria for a network meta-analysis. The excluded studies and reasons for exclusion are presented in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

Figure 1.
Study Selection Process

Overall, 15 double-blind randomized clinical trials corresponding to 12 interventions were included.

The 15 included RCTs consist of 10 parallel group trials (66.7%), 3 crossover trials (20.0%), and 3 multiarm studies (20.0%), (1 trial has both crossover and multiarm designs). A total of 492 patients are included, with 324 patients (65.9%) allocated to the experimental arms and 168 patients (34.1%) to the placebo arm. The placebo acted as the reference group in 12 studies (80.0%), whereas in 3 studies (20.0%), an active treatment served as the reference group (2 studies used propranolol, and 1 study used diphenhydramine). The RCTs used 5 scores: Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Akathisia Rating Scale, Simpson Angus Scale, and 2 scores based on the DSM-5 criteria for akathisia. The descriptions of these scales and the characteristics of the trials can be found in eTable 2 in Supplement 1.

Limitations

Limitations of the study included the subgroup analysis for low risk of bias, which should be interpreted cautiously due to the inclusion of only 8 studies, resulting in low statistical power. The efficacy of propranolol may be underestimated due to study design. In the study by Kramer et al, propranolol did not demonstrate significant efficacy at the end of the first period (2 days), whereas it showed efficacy at the end of the study (5 days). Some studies excluded benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, whereas others included them but ensured that they were initiated before the start of the trial, with constant and balanced doses between arms to avoid confounding effects. Because only 1.5% of patients were treated with antipsychotic polytherapy, the efficacy of AIA can theoretically not be extrapolated to patients treated with antipsychotic polytherapy. However, antipsychotic polytherapy is common in clinical practice and is a recognized risk factor of AIA, and antipsychotic daily dose was not associated with efficacy in our results. Antipsychotic monotherapy is still recommended in cases of akathisia induced by antipsychotic polytherapy. Additionally, we did not use pre-post effect sizes to evaluate the evolution of scores over time because the intertime correlation coefficient (r) was not reported in the trials. Furthermore, between-group SMDs provide better control over covariates compared with within-group SMDs. Finally, our random-effects model relies on numerous indirect evidence due to the lack of direct comparisons between active treatments. The consistency between direct and indirect evidence defends the accuracy of network estimates.

Figure 4.
Ranked Forest Plot of Network Meta-Analysis for Efficacy of Treatments in Antipsychotic-Induced Akathisia

The different treatments are compared with placebo (the reference group). The more negative the standardized mean difference (SMD) is, the higher the reduction in akathisia scale score for intervention compared with placebo. Weight represents the sum of the inverse variance of all effect sizes in the pairwise comparison model for respective intervention. Square size is proportional to weight.

In Figure 5, the head-to-head comparisons of the efficacy of the 10 included treatments and placebo are presented in order of ranking. None of the network estimates comparing active treatments reached statistical significance (all 95% CIs of SMDs contain the value 0). There was no direct evidence comparing cyproheptadine or zolmitriptan with placebo because the trials evaluating these drugs did not include placebo as a reference group. Only biperiden demonstrated greater efficacy than valproate (SMD, −0.99; 95% CI, −1.93 to −0.04). There was no significant difference in efficacy between propranolol and zolmitriptan, cyproheptadine and propranolol, mirtazapine and propranolol, or vitamin B 6 and mianserin.

### Role of mirtazapine in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia [^d562f2ef]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of mirtazapine in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and PsycINFO (1967-February 2008) were searched using the terms akathisia and mirtazapine. A bibliographic search was conducted as well.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the search were evaluated. All primary literature was included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Antipsychotic-induced akathisia can be difficult to manage and may respond to mirtazapine based on its antagonist activity at the serotonin 5-HT(2A)/5-HT(2C) receptors. Three case reports (N = 9 pts.), 1 placebo-controlled trial (N = 26), and 1 placebo- and propranolol-controlled study (N = 90) that evaluated mirtazapine for antipsychotic-induced akathisia have been published. Mirtazapine demonstrated a response rate of 53.8% compared with a 7.7% response rate for placebo, based on at least a 2-point reduction on the Barnes Akathisia Scale (global subscale; p = 0.004). Using the same criterion, mirtazapine and propranolol demonstrated efficacy based on response rates of 43.3% and 30.0% compared with placebo (6.7%; p = 0.0051). Mirtazapine was better tolerated than propranolol. In both studies, drowsiness was the most common adverse event associated with mirtazapine.

Conclusions

Mirtazapine may be considered a treatment option for antipsychotic-induced akathisia. It may be especially useful for patients with contraindications or intolerability to beta-blockers and for those with comorbid depression or negative symptoms. Additional studies should be conducted to provide further evidence of mirtazapine's effectiveness in treating akathisia.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ea159ec2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Data Extraction

All records were screened and extracted by 2 researchers (R.B. and C.G.). Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third author (G.F.). The secondary outcomes were extracted through the trials, namely, the total number of patients experiencing adverse effects and dropouts. Percentages relative to the total number of participants in the network meta-analysis are presented. Twenty-seven baseline characteristics were extracted and are presented in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

Risk of Bias

We assessed the risk of bias for individual studies according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using the Risk of Bias 2 tool. More details on identification and selection of studies, outcomes, data extraction, missing data, risk of bias, and the details of statistical analyses are presented in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

Statistical Analysis

We estimated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their respective SEs for continuous outcome using pairwise and network meta-analysis. If the total sample size was 20 or fewer patients, a Hedges g (SMD) correction was applied. If not, a Cohen d (SMD) was calculated. The different effect sizes were compiled using a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis model, and 95% CIs are presented. Pooled weights for each intervention were calculated from pairwise comparisons model. Results were resumed in a forest plot and a league table.

The statistical heterogeneity of our model was assessed with I 2 and τ 2. A Cochran Q testwas conducted for overall heterogeneity and inconsistency. The ranking of treatments is presented through P-score based on the random-effects model. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) has been used for the rankogram. To examine the transitivity assumption, we listed relevant sociodemographic and clinical factors and compared them by means of boxplots. Tests and 2-sided P value threshold for statistical significance were as follows: Cochran Q test P < .05, Separate Indirect From Direct Evidence (SIDE) test P < .10, and Egger test, Pustejovsky-Rodgers corrected test, and Thompson-Sharp test P < .05. All statistical analyses were performed using the netmeta package (version 2.8–2) in R software, version 4.1.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

### Akathisia, an easily overlooked side effect… [^15d19199]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleFree accessCORRESPONDENCEReply to H. Onishi et al To the editor: We read the article by Sandhya et al 1with great interest. The report that olanzapine is effective against anorexia in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy is of great benefit to patients. However, we would like to add some commentary to further enhance the potential benefits. The authors reported that olanzapine has minimal side effects. However, they did not mention akathisia in patients due to administration of olanzapine. As olanzapine acts as a dopamine D2 receptor blocker, it can induce akathisia, an extrapyramidal symptom, and as a result, patients may experience significant distress. With a frequency reported between 3% and 16%, this side effect should always be taken into consideration.

2However, although akathisia is easy to diagnose when it presents with classical symptoms, such as an inability to stay seated and restless meandering, it is often overlooked because symptoms are diverse. 3A survey on patients with cancer revealed that many patients were diagnosed with akathisia after being referred to a psychiatrist for reasons such as anxiety and depression. 4Many patients are bedridden as a side effect of chemotherapy, and akathisia in such patients is difficult to diagnose and causes significant distress.
5. The current study is beneficial for patients suffering from anorexia; therefore, we believe that oncologists should be aware of the potential for akathisia to develop as a side effect when administering olanzapine so as to further improve the patients' quality of life. References 1.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^d44758af]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Most of the medications suggested in literature for akathisia were tried such as, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and anticholinergic agents, but none achieved an improvement of the patient's symptoms. The patient's tardive akathisia severely complicated her treatment-resistant depression. At this stage, physicians were left with no other evidence-based treatment options and decided to carry out a single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scan to exclude the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

It is therefore essential that all practitioners are aware and competent in promptly identifying and managing akathisia. Commonly, practitioners may be reluctant to diagnose akathisia, attributing symptoms of restlessness to the patient's anxiety. As a result, more medications are prescribed, and doses are increased leading to paradoxically negative effects. This process is repeated, creating a vicious cycle. The use of rating scales such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale can help doctors make an early diagnosis and prevent complications.

### Fluoxetine dose-increment related akathisia in depression: implications for clinical care, recognition and management of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced akathisia [^0908788d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 22-year-old woman presenting major depressive episode with severe akathisia after an increase in fluoxetine. The patient developed severe restlessness and de novo suicidal ideation approximately 1 week after the dosage of fluoxetine was doubled, 1 year on from when the drug was first introduced. This case illustrates the importance of being alert to movement disorders in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The clinical implications are discussed. A management strategy based on the evidence in the existing literature is suggested.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^de025cef]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and network meta-analysis found that mirtazapine (15 mg/d for ≥ 5 days), biperiden (12 mg/d for ≥ 14 days), and vitamin B 6 (600 mg/d for ≥ 5 days) were associated with the greatest efficacy for treating AIA, with vitamin B 6 having the best efficacy and tolerance profile. Because the number of available RCTs remains low and sample sizes are limited, prudence is advised. Trazodone (100 mg/d for ≥ 5 days), mianserin (15 mg/d for ≥ 5 days), and propranolol (50 mg/d for ≥ 8 days) may be effective alternatives with less favorable efficacy and tolerance profiles.

### Measurement-based diagnosis and treatment for tardive dyskinesia [^675d309f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with agents that block dopamine receptors, particularly antipsychotics. TD commonly involves the orofacial muscles and extremities, and, because these movements are out of the patient's control, they can have serious physical and psychological effects. An accurate and early diagnosis of TD is crucial because the risk of permanence increases over time. To minimize the risk of TD development, clinicians should use the lowest necessary doses of dopamine receptor blocking agents, and, if allowed by the treated condition, the dopamine receptor blocking agents should be stopped after the shortest necessary time. Clinicians should try to avoid parkinsonian adverse effects and akathisia and prefer second-generation antipsychotics over first-generation antipsychotics. Moreover, clinicians should differentiate between TD and other drug-induced movement disorders, particularly drug-induced parkinsonism, as anticholinergic treatment can worsen TD. To facilitate measurement-based care, clinicians should use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale examination to screen for and routinely monitor TD, especially when providing treatments intended to decrease the symptoms and impact of TD. Two vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat TD. For patients who have moderate to severe or disabling TD, the American Psychiatric Association recommends treatment with the VMAT2 inhibitors. Clinicians should communicate with patients and care partners about risk factors for and signs of TD, as well as available treatment options for TD and what they can expect in terms of short- and long-term results.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c5ce2e5a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Propranolol, 50 mg/d for 8 days, is the intervention that contributes the most to the heterogeneity of our main random-effects model due to the inclusion of trials lasting 2 days or less. It seems therefore recommended to administer propranolol for AIA with a duration longer than 2 days. There is no evidence to suggest that increasing the dosage beyond 50 mg/d enhances efficacy. Dumon et alcompared the effects of betaxolol, a selective β-blocker, with those of propranolol in akathisia and concluded that betaxolol and propranolol demonstrate comparable efficacy. The shared mechanism of action between the 2 drugs is the blockade of β 1 -adrenergic receptors.

Studies on cyproheptadine have produced conflicting results. The SUCRA ranking places it in fourth position, but the CI of its SMD includes the value of 0, suggesting that cyproheptadine is not significantly more effective than placebo. Considering the low confidence associated with the SMD of cyproheptadine, it is important to prioritize these results over the questionable ranking. Rankings are based on probabilities and do not guarantee reliable results for wide or nonsignificant CIs. The fourth subgroup analysis, pooling by class antihistaminics (cyproheptadine and diphenhydramine), has shown similar conclusions for the efficacy of antihistaminics. Although cyproheptadine appears to be as effective as propranolol, it cannot be currently recommended, and additional data are needed.

### Midazolam vs. diphenhydramine for the treatment of metoclopramide-induced akathisia: a randomized controlled trial [^9f706b81]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effects of midazolam, which is a fast and short-acting benzodiazepine, and diphenhydramine, which is a widely used anticholinergic agent, in clinical practice for the treatment of metoclopramide-induced akathisia.

Methods

All adults older than 17 years given metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting or for headache and who had akathisia were eligible for this clinical, randomized, double-blind trial. Patients were randomized to receive diphenhydramine or midazolam. Subjective, objective, and total akathisia scores and modified Ramsay Sedation Scale scores were recorded. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the efficacy and side effects of the medications.

Results

Forty-one (73.3%) of the 56 enrolled patients were women. The mean (± SD) age was 39.9 (± 15.7) years in the diphenhydramine group and 40.9 (± 16.2) years in the midazolam group. Mean subjective, objective, and total akathisia scores in the first 5 minutes declined considerably in the midazolam group compared with the diphenhydramine group (p < 0.001). However, the mean Ramsay Sedation Scale score in the first 15 minutes increased significantly in the midazolam group compared with the diphenhydramine group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Midazolam can correct the symptoms of metoclopramide-induced akathisia faster than diphenhydramine, but it causes more sedation.

### Vitamin B6 treatment in acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^4d1ded39]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment strategies for acute neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) contain anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, dopamine agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic agents, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and serotonin antagonists. Nevertheless, many patients who suffer from acute akathisia fail to respond to treatment. In earlier studies, vitamin B6 was found to be effective in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced movement disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin B6 in the treatment of acute NIA. This is the first report of B6 as a treatment for NIA.

Method

This study was conducted in 2 mental health centers from February 2003 to November 2003. Twenty schizophrenia and schizoaffective inpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of NIA were randomly divided to receive vitamin B6 600 mg/day b.i.d. (N = 10) or placebo (N = 10) twice a day for 5 days in a double-blind design. The Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) were used to assess the severity of NIA and psychotic symptoms. The BAS assessment was made at baseline and every day during the study. The BPRS and CGI were completed at baseline and at the end of the study.

Results

The vitamin B6-treated patients in comparison with the placebo group showed a significant improvement on the subjective-awareness of restlessness (p = .0004), subjective-distress (p = .01), and global (p = .004) subscales of the BAS. The objective subscale did not demonstrate significant positive results (p = .079), but there was a trend of symptom amelioration in the vitamin B6 group. A reduction of at least 2 points on the BAS global subscale was noted in 8 patients in the vitamin B6 group (80%), and in only 3 patients in the placebo group (30%) (p = .037).

Conclusion

Our preliminary results indicate that high doses of vitamin B6 may be useful additions to the available treatments for NIA, perhaps due to its combined effects on various neurotransmitter systems.

### Adjuvant anticholinergic therapy for the prevention of akathisia in patients with primary headache in the emergency department: a systematic review [^69189cd1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Adjunct therapy with anticholinergic agents has been proposed to reduce the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects such as akathisia following treatment with neuroleptics or metoclopramide. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of anticholinergic agents to prevent neuroleptic or metoclopramide-induced akathisia in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with benign headache.

Methods

Eight electronic databases and the gray literature were searched to identify randomized controlled trials involving adult patients presenting to the ED with primary headache treated with neuroleptic or metoclopramide. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were completed by two independent reviewers. Individual or pooled meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes were calculated as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic.

Results

A total of 1032 studies were screened, of which two studies were included in the review. Both studies provided patients with diphenhydramine following treatment with neuroleptics or metoclopramide. Treatment with diphenhydramine did not reduce the incidence of akathisia compared to treatment with placebo (RR0.83, 95% CI 0.43–1.61, I² = 0%). The impact of diphenhydramine on pain relief, need for rescue medications, and relief of other extrapyramidal side effects was reported in one of the two studies, with no significant differences noted in any outcomes compared to patients treated with placebo.

Conclusion

This review found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of diphenhydramine as an adjunct therapy to prevent akathisia in ED patients treated with neuroleptics or metoclopramide for primary headache. This finding relies on the results of two small randomized controlled trials with incomplete outcome reporting. Additional high-quality studies are needed to better understand the clinical efficacy of agents with anticholinergic properties in the ED management of patients with primary headaches.

### Evaluation of akathisia in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar I disorder: a post hoc analysis of pooled data from short-and long-term aripiprazole trials [^3bfe3624]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to assess the clinical characteristics of akathisia in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar I disorder receiving aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, or placebo. We conducted post hoc analyses of pooled safety data from trials in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I disorder. Outcome measures included the incidence of akathisia, time to onset, duration, severity, and discontinuation due to akathisia, concomitant use of benzodiazepines and/or anticholinergics, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) scores, and the correlation between antipsychotic efficacy and akathisia. The results for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were as follows: akathisia in 9% of aripiprazole- and 6% of placebo-treated patients; 12.5% of aripiprazole- versus 24% of haloperidol-treated patients; 11% of aripiprazole- versus 6% of olanzapine-treated patients. Bipolar I disorder: akathisia in 18% of aripiprazole- and 5% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical characteristics of akathisia were similar between each data set, regardless of disease. Akathisia was generally mild-to-moderate in severity. Discontinuation due to akathisia was low in both the schizophrenia trials (aripiprazole 0.3%; placebo 0%; aripiprazole 0.9%; haloperidol 2.3%; aripiprazole 1.2%; olanzapine 0.2%) and the bipolar trials (aripiprazole 2.3%; placebo 0%). Treatment-emergent akathisia was not associated with a poorer clinical response. In conclusion, akathisia with aripiprazole occurred early in treatment, was mild-to-moderate in severity, led to few study discontinuations, and did not compromise therapeutic efficacy.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^06c66e23]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

This report presents a case of drug-induced severe tardive akathisia developing after the combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and an antipsychotic, in a woman with severe major depression. The trial and combination of multiple medications is common practice in treatment-resistant patients with depression. With the increase in the prevalence of treatment-resistant depression, adverse effects of medication such as tardive akathisia are becoming more common. Tardive akathisia persists even after the withdrawal of the causative agent and is very challenging to treat. The patient did not respond to any standard medications indicated for drug-induced akathisia. As a result, the patient became suicidal and extremely distressed with all treatment options exhausted. Guidelines on the management of drug-induced tardive akathisia are non-existent. This reflects the importance of this case study, which reveals the complete remission of both tardive akathisia and all the patient's depressive symptoms after electroconvulsive therapy. This report provides evidence of an established treatment intervention used in a new situation.

### Cariprazine and akathisia, restlessness, and extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with bipolar depression [^2e09693f]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Akathisia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is commonly related to the use of dopamine receptor antagonists/partial agonists. The characteristics of cariprazine-related akathisia, restlessness, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were investigated in patients with bipolar I depression.

Methods

Akathisia-related data from 3 fixed-dose clinical studies of cariprazine 1.5 mg/d and 3 mg/d in bipolar depression were evaluated in pooled post hoc analyses. Outcomes related to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included incidence, time to onset, time to resolution, severity, discontinuations, and rescue medication use.

Results

The incidence of akathisia was 7.6% for overall cariprazine (1.5 mg/d = 5.5%; 3 mg/d = 9.6%) and 2.1% for placebo; acute EPS occurred in 4.5% of cariprazine-treated (1.5 mg/d = 3.8%; 3 mg/d = 5.1%) and 2.1% of placebo-treated patients. Findings were similar for restlessness. Most TEAEs were mild/moderate (> 95%), occurred during the first 3 weeks of cariprazine initiation or dose increase, and resulted in few discontinuations (< 3%); median time to resolution of an akathisia or EPS TEAE after the last dose of cariprazine was ~1 week. Rescue medication was used by < 3% of patients to manage akathisia/EPS events.

Limitations

Post hoc analyses; no active comparator.

Conclusions

In patients with bipolar depression, the incidence of cariprazine-related akathisia was higher than acute EPS or restlessness, with lower cariprazine doses associated with lower incidences of events. Akathisia and EPS TEAEs occurred early in treatment and were mild/moderate in severity. Few patients with akathisia or acute EPS discontinued treatment. Cariprazine-related akathisia and EPS can be minimized with conservative dosing and titration strategies.

### Immediate effect of intravenous diazepam in neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia: an open-label study [^ca2944b3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic-induced akathisia can be severely distressing to some patients. and rapid treatment would be preferable. However, there have been relatively few studies conducted regarding the rapid treatment of akathisia. The effect of intravenous diazepam at the beginning of treatment for akathisia was studied in an open clinical trial.

Method

The subjects were 18 patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (DSM-IV criteria) who developed neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia during antipsychotic medication and who required immediate relief from the distress of akathisia. Diazepam was given intravenously to the patients at a rate of 5 mg per 30 seconds.

Results

All 18 subjects experienced immediate relief from akathisia after the injection of diazepam (mean ± SD dose = 12.6 ± 2.6 mg; range, 10–17 mg). They reported no serious adverse effects.

Conclusion

The results suggest that intravenous diazepam could be used in the treatment of patients with severely distressing akathisia who require immediate relief.

The authors describe the case of a 38-year-old man with a history of schizoaffective disorder, who attempted suicide following the recent starting of a neuroleptic agent that resulted in the development of intolerable akathisia. He survived the attempt, and following changes in his medications the akathisia resolved with no further suicidal ideation.

### Prochlorperazine in children with migraine: a look at its effectiveness and rate of akathisia [^e6ded40d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of prochlorperazine and the rate of akathisia in children with severe migraine.

Methods

The study is a prospective cohort of a convenient sample of patients younger than 18 years old diagnosed with migraine and treated with intravenous prochlorperazine in adjunction with diphenhydramine in the emergency department. The evaluation of pain and akathisia was performed before the treatment and was repeated 60 minutes later and before discharge. A telephone follow-up was completed to assess relapse in pain and presence of akathisia. The effectiveness of prochlorperazine was determined using different outcomes: 50% reduction of pain, pain-free patients, treatment failure, and relapse of pain.

Results

Of the 79 patients included in the study for 25 months, 64 (81%) either met the International Headache Society criteria or had a diagnosis of migraine confirmed by a neurologist at follow-up. Among these patients, 47 (100%) of 47 had a 50% reduction of pain, and 24 (50%) of 48 were pain free at discharge. Only 14 (22%) of 64 patients had a treatment failure. However, 43 (68%) of 63 patients had a relapse of their headache within the first week after discharge. Overall, among the 79 patients, 4 (5%) had a definitive diagnosis of akathisia, but 27 (34%) other patients presented symptoms suggesting a possible diagnosis of akathisia.

Conclusion

Prochlorperazine seems very effective to decrease pain on a short-term basis in children. However, more than two thirds of the patients, overall, had a relapse of their migraine at home in the first week. Despite the use of diphenhydramine, akathisia remains a concern.

### Drug efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced akathisia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^619b1753]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This work represents the first network meta-analysis, to our knowledge, to explore the efficacy associated with adjunctive drugs in AIA, which is a common clinical issue in psychiatric daily practice. The following adjunctive drugs demonstrated efficacy, listed in decreasing order of effect sizes: mirtazapine (15 mg/d), biperiden (2.5–15 mg/d), vitamin B 6 (600 mg/d), mianserin (15 mg/d), trazodone (100 mg/d), and propranolol (20–120 mg/d). Cyproheptadine also appeared to be potentially effective, but data were insufficient to fully support its efficacy. Clonazepam and valproate did not demonstrate superiority over placebo and are not currently recommended. These results have important implications for clinical practice.

Mirtazapine, biperiden, and vitamin B 6 exhibited moderate to large effect sizes with comparable efficacy, and mirtazapine consistently ranked first in both the main analysis and all subgroup analyses. However, mirtazapine may be poorly tolerated due to its sedative effects and the potential for weight gain. Mianserin is also effective, similar to mirtazapine, in reducing akathisia symptoms. This antidepressant also has a good tolerability profile except for sedation. However, 10% to 20% of patients do not respond to mirtazapine and mianserin, which suggests that other mechanisms, apart from serotonin blockade, may be involved in AIA.

Vitamin B 6 may be considered the best option in terms of the risk-benefit ratio for AIA treatment. In cases involving insomnia, mirtazapine may still be the preferred choicefor the treatment of comorbid depressive disorder. Vitamin B 6 has a moderate to large effect size that also extends to different subgroup analyses. Its major potency lies in its excellent tolerability and acceptability profile. Vitamin B 6 may play a role, notably as a corrector of dopamine imbalance and a free radical scavenger.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^260853a7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics — Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are presented as the primary pharmacological treatment for psychotic symptoms and the most commonly used and best-studied pharmacological treatment for agitation, with considerable evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses for efficacy. Findings from CATIE-AD failed to demonstrate conclusive benefits of second-generation antipsychotics over placebo in Alzheimer's disease with psychosis or aggression, although certain outcome variables favored medications and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower with olanzapine and risperidone than with placebo or quetiapine. Given side effects and potential toxicity, the risks and benefits must be reassessed on an ongoing basis, the lowest effective dose should be sought with emergent side effects first treated by dose reduction, and indications should be generally limited to psychosis or behavioral disturbances, not primarily for sleep disorders or anxiety. Periodic attempts (e.g., every several months) to reduce or withdraw antipsychotic medications should be considered for all patients while weighing the probability of a relapse and the dangerousness of the target behavior(s). In general, agents with significant anticholinergic properties should be avoided in patients with dementia, and mild to moderate adverse effects of antipsychotics include akathisia, parkinsonism, and sedation.

### Diphenhydramine in the treatment of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine [^bfe0dc50]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Dopamine D(2) antagonists are known to induce akathisia, the emergency management of which remains undetermined. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of diphenhydramine in the treatment of akathisia induced by 10 mg intravenous prochlorperazine. This prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study evaluated a cohort of akathisic adult Emergency Department patients who were participating in a series of three studies of acute akathisia at an academic medical center. Each subject received intravenous diphenhydramine, with akathisia measurements (graded from 0–17 points) performed just before and 30 min after infusion. Mean scores were calculated using descriptive statistical analyses. The effect of treatment was evaluated using the paired t-test. For the 87 akathisic patients, the mean score before treatment was 9.8 ± 3.6, and after treatment was 1.2 ± 2.6, a mean reduction of 8.5 ± 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8 to 9.4; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, intravenous diphenhydramine rapidly reduces signs and symptoms of acute akathisia induced by prochlorperazine.

### Akathisia: prevalence and risk factors in a community-dwelling sample of patients with schizophrenia. results from the FACE-SZ dataset [^0eb0880f]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of akathisia in a community-dwelling sample of patients with schizophrenia, and to determine the effects of treatments and the clinical variables associated with akathisia. 372 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were systematically included in the network of FondaMental Expert Center for Schizophrenia and assessed with validated scales. Akathisia was measured with the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS). Ongoing psychotropic treatment was recorded. The global prevalence of akathisia (as defined by a score of 2 or more on the global akathisia subscale of the BAS) in our sample was 18.5%. Patients who received antipsychotic polytherapy were at higher risk of akathisia and this result remained significant (adjusted odd ratio = 2.04, p = .025) after controlling the influence of age, gender, level of education, level of psychotic symptoms, substance use comorbidities, current administration of antidepressant, anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines, and daily-administered antipsychotic dose. The combination of second-generation antipsychotics was associated with a 3-fold risk of akathisia compared to second-generation antipsychotics used in monotherapy. Our results indicate that antipsychotic polytherapy should be at best avoided and suggest that monotherapy should be recommended in cases of akathisia. Long-term administration of benzodiazepines or anticholinergic drugs does not seem to be advisable in cases of akathisia, given the potential side effects of these medications.

### Akathisia (restless legs syndrome) in people with schizophrenia and mental retardation… [^2870c09a]. ClinicalTrials (2003). Low credibility.

Study Overview Akathisia is a relatively common side effect of neuroleptic medication that occurs within 1 week to 6 months after the initiation of medication. Akathisia is characterized by a variety of movement manifestations, such as fidgeting, irritability, inability to sit or stand still, marching in place, continuous trunk motions, sleeplessness, and a subjective sense of restlessness. The first experimental series will compare chronic akathisia in schizophrenic and MR patients. Four groups of MR patients and four groups of schizophrenic patients will be studied: young with chronic akathisia, older with chronic akathisia, young on neuroleptics without akathisia, and older on neuroleptics without akathisia. Two control groups will include healthy individuals with normal intelligence who are not on neuroleptic medication.

Assessments will include videotaped recordings and kinematic analysis of naturally occurring akathisia restlessness movements as well as cognitive and psychiatric tests. Demographic factors and medication factors will also be assessed to determine their relation to and possible impact on chronic akathisia. The second experimental series will compare schizophrenic and MR patients who are initiating neuroleptic therapy. Institutionalized MR patients will be age matched with schizophrenic patients. Tests will occur at baseline and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 52. Those who enroll in the protocol early will be tested for more than 12 months where possible and useful. The same analyses as in the first experimental series will be used to allow for comparison of acute and chronic akathisia.
- Chronic akathisia for at least 3 months prior to study entry
- Neuroleptic medication for at least 6 months prior to study entry. Exclusion Criteria
- Psychotropic drugs such as serotonin re-uptake inhibiting anti-depressants
- Nonambulatory
- Uncontrolled seizure disorders
- Fragile X syndrome
- Down Syndrome
- Neurological disease that is known to have definitive symptoms of choreoathetosis, dystonia, Syndenham's chorea, etc.

### Diphenhydramine for the prevention of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine: a randomized, controlled trial [^9385f1bd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The utility of intravenous prochlorperazine as an antiemetic agent and abortive therapy for headache may be limited by the frequent occurrence of akathisia, the distressing effects of which have been shown to disrupt patient care. We tested the hypothesis that adjuvant diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department of an academic tertiary care medical center with an annual census of 95,000 emergency patient visits. We enrolled a convenience sample of 100 adult patients who received 10 mg of intravenous prochlorperazine for the treatment of nausea/vomiting or headache. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a 2-minute infusion of prochlorperazine with either 50 mg of diphenhydramine or placebo. The incidence of akathisia at 1 hour was measured by using explicit diagnostic criteria. To measure the influence of treatment on sedation, the subjects noted, on a 100-mm visual analog scale, their degree of sedation before and after treatment.

Results

Akathisia developed in 18 (36%) of 50 subjects in the control group and in 7 (14%) of 50 subjects in the diphenhydramine group, a 61% relative reduction. The addition of adjunct diphenhydramine resulted in an absolute reduction of 22% in the incidence of akathisia (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 38%; P = 0.01). The odds ratio for akathisia with the use of adjuvant diphenhydramine was 0.39 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.85). Mean sedation scores increased 12 mm after infusion of prochlorperazine alone (95% CI 3 to 21 mm) compared with a 33-mm increase after infusion of prochlorperazine with adjuvant diphenhydramine (95% CI 24 to 42 mm). The 12-mm difference between the groups was statistically significant (95% CI 9 to 34 mm, P < .001).

Conclusion

Adjuvant diphenhydramine reduces the incidence of akathisia induced by prochlorperazine and is associated with an increase in sedation.

### Tetrabenazine (Xenazine) [^121983f2]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.5 Akathisia, Restlessness, and Agitation

XENAZINE may increase the risk of akathisia, restlessness, and agitation.

In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, akathisia was observed in 10 (19%) of XENAZINE-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In an 80-week, open-label study, akathisia was observed in 20% of XENAZINE-treated patients.

Patients receiving XENAZINE should be monitored for the presence of akathisia. Patients receiving XENAZINE should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia, the XENAZINE dose should be reduced; however, some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.

5.6 Parkinsonism

XENAZINE can cause parkinsonism. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism (i.e., bradykinesia, hypertonia and rigidity) were observed in 15% of XENAZINE-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week, open-label studies, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism were observed in 10% and 3% of XENAZINE-treated patients, respectively.

Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between this drug-induced adverse reaction and progression of the underlying disease process. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington's disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with XENAZINE, dose reduction should be considered; in some patients, discontinuation of therapy may be necessary.

### Managing the side effects associated with commonly used treatments for bipolar depression [^905837be]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The most commonly used pharmacologic therapies for bipolar depression are mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants. This paper reviews common side effects associated with these medications and provides recommendations for managing adverse medication effects in clinical practice.

Methods

Narrative review based on literature searches of Medline and evidence-based treatment guidelines for agents that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and/or are commonly used to treat bipolar depression.

Results

Side effects of bipolar depression pharmacotherapies are common and vary by medication, with weight gain, metabolic dysregulation, sedation/somnolence, and akathisia among those observed most frequently. These adverse events (weight gain and sedation/somnolence, in particular) negatively affect treatment adherence in patients with bipolar disorder. Furthermore, endocrine and metabolic comorbidities, weight gain, and obesity may reduce the likelihood of positive clinical responses to pharmacologic therapies. Clinicians may consider switching patients to bipolar depression medication(s) with a lower propensity for sedation or adverse metabolic effects. Lifestyle modification (e.g., dietary changes, exercise) is an important component in the treatment of weight gain/obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia; in addition, a wide range of medications are available as therapeutic options for patients in whom non-pharmacologic management strategies are insufficient. The use of adjunctive medication may also reduce treatment-related sedation and somnolence.

Limitations

The selection of relevant studies from the literature search relied primarily on the author's expertise in the area of bipolar depression and knowledge of the issues addressed.

Conclusion

Successful treatment of bipolar depression extends beyond managing mood symptoms to also monitoring adverse medication events and managing associated medical disorders.

### The appropriateness of routine medication treatment for schizophrenia [^6276bb81]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although national guidelines specify appropriate strategies for the treatment of schizophrenia, this disorder presents challenges to clinicians and health-care organizations. To improve care, it is useful to understand how often patients receive appropriate treatment. Most research evaluating treatment was performed when first-generation antipsychotic medications were the modal treatment. Given that most prescriptions are now for second-generation medications, this study describes current clinical problems and the appropriateness of treatment in routine practice.

Method

Between 2002 and 2004, a random sample of patients (n = 398) were interviewed at baseline and 1 year at 3 Department of Veterans Affairs mental health clinics. Symptoms and side effects were assessed. Analyses examined whether prescribing were consistent with guidelines in patients with significant psychosis, depression, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, or elevated weight.

Results

Few patients met criteria for depression, parkinsonism, or akathisia. A total of 44% of patients had significant psychosis, 11% had tardive dyskinesia, and 46% were overweight. Medication was appropriate in 27% of patients with psychosis, 25% of patients with tardive dyskinesia, and 2% of patients with elevated weight. Management of elevated weight improved modestly over time. Treatment was more likely to improve for patients whose psychiatrists had more than 12 patients with schizophrenia in their caseload.

Conclusion

Compared with the 1990s, outpatients are more likely to have significant psychosis. The rate of appropriate treatment of psychosis is unchanged. Weight gain has become a prevalent side effect, yet treatment is rarely changed in response to weight. There is a need for interventions that improve management of psychosis and weight.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^16be5ce7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Major depression is a common and disabling disorder affecting 14.6% of the population over a lifetime. Most patients respond to antidepressant treatment but 10% to 30% exhibit treatment-resistant symptoms. This severely affects the patients' quality of life. Treatment-resistant depression is a challenging condition for physicians who try to use integrated therapeutic strategies to tackle it. These include combining antidepressants, switching antidepressants and augmentation with non-antidepressants such as antipsychotics or lithium. However, the practice of combining and adding new agents has potential risks involved, including severe adverse effects, such as drug-induced akathisia in this case.

Akathisia consists of subjective inner restlessness, the inability to remain seated, restless legs and the desire to move constantly. Evident objective motor phenomena occur such as rocking, shifting from foot to foot, stamping in place and pacing around. Akathisia is known to be induced by antipsychotics and more rarely by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Cases of SSRI-induced akathisia have been reported in literature in recent years. Various pharmacological agents have been used to treat this condition, but widely accepted clinical guidelines are lacking. The incidence of this condition is increasing mainly due to the increase in the use of atypical antipsychotics and the concurrent use of antidepressants and antipsychotics as an augmenting agent in non-responsive depressed patients. Tardive akathisia is defined as akathisia that is unremitting even after the withdrawal of antipsychotics from the patient. This can have detrimental effects on the patient and can potentially lead to suicide, as seen in this case. Evidence on the management of tardive akathisia is absent in literature.

We report a case of tardive akathisia induced by the combination of an SSRI, escitalopram and an augmenting antipsychotic, olanzapine. This had significant negative implications on the patient's existing severe mental illness. The occurrence of both disorders caused unremitting and unbearable distress that lead to a rapid deterioration and suicidal impulses. This highlights the importance of considering medication risks when combining various psychiatric drugs. It is essential to increase awareness of the adverse effects and drug interactions that can occur with psychiatric drugs.

### Management of common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^62ef6a9d]. World Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The benefits of antipsychotic medications are sometimes obscured by their adverse effects. These effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues (e.g., mild sedation or dry mouth) to very unpleasant (e.g., constipation, akathisia, sexual dysfunction) to painful (e.g., acute dystonias) to disfiguring (e.g., weight gain, tardive dyskinesia) to life-threatening (e.g., myocarditis, agranulocytosis). Importantly, adverse effect profiles are specific to each antipsychotic medication and do not neatly fit into first- and second-generation classifications. This paper reviews management strategies for the most frequent side effects and identifies common principles intended to optimize net antipsychotic benefits. Only use antipsychotics if the indication is clear; only continue antipsychotics if a benefit is discernible. If an antipsychotic is providing substantial benefit, and the adverse effect is not life-threatening, then the first management choice is to lower the dose or adjust the dosing schedule. The next option is to change the antipsychotic; this is often reasonable unless the risk of relapse is high. In some instances, behavioral interventions can be tried. Finally, concomitant medications, though generally not desirable, are necessary in many instances and can provide considerable relief. Among concomitant medication strategies, anticholinergic medications for dystonias and parkinsonism are often effective; beta-blockers and anticholinergic medications are useful for akathisia; and metformin may lead to slight to moderate weight loss. Anticholinergic drops applied sublingually reduce sialorrhea. Usual medications are effective for constipation or dyslipidemias. The clinical utility of recently approved treatments for tardive dyskinesia, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, is unclear.

### The barnes akathisia rating scale – revisited [^08112937]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Akathisia is a syndrome of motor restlessness, principally seen in association with antipsychotic medication. It is characterized by a subjective experience of mental unease and the urge to move, and manifests physically as particular patterns of restless movement. This review focuses on the signs and symptoms of the condition, and its diagnosis and assessment using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. This scale was generated 15 years ago, and was derived from the findings of studies exploring the clinical features of antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Subsequently, its validity and reliability have been established, and it has been used extensively in clinical studies worldwide.

### Movement disorders associated with neuroleptic treatment [^1486f2a0]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), can be classified into acute and tardive syndromes. Among the former are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. Conventional neuroleptics that have traditionally been used to treat psychiatric disorders are often associated with EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics provide a more promising treatment strategy for psychiatric disorders and have a lower potential for producing EPS than conventional neuroleptics.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^c6fcd3c4]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Akathisia is a very distressing condition that is known to increase suicidal ideation and impulsive behaviour. In many cases, the symptoms of akathisia can be more distressing than the underlying mental health disorder itself. It is often underdiagnosed and symptoms are attributed to underlying anxiety or mental health disorders. As a result, clinicians continue prescribing psychiatric drugs that can make the symptoms of akathisia worse and lead to a vicious cycle. It is therefore of great importance that clinicians maintain a degree of high suspicion and recognise symptoms early in their presentation to prevent complications. Various reports have estimated the occurrence rate of SSRI-induced akathisia to range from 9.8% to 45.1%.

Previous case studies have also presented the emergence of akathisia following the administration of psychiatric drugs. SSRI-induced akathisia is suggested by several case reports. A case of paroxetine-induced akathisia has been reported. A case of sertraline-induced akathisia leading to suicidal attempts has also been reported. On withdrawal of the antidepressant, akathisia completely resolved. This further emphasises the importance of recognising the symptoms of akathisia early to avoid negative outcomes and the deterioration of the mental state of patients. Furthermore, akathisia has been reported with the use of SNRIs, although more rarely.

It is therefore evident that both SSRIs and antidopaminergic drugs may occasionally induce extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia. The proposed mechanism of this is the serotonergically mediated inhibition of the dopamine system. Concurrent antidopaminergic therapy may predispose patients to these effects. The potential risks can be minimised by preventing unnecessary and fast dose increments. Physicians should be aware of the emergence of these severe negative effects when introducing new drugs to the current drug regimen of patients, especially when psychiatric drugs are combined. It is important to note that the development of akathisia after the combination of escitalopram, which is one of the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and olanzapine in this case support the theory of serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopamine which was likely augmented by concurrent antipsychotic use, further blocking dopamine receptor stimulation. This mechanism persisted even after the withdrawal of the causative agents when the SPECT scan was carried out, supporting the diagnosis of tardive akathisia.

### No association between akathisia or parkinsonism and suicidality in treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^9bc1427d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

Akathisia and drug-induced Parkinsonism have traditionally been associated with depression and suicidality based on case study evidence. In this subanalysis, patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia were rated on the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale and Simpson-Angus extrapyramidal side-effect scale at two time points (n = 86 at first assessment; n = 67 at second assessment). At no time point was there any significant relationship between akathisia and depression/suicidality or distress associated with akathisia and Parkinsonism with suicidality. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^dc22dd23]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms in dementia — aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and side-effect management: In a randomized controlled trial, sedation occurred in 8% of aripiprazole-treated subjects versus 1% with placebo, and a meta-analysis confirmed this adverse event signal. Regarding ziprasidone, there are insufficient data to make assertions regarding safety and tolerability. Most short-term side effects can be minimized by using the lowest effective dose, and this is particularly important to minimize sedation and akathisia, which can worsen target symptoms. For parkinsonian side effects, anticholinergic agents may be effective but "should be used only with extreme caution for elderly patients both with and without dementia".

Network Graph

The network graph is presented in Figure 3. One studywas excluded from the main network due to the absence of a comparison linking diazepam or diphenhydramine with other treatments or placebo in the network, leaving 14 trials in the main network. Individual effect size and calculation for the study by Gagrat et alare described in eTable 3 in Supplement 1. Despite the limited number of trials, the network demonstrated overall strong connectivity. The most frequently studied comparisons involved propranolol, mirtazapine, mianserin, vitamin B 6, biperiden, and the placebo control condition. Cyproheptadine, clonazepam, and zolmitriptan had weak connections within the network, with only 1 direct comparison each.

### Cariprazine (Vraylar) [^95a78c67]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) and Akathisia

In schizophrenia, bipolar mania, bipolar depression, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials, data were objectively collected using the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) for treatment-emergent EPS (parkinsonism) (SAS total score ≤ 3 at baseline and > 3 post-baseline) and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for treatment-emergent akathisia (BARS total score ≤ 2 at baseline and > 2 post-baseline).

In 6-week schizophrenia trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), excluding akathisia and restlessness was 17% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 8% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.3% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia was 11% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.5% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients.

In 3-week bipolar mania trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 28% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 12% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to a discontinuation in 1% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia was 20% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 5% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 2% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^8227f8c6]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment for tics — efficacy, risks, dosing, and monitoring: Haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, and tiapride are probably more likely than placebo to reduce tic severity, and pimozide, ziprasidone, and metoclopramide are possibly more likely than placebo to reduce tic severity; there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative efficacy of these drugs. Systematic reviews of trials and cohort studies demonstrate a higher risk of drug-induced movement disorders (including tardive dyskinesia, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dystonia), weight gain, adverse metabolic side effects, prolactin increase, and QT prolongation with both first- and second-generation antipsychotics across psychiatric and neurologic conditions, and the relative propensity for these adverse effects varies by agent and is often dose-dependent. Physicians may prescribe antipsychotics for the treatment of tics when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks (Level C), must counsel patients on the relative propensity of antipsychotics for extrapyramidal, hormonal, and metabolic adverse effects to inform decision-making on which antipsychotic should be prescribed (Level A), must prescribe the lowest effective dose to decrease the risk of adverse effects (Level A), and should monitor for drug-induced movement disorders and for metabolic and hormonal adverse effects of antipsychotics, using evidence-based monitoring protocols (Level B). Physicians have a duty to monitor the effectiveness and safety of prescribed medications, and evidence-based monitoring protocols are available, and abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic medications can cause withdrawal dyskinesias.

### Atypical antipsychotic-induced akathisia with depression: therapeutic role of mirtazapine [^9d4d9531]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of mirtazapine in treating akathisia caused by risperidone and olanzapine, as well as its use in alleviating comorbid depressive disorder.

Case Summaries

Five patients with diagnoses varying from schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and bipolar disorder developed akathisia while on treatment with olanzapine and risperidone. The likelihood that risperidone and olanzapine had induced akathisia in all patients was rated probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. Four of these patients were also found to be depressed. The akathisia was successfully treated with mirtazapine, and 3 of the 4 depressed patients improved with mirtazapine treatment. Use of mirtazapine did not result in any adverse effect.

Discussion

Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of central alpha(2) auto- and hetero-adrenergic receptors, as well as an antagonist of 5-HT(2A/2C), 5-HT(3), and histaminergic H(1) postsynaptic receptors. The efficacy of mirtazapine in treatment of akathisia may result from its antagonist property at the H(1) receptors and its dopaminergic activity in frontal cortex. The use of mirtazapine offers advantages over other anti-akathisia drugs in its better adverse effect profile, as well as its ability to treat coexisting depression.

Conclusions

Mirtazapine is efficacious in treating atypical antipsychotic-induced akathisia. It may be a good option, particularly in patients with coexisting depression.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^c84f0a51]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The analysis has certain limitations. First, we defined our primary outcome post-hoc as the number of participants receiving antiparkinsonian medications and used other proxies when data were not available. This decision was made in order to provide a comprehensive analysis and increase the power to estimate dose-response relationships. We gave preference to the use of antiparkinsonian medications as a measure of global EPS, as it was often used in previous analyses. We also prioritised dichotomous outcomes over scale-derived data due to skewness. In a sensitivity analysis comparing dichotomous to scale-derived data (by estimating ORs from SMDs), we found that effect sizes were generally smaller for the latter (eAppendix 7). This could be potentially attributed to skewness (e.g. large SDs may dilute SMDs) and/or the transient nature of EPS during the study, resulting in small mean changes from baseline to endpoint. A previous dose-response meta-analysis analysed only scale-derived data, which could also explain some of the differences in the findings with the current analysis.

Second, the term "EPS" is an umbrella term of heterogenous treatment-emergent movement disorders that could have different etiopathogeneses and require different treatments. Our study primarily focused on parkinsonism and other movement disorders that could be treated with anticholinergic medications. Thus, the findings cannot be directly extrapolated to akathisia and tardive dyskinesia that have different pathogenetic mechanisms and need for distinct interventions. For this reason, we conducted a separate dose-response meta-analysis on antipsychotic-induced akathisia, which revealed often but not always differing shapes of dose-response curves between akathisia and EPS. This may also be relevant for antipsychotics like aripiprazole that have a clinically-important risk of akathisia, albeit a generally small risk of EPS. In particular, we found that the risk of akathisia reached a plateau of OR = 1.8–2.0 at approximately 10–15 mg/d of aripiprazole, whereas the risk of EPS was trivial OR = 1.2–1.3 at these doses, but slightly increased up to OR = 1.57 at 30 mg/d (Fig. 2).

### Clinical predictors of extrapyramidal symptoms associated with aripiprazole augmentation for the treatment of late-life depression in a randomized controlled trial [^0204cba9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Augmentation with aripiprazole is an effective pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant late-life depression (LLD). However, aripiprazole can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as akathisia and parkinsonism; these symptoms are distressing and can contribute to treatment discontinuation. We investigated the clinical trajectories and predictors of akathisia and parkinsonism in older patients receiving aripiprazole augmentation for treatment-resistant LLD.

Methods

Between 2009 and 2013, depressed older adults who did not remit with venlafaxine were randomized to aripiprazole or placebo in a 12-week trial. Participants were 60 years or older and met DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive episode with at least moderate symptoms. The presence of akathisia and parkinsonism was measured at each visit using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), respectively. In an exploratory analysis, we examined a broad set of potential clinical predictors and correlates: age, sex, ethnicity, weight, medical comorbidity, baseline anxiety severity, depression severity, concomitant medications including rescue medications, and aripiprazole dosage.

Results

Twenty-four (26.7%) of 90 participants randomized to aripiprazole and who had akathisia scores available developed akathisia compared to 11 (12.2%) of 90 randomized to placebo. Greater depression severity was the main predictor of treatment-emergent akathisia. Most participants who developed akathisia improved over time, especially with reductions in dosage. Fifteen (16.5%) of 91 participants taking aripiprazole and who had parkinsonism scores available developed parkinsonism, but no clinical predictors or correlates were identified.

Conclusions

Akathisia is a common side effect of aripiprazole, but it is typically mild and responds to dose reduction. Patients with greater baseline depression may warrant closer monitoring for akathisia. More research is needed to understand the course and predictors of treatment-emergent EPS with antipsychotic augmentation for treatment-resistant LLD.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^372265b6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient was withdrawn from akathisia-inducing drugs. Both olanzapine and escitalopram were withdrawn. However, the patient's symptoms of inner restlessness and inability to sit still did not improve. Hence, doctors proceeded in prescribing adjunctive medication. Propranolol was prescribed at 80 mg/day orally but did not improve symptoms after several weeks of trial. Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam were also used at 1 mg/day orally with clinically insignificant improvements. Lastly, other agents such as clonidine up to 0.15 mg/day orally were used with minimal improvements in the patient's symptoms.

After exhausting all first-line options supported by primary research, both the physician and patient agreed to try a series of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments. After 12 ECT sessions, the patient had enormously significant improvements in depressive symptoms and to the surprise of the medical team, the symptoms of akathisia had completely disappeared. The patient achieved remission from feelings of inner restlessness, inability to sit still and depressed mood. The patient experienced great improvement and was able to return to normal functioning following an extremely distressing and unsuccessful period of failed treatments. This report provides evidence of a case of non-refractory symptoms of both depression and drug-induced akathisia that substantially improved following ECT with no residual adverse effects. Following ECT, the patient was prescribed 75 mg of clomipramine to prevent depression relapse.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: a systematic review and digital tool development [^032f3b5e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

The study had two methodological stages (figure 1). For the first stage of creating side-effect databases, we did a systematic umbrella review of published meta-analyses following a prespecified protocol, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372142; appendix pp 2–5). Two authors (TP and RAMcC) separately searched Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from database inception up to June 26, 2023, for meta-analyses that ranked antidepressants when used as monotherapy by individuals with major depressive disorder, or antipsychotics when used as monotherapy by individuals with schizophrenia, on the basis of relative magnitude or risk of side-effects. The search results were cross-checked with differences resolved by discussion between the two authors. To allow broad drug comparisons, we focused on side-effects that are common among antipsychotics or antidepressants, as defined in clinical guideline documents. As such, we did not include side-effects considered to be largely clozapine specific (eg, myocarditis and agranulocytosis). The search terms used were: (antidepressant OR antipsychotic) AND (extrapyramidal OR parkinsonism OR dyskinesia OR dystonia OR akathisia OR prolactin OR headache OR agitation OR insomnia OR cholinergic OR gastrointestinal OR constipation OR nausea OR arrythmia OR QTc OR hypotension OR hypertension OR weight OR glucose OR lipid OR cholesterol OR triglyceride OR sedation OR natraemia OR natremia OR sodium OR thromboembolism OR sexual) AND meta-analysis. To reduce heterogeneity, we only included meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials examining antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy in the treatment of depression or schizophrenia, respectively, and drugs assessed within the meta-analysis needed a common comparator. We also only included studies on adults aged 18 years or older. In recognition that some side-effects (eg, venous thromboembolism and tardive dyskinesia) might occur after longer-term treatment, we included meta-analyses of trials examining both acute and maintenance treatment. Only studies written in English were selected. Summary estimates were sought and, if data were missing, study authors were contacted. In anticipation of inadequate meta-analytic coverage of some side-effects, we aimed to supplement results with ordinal ranking data from guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. As such, in parallel to the meta-analytic review, we also reviewed national and international guideline documents and similar sources (eg, consensus statements and clinical guideline resources) for the management of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder in adult populations (age ≥ 18 years); these documents were selected from the reference lists of previous umbrella reviews in the field (appendix p 9). Guidelines were selected if they provided ordinal rankings for drug side-effects.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^625c6118]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

When patients present with restlessness and agitation, anxiety is the most likely differential in most physicians' minds. However, the possibility of the subjectively distressing condition called 'akathisia' should always be considered. Akathisia should be screened for by checking any akathisia-inducing medication prescribed. Various medications used in general medical settings can induce akathisia, such as, metoclopramide, azithromycin, SSRIs and antipsychotics.

Antipsychoticuse can cause drug-induced movement disorders and lead to drug-induced Parkinsonism. This cluster of symptoms is commonly referred to as extrapyramidal syndrome.

Drug-induced Parkinsonism can be easily misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease as the clinical features of these two conditions are indistinguishable. Clinical features common to both disorders include bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and movement disorders. To distinguish between the two disorders, a DAT scan was ordered in this case. DAT imaging is useful for diagnosing presynaptic Parkinsonism, as dopamine uptake is significantly decreased in Parkinson's disease, and this helps to differentiate it from postsynaptic blockage by drug-induced Parkinsonism.

Recommendation 6 — adjunctive treatments in youth with schizophrenia spectrum disorders — states: Some youth with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may benefit from adjunctive medication treatments to address side effects of the antipsychotic agent or to alleviate associated symptomatology (e.g., agitation, mood instability, depression, explosive outbursts). [CG] Adjunctive medications commonly used in clinical practice include anticholinergic agents (extrapyramidal side effects), β-blockers (akathisia), mood stabilizers (mood instability, aggression), and antidepressants (depression, negative symptoms), and/or benzodiazepines (anxiety, insomnia, akathisia). Benzodiazepines also are used as primary treatments for catatonia, and there are no studies systematically addressing the use of adjunctive agents in youth with schizophrenia.

### Tetrabenazine [^e5f9c837]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with tetrabenazine tablets and other drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection), and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.

The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of tetrabenazine tablets; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.

Recurrence of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy. If treatment with tetrabenazine tablets is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence.

5.5 Akathisia, Restlessness, and Agitation

Tetrabenazine tablets may increase the risk of akathisia, restlessness, and agitation.

In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, akathisia was observed in 10 (19%) of tetrabenazine tablets-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In an 80-week, open-label study, akathisia was observed in 20% of tetrabenazine tablets-treated patients.

Patients receiving tetrabenazine tablets should be monitored for the presence of akathisia. Patients receiving tetrabenazine tablets should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia, the tetrabenazine tablets dose should be reduced; however, some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.

### Management of tardive syndrome: medications and surgical treatments [^718ac634]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Tardive syndrome (TS) is an iatrogenic, often persistent movement disorder caused by drugs that block dopamine receptors. It has a broad phenotype including movement (orobuccolingual stereotypy, dystonia, tics, and others) and nonmotor features (akathisia and pain). TS has garnered increased attention of late because of the Food and Drug Administration approval of the first therapeutic agents developed specifically for this purpose. This paper will begin with a discussion on pathogenesis, clinical features, and epidemiology. However, the main focus will be treatment options currently available for TS including a suggested algorithm based on current evidence. Recently, there have been significant advances in TS therapy, particularly with the development of 2 new vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors for TS and with new data on the efficacy of deep brain stimulation. The discussion will start with switching antipsychotics and the use of clozapine monotherapy which, despite the lack of higher-level evidence, should be considered for the treatment of psychosis and TS. Anti-dyskinetic drugs are separated into 3 tiers: 1) vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors, which have level A evidence, are approved for use in TS and are recommended first-choice agents; 2) drugs with lower level of evidence for efficacy including clonazepam, Ginkgo biloba, and amantadine; and 3) drugs that have the potential to be beneficial, but currently have insufficient evidence including levetiracetam, piracetam, vitamin B 6, melatonin, baclofen, propranolol, zolpidem, and zonisamide. Finally, the roles of botulinum toxin and surgical therapy will be examined. Current therapies, though improved, are symptomatic. Next steps should focus on the prevention and reversal of the pathogenic process.

### Clinical characteristics and associated factors in antipsychotic-induced akathisia of Asian patients with schizophrenia [^a3a914ad]. Schizophrenia Research (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied the prevalence of akathisia and its relationship to a number of sociodemographic and clinical factors in a population of Chinese inpatients with Schizophrenia.

Method

Six-hundred and forty-five patients were recruited for the study. Akathisia was assessed using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), dyskinesia by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE) were assessed by the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS).

Results

Only 35 (5%) patients were assessed to have akathisia. There was no gender or ethnic difference in the rates of akathisia. However, the majority of the patients (65%) were receiving an anticholinergic agent at the time of the study.

Conclusion

Our findings of an overlap between TD and EPSE support the suggestion that there may be a common vulnerability for these movement disorders. The finding of a low rate of akathisia among our Asian patients suggests an inter-ethnic difference in the vulnerability for the development of akathisia. However, comparing our results with the rates reported from other countries may be hampered by the diagnostic and methodological differences across studies.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported with acute treatment in adults with schizophrenia were akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, and somnolence. The safety profile of SAPHRIS in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults was similar to that seen with acute treatment.

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) reported with acute monotherapy treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults were somnolence, oral hypoesthesia dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (excluding akathisia) and akathisia; and during the adjunctive therapy trial in bipolar I disorder in adults were somnolence and oral hypoesthesia. The rates were lower at the 5mg twice daily dose than the 10mg twice daily dose for all of these most common adverse reactions. The safety profile of SAPHRIS in the maintenance treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults was similar to that seen with acute treatment.

The adult information below is derived from a clinical trial database for SAPHRIS consisting of over 5355 patients and/or healthy subjects exposed to one or more sublingual doses of SAPHRIS. A total of 1427 SAPHRIS-treated patients were treated for at least 24 weeks and 785 SAPHRIS-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure at therapeutic doses.

### Clonidine for management of agitation in delirious patients [^6ae0e041]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Agitation/Anxiety/Akathisia

Due to its nature as a sympatholytic, clinicians have used clonidine to target hyperactive symptoms such as anxiety and agitation in various settings. It has been used to improve akathisia, whether it is drug-related or not. For example, in one case of a woman with TBI and agitation complicated by risperidone-induced akathisia, clonidine 0.025 BID was successfully utilized to resolve akathisia, and was well-tolerated. Other studies have replicated this finding in this population. It has also been shown to be well tolerated for agitation in other sensitive populations. For example, patient with TBI are sensitive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, so when considering an agent to treat akathisia, in a patient where beta-blockers may be contraindicated (such as those with asthma, diabetes, or COPD), reasonable options include bromocriptine or clonidine. Another case describes a patient with Alzheimer Disease, a population notoriously sensitive to certain medications, who had a positive response to clonidine for agitation. Another study reported an Alzheimer patient that had a decreased requirement for benzodiazepines and restraints after administration of clonidine 0.1 mg BID, and a case of a patient with major neurocognitive disorder. The transdermal formulation of clonidine is superior for anxiety, as compared to its oral form, the transdermal form provides a slow release of medication, thereby preventing the sedation from peak levels. It also avoids rebound anxiety related to rapid metabolism of the oral form. The transdermal formulation's efficacy is distinct from the oral form.

### The safety and tolerability of aripiprazole once-monthly as maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study [^5a0a086e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400), an atypical long-acting injectable antipsychotic, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (BP-I). We further assess safety and tolerability and characterize adverse events (AEs) across the duration of aripiprazole exposure.

Methods

Patients with BP-I were stabilized on oral aripiprazole (2–8 weeks), AOM 400 (12–28 weeks), followed by 1:1 randomization of patients meeting stability criteria to a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were collected across study phases. AEs were counted in a phase if they were drug-related and continued from the baseline of that phase. A separate analysis on new-onset akathisia was conducted.

Results

Among TEAEs occurring in ≥ 10% of patients during all study phases were akathisia (23.3%) and weight increased (10.6%). Median time to akathisia onset was 20 days after starting oral aripiprazole; median duration was 29 days for the first occurrence; 21/168 patients (12.5%) reporting akathisia experienced > 1 episode. Episodes of new-onset akathisia decreased over time, with few events reported in the randomized phase. Weight gain was minimal with oral aripiprazole, generally starting within 3 months after the first AOM 400 injection, and appearing to plateau at 36 weeks. The mean weight gain within any study phase was ≤ 1.0 kg. Potentially clinically significant changes in metabolic parameters were uncommon.

Limitations

Patients on placebo had AOM 400 exposure before randomization.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that AEs with AOM 400 treatment were time-limited and support AOM 400 as a well-tolerated maintenance treatment of BP-I.

### Movement disorders in psychiatric patients [^5c7fdb9b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Acute antipsychotic drug-related motor syndromes

With the acute motor syndromes caused by antipsychotics — akathisia and acute dystonic reactions — the relationship to D2 dopamine receptor blockade is clearer. Akathisia, with an incidence ranging from 21% to 75%, is a sensorimotor syndrome consisting of inner restlessness, an urge to move, an objective component of restless movement and, sometimes, prominent dysphoria. It usually occurs acutely and improves with drug withdrawal, though it has a chronic or tardive counterpart that may worsen with cessation of dopamine receptor blockade.

Acute dystonic reactions are seen predominantly in younger patients, males being more susceptible. They are reportedly more likely to occur with the injectable DRBAs or with higher doses. While akathisia may develop within minutes of a first dose of antipsychotic treatment, acute dystonic reactions are usually delayed by at least 12 hours. This may relate to the drop in blood level of the medication. Ninety per cent of reactions begin within 3–5 days. The prevalence of acute dystonia has been estimated to range from 2.3% to 60% of patients treated with conventional antipsychotics, and from 2% to 3% with atypical ones. The usual manifestations are orofacial dystonia, back arching, neck extension and occasionally laryngospasm. Pisa syndrome, characterised by tonic lateroflexion of the trunk, may occur as subacute dystonic reaction 3–10 days after starting a DRBA, or as a form of tardive dystonia.

Pharmacologically, the responsiveness of acute dystonic reactions to anticholinergic agents suggests that early cholinergic overactivity in response to a dopamine receptor antagonist is an important factor.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^5a0dbcdf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Schizophrenia — acupuncture added to pharmacotherapy: The guideline states, "There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against augmenting pharmacotherapy with acupuncture to reduce negative and positive symptoms for individuals with schizophrenia", and labels this as "(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added)". Cited evidence includes a systematic review of "30 RCTs, 29 of which consisted of Chinese populations", where "evidence from only four of the RCTs indicated that acupuncture plus standard-dose antipsychotics improves positive and negative symptoms… compared with standard-dose antipsychotics alone", while "The same four RCTs indicated that no such effect occurs in treatment with acupuncture plus low-dose antipsychotics". Modalities reviewed were "traditional, electro-acupuncture, acupoint injection, laser acupuncture, and acupoint catgut embedding treatment", with low-quality signals that acupuncture "might improve relapse rates and akathisia" and "might decrease the likelihood that individuals will experience a worsening in global state". Safety notes include "with few adverse effects" and that "None of the studies reported severe adverse outcomes, such as death, engagement with various services, patient satisfaction with care, QoL, or economic outcomes". The Work Group stated this topic is "Reviewed, New-added", that "The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low", and identified "limitations, including cultural factors that might impact the generalizability to individuals in the VA and DoD settings".

### Neuroleptic-induced acute and chronic akathisia: a clinical comparison [^14e01ad9]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

We compared the severity of subjective and objective symptomatology of akathisia between the acute and chronic subtypes of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Sixty-one schizophrenic subjects were evaluated. Multivariate analysis revealed that motor manifestations and distress of akathisia were less severe in chronic akathisia than in acute akathisia. The severity of subjective restlessness was not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, there were differences in the severity of symptoms and signs between the acute and chronic subtypes of akathisia, suggesting that the severity of the subjective and objective components of akathisia may be differentially affected by the duration of akathisia.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^2bf56cf8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic side effects in dementia — first-generation agents — include a broad range of common adverse effects that vary with medication potency, with high-potency agents (e.g., haloperidol, fluphenazine) most strongly associated with akathisia and parkinsonism symptoms and low-potency agents (e.g., thioridazine, chlorpromazine) associated with sedation, central and peripheral anticholinergic effects, and postural hypotension; in older populations after longer-term treatment, rates of tardive dyskinesia are five- to sixfold greater than in younger populations, and individuals with dementia with co-occurring extrapyramidal disorders (as in dementia with Lewy bodies) may show extraordinary sensitivity to first-generation antipsychotic agents.

### Remission of treatment-resistant depression with tardive akathisia with electroconvulsive therapy [^6ead29df]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old woman presented with symptoms of low mood, loss of interest, nervousness and anxiety. After several unresponsive trials of SSRIs (paroxetine, escitalopram) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; venlafaxine, duloxetine), she was diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. Although her depressive symptoms and anxiety showed minimal improvement after the trial of these antidepressants, the patient did not have any suicidal thoughts at this point.

Subsequently, she was prescribed the antipsychotic agent, olanzapine, to augment the SSRI escitalopram. This combination of medications did improve her symptoms for several weeks. However, a few weeks later while on escitalopram and olanzapine, the patient suddenly developed severe restlessness, inability to sit down and had to constantly pace around to feel more at ease. This would last until late at night affecting her sleep. Symptoms continued for weeks and as a result the patient became exhausted, severely distressed and exhibited suicidal thoughts and actions. For this reason, the patient was admitted as an inpatient in a psychiatric ward. After several weeks of suffering, the objective motor symptoms and inner restlessness were attributed to tardive akathisia using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. It is important to note that although the patient was depressed, she displayed important signs of akathisia. She expressed severe distress associated with a sense of inner restlessness. She also reported a strong desire to walk and pace around most of the time which was the only way she could alleviate her restlessness. This is a characteristic feature of akathisia and constitutes one of the criteria of the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. On observation, the patient was unable to remain seated and was constantly rocking from foot to foot. Consequently, the causative agents were withdrawn but her inner restlessness remained unaltered even after the withdrawal of both the antipsychotic and SSRI. The patient scored 5/5 on the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (severe akathisia). At this point, doctors where uncertain on how to proceed as literature provides minimal guidelines on how to tackle such cases. Meanwhile her symptoms were severe, and the patient was still suicidal.

### Prevalence of spontaneous movement disorders (dyskinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia) in never-treated patients with chronic and first-episode psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^341bc71a]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Finally, there was considerable variability in the choice of diagnostic tools and case definitions, with some studies using arbitrary thresholds that led to the inclusion of mild or borderline cases as positive cases. This variability in rating scale choice and case definitions could have contributed to the high heterogeneity of the overall pooled data, although subgroup comparisons stratified by diagnostic tool choice in dyskinesia data did not show significant differences. Furthermore, the reliability of outcome measures was also questioned, as some studies lacked inter-rater comparisons as highlighted in our risk of bias assessment (online supplemental table). In the case of akathisia, which can be a challenging construct in acutely psychotic individuals, some studies used rating scales that only provided a global score, while lacking the objective and subjective subdomains found in scales such as BARS. Additionally, some rating tools, for example, ESRS, are more weighted towards parkinsonism compared with other movement disorders, resulting in variable prevalence rates across studies. On the other hand, due to its predominance among SMDs, parkinsonism may have caused diagnostic overshadowing or 'masking' of other conditions, such as dystonia, in keeping with its inconsistent reporting across the included studies.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^51759544]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of First-Episode Psychosis and Schizophrenia — antipsychotic treatment benefits, harms, and selection: In summary, the potential benefits of treatment and the harms associated with withholding treatment far outweigh the potential harms associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotic medications differ from each other in their side effect profile; FGAs (e.g., fluphenazine, haloperidol) are more prone to produce extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonian symptoms, akathisia, dystonias, TD, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, especially when used at higher doses, whereas SGAs (e.g., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) are less likely than FGAs to cause EPS but might be associated with an increased risk of weight gain and other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemias and type 2 diabetes mellitus. FGAs and SGAs that bind strongly to the dopamine D2 receptor might cause prolactin elevation, which can lead to galactorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and sexual dysfunction, and both classes might cause cardiovascular side effects, including dysrhythmias and QT prolongation, and, rarely, seizures. Considering the variability in side effect profiles, the choice of antipsychotic medication should be based on an individualized evaluation that considers individual characteristics, including culturally influenced beliefs about mental illness and medication, and preferences and the side effect profiles of the different antipsychotic medications. Patient preferences vary; individuals with schizophrenia might have concerns about experiencing side effects and might perceive long-term treatment to be a practical and psychological burden; equity issues include decreased use of SGAs in African American populations that exposes individuals to increased risk of EPS, including TD, and possibly adversely impacts adherence and treatment response; acceptability issues are related to side effects (see Recommendations 14–18); and subgroup considerations include the use of lower antipsychotic doses in adolescents and elderly people with schizophrenia because of increased sensitivity and reduced rates of drug metabolism. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation, categorized it as Reviewed, New-added, judged the confidence in the quality of the evidence to be moderate, and noted limitations including a marked risk of bias.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^30e3ab5a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline — persistent headache in pregnancy states that ACOG recommends metoclopramide 10 mg (intravenous or enteral), alone or in combination with diphenhydramine 25 mg (intravenous or enteral) as additional treatment for persistent headache in pregnancy (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Use of metoclopramide is particularly helpful for women with migraine-associated nausea, and although metoclopramide is preferred because of its better safety profile, other common antiemetics can also be used. Oral diphenhydramine 25 mg may be co-administered with metoclopramide to counter akathisia, and the sedating effects of the antihistamine may also help with migraine resolution.

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^f441b934]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic neurologic adverse effects — incidence, timing, and management — Acute dystonia is characterized by involuntary motor tics or spasms and can include rare, potentially life‑threatening laryngeal dystonia presenting as a choking sensation, difficulty breathing, or stridor. Akathisia generally occurs within the first few days of antipsychotic medication administration, is found in up to 25% of patients, and has been reported after a single, standard dose (10 mg) of prochlorperazine; both acute dystonia and akathisia tend to occur early (days to weeks) and are easily reversed. To minimize these adverse effects, some advocate coadministering 25 to 50 mg of diphenhydramine or 1 to 2 mg of benztropine when giving an antipsychotic, whereas others prefer anticholinergic treatment only if acute symptoms occur, followed by 2 days of oral therapy. Delayed‑onset syndromes include Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia; Parkinsonism symptoms are found in up to 13% of patients and generally occur weeks to months after starting antipsychotic therapy, and drug‑induced Parkinsonism is often treated by adding an anticholinergic agent, adding a dopaminergic agonist (eg, amantadine), or decreasing the dosage of a typical antipsychotic or switching to an atypical antipsychotic, with early diagnosis and rapid withdrawal possibly improving complete recovery. Tardive dyskinesia occurs in 5% of young patients per year and is more common with older "typical" antipsychotics, and antipsychotic‑induced seizures are rare (usually < 1%) at therapeutic doses except for clozapine, which has a 5% incidence at high doses.

Differential diagnoses

A thorough differential diagnosis should assess for factors that may contribute to the clinical presentation and/or mimic symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These may include other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, mood disorders, and tic disorders; medical conditions, such as sleep disturbance and hyperthyroidism; adverse effects of medications, such as movement disorders like akathisia due to an antipsychotic medication; or environmental considerations, such as an unbefitting school placement. In some cases, a medical workup may be indicated to assess for medical causes, such as thyroid function tests to check for endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism. See Table 3 for signs and symptoms to assist with recognition of ADHD in individuals with ASD.

Table 3
Signs and Symptoms of ADHD in ASD

Treatment

There are differences of opinion as to whether to first initiate pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline on ADHD in the general population identifies parent-training behavior management (PTBM) as the first-line approach for preschool-aged children and medication management in conjunction with PTBM and behavioral classroom interventions for youth ages six years or older. Young et al. outline many non-pharmacological avenues through which to support children and adults with co-occuring ASD and ADHD and how to tailor these to meet the needs of the individual. Their practice recommendations echo the AAP guideline's focus on education for parents, along with career and occupational skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other behavioral and educational approaches both for individuals with ASD and ADHD and their families.

Medications approved by the FDA to treat ADHD include psychostimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine salts), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and α 2 -adrenergic agonists (Fig. 2, Table 4). The data examining the effectiveness of these medications in patients with ASD and ADHD is more limited.

In relation to non-autistic SOC

While stimulants are the first-line pharmacological treatment for ADHD in non-autistic populations, non-stimulants may be more suitable than stimulants for many autistic patients based on their unique clinical profiles.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorder [^6e7efa69]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2010). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents — differential diagnosis is emphasized by the directive that the psychiatric assessment "Should Consider Differential Diagnoses of Other Psychiatric Disorders and Physical Conditions That May Mimic PTSD (MS)". Symptom overlap is described with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), other anxiety disorders, juvenile mania, and primary substance-use disorders; for the latter, "these youths will typically benefit more from receiving treatment for substance use than for PTSD". Psychotic presentations require care because agitation, hypervigilance, and social withdrawal "may mimic a psychotic disorder", unusual perceptions should be distinguished from hallucinations, and "the likelihood of a delirium should also be considered". Physical contributors include conditions such as "caffeineism, migraine, asthma, seizure disorder, and catecholamine- or serotonin-secreting tumors", and medication effects from "antihistamines, sympathomimetics, steroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics (akathisia), and atypical antipsychotics", as well as nonprescription "diet pills, antihistamines, and cold medicines". For youths with somatic complaints, "a mental health assessment should be considered early", and "there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that severe trauma exposure adversely affects immunologic functioning in children".

### Quetiapine (quetiapine fumarate) [^dad50ff9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Four methods were used to measure EPS: (1) Simpson-Angus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS.

 Adults: In placebo-controlled clinical trials with quetiapine, utilizing doses up to 800 mg per day, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS ranged from 8% to 11% for quetiapine and 4% to 11% for placebo.

In three-arm placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia, utilizing doses between 300 mg and 800 mg of quetiapine extended-release tablets, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS was 8% for quetiapine extended-release tablets and 8% for Seroquel (without evidence of being dose related), and 5% in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, and muscle rigidity) was generally low and did not exceed 3% for any treatment group.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1b3d1f7e]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — maintenance and acute mania pharmacotherapy considerations emphasize that "Priority should be given to treatments effective for maintenance treatment to prevent the return of mood episodes; maintenance treatment is the cornerstone of treatment for BD". Evidence suggests that aripiprazole has potentially less efficacy compared with other agents. Valproate shows a small effect size (0.26) with liver toxicity and coagulopathy risks, its use "should be considered carefully", and "Valproate should be prescribed only as a last resort to individuals of childbearing potential" due to teratogenic and developmental harms. Carbamazepine poses severe risks to women of childbearing potential, has a Black Box warning recommending genomic testing (for HLA-B✱1502) in certain populations — specifically for those of Chinese descent — because of risk of a deadly rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [SJS/TEN]) and also has many drug–drug interactions. Patient preferences vary given side effect profiles: haloperidol has a higher risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects, and cariprazine had a 29% incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and a 21% incidence of akathisia in trials in BD. Asenapine requires sublingual administration for several minutes (twice daily) with unclear feasibility in more severely ill manic patients, and there is a lack of evidence for effectiveness of the asenapine transdermal patch. Ziprasidone must be taken twice daily with 500 kilocalories of food for proper absorption, and the intramuscular formulation takes increased time to administer secondary to preparation. The Work Group categorized the evidence as Reviewed, New-added with low confidence and noted limitations; benefits of these drugs in acute mania slightly outweighed harms, and because these treatments have no evidence preventing recurrence of mania or depression, "these drugs are not recommended as preferred treatments for acute mania".

Paroxetine controlled release — adult dosing and duration, adverse effects, and cautions are detailed: 62.5 mg/d (12.5–75 mg/d), starting at 25 mg/d and increasing by 12.5 mg/d at intervals of at least one week, with an adequate trial of 12 weeks, and use lower doses in the elderly. Notable adverse effects include drowsiness, nausea, insomnia, headache, dizziness, diaphoresis, weakness, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, akathisia, suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, sexual dysfunction, and discontinuation syndrome. Comments include availability of immediate-release tablets (20–60 mg/d), contraindicated with MAOIs and within 14 days of starting or stopping MAOIs, and that it is the most sedating SSRI with potent anticholinergic effects and as a 2D6 substrate has potentially significant interactions that may require dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy.

### Pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression: antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics [^362a2b7d]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) affects one in three patients with major depressive disorder and is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Studies of real-world practices suggest that antidepressant monotherapy continues to be the most widely used treatment after inadequate response to a first-line treatment. However, rates of remission with antidepressants in TRD are suboptimal. Atypical antipsychotics are the most widely studied augmentation agent and aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, quetiapine extended-release, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are approved for depression. Benefits of using atypical antipsychotics for TRD has to be weighted against their potential adverse events, such as weight gain, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia.

### Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^f58b386d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tardive Dyskinesia

The syndrome is characterized by involuntary choreoathetoid movements which variously involve the tongue, face, mouth, lips, or jaw (e.g., protrusion of the tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of the mouth, chewing movements), trunk and extremities. The severity of the syndrome and the degree of impairment produced vary widely.

The syndrome may become clinically recognizable either during treatment, upon dosage reduction, or upon withdrawal of treatment. Movements may decrease in intensity and may disappear altogether if further treatment with neuroleptics is withheld. It is generally believed that reversibility is more likely after short rather than long term neuroleptic exposure. Consequently, early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important. To increase the likelihood of detecting the syndrome at the earliest possible time, the dosage of neuroleptic drug should be reduced periodically (if clinically possible) and the patient observed for signs of the disorder. It has been suggested that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome, and that the full blown syndrome may not develop if medication is stopped when lingual vermiculation appears.

Dystonia: Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.
Akathisia: Akathisia presents as constant motor restlessness. The patient with akathisia often complains, when asked, about his/her inability to stop moving. Akathisia should not be treated with an increased dose of neuroleptic; rather, the dose of antipsychotic may be lowered until the motor restlessness has subsided. The efficacy of anticholinergic treatment of this side effect is unestablished.
Pseudoparkinsonism: Pseudoparkinsonism refers to a drug-induced state similar to the classic syndrome. Generally, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents (i.e., benztropine, biperiden, procyclidine, or trihexphenidyl) and amantadine are helpful in alleviating symptoms that cannot be managed by neuroleptic dose reduction. The value of prophylactic antiparkinsonian drug therapy has not been established. The need for continued use of antiparkinsonian medication should be reevaluated periodically.
