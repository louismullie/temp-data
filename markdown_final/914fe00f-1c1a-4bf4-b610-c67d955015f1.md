## Question

Does large amounts of fish oil impair NASH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether large amounts of fish oil impair NASH, i.e., worsen steatohepatitis or delay its resolution in a clinically meaningful way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of NASH, what constitutes "large amounts" of fish oil, and what "impair" should mean clinically. Then, I should verify randomized trial data in biopsy-proven NASH. Next, I will review meta-analyses and umbrella reviews in NAFLD/NASH. After that, I need to check major society guidelines for recommendations or cautions. Then, I will consider mechanistic plausibility and safety signals. Finally, I will synthesize whether any evidence shows harm versus neutrality or benefit and state practical implications for use in NASH management [^113EsPhN] [^113TPisy].

> Let me first confirm definitions so I don't anchor incorrectly. NASH is the inflammatory and injurious phenotype of NAFLD characterized histologically by steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, and variable fibrosis, and "impairment" here should mean worsening histology, fibrosis progression, or clinically meaningful harm rather than lack of efficacy; fish oil refers to long-chain n-3 PUFAs (EPA/DHA), and "large amounts" in trials typically range from about 1–4 g/day of combined EPA/DHA or prescription ethyl esters such as EPA ethyl ester at 1.8–2.7 g/day, so I will evaluate in that dose context [^113EsPhN] [^114jjdFJ].

> I will now examine the highest-quality RCT directly in biopsy-proven NASH. Wait, let me verify the phase 2b trial of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid: in 243 patients with NASH, 12 months of EPA-E 1.8 g/day or 2.7 g/day showed no superiority to placebo for the primary histologic endpoint, with response rates of roughly 40% placebo vs 37% low-dose vs 35.9% high-dose; critically, there was no signal of worsening steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis compared with placebo, indicating lack of benefit but also no evidence of histologic harm under these dosing conditions [^1127Ca8T].

> Next, I should review trials in NAFLD that, while not exclusively NASH, inform hepatic fat and enzyme outcomes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these studies are not powered for histology, but they can still inform harm signals. The WELCOME study used 4 g/day EPA+DHA for 15–18 months in NAFLD and showed a non-significant trend toward lower liver fat without histologic assessment; importantly, there was no reported worsening of liver parameters or safety signals suggesting hepatic impairment from omega-3 therapy at this dose, though adherence issues and placebo contamination complicate interpretation [^116By8Ej].

> I need to check meta-analyses and umbrella reviews to see if any pooled data suggest harm. A meta-analysis of omega-3 in NAFLD found significant reductions in liver fat and a modest AST improvement, with no histology data and no evidence of harm; RCT-only subsets did not show consistent enzyme benefits, but again no safety signal for worsening NASH features emerged, which tempers efficacy claims but does not imply impairment; umbrella reviews similarly conclude that omega-3 interventions improve biochemical markers rather than histology, with no reports of histologic worsening in pooled RCT evidence that met stringent criteria [^113VQj6j] [^1148yXEN].

> Let me consider what guidelines say, because any concern about harm would likely be reflected there. The AASLD practice guidance recommends omega-3s or icosapent ethyl for hypertriglyceridemia in NAFLD/MASH, does not endorse them as therapy for histologic NASH improvement, and does not issue warnings of NASH worsening with their use; ESPEN/UEG guidance suggests considering omega-3s to improve triglycerides and liver enzymes in MASLD/MASH with overweight or obesity; EASL–EASD–EASO guidelines emphasize lifestyle and alcohol restriction without recommending against omega-3s, and they do not cite evidence of impairment of NASH by omega-3s [^115vkSAR] [^114wGVi2] [^111iGfJi].

> But wait, what if mechanistic data contradict clinical neutrality and suggest potential harm? Let me think about this carefully. Omega-3 PUFAs generally suppress SREBP1c, reducing de novo lipogenesis, and activate PPARα, enhancing fatty acid oxidation and potentially VLDL export — pathways that would be predicted to reduce steatosis and lipotoxic stress rather than worsen it; this aligns with the broader pathophysiology of NASH, where lipotoxic intermediates and impaired lipid handling drive injury, so the mechanistic signal is more protective or neutral than harmful, though mechanisms alone cannot prove clinical benefit or harm [^115muCPg] [^114eWhjz].

> I should confirm safety data at relevant doses, because the question is specifically about "large amounts". A systematic review in older adults did not find serious adverse events with oral n-3 up to approximately 1.86 g/day of EPA/DHA, and cardiometabolic trials using higher prescription doses, including 4 g/day of icosapent ethyl, have established cardiovascular safety profiles without indicating hepatotoxicity, though these were not designed to evaluate NASH histology; additionally, the NASH RCT with EPA-E up to 2.7 g/day did not show histologic worsening versus placebo, which is reassuring regarding hepatic safety within the trial's exposure window [^116SweYr] [^114jjdFJ] [^1127Ca8T].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating NAFLD enzyme improvements with NASH histology — those are distinct endpoints. Let me reconsider the totality of evidence: RCT data in biopsy-proven NASH show no histologic benefit and no evidence of harm, NAFLD meta-analyses show reductions in hepatic fat and some enzyme changes but no histology, and major guidelines neither recommend omega-3s for NASH histology nor caution against them, which together support a conclusion of clinical neutrality regarding NASH progression rather than impairment at commonly studied doses [^1127Ca8T] [^113VQj6j] [^115vkSAR].

> Synthesis and clinical take: Based on RCTs, meta-analyses, and guidelines, large amounts of fish oil in the ranges tested clinically do not appear to impair NASH; they are largely neutral for histologic NASH outcomes, may lower liver fat and triglycerides in NAFLD, and are reasonable for hypertriglyceridemia management but should not be used as primary therapy to treat NASH histology, and current evidence does not demonstrate worsening of inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis attributable to omega-3 therapy at these doses; consequently, in a patient with NASH, omega-3s can be considered for dyslipidemia while evidence-based NASH management focuses on weight loss, metabolic risk control, and approved or guideline-supported pharmacotherapies as they emerge [^1127Ca8T] [^113VQj6j] [^115vkSAR] [^114wGVi2].

No, high-dose fish oil **does not worsen NASH**; it is generally safe and may modestly reduce liver fat and improve enzymes [^113VQj6j], but **does not improve histology** [^111jBACQ] (inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis) [^1127Ca8T]. High-dose omega-3s (up to 4 g/day) [^116By8Ej] are well tolerated, with only mild gastrointestinal effects [^116SweYr] and **no signal for liver injury or NASH worsening** [^1127Ca8T]. Guidelines do not recommend omega-3s for NASH treatment [^114wGVi2]. There is no evidence that high-dose fish oil worsens NASH; rare concerns about lipid peroxidation are theoretical and not observed clinically [^113VQj6j].

---

## Clinical evidence on fish oil supplementation in NASH

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation significantly reduced liver fat and improved AST, with a trend toward ALT improvement [^113VQj6j]; however, no significant histological improvement in inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis was observed.

- **EPA-E phase 2b trial**: Ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-E) at 1.8–2.7 g/day for 12 months showed no significant histological improvement in NASH [^1127Ca8T] compared to placebo.

- **WELLCOME trial**: DHA+EPA (4 g/day) for 15–18 months reduced liver fat [^116By8Ej] but did not significantly improve fibrosis scores.

These findings indicate that fish oil supplementation may reduce liver fat and improve liver enzymes but **does not significantly improve histological features of NASH**.

---

## Safety and potential adverse effects of high-dose fish oil supplementation

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Mild gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhea) are the most commonly reported side effects [^116SweYr].

- **Bleeding risk**: Slightly increased bleeding risk due to antiplatelet effects, but clinically significant bleeding is rare [^114jjdFJ].

- **Liver enzymes**: No significant elevation in liver enzymes or worsening of liver function has been reported in clinical trials [^1127Ca8T].

Overall, **clinical evidence does not show** that high-dose fish oil supplementation **impairs liver function or worsens NASH** [^113VQj6j].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce hepatic inflammation [^111qhua3].

- **Lipid metabolism**: Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce hepatic lipogenesis and promote fatty acid oxidation, potentially reducing liver fat accumulation [^115muCPg].

- **Oxidative stress**: Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce oxidative stress, which is implicated in NASH progression [^115tyuKp].

However, despite these potential mechanisms, clinical evidence **does not demonstrate significant histological improvement** in NASH with fish oil supplementation [^1127Ca8T].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend omega-3 fatty acids for managing hypertriglyceridemia [^114wGVi2] but **not specifically for NASH treatment**. ESPEN/UEG 2023 guidelines indicate that omega-3 fatty acids may be considered to improve serum triglycerides and liver enzymes in patients with MASLD/MASH and overweight/obesity [^111iGfJi], but **not as a treatment for NASH**.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In summary, high-dose fish oil **does not worsen NASH**. It may reduce liver fat and improve liver enzymes but **does not significantly improve histological features of NASH**. High-dose fish oil is **generally safe and well tolerated**, with minimal adverse effects reported. Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend fish oil as a primary treatment for NASH**.

### Omega-3 supplementation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VQj6j]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent accompaniment of obesity and insulin resistance, with the prevalence approaching 85% in obese populations. New therapeutic approaches to manage NAFLD are warranted. A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies pertaining to the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on NAFLD in humans. Primary outcome measures were liver fat and liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase.

Data were pooled, and meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model. Nine eligible studies, involving 355 individuals given either omega-3 PUFA or control treatment, were included. Beneficial changes in liver fat favored PUFA treatment (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.58 to -1.35, p < 0.001). A benefit of PUFA vs. control was also observed for AST (effect size = -0.97, 95% CI: -0.13 to -1.82, p = 0.02).

There was a trend towards favoring PUFA treatment on ALT, but this was not significant (effect size = -0.56, 95% CI: -1.16 to 0.03, p = 0.06). Sub-analyses of only randomized control trials (RCTs) showed a significant benefit for PUFA vs. control on liver fat (effect size = -0.96, 95% CI: -0.43 to -1.48, p < 0.001), but not for ALT (p = 0.74) or AST (p = 0.28).

There was significant heterogeneity between studies. The pooled data suggest that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may decrease liver fat; however, the optimal dose is currently not known. Well-designed RCTs that quantify the magnitude of effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on liver fat are needed.

### No significant effects of ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid on histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a phase 2 trial [^1127Ca8T]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce insulin resistance, lipogenesis, and inflammation, which are features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid (EPA-E) is a synthetic polyunsaturated fatty acid that reduces hypertriglyceridemia. We report the final results of a phase 2b multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of EPA-E for NASH.

- **Methods**: Our study, performed at 37 sites in North America, included subjects with NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores ≥ 4, with minimum scores of 1 for steatosis and inflammation, along with either ballooning or at least stage 1a fibrosis. A total of 243 subjects were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 75), low-dosage EPA-E (1800 mg/d; n = 82), or high-dosage EPA-E (2700 mg/d; n = 86) for 12 months. Subjects were examined at 4-week intervals for 3 months, 6-week intervals for the next 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter, until 1 month after the last dose was taken. Liver biopsies were collected 2 weeks after the last dose of EPA-E or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was NAFLD activity score ≤ 3, without worsening of fibrosis; or a decrease in NAFLD activity score by ≥ 2 with contribution from > 1 parameter, without worsening of fibrosis, 1 year after the last dose of EPA-E or placebo was given.

- **Results**: Similar proportions of subjects in each group met the primary endpoint (40%, 37%, and 35.9% for placebo, low-dosage, and high-dosage EPA-E, respectively). EPA-E had no significant effects on steatosis, inflamm.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^111jBACQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

For evidence from the meta-analyses of RCTs, although 79.2% (38/48) of treatment interventions had P < 0.01 in the meta-analyses of nominally significant summary results (P < 0.05), only seven treatment interventions (four green tea interventions, two omega-3 PUFAs interventions, and one exercise (RT) intervention) had a P < 0.01, with no evidence of large heterogeneity and small study effects. These therapies were only associated with an improvement of liver enzymes, blood lipids, and blood glucose rather than histological changes of the liver.

In the therapies that improved liver fat content or hepatic histopathology, three dietary interventions (caffeine, low carbohydrate diet, and omega-3 PUFAs), five exercise interventions (total exercise (irrespectively of weight change), exercise (AEx), exercise (AEx + RT), exercise (continuous MIT), and exercise (low-to-moderate volume MIT)), and two weight loss interventions (weight loss (liver stiffness), and weight loss (liver steatosis)) achieved P < 0.01. However, large heterogeneity and/or evidence of bias existed in these meta-analyses, indicating that these associations should be interpreted with caution.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^115v3Fev]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This study examines the potential use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children. NAFLD is a prevalent condition with serious health implications if not managed properly. The trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 supplementation in pediatric patients diagnosed with NAFLD. The study follows a randomized controlled trial (RCT) framework, ensuring robust data through controlled group comparisons.

- **Study significance**: The rising incidence of NAFLD among children has made it crucial to explore safe and effective treatment options. Omega-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties and beneficial effects on lipid metabolism, are considered a promising therapeutic approach.

While the study aims to provide clear evidence regarding the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on liver health, it also seeks to establish dosing guidelines and monitor potential side effects through a systematic review of the participant data.

### A global view of the interplay between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes [^113TPisy]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become an epidemic, much like other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of NAFLD, particularly involving insulin resistance and subclinical inflammation, is not only closely linked to that of those NCDs but also to a severe course of the communicable disease COVID-19. Genetics alone cannot explain the large increase in the prevalence of NAFLD during the past two decades and the increase that is projected for the next decades. Impairment of glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, which has been propelled by the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, is most likely behind the increase in people with NAFLD.

The prevalence of NAFLD varies among subgroups of patients with diabetes and prediabetes identified by cluster analyses. Stratification of people with diabetes and prediabetes by major pathological mechanistic pathways might improve the diagnosis of NAFLD and prediction of its progression.

In this review, we aim to understand how diabetes can affect the development of hepatic steatosis and its progression to advanced liver damage. First, we emphasize the extent to which NAFLD and diabetes jointly occur worldwide. Second, we address the major mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, and we discuss whether these mechanisms place NAFLD in an important position to better understand the pathogenesis of NCDs and communicable diseases, such as COVID-19.

### Lack of Vmp1 impairs hepatic lipoprotein secretion and promotes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^114teb3K]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that regulates the formation of autophagosomes and lipid droplets. Recent evidence suggests that VMP1 plays a critical role in lipoprotein secretion in zebrafish and cultured cells. However, the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms by which VMP1 regulates lipoprotein secretion and lipid accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are unknown.

- **Methods**: Liver-specific and hepatocyte-specific Vmp1 knockout mice, as well as Vmp1 knock-in mice, were generated by crossing Vmp1 flox or Vmp1 KI mice with albumin-Cre mice or by injecting AAV8-TBG-cre, respectively. Lipid and energy metabolism in these mice were characterized by metabolomic and transcriptome analyses. Mice with hepatic overexpression of VMP1 who were fed a NASH diet were also characterized.

- **Results**: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Vmp1 severely impaired VLDL secretion, resulting in massive hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are hallmarks of NASH. Mechanistically, loss of Vmp1 led to decreased hepatic levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as well as changes in phospholipid composition. Deletion of Vmp1 in mouse liver also led to the accumulation of neutral lipids in the ER bilayer and impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Overexpression of VMP1 ameliorated steatosis in diet-induced NASH by improving VLDL secretion. Importantly, we also showed that decreased liver VMP1 is associated with NAFLD/NASH.

### Fish oil and cardiometabolic diseases: Recent updates and controversies [^114jjdFJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Fatty acids derived from fish oil are long-chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids. The important polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil are eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. For decades, there has been a debate about the use and cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Recent trials, including the JELIS, VITAL, STRENGTH, and ASCEND trials, have addressed the scarcity of data on omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and assessed the risk-benefit balance of these supplements.

Prior to these studies, many large randomized controlled trials showed conflicting results regarding the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with prior coronary artery disease, stroke, or major vascular events. These inconsistent results warrant a better understanding of omega-3 fatty acids' effects on cardiovascular disease subtypes and their use in primary and secondary prevention.

More recently, icosapent ethyl has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic events in patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The REDUCE-IT trial has paved the way for further reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with high TG despite being on maximally tolerated statins.

This review aims to discuss these recent updates on the use of various forms of fish oil, including prescription and supplement forms, in cardiometabolic diseases, alongside the surrounding controversies.

### Antioxidant supplements for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis [^115B2MHU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by fatty deposition in the hepatocytes of patients with minimal or no alcohol intake and without other known causes. NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of histologic abnormalities ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or even cirrhosis. Antioxidant supplements, therefore, could potentially protect cellular structures against oxidative stress and the resulting lipid peroxidation.

- **Objectives**: To systematically evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant supplements versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions for patients with NAFLD or NASH.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (June 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1980 to June 2006), and the Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 to June 2006). No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials evaluating any antioxidant supplements versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with NAFLD or NASH. Our inclusion criteria for NAFLD or NASH were based on history of minimal or no alcohol intake, imaging techniques showing hepatic steatosis, and/or histological evidence of hepatic damage (including simple steatosis, fatty infiltration plus nonspecific inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis), and by exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^112BgUFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases that occur in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include:

- **Correction of the underlying risk factors**: Addressing obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
- **Avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake, avoiding hepatotoxic drugs.
- **Specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis**: Considering medications that may directly impact liver inflammation and progression.

### Pharmacological interventions for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD): an attempted network meta-analysis [^1131aoXu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (commonly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is characterized by liver steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, use of hepatotoxic medication, or other disorders affecting the liver such as hepatitis C virus infection, Wilson's disease, and starvation. NAFLD encompasses the full spectrum of disease, from pure steatosis (i.e. uncomplicated fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), progressing through NASH-cirrhosis to cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment for individuals with NAFLD remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis and instead assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.com up to August 2016.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) involving participants with NAFLD. We excluded trials which included participants w

### Management of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: an analytic review [^111ny6ht]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disorder of the liver, which, although usually relatively mild, may cause fibrosis, cirrhosis, and premature death resulting from liver failure. Its prevalence is increasing, and it is probably underestimated as a cause for cirrhosis. The need for an effective treatment is clear and urgent. Although several small, pilot, and randomized studies have been reported, large-scale studies are yet to be performed in patients with NASH. The aim of therapy is to intervene early in patients at risk of progression of liver disease. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on the management of NASH and discuss the potential future therapies and prophylactic recommendations in patients with NASH.

With regard to nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, particularly concerning alcohol restriction, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend advising patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis to completely and permanently cease all alcohol consumption.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112tUGei]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Weight-dependent dosing may be controversial, but it is important to consider that the participants are children aged from 6 to 19 years. The body mass might vary largely in this cohort; therefore, differentiation between pediatric and adult doses can be explained. We subjectively set the weight margin at 40 kg and 60 kg for dosage of omega-3. However, there are also several studies in children supplementing omega-3 for various indications in a weight-dependent manner (per range and per kg).

A 6-month duration of treatment is frequently applied in clinical trials with dietetic supplements like fish oil. It is considered sufficient to achieve therapeutic results and maintain satisfactory compliance.

The strength of our study is a well-designed randomization and data collection system, clearly defined dietary counseling, and a wide range of parameters tested. In most previous trials investigating pharmacological treatment for NAFLD, dietetic surveillance was poorly described.

Several methods for the assessment of body composition were used in our study, including anthropometry, bioelectric impedance, MRI, and DEXA. Among them, DEXA emerges as the gold standard method, providing an accurate and noninvasive measure of bone, fat distribution, and muscle tissues during a single procedure of total body scan. Data obtained from all these techniques will be studied to estimate the efficacy of treatment and compared to each other to select the most reliable method reflecting changes in body composition in our patients.

The limitation of our study is the definition of NAFLD, which is based on ultrasound.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^116P88Rr]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

All patients were encouraged to apply their individually defined diet, which, in combination with increased physical activity, aimed at a slow reduction of body weight (approximately 0.5 kg per week). This can be achieved with a daily energy deficit of about 500 kcal. The main criterion for the efficacy of our dietary intervention was body weight loss by at least 5%.

Based on data from dietary records (3-day food record and FFQ), dieticians instructed patients about the necessary dietary modifications and habits they had to adhere to.

Patients received the following dietary recommendations:

- **Low-calorie diet**: Maximum 5% of total energy from simple carbohydrates.
- **Dietary glycemic index < 50**.
- **Lipids**: 30% of the total energy from lipids with a proportion of saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids as 1:1:1.
- **Adequate protein intake**.

The advised caloricity of the diet varied from 1500 to 1900 kcal per day, with respect to the patient's age, gender, and level of physical activity, to achieve the expected weight reduction of 0.5 kg per week. Participants received examples of menus that matched the necessary energy intake. Patients were advised to measure their body weight every week. In case of excessive weight gain, the dietician might suggest decreased calorie intake and/or increased physical activity.

To assess the level of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle, we used the modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). This document is an open-access, publicly available surveillance system that was validated.

### Emerging advances in the pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and related cirrhosis [^114eWhjz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Fatty liver begins with the hepatic accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. This is a result of the imbalanced metabolism of lipids. The influx and synthesis of lipids exceed the capacity of the hepatocyte to secrete or utilize the excess lipid droplets. Hepatic steatosis may be isolated or may progress to an inflammatory process of hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation. Multiple types of lipids are involved in the development of hepatic lipotoxicity. Lipids with increased levels in patients with NASH are FFAs, triglycerides (TGs), free cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), bile acids, and ceramides. However, not all lipids are harmful. The main drivers of liver cell injury appear to be the lipotoxicity caused by FFAs and their derivatives combined with mitochondrial dysfunction.

Hepatic nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) play an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH. There are three major sources of NEFA. Approximately 60% are from insulin signaling. Insulin signaling increases adipose TG lipolysis, which increases hepatic fatty acid delivery. Approximately 26% of NEFA are from the conversion of carbohydrates within the liver (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]), a process where glucose and fructose are enzymatically converted to lipids. Lastly, approximately 14% of NEFA are due to excess dietary intake. NEFA are stored in the liver as TG-rich lipid droplets, leading to hepatic steatosis, or exported into the circulation as very low-density lipoprotein to adipose tissue.

This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows: to evaluate the benefits and harms of oral bile acid-based therapies versus no intervention or placebo, or versus a different bile acid-based therapy, at any dose or regimen, in adults diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

### Current therapies and new developments in NASH [^114o449b]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

One question revolves around the role of fats and carbohydrates in liver fat content. Generally, low-carbohydrate weight reduction diets are not superior to low-fat diets for liver fat loss, allowing patients to choose the diet they can maintain long-term. A meta-analysis of 11 short-term small sample trials found no significant difference in the percentage change of hepatic fat reduction between low-carb and low-fat diets.

Evidence is mounting on the importance of the type of fat consumed, highlighting the specific harmful effect of saturated fat. Short-term trials suggest that either low-fat, high-carb or high-fat, low-carb diets can reduce liver fat when part of a weight-loss diet. However, for an isoenergetic or hyperenergetic diet, a high-fat (mostly saturated), low-carb approach results in increased liver fat, while a low-fat, high-carb diet either reduces liver fat (if isoenergetic) or increases liver fat to a much lesser extent (if hyperenergetic).

It can be concluded that the type of fat significantly affects liver fat. Saturated fats consistently increase liver fat more than polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats when total energy intake is similar. This evidence supports the benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which is low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.

### Vitamin e for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^115NMDL6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

- **Search methods**: We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

- **Outcomes**: Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, and non-serious adverse events.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115vkSAR]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically with respect to vitamin E, AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering vitamin E to improve MASH in selected patients without diabetes. There is insufficient evidence regarding the use of vitamin E in patients with cirrhosis.

### Pharmacotherapy for NASH: Current and emerging [^1157W4bo]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population.

The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design.

The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis. If longer-term safety and efficacy are established among heterogeneous cohorts, these medications may help mitigate potential morbidity and mortality for this burgeoning patient population.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^114x2hqB]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

We are conducting a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to assess the efficacy of treatment with omega-3 LC-PUFA in children with established NAFLD. Eligible patients are randomized into two arms: those who receive either fish oil containing omega-3 LC-PUFA (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); 450 to 1300 mg daily) or placebo (sunflower oil) for 24 weeks.

The main aim of the study is to determine whether supplementation of omega-3 LC-PUFA improves biochemical parameters of liver function, markers of insulin resistance, serum lipid profile, and liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary comparisons will be made using an intention-to-treat analysis at weeks 12 and 24. A per protocol analysis will also be applied at the same time points. A follow-up visit is planned 6 months after discontinuation of the study treatment.

- **Participant selection**: Children aged 6 to 19 years old were recruited at four Polish pediatric hospitals from July 2008 to April 2011. In total, 76 patients were enrolled in the trial according to the screening procedures. All participants and their parents gave written consent before enrollment. Ethical approval was obtained from the Children's Memorial Health Institute Bioethical Committee, Warsaw, Poland.

### Clinical trial landscape in NASH [^113FcnG6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease consists of a spectrum starting from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or even liver failure. The prevalence of NASH has increased in parallel with the rising rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Given the high prevalence and deadly complications of NASH, there have been significant efforts to develop effective treatments.

Phase 2A studies have assessed various mechanisms of action across the spectrum of the disease, while phase 3 studies have focused mainly on NASH and fibrosis stage 2 and higher, as these patients have a higher risk of disease morbidity and mortality. The primary efficacy endpoints also vary, using noninvasive tests in early-phase trials while relying on liver histological endpoints in phase 3 studies as required by regulatory agencies.

Despite initial disappointment due to the failure of several drugs, recent phase 2 and 3 studies have shown promising results, with the first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for NASH expected to be approved in 2023. In this review, we discuss the various drugs under development for NASH, their mechanisms of action, and the results of their clinical trials. We also highlight the potential challenges in developing pharmacological therapies for NASH.

### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prevents hepatic steatosis in a murine model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112kuvbG]. Pediatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, ranging from hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis and liver failure. It has been demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acids are negative regulators of hepatic lipogenesis and that they can also modulate the inflammatory response in mice. Furthermore, they may attenuate hepatic steatosis even in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice.

We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may protect the liver against hepatic steatosis in a murine model of parenteral nutrition in which all animals develop steatosis and liver enzyme disturbances. To test this hypothesis, groups of mice received a fat-free, high-carbohydrate liquid diet ad libitum for 19 days with enteral or intravenous supplementation of an omega-3 fatty acid emulsion or a standard intravenous lipid emulsion.

Control mice received food alone or the fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet without lipid supplementation. Mice that received the fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet only or supplemented with a standard intravenous lipid emulsion developed severe liver damage, as determined by histology and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as elevation of serum liver function tests. However, animals that received an intravenous omega-3 fatty acid emulsion showed only mild deposits of fat in the liver, whereas enteral omega-3 fatty acids prevented hepatic pathology and led to the normalization of liver function tests.

In conclusion, while standard intravenous lipid emulsions fail to improve dietary-induced steatotic injury to the liver, intravenous supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids partially…

### Modest alcohol consumption is associated with decreased prevalence of steatohepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^113RqT9c]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a cardiovascular risk factor. Although modest alcohol consumption may reduce cardiovascular mortality risk, whether patients with NAFLD should be allowed modest alcohol consumption remains an important unaddressed issue. We aimed to evaluate the association between modest alcohol drinking and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among subjects with NAFLD.

Methods: In a cross-sectional analysis of adult participants in the NIH NASH Clinical Research Network, only modest or non-drinkers were included. Participants identified as (1) drinking > 20 g/day, (2) binge drinkers, or (3) non-drinkers with previous alcohol consumption were excluded. The odds of having a histological diagnosis of NASH and other histological features of NAFLD were analyzed using multiple ordinal logistic regression.

Results: The analysis included 251 lifetime non-drinkers and 331 modest drinkers. Modest drinkers, compared to non-drinkers, had lower odds of having a diagnosis of NASH (summary odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.39–0.84, p = 0.002). The odds of NASH decreased as the frequency of alcohol consumption increased within the range of modest consumption. Modest drinkers also had significantly lower odds for fibrosis (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41–0.77) and ballooning hepatocellular injury (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.92) than lifetime non-drinkers.

Conclusions: In a large, well-characterized population with biopsy-proven NAFLD, modest alcohol consumption was associated with a lesser degree of severity as determined by lower odds of the key features.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^1158nWkT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

NASH is a common liver disease that increases liver-related mortality and reduces survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologist. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH is based on the potential for disease progression and the difficulties that many patients have successfully implementing, in the long term, diet and lifestyle changes. Even in those that succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone. This review provides a personal and critical assessment of the histological efficacy and safety of agents tested in randomized trials in patients with NASH.

### Associations of serum n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids with prevalence and incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115muCPg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Some potential mechanisms could explain the observed findings. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the eicosanoids derived from them can act as ligands for transcription factors and induce changes in gene expression. Fat accumulation in the liver is caused by the imbalance between acquisition and disposal of intrahepatic lipids, and gene regulation is assumed to affect hepatic fatty acid metabolism. The sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) is a transcription factor required for intrahepatic lipid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR α) upregulates fatty acid oxidation. PUFAs and their eicosanoids suppress the activity of SREBP1c and activate PPAR α. As a result, liver fat accumulation is decreased because de novo lipogenesis is diminished and more fatty acids go into oxidation and secretion. SREBP1c and PPAR γ expression levels are associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a population-based study.

In addition, the eicosanoids derived from PUFA have anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory effects. Overproduction of proinflammatory metabolites has various inflammatory effects, resulting in low-grade inflammation and disease progression, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oxidative stress causes cellular damage and impaired liver function, promotes lipid accumulation, and, with inflammatory signaling, seems to affect the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. n-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids were typically considered proinflammatory and n-3 PUFA eicosanoids anti-inflammatory, but recent research indicates that n-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids also have anti-inflammatory properties, and in experimental studies, even high doses of linoleic acid (LA) were shown to have beneficial effects.

### Effects of epeleuton, a novel synthetic second-generation n-3 fatty acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, triglycerides, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers [^117C25Ji]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The data that support the findings of this study may be made available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This was a 16-week, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial (NCT02941549) of epeleuton in patients with NAFLD and elevated BMI. The trial was approved by the central and local institutional review boards or ethics committees and was conducted according to the provisions of the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice, the World Health Organization Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory requirements. All participants provided written informed consent before participation in the trial.

Patients were assigned to trial treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule in permuted blocks stratified according to trial site. Patients meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to epeleuton 2 g/day (epeleuton 1 g twice daily), epeleuton 1 g/day (epeleuton 500 mg twice daily), or placebo (light liquid paraffin) twice daily.

Eligibility criteria at screening included an age of 18 to 75 years, NAFLD based on the presence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology in the absence of secondary causes, BMI between 25.0 and 40.0 kg/m², and ALT ≥ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal in the 3 months before screening, history of gastric bypass surgery, history of or scheduled orthopedic surgery.

### Association between obesity phenotypes and non-alcoholic fatty liver: a large population-based study [^114mzWGE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the accumulation of fat in the liver without excessive alcohol intake. NAFLD is closely tied to conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. It is the most common chronic liver disease, and its prevalence is rising in parallel with the increasing rates of obesity and diabetes. NAFLD can progress from a simple fat buildup to more advanced forms like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. NAFLD is also associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other metabolic disorders, posing a significant financial burden on healthcare systems.

The NAFLD is a prevalent metabolic disease worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 25% globally and 27% in Asia. Early diagnosis, prevention, and control of NAFLD are crucial. Non-invasive indices such as the fatty liver index (FLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) score, and Steato Test (ST) are used to predict fatty liver. FLI, which is a composite equation of waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and triglycerides, is particularly useful in population-based studies. A study conducted in Italy found that the FLI had a predictive power of 82% (Area under the Curve (AUC): 0.82). The study also revealed that the cut-off point for the FLI is smaller in women compared to men.

Studies have shown an association between MetS and fatty liver, with a higher prevalence of fatty liver associated with MetS.

### Nutritional assessment and hepatic fatty acid composition in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): A cross-sectional study [^116AhBqt]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Low hepatic n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may contribute to steatosis and steatohepatitis and can be affected by diet and oxidative stress.

- **Methods**: Seventy-three patients referred for elevated liver enzymes and suspected NAFLD were assessed. Nutritional assessment, hepatic fatty acid (FA) composition, and oxidative stress were compared between these groups: simple steatosis (SS, n = 18), steatohepatitis (NASH, n = 38), and minimal findings on liver biopsy (MF, n = 17).

- **Results**: Patients with NASH had higher BMI, central obesity, body fat, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, and lower physical activity compared to the other groups. They also had relatively lower hepatic n-3 and n-6 PUFA, a decrease in the ratio of metabolites to essential fatty acid precursors for both n-6 and n-3 FA (eicosapentaenoic + docosahexaenoic/linolenic and arachidonic/linoleic acid ratios), and higher liver lipid peroxides with lower antioxidant power when compared to MF. Overall, there was no significant difference between SS and NASH in FA composition. Self-reported dietary intake and red blood cell FA composition were similar among the three groups.

- **Conclusions**: NASH patients have more metabolic abnormalities. This is associated with higher oxidative stress and lower n-3 and n-6 PUFA in the liver in the absence of any differences in dietary FA composition.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114wGVi2]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, with a specific focus on the management of comorbidities, the AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend offering lifestyle changes and supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates for the management of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Fish oil-based lipid emulsions prevent and reverse parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease: the Boston experience [^112ZU38K]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) is the most prevalent and severe complication of long-term parenteral nutrition. However, its underlying pathophysiology remains largely unclear. Currently approved parenteral lipid emulsions in the United States contain safflower or soybean oils, both rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Mounting evidence suggests that omega-6 PUFAs from plant oils in these lipid emulsions may contribute to the onset of liver injury. In contrast, fish oil-based lipid emulsions are primarily composed of omega-3 PUFAs, offering a promising alternative.

The authors review the literature on the role of lipid emulsions in the development of PNALD and explore prevention and treatment strategies using fish oil-based lipid emulsions. They conclude that a fish oil-based emulsion is hepatoprotective in a murine model of PNALD and appears safe and effective for treating this type of liver disease in children. A prospective randomized trial currently underway at the authors' institution will objectively assess the efficacy of fish oil monotherapy in the prevention of PNALD.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112UVwMY]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver damage ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the natural history of NAFLD is yet to be fully defined, it is clear that NAFLD, especially NASH, carries an increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and overall mortality compared to the general population. Emerging evidence suggests that the main cause of death in NAFLD is CVD, strongly reflecting its close relation to metabolic syndrome (MS). In patients who develop liver steatosis at a younger age, the complications of liver disease and metabolic syndrome may appear sooner, necessitating special concern and early management.

Weight reduction appears to be the front-line therapy in NAFLD. Dietary restrictions are as important as physical activity and lifestyle changes. However, compliance is poor in these patients, and there is too much inconsistent data from clinical trials to indicate the optimal rate and extent of weight loss in children.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^117C5FBt]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

To minimize possible bias, we designed a randomized, double-blind trial. The study treatment and placebo have identical appearances, with capsules and packaging in plastic pill boxes to ensure the double-blind study design. Data on the patients are entered and organized in the electronic case report form (e-CRF). The treatment allocation is done using centralized randomization, which is fixed, balanced, and stratified according to the center. Both e-CRF and randomization are conducted by an external company. Ultrasounds are performed each time by the same radiologist, and the histology of the liver is assessed by two independent pathologists. Advanced lab tests are sent and examined in a central laboratory.

As there is no efficient pharmacological treatment for NAFLD, a positive result from this randomized trial will position omega-3 fatty acids as a useful agent in the treatment of NAFLD in children, which can be safely applied together with lifestyle modification. Conversely, no or negative effects of supplementation will add valuable evidence against its use in NAFLD. Nevertheless, the final findings are expected to strongly contribute to the knowledge base and public health guidelines regarding the use of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and obesity-related diseases.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^114hQPQW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). High credibility.

Data extraction was conducted by one author (X.P.) and separately verified by other authors (J.L. and H.Z.). From each eligible meta-analysis on observational studies or RCTs, the following information was extracted: first author and publication year, outcome, number of studies included, total population, number of cases, measure of exposure, effect sizes (risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD), weighted mean difference (WMD), and 95% confidence intervals), and any reported estimate of heterogeneity. The type of effect model, publication bias assessed by Egger's test, and dose-response analyses were abstracted when possible.

In cases of overlapping meta-analyses on the same association, the most recent and largest number of disease cases were prioritized. In exceptions where the most recent was not the largest, reasons for the discrepancy were examined. If the most recent meta-analysis included prospective studies and the largest included fewer prospective studies plus retrospective data, the one with the largest amount of prospective data was retained; otherwise, the largest meta-analysis was kept. When available, a dose-response meta-analysis was presented over a high-versus-low meta-analysis for one exposure or treatment. Discrepancies in the extracted data were resolved through discussion.

The assessment of methodological quality was conducted using the eleven items of the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist.

### Docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid prevent essential fatty acid deficiency and hepatic steatosis [^111zi6ib]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Essential fatty acids are crucial for growth, development, and physiological function. α-Linolenic acid and linoleic acid, precursors of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids respectively, are traditionally considered the essential fatty acids. However, it is hypothesized that docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid can also function as essential fatty acids.

- **Methods**: Using a murine model of essential fatty acid deficiency and consequent hepatic steatosis, researchers provided mice with varying amounts of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids. The aim was to determine whether exclusive supplementation with these acids could prevent essential fatty acid deficiency and inhibit or attenuate hepatic steatosis.

- **Results**: Mice supplemented with docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids at 2.1% or 4.2% of their calories for 19 days exhibited normal liver histology and no biochemical evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency, findings which persisted after 9 weeks.

- **Conclusion**: Supplementation of sufficient amounts of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acids alone, without α-linolenic and linoleic acids, fulfills essential fatty acid requirements and prevents hepatic steatosis in a murine model.

### Effects of purified eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: results from the Welcome* study [^116By8Ej]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

There is no licensed treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that increases the risk of chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. We tested whether 15–18 months of treatment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Omacor/Lovaza) at a dosage of 4 grams per day decreased liver fat and improved two histologically-validated liver fibrosis biomarker scores, which were the primary outcomes.

Patients with NAFLD were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [DHA+EPA (n = 51), placebo (n = 52)]. We quantified liver fat percentage using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in three liver zones. Additionally, liver fibrosis was measured using two validated scores. Adherence to the intervention (Omacor group) and potential contamination (with DHA and EPA) in the placebo group were assessed by measuring erythrocyte percentage DHA and EPA enrichment through gas chromatography.

We conducted multivariable linear regression to test the effects of:

- **DHA+EPA treatment**: (intention-to-treat analyses)
- **Erythrocyte DHA and EPA enrichment**: (secondary analysis)

Median baseline and end-of-study liver fat percentages were 21.7% (interquartile range [IQR] 19.3) and 19.7% (IQR 18.0) for the placebo group, and 23.0% (IQR 36.2) and 16.3% (IQR 22.0) for the DHA+EPA group.

In the fully adjusted regression model, there was a trend toward improvement in liver fat percentage with DHA+EPA treatment (β = -3.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.0 to 0.8; p = 0.1). However, evidence of contamination was observed in the placebo group, and variable adherence to the intervention was noted in the Omacor group. Further regression analysis showed that DHA enrichment was independently associated with a decrease in liver fat percentage, with each 1% enrichment resulting in β = -1.70.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^115EUEca]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Although the associations of lifestyle, as well as metabolic syndrome, with the risk or treatment of NAFLD have been examined in a large number of published meta-analyses, the quality of evidence was only high for the association of sugar-sweetened soda with increased NAFLD risk. Only seven treatment interventions — four green tea interventions, two omega-3 PUFAs interventions, and one exercise (RT) intervention — had a higher strength of epidemiologic evidence, demonstrating improvement of liver enzymes, blood lipids, and blood glucose rather than histological changes of the liver. Robust clinical RCTs are needed to further investigate the associations between lifestyle modifications and the incidence of or therapeutic effects on NAFLD.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^1148yXEN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). High credibility.

Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is pathologically associated with a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and metabolic syndrome. An umbrella review of meta-analyses was conducted to summarize the quality of evidence regarding the epidemiologic associations between lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD concerning risk and treatment.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception until June 1, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining associations between lifestyle and metabolic syndrome with NAFLD risk or treatment were screened. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes, P values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, and small-study effects. Meta-analyses of RCTs with outcomes showing random-effect P < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 37 publications were included: twenty-two publications reporting 41 meta-analyses of observational studies (37 unique outcomes) and 15 publications reporting 81 meta-analyses of RCTs (63 unique outcomes) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high for 97% of the included meta-analyses. High-quality evidence was noted only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda consumption with increased NAFLD risk in meta-analyses of observational studies. Only three therapeutic interventions (green tea improving ALT, TG, etc) were found.

### Lack of Vmp1 impairs hepatic lipoprotein secretion and promotes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^111oWfhL]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Aims: Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that regulates the formation of autophagosomes and lipid droplets. Recent evidence suggests that VMP1 plays a critical role in lipoprotein secretion in zebrafish and cultured cells. However, the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms by which VMP1 regulates lipoprotein secretion and lipid accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are unknown.

Methods: Liver-specific and hepatocyte-specific Vmp1 knockout mice, as well as Vmp1 knock-in mice, were generated by crossing Vmp1 flox or Vmp1 KI mice with albumin-Cre mice or by injecting AAV8-TBG-cre, respectively. Lipid and energy metabolism in these mice were characterized by metabolomic and transcriptome analyses. Mice with hepatic overexpression of VMP1 who were fed a NASH diet were also characterized.

Results: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Vmp1 severely impaired VLDL secretion resulting in massive hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are hallmarks of NASH. Mechanistically, loss of Vmp1 led to decreased hepatic levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, as well as changes in phospholipid composition. Deletion of Vmp1 in mouse liver also led to the accumulation of neutral lipids in the ER bilayer and impaired mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Overexpression of VMP1 ameliorated steatosis in diet-induced NASH by improving VLDL secretion. Importantly, we also showed that decreased liver VMP1 is associated with NAFLD.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^1127p7Jm]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Patient recruitment for the trial began in 2008 and concluded in 2011. Out of the 86 screened participants, 10 were found ineligible (11.6%). The most common reason for ineligibility was ALT activity being less than 1.3 times the ULN. A total of 76 children with NAFLD met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to receive either omega-3 (n = 38) or placebo (n = 38).

The follow-up of the study is still ongoing. We are currently finalizing data collection obtained after 24 weeks of treatment. The full statistical analysis of the study results will be completed in mid-2013.

### Bioactive lipid species and metabolic pathways in progression and resolution of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^111qhua3]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing worldwide; yet there are no effective treatments. A decade has passed since the initial lipidomics analyses of liver tissues from patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We have learned that liver cells from patients with NASH have an abnormal lipid composition, and that the accumulation of lipids leads to organelle dysfunction, cell injury and death, and chronic inflammation, known as lipotoxicity.

- **Lipid species and metabolic pathways**: We review the lipid species and metabolic pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH and potential therapeutic targets. This includes enzymes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, bioactive sphingolipids and polyunsaturated-derived eicosanoids, and specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators.

- **Resolution of inflammation**: We discuss the concept that NASH is a disease that can resolve, and the roles of lipid molecules in the resolution of inflammation and regression of fibrosis.

### Hepatic lipotoxicity and the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: The central role of nontriglyceride fatty acid metabolites [^115tyuKp]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

A significant body of evidence now forces us to rethink the causes of NASH. Once thought to be a disease caused by triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes with subsequent oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation causing inflammation and fibrosis, new data from animal studies and a limited number of human studies now provide convincing evidence that triglyceride accumulation does not cause insulin resistance or cellular injury in the liver. The lipotoxic liver injury hypothesis for the pathogenesis of NASH suggests that we need to focus our therapeutic efforts on reducing the burden of fatty acids going to the liver or being synthesized in the liver. This can be accomplished by improving insulin sensitivity at the level of adipose tissue to prevent inappropriate peripheral lipolysis and by preventing unnecessary de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Excess carbohydrates are the major substrates for de novo lipogenesis, and thus, reducing carbohydrate consumption through dietary changes and increasing muscle glucose uptake through exercise remain important cornerstones of treatment and prevention of lipotoxic liver injury, a disease hitherto called NASH.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: Is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^116SweYr]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We systematically reviewed the potential for adverse events (AEs) in a population of older adults following an intervention of n-3 fatty acid supplementation versus a placebo. Our results are consistent and support literature showing no evidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with oral n-3 supplementation in older adults at doses ≤ 1.86 g EPA and/or DHA per day. Although non-serious adverse events related to gastrointestinal disturbances were observed, these were infrequent and not solely apparent in the n-3 intervention group.

Literature supporting an association between the intake of n-3 fatty acids and SAEs in an older adult population is scant. In the present review, Van de Rest et al. 2009 were the only investigators to report on mortality; however, this was deemed unrelated to the study design or n-3 intervention. These same investigators also reported one case of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the placebo arm of the trial, which was high oleic sunflower oil. No studies in the review reported major bleeds, stroke, or bruising.

Of clinical importance, 14 of the 17 full-text articles reported positive benefits associated with n-3 supplementation in otherwise healthy older adults. These included reduced symptoms of depression, enhanced cell-mediated immunity, a reduction in oxidative stress, relief from osteoarthritic symptoms, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties, increased muscle anabolic signaling, cardiovascular benefits, and the feasibility and acceptability of n-3 fatty acids. With the exception of Holguin et al. 2005, who reported a greater prevalence of gastrointestinal disturbances (eructation and nausea; ~54%) in participants, the findings are largely supportive of n-3 fatty acid supplementation benefits.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Design and rationale of randomized controlled trial [^112TDFN1]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome, as obesity and insulin resistance are the main pathogenic contributors for both conditions. NAFLD carries an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, creating an urgent need to find effective and safe therapy for children and adults with NAFLD. Research and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in metabolic syndrome-related conditions and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods/design**: We are conducting a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in children with NAFLD. Patients are randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or placebo for 24 weeks. The dose of omega-3 (DHA + EPA) ranges from 450 to 1300 mg daily. A low-calorie diet and increased physical activity are advised and monitored using validated questionnaires. The primary outcome of the trial is the number of patients who decreased ALT activity by ≥ 0.3 of the upper limit of normal. The main secondary outcomes are improvement in the laboratory liver tests, liver steatosis on ultrasound, markers of insulin resistance, and difference in fat/lean body mass composition after 6 months of intervention.

- **Discussion**: The potential efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of NAFLD provides a needed rationale for the use of this safe dietary supplement, alongside weight reduction therapy, in the growing population of children and adults with NAFLD.

### Effects of epeleuton, a novel synthetic second-generation n-3 fatty acid, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, triglycerides, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers [^116sb5eZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Epeleuton's effects on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are evident in the broadly consistent decreases of multiple parameters, including fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids. In this trial, treatment with epeleuton at 2 g/day produced significant decreases in HOMA-IR, which quantifies insulin resistance and beta cell function, and correlates with estimates using euglycemic clamp methods.

One potential explanation for increased risk in patients with high triglycerides is the presence of a proinflammatory state. It has been speculated that the effects of icosapent ethyl on rates of ischemic events in the REDUCE-IT trial are not fully explained by its triglyceride-lowering effect. An anti-inflammatory effect may have contributed to the magnitude of reduction seen in REDUCE-IT.

In the present analysis, epeleuton at 2 g/day did not decrease hsCRP but significantly decreased circulating levels of an array of chemokines, adhesion molecules, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members, and other markers of endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular, and diabetes mellitus risk. Notably, phase 3 studies of icosapent ethyl showed reductions in hsCRP compared with baseline levels only at the higher 4 g/day dose, and not at the 2 g/day dose, which may suggest that a higher dose of epeleuton is similarly required to decrease hsCRP. The positive data at the 2 g/day dose, and the lack of effect of the lower dose of epeleuton on most inflammatory markers provide mechanistic indications that epeleuton.

### Lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella review of evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials [^111x7r1H]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). High credibility.

Recent epidemiological studies have indicated that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is pathologically associated with a sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, and metabolic syndrome. An umbrella review of meta-analyses was performed to summarize the quality of evidence regarding the epidemiologic associations between lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and NAFLD in regards to risk and treatment.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase Database from inception until June 1, 2021. Meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the associations of lifestyle as well as metabolic syndrome with NAFLD risk or treatment were screened. We assessed meta-analyses of observational studies based on random-effect summary effect sizes and their P values, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity, and small-study effects. For meta-analyses of RCTs, outcomes with a random-effect P < 0.005 and a high-GRADE assessment were classified as strong evidence.

- **Results**: A total of 37 publications were included in this review: twenty-two publications reporting 41 meta-analyses of observational studies (37 unique outcomes) and 15 publications reporting 81 meta-analyses of RCTs (63 unique outcomes) met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high for 97% of the included meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated high only for the association of sugar-sweetened soda consumption with increased NAFLD risk in meta-analyses of observational studies. Only 3 therapeutic interventions (green tea improving ALT, TG, T

### Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Where are we now and where are we going [^111DyHhS]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was considered relatively uncommon prior to the middle of the last decade, over the past three years there has been an explosion of studies on various aspects of NASH, with one study reporting that after hepatitis C, NASH was the most common diagnosis in patients presenting largely with persistent abnormalities of liver function tests. The field of NASH has come a long way in a relatively short space of time. This article considers advances in knowledge that have arisen as a result of these studies and highlights areas for further work.

### Molecular interplay between Δ5/Δ6 desaturases and long-chain fatty acids in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^115bpb8X]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not completely elucidated. In the study, we integrated gene expression profiling of liver biopsies from NASH patients with translational studies in mouse models of steatohepatitis and pharmacological interventions in isolated hepatocytes to identify new molecular targets in NASH.

- **Design and results**: Using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified a significant enrichment of genes involved in the multi-step catalysis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, namely, Δ-5 desaturase (Δ5D) and Δ6D in NASH. Increased expression of Δ5D and Δ6D at both mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in livers from mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity and NASH. Gas chromatography analysis revealed impaired desaturation fluxes toward the ω-6 and ω-3 pathways, resulting in an increased ω-6 to ω-3 ratio and reduced ω-3 index in human and mouse fatty livers.

	- Restoration of hepatic ω-3 content in transgenic fat-1 mice expressing an ω-3 desaturase, which allows the endogenous conversion of ω-6 into ω-3 fatty acids, produced a significant reduction in hepatic insulin resistance, steatosis, macrophage infiltration, necroinflammation, and lipid peroxidation. This was accompanied by attenuated expression of genes involved in inflammation, fatty acid uptake, and lipogenesis. These results were mostly reproduced by feeding obese mice with an exogenous ω-3-enriched diet.

	- A combined Δ5D/Δ6D inhibitor, CP-24879, significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory injury in hepatocytes. Interestingly, CP-2…

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^114VmQJF]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The controversies over the effects of replacing saturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated fatty acids — reduced consumption of animal fats, increased consumption of vegetable oils — and the significance of the evidence from trials of very low carbohydrate, high fat diets suggest both "additive" and "subtractive" nutritional approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Both depend on assumptions about the nature of biological normality in human diets. The replacement of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats implies that saturated fat as a nutrient causes disease and is being reduced, and/or that the consumption of vegetable oils is healthy and without long-term risks. The debate about the role of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the use of plant oils appraises these assumptions.

The consumption of very low carbohydrate, high fat diets assumes that high levels of dietary fat and saturated fat can be consumed for a lifetime without the risks outweighing the benefits. A point of controversy is whether such assumptions can be accepted without long-term clinical trials of the kind that would be required for a pharmaceutical means of prevention. This controversy might be resolved by longer-term clinical trials, but the cost and methodological and ethical challenges of such dietary trials suggest they may never be done.

- **Prevention strategies**: Public health preventive measures can be divided into two main categories.
	- **Subtractive**: Rose described this as "the removal of an unnatural factor and the restoration of biological normality".

### Farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (FLINT): A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116SGzcE]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

The bile acid derivative 6-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid (obeticholic acid) is a potent activator of the farnesoid X nuclear receptor that reduces liver fat and fibrosis in animal models of fatty liver disease. This study assessed the efficacy of obeticholic acid in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

- **Methods**: A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised clinical trial was conducted at medical centres in the United States. Patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis were treated with obeticholic acid given orally (25 mg daily) or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and diabetes status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology, defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment.

A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks, undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies, supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic acid (p = 0.0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial was registered.

### Vitamin e for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1158inNu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Regarding risk of bias, we used the overall risk of bias judgement to inform the GRADE assessment: "low risk of bias" indicates "no limitation" (no downgrading); "some concerns" indicates either "no limitation" or "serious limitation" (certainty of evidence is downgraded one level); and "high risk of bias" indicates either "serious limitation" or "very serious limitation" (certainty of evidence is downgraded two levels).

We used the methods and recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We applied the updated guidance on rating imprecision and calculated the optimal information size, which helped us assess imprecision. We justified all decisions to downgrade the certainty of the evidence using footnotes and made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

We defined the levels of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low following the GRADE Working Group grades of evidence.

- **High certainty**: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
- **Moderate certainty**: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
- **Low certainty**: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
- **Very low certainty**: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^113wFSUA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has emerged as a major challenge because of its prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, complex pathogenesis, and lack of approved therapies. As the burden of hepatitis C abates over the next decade, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will become the major form of chronic liver disease in adults and children and could become the leading indication for liver transplantation. This overview briefly summarizes the most recent data on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Ongoing clinical trials are focused on an array of disease mechanisms, and reviewed here are how these treatments fit into the paradigm of substrate overload lipotoxic liver injury. Many of the approaches are directed at downstream events such as inflammation, injury, and fibrogenesis. Addressing more proximal processes such as dysfunctional satiety mechanisms and inappropriately parsimonious energy dissipation are potential therapeutic opportunities. If successfully understood and exploited, these could address not only fatty liver disease but also other components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

### Molecular mechanisms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Potential role for 12-lipoxygenase [^117QVnDf]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of pathologies associated with fat accumulation in the liver. NAFLD is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to a third of the general population. It is commonly associated with features of metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance. NAFLD shares the basic pathogenic mechanisms with obesity and insulin resistance, such as mitochondrial, oxidative, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Lipoxygenases catalyze the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane — mainly arachidonic acid and linoleic acid — to produce oxidized pro-inflammatory lipid intermediates. 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) has been studied extensively in the setting of inflammation and insulin resistance. As insulin resistance is closely associated with the development of NAFLD, the role of 12-LOX in the pathogenesis of NAFLD has received increasing attention in recent years. In this review, we discuss the role of 12-LOX in NAFLD pathogenesis and its potential role in emerging new therapeutics.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^115SJugS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Figure S2 illustrates funnel plots for the three main outcomes: steatosis reduction (Figure S2A), fibrosis improvement (Figure S2B), and safety (Figure S2C). For steatosis and fibrosis, the plots demonstrate relatively symmetrical distributions, indicating minimal publication bias. Most studies are clustered within the funnel, though some outliers suggest minor heterogeneity, likely due to differences in study designs or patient populations. In contrast, the safety outcomes show greater variability, with more asymmetry observed, reflecting differences in adverse event reporting and treatment tolerability across studies. Overall, the funnel plots suggest reliable findings for efficacy outcomes, while safety data require careful interpretation due to variability. The rankogram plots illustrate the ranking probabilities of interventions for steatosis reduction, fibrosis improvement, and adverse events (Figure S3).

To assess the robustness of our findings, a sensitivity analysis was performed by restricting the network meta-analysis to studies classified as low risk of bias according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Sensitivity analysis, including only studies with a low risk of bias, confirmed the consistency of the main findings. The ranking of treatments for both steatosis and fibrosis remained stable, and the effect estimates showed minimal deviation from the full dataset analysis (supplemental content, Figure S4). These results indicate that the primary conclusions are robust and not significantly influenced by potential bias in some included studies.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113VeRtg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become increasingly recognized as the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in recent decades. It is among the most common forms of chronic liver disease in the Western world and across the globe. With the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, NAFLD is estimated to affect about one-quarter of the U.S. population. Although most patients with NAFLD have nonprogressive bland steatosis, a minority develop the histological subtype of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death. This is especially true for NASH patients with type 2 diabetes.

Treatment of NAFLD should therefore be directed towards patients with established NASH. Sustained weight loss seems to improve insulin resistance and associated NASH. Notably, weight loss through bariatric surgery leads to biochemical and histological improvement in morbidly obese patients with NASH. Several pharmacologic agents have been studied to improve insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory mediators potentially responsible for the development and progression of NASH. While some studies have shown initial promise, none has established long-term efficacy using randomized clinical trials.

This paper briefly reviews the epidemiology, natural history, and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH, focusing on the clinical trials of various therapeutic modalities for NAFLD. These include weight loss agents, bariatric surgery, insulin-sensitizing agents, lipid-lowering agents, and antioxidants.

### Practical guideline on obesity care in patients with gastrointestinal and liver diseases - Joint ESPEN/UEG guideline [^111iGfJi]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to omega-3 fatty acids, ESPEN/UEG 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering omega-3 fatty acids to improve serum triglycerides and liver enzymes in patients with MASLD/MASH and overweight/obesity.
