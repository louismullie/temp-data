## Question

Warning signs with cellulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the warning signs in cellulitis that mandate urgent action, including how to distinguish dangerous mimics and when to escalate care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline clinical features of cellulitis and how to confirm the diagnosis. Then, I should identify systemic warning signs that indicate sepsis or severe infection. Next, I will examine local danger features suggesting necrotizing infection or abscess. After that, I need to consider special populations and high-risk scenarios that lower thresholds for escalation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and outline immediate actions, including diagnostics and empiric therapy, while double-checking areas where misdiagnosis commonly occurs [^111kKWVP] [^114kM2k4].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical picture of cellulitis so I don't anchor prematurely on mimics. Cellulitis typically presents with poorly demarcated erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness, often in the lower extremities, and may be accompanied by lymphangitic streaking; systemic features such as fever and chills can occur but are not universal, especially in older adults or the immunocompromised, so I need to be cautious not to over-rely on fever as a severity marker [^1119mx9Q] [^112aNEXQ] [^113Yu8My].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — about one-third of patients labeled with lower-limb cellulitis in the ED are misdiagnosed, so I should actively consider mimics like venous stasis dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, gout, septic bursitis, and necrotizing fasciitis, and I should use bedside ultrasound when the diagnosis is uncertain or when I suspect an occult abscess that would change management from antibiotics alone to incision and drainage [^111kKWVP] [^114kM2k4] [^11689GoD].

> Next, I should review systemic warning signs that demand urgent escalation. I need to check for SIRS criteria (fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis or leukopenia), altered mental status, hypotension, or signs of organ dysfunction, because these indicate severe infection and often require hospitalization and broad-spectrum intravenous therapy; in immunocompromised hosts, even subtle systemic changes can herald rapid deterioration, so I should lower my threshold to admit and broaden coverage [^114pSATx] [^112iZpuV] [^111T5z9T].

> I will now examine local danger features that suggest necrotizing infection or deep complications. Rapidly progressive erythema over hours, severe pain out of proportion to exam, anesthesia or pallor of the skin, crepitus or soft-tissue gas, bullae or ecchymoses, and skin necrosis are red flags; tenderness extending beyond the visible erythema and a dusky or mottled appearance likewise raise concern for necrotizing soft tissue infection, where time to surgical debridement is the strongest predictor of survival, so I should not delay surgical consultation when these are present [^1129w3hT] [^112JmoCK].

> But wait, what if the cellulitis is purulent or fluctuant? I should double-check for abscess because purulence shifts management toward incision and drainage rather than antibiotics alone; point-of-care ultrasound helps detect occult collections, and in patients with purulence or systemic toxicity, cultures of drained material are appropriate to guide therapy and detect MRSA [^11689GoD] [^112m3gRJ].

> Let me consider special populations and high-risk scenarios that warrant a lower threshold for escalation. In immunocompromised patients, including those with malignancy, transplant, or on immunosuppressive therapy, I should obtain blood cultures and consider early biopsy or aspiration of lesions because atypical pathogens and resistant organisms are more likely; in febrile neutropenia, I should hospitalize and start empiric vancomycin plus antipseudomonal coverage, and extend therapy based on clinical response and microbiology [^111T5z9T] [^115RUDYD] [^114ge6ZK]. In older adults, I should remember that fever may be absent and presentations are often atypical, so subtle changes in function or mentation still matter; in patients exposed to coastal waters, I should suspect Vibrio vulnificus and treat promptly given its fulminant course; and in patients on denosumab or other biologics, I should counsel early recognition of infection and maintain a low threshold to evaluate and treat aggressively [^113Yu8My] [^115fsSTS] [^112qfoUS].

> I need to ensure I address predisposing factors that both worsen acute disease and drive recurrence. Chronic edema or lymphedema, venous insufficiency, tinea pedis with toe-web maceration, obesity, and skin barrier disruption should be identified and treated during the acute episode and as part of prevention, because addressing these can reduce recurrence substantially; for patients with repeated episodes despite optimal local care, prophylactic antibiotics may be considered while predisposing factors persist [^115ofQds] [^116anE5J] [^117Ntmyk].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework so I don't miss time-critical steps. If there are any systemic instability signs, concern for necrotizing infection, immunocompromise with moderate to severe disease, failure of outpatient therapy, or inability to tolerate oral antibiotics, I should hospitalize and initiate IV therapy; if none of these are present and the patient is reliable, outpatient therapy with close follow-up is reasonable, with a plan to reassess within 24–48 hours for response and to escalate if there is no improvement [^114pSATx] [^111ek3cL] [^115UecZb].

> Let me first confirm the immediate actions when warning signs are present. I should obtain blood cultures before antibiotics in patients with systemic signs or high-risk features, start empiric IV therapy tailored to severity and risk (for example, vancomycin plus a beta-lactam with antipseudomonal coverage for severe infection or immunocompromise), and consult surgery urgently if necrotizing infection is suspected; I should also consider imaging with MRI or contrast-enhanced CT if deep infection or gas is suspected, recognizing that imaging should not delay operative management when the clinical picture is compelling [^114pSATx] [^111VZ6JV] [^1129w3hT].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of routine labs and imaging in uncomplicated cases so I don't over-order tests. Routine blood work and cultures have low diagnostic yield in straightforward cellulitis, and imaging is generally unnecessary unless I suspect abscess, osteomyelitis, retained foreign body, or necrotizing infection; when needed, ultrasound can detect occult abscess, and MRI or CT can delineate deep tissue involvement or gas, guiding surgical planning [^114qTzei] [^115z6nqP] [^116NPw4v].

> I should double-check antibiotic choices and duration to align with evidence. For typical nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs, an oral agent active against streptococci such as penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, or dicloxacillin is appropriate; if MRSA risk is high or the patient is systemically ill, add MRSA-active therapy such as TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or vancomycin depending on severity; a 5-day course is usually sufficient if improving, extending to 7–10 days if response is slow or disease is severe [^114pSATx] [^116QtZHg] [^114Z8V8r].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaway so I don't understate the risk. The most critical warning signs are systemic instability, rapidly progressive erythema, severe pain out of proportion, anesthesia or pallor, crepitus or gas, bullae or ecchymoses, and failure to improve with appropriate therapy; recognizing these early and acting with urgent evaluation, imaging when indicated, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, and surgical consultation for suspected necrotizing infection can be limb- and life-saving, whereas delays increase morbidity and mortality substantially [^1129w3hT] [^111VZ6JV].

Cellulitis can rapidly progress to life-threatening complications, so **red flags** require urgent evaluation: **rapidly expanding erythema** or **severe pain out of proportion** to the exam [^1129w3hT], **systemic toxicity** (fever, chills, confusion, hypotension) [^111cFv7N], **bullae, necrosis, or crepitus** (suggesting necrotizing infection) [^1129w3hT], and **immunocompromise** or **failure to improve after 48–72 hours** of therapy [^112iZpuV]. Additional warning signs include **lymphangitic streaking**, **purulent drainage**, **severe edema**, **recurrent episodes**, or **involvement of the face, periorbital, or perianal areas** [^notfound]. Immediate care is indicated for any of these features to prevent sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, or other serious complications [^1129w3hT].

---

## Local warning signs

- **Rapidly expanding erythema**: Spreading redness over hours suggests aggressive infection and warrants urgent evaluation [^1129w3hT].

- **Severe pain disproportionate to exam**: Pain out of proportion may indicate necrotizing fasciitis or deep infection [^1129w3hT].

- **Bullae, necrosis, or skin discoloration**: These indicate tissue ischemia or necrosis and risk of necrotizing infection [^1129w3hT].

- **Crepitus or soft tissue gas**: Highly suggestive of necrotizing infection and requires immediate surgical consultation [^1129w3hT].

- **Purulent drainage or abscess**: Indicates purulent infection needing drainage and broader coverage [^11689GoD].

- **Lymphangitic streaking**: Suggests systemic spread and higher risk of complications [^notfound].

- **Severe edema or induration**: May indicate deeper involvement or compartment syndrome risk [^notfound].

- **Recurrent episodes**: Suggest untreated predisposing factors and higher risk of complications [^117Ntmyk].

- **Involvement of face, periorbital, or perianal areas**: These anatomical sites carry higher risk of serious complications and may need specialist input [^notfound].

---

## Systemic warning signs

- **Fever, chills, or malaise**: Common systemic signs indicating bacteremia or sepsis risk [^112aNEXQ].

- **Confusion, altered mental status, or lethargy**: Suggest severe infection or sepsis and require urgent care [^114pSATx].

- **Hypotension or tachycardia**: Signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [^notfound].

- **Failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy**: Indicates treatment failure, resistant organisms, or deeper infection [^1129w3hT].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of severe infection, atypical pathogens, and complications [^114eeoYo].

- **Diabetic patients**: Increased risk of severe infection, necrotizing fasciitis, and poor wound healing [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of severe infection, atypical presentations, and complications [^113Yu8My].

- **Patients with chronic edema, lymphedema, or venous insufficiency**: Higher risk of recurrent and severe cellulitis [^116anE5J].

---

## Recommended actions for warning signs

When any of these warning signs are present, **immediate medical evaluation** is recommended, including:

- **Urgent clinical assessment**: Evaluate for necrotizing infection, abscess, or systemic involvement [^114pSATx].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, blood cultures if systemic signs are present [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI, or CT if necrotizing infection or deep involvement is suspected [^111VZ6JV].

- **Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics**: Empiric therapy covering MRSA, streptococci, and gram-negative organisms if indicated [^114pSATx].

- **Surgical consultation**: For suspected necrotizing infection, abscess, or failure of medical therapy [^1129w3hT].

---

Cellulitis can escalate quickly; **prompt recognition of these warning signs** and immediate intervention are essential to prevent serious complications and improve outcomes [^113WAb2P].

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens, duration of antibiotics, and treatment of predisposing factors.

Abstract

Infection by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019) has been the most important public health event of the last 100 years. The number of cases and deaths caused by this disease, its potential to rapidly spread and the search for a vaccine have been the center of discussion all over the world for over 1 year. In addition to the number of cases and all social, economic, and public health consequences of the pandemic, the variety of symptoms and clinical signs presented by infected patients has been subject of several studies and case reports. At the time of this writing, even with promising research, the clinical outcome of some patients is still unpredictable. The purpose of this article is to report an unusual case, the diagnostic process, and early treatment of this severe and atypical clinical picture. The patient is a young man diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 who sought our hospital in Southern Brazil reporting a history of pansinusitis progressing to a severe orbital cellulitis, requiring immediate surgical intervention.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115z6nqP]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^113H9Nh1]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We hope that this case will expand the range of pathophysiology known to be associated with GCS cellulitis, including rhabdomyolysis; whereas most cases of cellulitis are self-limited streptococcal infections, this case highlights the importance of being alert to toxin-mediated disease, with systemic symptoms out of proportion to visible surface inflammatory signs. This distinction is important because the default therapeutic response is often broader antibiotic coverage, whereas the most appropriate response for virulent yet antibiotic-sensitive pathogens, such as GCS, is more narrowly targeted high-dose antibiotics with vigilant clinical monitoring and supportive care to avoid a poor prognosis and prolonged hospitalization.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112KZkpu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with febrile neutropenia (persistent/recurrent episodes), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain blood cultures and cultures of skin lesions by culture aspiration, biopsy, or surgical excision in these patients, as their infection may be caused by resistant microbes, yeast, or molds. Recognize that the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test (1, 3-β-D-glucan or galactomannan tests) is low in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent.

### Eyelid necrotizing fasciitis: what were the early signs? [^114JmVQL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, life-threatening subcutaneous soft tissue infection that causes massive tissue destruction.

Objectives

To illustrate the warning signs of this condition by reporting a rare case of eyelid necrotizing fasciitis.

Case Report

A previously healthy 22-year-old man presented with a preseptal eyelid infection that spread rapidly despite prompt treatment with several intravenous antibiotics. He developed the characteristic clinical and radiologic features of necrotizing fasciitis, and required surgical debridement to cure the infection. Histology confirmed the diagnosis.

Conclusion

In this article, we suggest the indicators that may enable physicians to think of the development of necrotizing fasciitis in patients with infections of the skin and subcutis.

### Cellulitis: a review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.
- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^114kM2k4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. Mimics of cellulitis presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

Objective

This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, mimics of cellulitis, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

Discussion

The current emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in an analogous manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

Conclusion

Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician differentiate cellulitis from mimics. Surgical intervention is frequently needed for high morbidity and mortality mimics.

### Management of patients with infectious diseases in an emergency department observation unit [^111TaN2j]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia, cellulitis, and pyelonephritis are discussed in this review because they are the most common infections requiring hospital care, and they all have significant death or complication rates and broad differential diagnoses. They also demonstrate many of the considerations that could be applied to other infections appropriate for OU care. Table 11 lists additional infections that are good candidates for OU care. A key to successful OU management of infection is early consultation with the primary care physicians and appropriate specialists when one is setting up the unit, designing its guidelines, and when treating specific patients. Because individual patient outcomes are not predictable, increasing the absolute numbers treated and successfully discharged from observation can necessarily increase the percentage of OU patients that are hospitalized. In essence, a group who would be hospitalized from the ED is transferred to observation status, where most avoid hospital admission. Because some patients fail to respond, develop complications, or demonstrate alternative diagnoses, many troubles can be avoided when the primary care and specialist physicians have collaborated in the observation treatment decisions. These guidelines have been presented as a starting point. It is clear that more research targeted at this group of patients is required to refine current practice. As for everything else in medicine, there is no doubt that many of the specific recommendations made here will become obsolete in no time.

### Microbiological and clinical features of patients with cellulitis in tropical Australia: disease severity assessment and implications for clinical management [^114GHBWg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Australian guidelines for the treatment of cellulitis are informed by data from temperate, metropolitan centers. It is uncertain if these guidelines are equally applicable in tropical Australia, where the population, access to healthcare, and array of potential pathogens are quite different. This retrospective study examined adults admitted to Cairns Hospital in tropical Queensland, Australia, who were treated with intravenous antibiotics for a principal diagnosis of cellulitis in 2019. The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings in these cases and the resulting implications for patient management. There were 305 episodes of cellulitis; a potential pathogen was identified in 93/305 (30%), most commonly Staphylococcus aureus (45/93, 48%) or Group A Streptococcus (16/93, 17%). There was one case of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Initial treatment was most commonly with narrow spectrum β-lactam antibiotics with flucloxacillin prescribed in 170/305 (56%) and cefazolin prescribed in 74/305 (26%). Overall, 4/305 (1%) died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days, 123/305 (40%) had an inpatient stay > 48 hours, and 63/305 (21%) were readmitted to hospital within 30 days. Every patient who subsequently died or required ICU admission had an elevated early warning score (EWS ≥ 3) on admission. An EWS ≥ 3 on admission also predicted an inpatient stay of > 48 hours (odds ratio [OR]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.7–6.0; P < 0.001) and 30-day readmission (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2–4.6; P = 0.01). The etiology of cellulitis in tropical Queensland, Australia, is very similar to that seen in temperate regions, enabling the use of standard management algorithms for patients with cellulitis in the region.

### Analysis of the incidence and severity of cellulitis during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan [^111VAuAR]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that affected approximately 21.2 million people worldwide in 2015 and resulted in approximately 16 900 deaths worldwide. Clinically, cellulitis presents with poorly demarcated erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the affected area. The most common causative organisms are group A Streptococcus and. While cellulitis typically responds well to appropriate antibiotic therapy and is rarely fatal, delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment can result in severe complications, including necrotizing fasciitis, abscess formation, septic shock, and death in extreme cases. Timely diagnosis and treatment are therefore essential to prevent such serious outcomes.

The behavioral changes brought about by the COVID‐19 pandemic may have influenced the epidemiology of cellulitis in multiple ways. The reduced frequency of outings due to stay‐at‐home measures could plausibly have resulted in a decreased incidence of trauma‐induced cellulitis. Conversely, concerns over potential COVID‐19 exposure in healthcare settings may have led to delays in seeking medical care, thereby increasing the likelihood of presenting with more severe cases of cellulitis. Despite its clinical significance, the limited evidence supporting these hypotheses suggests a need for further research into the pandemic's impact on the incidence and management of cellulitis.

To address these gaps, this study aimed to examine the effect of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the number of cellulitis cases in both outpatient and inpatient settings by applying a difference‐in‐differences (DID) design to a nationwide hospital claims database in Japan. We also evaluated complications and comorbidities associated with hospitalization, the proportion of cases requiring ambulance transport, and the length of hospital stay to examine the change in disease severity.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas: prevention [^116LAGsJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around one quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 323 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 170 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two interventions based on information about to the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Limited evidence for diagnosing bacterial skin infections in older adults in primary care: systematic review [^113Yu8My]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Life expectancy is increasing, resulting in a growing population of older people. People aged over 65 years make up approximately one sixth of the population, but account for one in three outpatient attendances. Due to a combination of factors including immunosenescence, that is age-related immune dysfunction and inability to mount an adequate response to pathogenic insults and age-related thinning of the skin, the skin of older adults is more susceptible to bacterial infections. Soft tissue and skin infections such as cellulitis are common in older adults. If these conditions are not treated promptly, sepsis may ensue. Each year in the United Kingdom (UK), there are 150,000 cases of sepsis in the population, causing 44,000 deaths.

Cellulitis is the fourth leading cause of emergency hospital admissions in the UK for acute ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs); that is, conditions that could effectively be managed in the community. Emergency hospital admissions for patients over the age of 65 years with ACSCs is on the rise. The reasons for the escalation in hospital admissions of older patients with these conditions are not clear, however, bacterial infections frequently present in an atypical fashion in older adults, which can create a diagnostic conundrum for clinicians. Symptoms and signs that are typically associated with bacterial infections in younger adults, such as fever, might be absent in older people. Poor vascular supply, more common in old age, can reduce the signs and symptoms of erythema, warmth and tenderness that are typically associated with cellulitis. Much of the research that has been performed in this area has been conducted in secondary care rather than in primary care.

There is a paucity of official guidance to aid clinicians in illuminating these non-classical presentations. There are no specific NICE or SIGN guidelines relating to the clinical features of bacterial skin infections in older adults.

In order to effectively diagnose and treat bacterial skin infections in older adults in the primary care setting, a clearer understanding of the clinical features that are predictors of infection in this age group is required. Once established, further appropriate management can be initiated, with the goal of reversal of morbidity, and avoidance of premature mortality. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the clinical features that help to diagnose bacterial skin infections (referred to as 'skin infections' from here onwards) in older adults in the community.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections: a primary care review [^113o5eXU]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections often present initially to family physicians. These infections must be detected and treated rapidly to prevent loss of limb or a fatal outcome. Unfortunately, necrotizing soft tissue infections have no pathognomonic signs. Patients may present with some evidence of cellulitis, vesicles, bullae, edema, crepitus, erythema, and fever. They also may complain of pain that seems out of proportion to the physical findings; as the infection progresses, their pain may decrease. Magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory findings such as acidosis, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, coagulopathy, and an elevated white blood cell count may provide clues to the diagnosis. No single organism or combination of organisms is consistently responsible for necrotizing soft tissue infections. Most infections are polymicrobial, with both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria frequently present. Fungal infections also have been reported. Generally, bacterial and toxin-related effects converge to cause skin necrosis, shock, and multisystem organ failure. Aggressive debridement of infected tissues is critical to management. Antimicrobial therapy is important but remains secondary to the removal of diseased and necrotic tissues.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high‐quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic?

Diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.
Approximately one in three patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis do not have cellulitis and are given another diagnosis on discharge. Consequently, this results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.
There are no diagnostic criteria available for lower‐limb cellulitis in the U.K.

What does this study add?

This systematic review has identified a key research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis.
There is a current lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. 1 Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation. 2

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. 3 Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. 4 This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. 5 Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. 6 However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. 7 A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research. 8

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower‐limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower‐limb cellulitis only. Lower‐limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable from cellulitis.

A preliminary search found no previous systematic reviews that investigated the development or validation of diagnostic criteria or tools for cellulitis.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112JmoCK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSTI can rapidly progress to a life-threatening septic process, unless its evolution is curtailed by aggressive surgical debridement. Key to this is prompt diagnosis which can be straightforward in typical cases where patients present with classical features, but mimics and occult disease can confuse diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems which can be practicably applied in the ED, have been proposed, based on laboratory indices and cross-sectional imaging, but no test is infallible. Clinicians need to exercise a high threshold for considering the diagnosis of NSTI, use scoring systems judiciously, but fundamentally, surgical exploration remains the diagnostic gold standard.

Recurrent cellulitis — evaluation and prophylaxis: Identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and perform these practices as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C).

Initially, distinguishing between cellulitis and a necrotizing soft tissue infection that requires operative intervention may be difficult. Most cases of necrotizing soft tissue infection are originally diagnosed as cellulitis. However, since time to operative debridement is a strong determinant of outcome in NSTIs, timely diagnosis is essential.

Patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections usually present with severe pain that is out of proportion to the physical findings.

Necrotizing infections more commonly present with systemic signs of sepsis than non-necrotizing infections, although TSS from both S. aureus and Strep. pyogenes can occur without a necrotizing process. Physical findings of necrotizing soft tissue infections may include tenderness beyond the area of erythema, crepitus, and cellulitis that is refractory to antimicrobial therapy.

A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be initially treated as a necrotizing infection. Bullous changes, ecchymotic changes of the skin, and loss of skin sensation should all be considered as a necrotizing infection. Crepitus is most commonly the result of gas within tissues. While the presence of crepitus and gas within tissues is highly suggestive of a NSTI, its absence does not rule out its presence. All bacteria growing under aerobic conditions produce CO2 as a by-product and the free diffusion of CO2 typically limits gas collection in these cases, thus explaining the absence of gas in rapidly progress S. pyogenes infections.

The clinical picture may worsen very quickly, sometimes during a few hours.

Delay in diagnosis and/or treatment correlates with a poor outcome, leading to severe sepsis and/or multiple organ failure and only early surgical debridement and appropriate antimicrobial treatment can prevent sepsis progression and death.

### Etanercept (Enbrel) [^1157FTUE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Infections

Infections, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, have been observed in adult and pediatric patients. Infections have been noted in all body systems and have been reported in patients receiving Enbrel alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.

In controlled portions of trials, the types and severity of infection were similar between Enbrel and the respective control group (placebo or MTX for RA and PsA patients) in RA, PsA, AS and PsO patients. Rates of infections in RA and adult PsO patients are provided in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. Infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis and influenza.

In controlled portions of trials in RA, PsA, AS and PsO, the rates of serious infection were similar (0.8% in placebo, 3.6% in MTX, and 1.4% in Enbrel/Enbrel + MTX-treated groups). In clinical trials in rheumatologic indications, serious infections experienced by patients have included, but are not limited to, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic arthritis, bronchitis, gastroenteritis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, abscess and osteomyelitis. In clinical trials in adult PsO patients, serious infections experienced by patients have included, but are not limited to, pneumonia, cellulitis, gastroenteritis, abscess and osteomyelitis. The rate of serious infections was not increased in open-label extension trials and was similar to that observed in Enbrel- and placebo-treated patients from controlled trials.

In 66 global clinical trials of 17,505 patients (21,015 patient-years of therapy), tuberculosis was observed in approximately 0.02% of patients. In 17,696 patients (27,169 patient-years of therapy) from 38 clinical trials and 4 cohort studies in the U.S. and Canada, tuberculosis was observed in approximately 0.006% of patients. These studies include reports of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The types of infections reported in pediatric patients with PsO and JIA were generally mild and consistent with those commonly seen in the general pediatric population. Two JIA patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^117Pd3mv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was first to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. Second, we wanted to examine early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By limiting the study to cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study of early response in relation to baseline factors could be performed largely without influence of confounders such as need of surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for the assessment of early response and how initial response can be used in guiding continued treatment and predicting outcome.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^116qPMsz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high-quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed. What's already known about this topic? Diagnosing lower-limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116mEAXB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The term "non-necrotizing cellulitis" has been used to incorporate two entities, erysipelas and cellulitis, which are diffusely spreading skin infections not associated with suppurative foci.

However, a fine distinction exists between erysipelas and cellulitis. Erysipelas has a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue and lesions raised above the surrounding normal skin.

Cellulitis involves deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and has less distinctive features than erysipelas.

They are commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually b-hemolytic streptococci (usually group A). S. Aureus rarely causes erysipelas and cellulitis, but such infections usually are more suppurative and less diffuse.

Superficial, non-necrotizing infections caused by certain strains of Group A-streptococcal (GAS) may be associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, characterized by rapid progression of septic shock and organ failure.

As previously discussed, the recent dramatic increase in CA-MRSA makes the empiric treatment of staphylococcal infections troubling.

Diagnostic studies have a low yield in patients with superficial soft tissue infections and usually do not help with the diagnosis. However, establishing whether cellulitis represents signs of a deeper and/or more severe infectious process can be difficult but is of considerable importance as the majority of NSTIs are originally diagnosed as cellulitis.

Lack of clinical response could be due to unusual organisms, resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis. In patients who become increasingly ill, deeper infections should be always suspected.

For these infections, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin is the drug of choice.

Moxifloxacin or Levofloxacin may be suggested in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams. Clindamycin reduces exotoxin and superantigen production by pathogenic strains of GAS, and can be used in association as an adjunct in the treatment of streptococcal TSS.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Syndromic analysis of sepsis cohorts using large language models [^111PazCy]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Second, the symptom clusters identified in this study provide a more intuitive basis for categorizing patients with sepsis beyond organ dysfunction or biomarker criteria. The self-organization of LLM-generated signs and symptoms into syndromes that mirror common infection sources and correlate with discharge diagnoses supports the construct validity of the LLM method. Unlike discharge diagnosis codes, signs and symptoms more accurately reflect the ambiguity of initial patient presentations, considering that 3 of the identified syndromes (dizziness, constitutional, and back pain) were not specific to an infection source. When compared with the ICD-10-CM method of identifying presenting signs and symptoms using codes from professional billing charges up to the date of admission, the LLM method exceeded the ICD-10-CM method in sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

Third, the observed differential risks of MRSA, MDRGN organisms, and in-hospital mortality across symptoms highlight these data's importance to understanding the heterogeneity of patients with possible sepsis. For example, the fact that certain symptoms were associated with lower risk for specific multidrug-resistant organisms (urinary tract symptoms for MRSA; cellulitis symptoms for MDRGN organisms) suggests that empiric antibiotic guidelines for sepsis could likely be tailored further using presenting symptoms. The associations between decreased mortality risk and urinary or constitutional symptoms suggest that broadly aggressive sepsis treatment protocols could unintentionally incur a less favorable benefit-to-risk ratio in these subcohorts. Additionally, the association between constitutional symptoms (most commonly fever and chills in this cohort) and decreased mortality aligns with prior work documenting that explicit infectious symptoms in sepsis cohorts are associated with earlier treatment and better outcomes. Future risk prediction and causal inference models for sepsis should incorporate symptoms and assess the potential benefits and risks of adding symptom-based criteria to consensus guidelines on empiric antibiotic timing and selection.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cellulitis requiring intensive care [^115mwmkR]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cellulitis is a commonly occurring skin and soft tissue infection and one of the most frequently seen dermatological diseases in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, clinical characteristics of patients with cellulitis requiring intensive care treatment are poorly defined. Necrotizing fasciitis is often confused for cellulitis at initial presentation and is considered to be more severe and thus has previously been described in more detail.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients with ICU-necessitating cellulitis and to compare them with patients with necrotizing fasciitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study includes all ICU admissions from 2 tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. Of 2562 sepsis admissions, 101 had possible, probable, or definite cellulitis or soft tissue infections. Retrospective review identified severe cellulitis was the reason for ICU admission in 23 patients, necrotizing fasciitis in 31 patients, and other diagnoses in 47 patients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient and disease characteristics, cultured pathogens, lengths of stay, and short-term and long-term mortality.

Results

Overall, 54 patients with cellulitis (n = 23; mean [SD] age, 57.2 [17.7] years) or necrotizing fasciitis (n = 31; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [13.5]) were included in this study. Patients with cellulitis were found to be less severely ill than patients with necrotizing fasciitis. This is reflected in rates of shock (7 [30.4%] vs 19 [61.3%]; p = 0.03), need for mechanical ventilation (12 [52.2%] vs 19 [93.5%]; p = 0.003) and slightly lower mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (8 vs 10; p = 0.046). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV scores did not differ significantly (82 [75–98] vs 76 [70–96]; p = 0.16). Patients with cellulitis had more chronic comorbidities than patients with necrotizing fasciitis (20 [87.0%] vs 17 [54.8%]; p = 0.02), especially cardiovascular insufficiencies (10 [43.5%] vs 4 [12.9%]; p = 0.02) and immunodeficiencies (9 [39.1%] vs 3 [9.7%]; p = 0.02). Among patients with cellulitis and patients with patients with necrotizing fasciitis, Staphylococcus aureus (10 [43.5%] vs 4 [12.9%]; p = 0.02), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 [8.7%] vs 19 [61.3%]; P < .001) and Escherichia coli (4 [17.4%] vs 5 [16.2%]; p = 0.90) were the most frequently observed pathogens. Median (IQR) length of ICU stay was shorter for patients with cellulitis vs patients with necrotizing fasciitis (3 [2–5] vs 5 [3–11]; p = 0.01), while median (IQR) hospital length of stay did not differ significantly (22 [10.25–32] vs 36 [14.25–40]; p = 0.16); and the in-hospital mortality rate (26.1% vs 22.6%, P > .99) and 90-day mortality rate (30.4% vs 22.6%; p = 0.54) were similar.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with cellulitis patients are seldom admitted to the ICU. However, while these patients are less critically ill on admission than patients with necrotizing fasciitis, they have more chronic comorbidities and most notably similar short-term and long-term mortality.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^114Ah4NM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset impact with fever and raised white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients with adherence to therapy, who do not have general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, can present recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the frequency of recurrences.

The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

Treatment
Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111rjLNJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found no robustly developed and validated diagnostic tools or criteria for lower‐limb cellulitis. A variety of potential tools have been explored so far, including biochemical tests, imaging, predictive scoring and clinical features. However, in seven of the eight included studies, cellulitis was not the main pathology of interest and was used as a comparator. Three studies compared cellulitis with rare differential diagnoses, such as osteomyelitis, which provide limited clinical applicability. This diversity in the tools explored emphasizes the difficulty in making a correct diagnosis on first presentation.

All eight included studies identified in this review were observational studies. 16, 17, 18, 19 The sample sizes were small, with only two studies including more than 100 patients with cellulitis. 16, 18 No criteria or tools have been subsequently validated in a large prospective study.

Despite cellulitis being a common presentation in community settings, all the tools identified to date have been developed and tested in secondary care, with limited evidence of validity or applicability in community settings. No study stated that the gold standard reference for clinical diagnosis was a board certified dermatologist or other specialist with cellulitis expertise. Only one study clearly stated who made the cellulitis diagnosis. 17

All the tools developed to date can be accessed by secondary care, are already available and, with the exception of CT imaging, are inexpensive. The severity of cellulitis is likely to be worse in secondary care. However, none of these tools can be used until they are validated in higher‐quality studies.

Three studies included rare pathologies that provide very limited clinical relevance as they are not common misdiagnoses of cellulitis. 110 Blood tests need to be interpreted with caution, as ESR, CRP and WBC count are nondiscriminatory markers, but can be used to guide a clinician when the differential diagnoses have been narrowed. High levels of these markers can also help point towards rarer pathologies such as NF. Only one study included paediatric patients, 20 therefore findings cannot be applied to this under‐researched population.

### Point-of-care ultrasound differentiates pyomyositis from cellulitis [^115DNRog]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pyomyositis (PM) is an infection of skeletal muscle, often associated with an abscess. Patients typically have predisposing risk factors or are immune compromised. The disease is often misdiagnosed, mistreated, and goes undetected until late in the patient's clinical course. We present a case of a patient without obvious predisposing risk factors who complained of right thigh pain, swelling, redness, and fevers for 4 days. Point-of-care ultrasound revealed muscle edema and subcutaneous emphysema without signs of an overlying cellulitis. Point-of-care ultrasound consequently led to an earlier diagnosis of PM and directly affected the immediate patient care in the emergency department.

### Misdiagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department and potential impact of clinical decision support interventions [^114E3Ljp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is misdiagnosed in 19% to 34% of emergency department (ED) cases resulting in excess healthcare spending and threatening patient safety. The objectives of this planned secondary analysis was to report the proportion of cellulitis misdiagnosis in the ED. Secondarily, we evaluated the potential impact of diagnostic adjuncts on misdiagnosis rates.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled ED patients presenting with acute lower extremity dermatologic complaints involving visible erythema (potential cellulitis). We abstracted the treating physician's diagnosis from the medical chart. Consensus diagnosis was determined by a group of six independent, multidisciplinary physicians. The treating ED physician's diagnosis was compared to the consensus panel diagnosis to identify errors. We evaluated the potential impact of two individual diagnostic adjuncts, skin surface temperature measurement and the ALT-70 score, plus a combination of both, on reducing cellulitis diagnostic errors RESULTS: The final sample included 201 patients. The diagnosis assigned by the treating physician and consensus panel was discordant in 50 of 201 cases (24.9%). Among patients with an ED physician diagnosis of cellulitis, 35.6% were overdiagnosed (48/135). In cases diagnosed as cellulitis, utilization of skin surface temperature, the two-level ALT-70 and the combination measure would have yielded an absolute reduction in cellulitis overdiagnosis by 8.9%, 5.7% and 13.0% of cases respectively CONCLUSION: Consistent with other reports, we observed a high rate of cellulitis overdiagnosis, highlighting the need for diagnostic support interventions. Proposed diagnostic adjuncts had an overall positive theoretical impact on overdiagnosis and should be evaluated in prospective interventional trials.

### About cellulitis | Group A strep… [^112oHYsD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the deeper layers of the skin.
- It causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area.
- If untreated, cellulitis can spread and cause serious health problems.
- Healthcare providers diagnose cellulitis by how it looks and treat it with antibiotics.
- Speak to a healthcare provider if you have concerns about cellulitis. Symptoms Generally, skin affected by cellulitis is
- Painful
- Red
- Swollen
- Tender to the touch
- Warm The skin may look pitted, like the peel of an orange. Blisters may appear on the affected skin. Other symptoms: Some people may also develop fever and chills. Cellulitis can appear anywhere on the body, but it's most common on the feet and legs. When to seek immediate medical attention spreads quicklyor you develop a fever or chills.

Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections:

- Bacteremia
- Endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Suppurative arthritis Cellulitis can cause thrombophlebitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors can increase the risk of getting this infection. Infections or injuries that break skin The following risk factors allow bacteria to get through the skin:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Injection drug use
- Injuries that break the skin Injuries that break the skin can include cuts, ulcers, bites, puncture wounds, tattoos, and piercings. For many people who get cellulitis, experts don't know how the bacteria get into the body.

Other health factors Other factors that increase risk for cellulitis include being overweight and chronic edema. Chronic edema is when limbs, like feet, legs, hands, or arms, stay swollen. Lymphedema and a coronary artery bypass graft are two conditions that can cause chronic edema.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors increase a person's risk. Breaks in the skin Disruption of the cutaneous barrier is a risk factor for developing cellulitis:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Fungal skin infections
- Injection drug use
- Injuries and wounds.

Clinical features Local signs Local signs of inflammation are present in most cellulitis cases:

- Erythema
- Pain
- **Warmth Systemic symptoms Systematic symptoms may be present**:

- Chills
- Fever
- Malaise These symptoms can be accompanied by lymphangitis and, less frequently, bacteremia. An elevated white blood cell count may also be present. Differentiating other skin infections Cellulitis affects structures that are deeper than areas affected by impetigo or erysipelas. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia.

Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

Error processing SSI file Cellulitis: All You Need to Know Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area of the skin. If untreated, it can spread and cause serious health problems. Good wound care and hygiene are important for preventing cellulitis. On This Page. Symptoms often affect feet and legs In general, cellulitis appears as a red, swollen, and painful area of skin that is warm and tender to the touch. The skin may look pitted, like the peel of an orange, or blisters may appear on the affected skin. Some people may also develop fever and chills. Cellulitis can appear anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the feet and legs. Seek medical attention immediately if the red area of the skin spreads quickly or you develop a fever or chills. Some people are at increased risk Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors can increase the risk of getting this infection.

Infections or injuries that break skin The following are risk factors because they allow bacteria to get through the skin:

- Injuries that cause a break in the skin
- Chronic skin conditions
- Chickenpox and shingles
- Injection drug use People who have had multiple cellulitis infections below the knee should be checked for fungal infections, such as athlete's foot. These infections should be treated since they can cause breaks in the skin that can lead to cellulitis. Complications are uncommon Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections:

- Bacteremia
- Suppurative arthritis
- Osteomyelitis
- Endocarditis Cellulitis can cause thrombophlebitis.

If you have an open wound or skin infection, avoid spending time in:

- Hot tubs
- Swimming pools
- Natural bodies of water People with diabetes should check their feet daily, looking for injuries or signs of infection.
