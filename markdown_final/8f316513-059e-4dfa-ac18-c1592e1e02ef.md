## Question

Can you define panniculitis and outline its management in morbidly obese patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition of panniculitis and its management in morbidly obese patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classification of panniculitis and why histopathology is pivotal. Then, I should verify obesity-specific phenotypes, distinguishing abdominal wall panniculus-associated disease from mesenteric panniculitis after bariatric surgery. Next, I will review the diagnostic workflow, including when to biopsy and what imaging to obtain. After that, I should examine conservative therapies, disease-specific immunosuppression, and weight-loss strategies. Finally, I will analyze surgical indications, timing, complication risks, preoperative optimization, and synthesize this into a stepwise management algorithm that integrates comorbidity screening and risk reduction strategies.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: panniculitis refers to inflammation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, typically presenting as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules or plaques, and accurate diagnosis often requires deep incisional biopsy because adipose tissue has limited reaction patterns necessitating clinicopathologic correlation [^117QUsXH] [^115m593Y]. Hold on, I should verify classification by pattern, because this shapes the differential: septal panniculitis (for example, erythema nodosum) versus lobular panniculitis (for example, lupus panniculitis, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma), with additional axes including vasculitis and predominant inflammatory cell type such as neutrophilic panniculitis, which directs workup and therapy [^116SLcQ8] [^115m593Y].

> Next, I need to consider the obesity-specific abdominal wall entity: in patients with a large abdominal panniculus (panniculus morbidus), chronic moisture, friction, lymphatic stasis, and ischemia can drive intertrigo, cellulitis, lymphedema, and ischemic panniculitis within the pannus; these patients often report pain, back strain, and hygiene difficulty that can become disabling [^116FYR39] [^115GcGVY]. Wait, let me verify the functional impact data; yes, in a bariatric series, grades 3–5 panniculus were specifically associated with hygiene problems and panniculitis contributing to morbidity, underscoring that this is not merely cosmetic but a pathologic state [^114shgne].

> I should separate this from mesenteric panniculitis, which is a distinct inflammatory–fibrotic process of mesenteric fat that can present de novo or after abdominal surgery, including case series after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy where early recognition and long-term immunosuppression altered outcomes; radiologically, CT demonstrates a misty mesentery with a fat-ring sign or pseudocapsule, but biopsy may still be required in selected cases to exclude malignancy and confirm diagnosis [^114J6KN3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially conflated abdominal wall panniculitis and mesenteric panniculitis; I need to ensure I keep these anatomically and etiologically distinct to avoid misdirected workup [^114NJEZy] [^1138k2Go].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach for morbidly obese patients where body habitus complicates evaluation: careful examination with retraction of folds is needed to assess deep lesions and macerated intertriginous skin; imaging can characterize the panniculus, identify hernias, and delineate edema in the abdominal wall, while CT is preferred for suspected mesenteric panniculitis; and definitive diagnosis for atypical, persistent, necrotic, or systemic cases should include a deep biopsy incorporating full-thickness subcutis for accurate histopathologic typing and to exclude lymphoma [^115GcGVY] [^117ApCik] [^114J6KN3] [^1174feQe] [^115m593Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benignity; I need to check for malignant mimics and lymphoproliferative disorders like subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, which can present with tender nodules and lipoatrophy and is often confused with lupus panniculitis; immunophenotyping and expert pathology review are crucial, and clinical vigilance for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is warranted in true SPTCL [^116tRxCW] [^115cuFdu]. I should double-check bedside pitfalls: SPTCL may initially resemble cellulitis or nonspecific panniculitis in case reports and teaching vignettes, reinforcing the threshold for biopsy when lesions persist or systemic symptoms occur [^113rej62].

> But wait, what if lesions are necrotizing and refractory; I need to ensure I test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency because guidelines recommend AAT testing in all patients with necrotizing panniculitis, which is a critical and actionable secondary cause that alters management and counseling [^114D3v98]. Let me reconsider infectious etiologies as well, especially in immunocompromised hosts, given MRSA and other pathogens can seed subcutis and require culture-directed therapy alongside histology when suspected [^112wEtHo] [^116SLcQ8].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative strategies tailored to morbid obesity: structured weight reduction is foundational to decrease mechanical load, moisture, and systemic inflammation; pharmacotherapy such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, phentermine–topiramate, or naltrexone–bupropion may be added to lifestyle measures per AGA guidance in appropriate adults, and bariatric evaluation should be considered for eligible patients with severe obesity [^113MCKJX]. Let me verify the broader dermatologic impact of weight-loss interventions; while data are heterogeneous, reports suggest weight reduction, including post-bariatric weight loss, can improve inflammatory dermatoses and reduce pannus burden, albeit with variation and the potential need for excess skin management [^1132hRfM] [^114Donba] [^112jPb3f].

> I will now examine disease-specific medical therapy because pattern-directed treatment matters: lupus panniculitis often responds to antimalarials and systemic corticosteroids with escalation to agents like dapsone or rituximab in refractory disease, whereas SPTCL frequently improves with immunomodulatory regimens such as systemic corticosteroids, bexarotene, interferon, or low-dose methotrexate when αβ phenotype is confirmed; conversely, γδ panniculitides generally require multiagent chemotherapy and carry a worse prognosis, underscoring the necessity of accurate phenotyping [^115cuFdu] [^116tRxCW]. For mesenteric panniculitis with systemic symptoms, I should confirm that prolonged corticosteroids with or without methotrexate are reported to be effective in selected post-bariatric cases, though evidence is limited and requires individualized risk–benefit assessment [^114NJEZy] [^1174feQe].

> Local and supportive care must not be overlooked; I need to ensure meticulous intertrigo management with antifungal and antibacterial measures when indicated, moisture control, and barrier strategies, while compression and elevation can aid lymphedema associated with panniculus morbidus; optimization of glycemic control and smoking cessation materially reduce wound complications and recurrent infections in this population [^115GcGVY] [^116FYR39] [^117SMFZG]. Wait, let me verify smoking's effect on wound outcomes; yes, smokers have significantly higher wound complication rates after panniculectomy, strengthening preoperative cessation counseling [^116FYR39].

> Now, I should detail when surgery is indicated: panniculectomy becomes appropriate for refractory panniculitis with recurrent infections, ulceration, malodor, or significant functional impairment such as immobility and hygiene inability after a reasonable trial of conservative measures; in extreme obesity, "supersize" panniculectomy has been performed for indications including panniculitis and hernia, with large resection weights reflecting disease burden [^117ApCik] [^116FYR39]. Hold on, I should verify whether this is truly functional rather than cosmetic; historical bariatric cohorts explicitly treated symptomatic panniculus concurrently or after weight loss for functional and hygienic indications, confirming medical necessity in selected patients [^114shgne].

> Regarding timing, I need to weigh concurrent versus staged approaches: concurrent panniculectomy at the time of gastric bypass has been reported without prolonging length of stay on average, but carries meaningful wound morbidity; staging after weight stabilization, typically 12–18 months post-bariatric surgery, is commonly favored to reduce tissue bulk and may facilitate lower major complication rates in some series, although overall wound complications remain substantial across studies [^114shgne] [^117ApCik] [^115ST43t]. Wait, let me first confirm absolute rates; single-institution series report overall wound complications ranging from approximately one-third to one-half of cases despite careful selection, underscoring the need for risk mitigation and shared decision making [^116FYR39] [^115ST43t].

> I should now review complication modifiers to guide optimization: higher BMI correlates with increased wound complications, diabetes independently predicts wound dehiscence, smoking increases superficial and deep incisional infections, and combining panniculectomy with hernia repair raises overall complication rates compared to panniculectomy alone; these data support preoperative glycemic control, smoking cessation, and staged hernia strategies when feasible [^116FYR39] [^117SMFZG] [^116W9Ka3]. Hold on, I should verify whether extreme obesity is an absolute contraindication; no, even BMI > 40 patients can undergo panniculectomy safely in experienced hands, but meticulous risk counseling and perioperative planning are essential [^115ST43t].

> Preoperative assessment should be comprehensive; I need to ensure screening for obesity-related comorbidities that amplify perioperative risk and complicate wound healing, including dyslipidemia, metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease, and other weight-related complications using guideline-based evaluations with lipid panels and liver imaging when indicated; this informs anesthesia risk, antibiotic dosing, and postoperative monitoring plans [^113H2Mz1] [^114rULHZ] [^1172J7oe] [^112YfR6x] [^113N5J7j]. I should confirm that I am not overreaching on specific numeric targets; while improved glycemic control is consistently associated with fewer wound complications, exact A1c cutoffs are not specified in these surgical series, so I will anchor recommendations to documented risk factors rather than arbitrary thresholds [^117SMFZG] [^116FYR39].

> Bringing this together, my stepwise algorithm for a morbidly obese patient with panniculitis begins with confirmation of panniculitis pattern on deep biopsy when the presentation is atypical, persistent, necrotizing, or systemic; in parallel, I assess for panniculus morbidus–related disease versus mesenteric involvement when abdominal symptoms occur post-bariatric surgery, using CT features and selective biopsy to confirm mesenteric panniculitis and exclude malignancy; I initiate aggressive conservative care including weight reduction with evidence-based anti-obesity pharmacotherapy or bariatric referral when appropriate, targeted immunosuppression for lupus panniculitis or SPTCL under specialist guidance, intertrigo control, edema management, and comorbidity optimization; and I refer for panniculectomy when refractory functional impairment or recurrent infections persist, selecting timing based on cardiopulmonary risk, planned or completed bariatric surgery, and modifiable risk factors such as diabetes and smoking status to mitigate the substantial but acceptable complication profile reported in contemporary series [^115m593Y] [^113MCKJX] [^114NJEZy] [^1174feQe] [^114shgne] [^117ApCik] [^116FYR39] [^117SMFZG] [^115cuFdu] [^116tRxCW].

Panniculitis is **inflammation of subcutaneous fat** [^115Edj65], presenting as tender erythematous nodules or plaques, and in morbid obesity, it is often driven by mechanical friction, moisture, and secondary infection [^115GcGVY] [^115FDjq8]. In morbidly obese patients, management centers on **weight loss** (lifestyle, pharmacotherapy [^113MCKJX], bariatric surgery) [^115HyDKt] to reduce recurrence and severity, along with **local care** (hygiene, moisture control, topical corticosteroids, antibiotics for infection) and compression therapy for lymphedema. Severe or refractory cases may require **systemic corticosteroids** [^115Edj65] or immunosuppressants [^115m593Y], with panniculectomy considered for persistent panniculitis with a large pannus [^114shgne]. To address comorbidities and reduce complications, **multidisciplinary care** is essential [^114rULHZ].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Key **clinical features** include tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules or plaques — often on the lower extremities, abdomen, or buttocks — that may ulcerate or drain in severe cases [^112auSmq]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation, histopathology, and imaging** (ultrasound, MRI) [^114J6KN3] to confirm inflammation and exclude other causes [^116RuXub].

---

## Pathophysiology in morbid obesity

- **Mechanical factors**: Friction and pressure from excess adipose tissue cause microtrauma and inflammation [^115GcGVY].

- **Metabolic factors**: Chronic low-grade inflammation from adipokines and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) promotes panniculitis.

- **Infectious factors**: Skin folds predispose to secondary bacterial and fungal infections, worsening inflammation [^112wEtHo].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Weight loss**: Lifestyle changes [^112tEVYL], pharmacotherapy (semaglutide, liraglutide, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion) [^113MCKJX], and bariatric surgery reduce recurrence and severity [^115GFmqz].

- **Local care**: Hygiene, moisture control, topical corticosteroids, and antibiotics for secondary infection [^115Edj65].

- **Compression therapy**: Reduces edema and improves lymphatic drainage in lymphedema-associated panniculitis.

---

### Medical management

For severe or refractory inflammation, **systemic corticosteroids** are used, and **immunosuppressive agents** such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or TNF-α inhibitors are considered for refractory or autoimmune-associated panniculitis.

---

### Surgical management

For persistent panniculitis with a large pannus, **panniculectomy** [^114shgne] removes excess abdominal skin and fat, improving hygiene, mobility, and quality of life. The **risks** include wound complications [^116W9Ka3], infection, dehiscence, and recurrence if weight is regained.

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary team** involving dermatology, surgery, endocrinology, nutrition, and physical therapy addresses comorbidities and reduces complications [^114rULHZ].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The **prognosis** is generally favorable with weight loss and risk-factor control [^115GFmqz], but recurrence is common without sustained weight loss and hygiene.

---

Panniculitis is inflammation of subcutaneous fat and, in morbid obesity, is driven by mechanical, metabolic, and infectious factors. **Management emphasizes weight loss, local care, and selective surgery**, with **multidisciplinary care** to optimize outcomes [^113MCKJX].

This review examines the complex relationship between obesity and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing their potentially shared pathogenesis, the impact of obesity on the natural history and treatment outcomes of IBD, and the management of obesity in patients with IBD.

- **Recent findings**:
	- Obesity represents a state of chronic inflammation that may not only contribute to IBD pathogenesis, but also influence disease progression, complications, and response to treatment. Increased visceral adiposity may carry negative prognostic implications for disease- and treatment-specific outcomes. Antiobesity medications, endoscopic bariatric therapies, and even bariatric surgery may be effective and well tolerated in selected patients with IBD.

The intersection of obesity and IBD presents a significant clinical challenge, with obesity influencing the natural history of IBD and potentially affecting treatment efficacy. As obesity prevalence among IBD patients rises, a tailored approach to management is crucial, taking into account the individualized risks and benefits of various treatment strategies, including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, endoscopic procedures, and bariatric surgery.

### Mesenteric panniculitis-first case series after bariatric surgery [^114NJEZy]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mesenteric panniculitis is an uncommon pathology of poorly understood etiology, characterized by progressive inflammation and fibrosis of the small bowel mesentery. This disease has been reported usually after other abdominal surgeries. We present two cases of young male patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and developed abdominal symptoms within 45–60 days of surgery. Both were investigated for known post-bariatric complications. The first patient presented five months later at an irreversible stage and died within 8–9 months of the primary surgery, while in the second patient, the disease process could be reversed through early intervention, diagnosis, treatment, and compliance. Mesenteric panniculitis is a rapidly progressive entity that can be adequately treated by early identification and long-term immunosuppressive therapy.

- **Question 1**: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Cellulitis
	- B. Lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP)
	- C. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTL)
	- D. Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (PCGDTL)
	- E. Extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL)

- **Answers**:
	- A. Cellulitis – Incorrect. Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues. It usually occurs in the lower parts of the legs, sometimes in the face, on the arms, and other areas, appearing as swollen, red, painful, and warm lesions. Pathology shows neutrophil infiltration, and antibiotics are usually effective against cellulitis.

	- B. LEP – Incorrect. LEP is an uncommon variant of lupus erythematosus, histopathologically characterized by lobular panniculitis. It often presents with subcutaneous nodules, indurated plaques, or ulcerations involving the face, proximal extremities, and breasts.

	- C. SPTL – Correct. SPTL is a cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma with a CD4-, CD8+, CD56-, βF1+ phenotype and an indolent clinical course. It typically appears as multiple, skin-colored, or erythematous, painless, subcutaneous nodules. SPTL can initially mimic benign panniculitis, psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, and cellulitis. Histopathologically, numerous atypical lymphoid cells surround the adipocytes in a wreath-like manner and are positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, βF1, Tia-1, granzyme B, but negative for CD20, CD56.

	- D. PCGDTL – Incorrect. PCGDTL is an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that does not express CD4, CD8, and βF1.

### Skin changes and manifestations associated with the treatment of obesity [^1132hRfM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

In light of the increasing prevalence of obesity, a large proportion of patients are taking weight loss medications or undergoing weight loss procedures. The typical paradigm for treating obesity begins with lifestyle interventions and progresses to medical treatments, and when nonsurgical interventions have failed, procedural techniques are considered. The effect of these interventions on the skin and dermatologic conditions has not been reviewed in depth. Herein, we review the impact of weight loss on pre-existing dermatologic conditions, as well as the development of novel skin changes and consequences of redundant skin after these interventions.

### Primary marginal zone lymphoma of the subcutis associated with panniculitis and fat necrosis [^112sJftq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Lymphocytic infiltrates in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, often accompanied by fat necrosis, are typically seen in benign panniculitis. Diagnostic considerations include subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma, whereas a primary subcutaneous B-cell lymphoma in this setting has not been previously described.

- **Methods**: We report the case of a 72-year-old woman with multiple deep cutaneous nodules on the trunk and upper extremities.

- **Results**: During 3 years of clinical follow-up, new skin nodules developed, while existing lesions remained stable or regressed. No other organ involvement was detected. Sequential biopsy specimens of the subcutaneous lesions revealed patchy, predominantly septal, lymphocytic infiltrates associated with extensive hyaline fat necrosis. The histologic and immunophenotypic features were consistent with marginal zone lymphoma. Genotyping revealed an identical monoclonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement across all biopsy specimens.

- **Conclusions**: This case represents, to our knowledge, the first reported case of primary subcutaneous B-cell lymphoma closely associated with panniculitis.

### Mesenteric panniculitis [^1174feQe]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric panniculitis is a rare and benign acute and chronic inflammatory and fibrotic process that predominantly affects the small intestine mesenteric fat and, less frequently (20%), the large intestine mesenteric fat. It may more rarely involve retroperitoneal, pelvic, and peripancreatic fat. This condition is more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 2–3:1, and it is more prevalent among Caucasian men. As of 2016, fewer than 300 cases have been reported worldwide, with none from South Africa. It may be associated with a variety of conditions such as prior abdominal surgery, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, infections, and gallstones among others.

Presenting symptoms are non-specific and include abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, and intestinal obstruction. A CT scan may reveal soft tissue masses, prominent lymph nodes, inflammation, and/or fibrosis of the mesentery. Greasy ring signal and pseudocapsule findings are considered more specific CT findings, but a biopsy is still required to confirm the diagnosis. The aim of this case report is to raise awareness among clinicians of this rare condition.

### Obesity and hidradenitis suppurativa: Targeting meta-inflammation for therapeutic gain [^111Qto7W]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous unit. The typical patient with HS is characterized by obesity, smoking habits, and the presence of nodules, abscesses, and/or draining tunnels predominantly distributed in intertriginous skin. It has been established that lifestyle and genetic factors are the main pathophysiological drivers of HS. In this critical review, we explore the interrelatedness of meta-inflammation, obesity, and HS, and discuss if and how this relationship may be manipulated for a therapeutic end.

### Palynziq [^113N4bEL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

One patient reported a soft tissue infection, which occurred after 196 days of Palynziq treatment and lasted 8 days, associated with mesenteric panniculitis treated with antibiotics. This resulted in treatment discontinuation.

- **Generalized skin reactions lasting at least 14 days**:
	- In clinical trials, 134 out of 285 (47%) patients treated with Palynziq experienced generalized skin reactions that were not limited to the injection site and lasted at least 14 days. The mean duration of these reactions was 63 days (median: 37 days; range: 14 to 638 days). These reactions were more frequent during the induction/titration phase, with 0.7 episodes per patient-year, and decreased over time to 0.3 episodes per patient-year in the maintenance phase. The mean time from the first dose of Palynziq to the onset of skin reactions was 373 days (median: 213 days; range: 2 to 1970 days). Five percent of these reactions persisted for at least 180 days, and 86% were reported as resolved at the time of the last observation, with up to 77 months of follow-up.

- **Angioedema**:
	- In clinical trials, 22 out of 285 (8%) patients experienced 45 episodes of angioedema. Symptoms included pharyngeal edema, swollen tongue, lip swelling, mouth swelling, eyelid edema, and face edema, occurring independent of anaphylaxis. Angioedema, included under hypersensitivity in Table 2, was more frequent during the induction/titration phase at 0.14 episodes per patient-year, and decreased over time to 0.04 episodes per patient-year in the maintenance phase. Three patients discontinued treatment, but all episodes resolved.

### The coexistence of lupus erythematosus panniculitis and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma in the same patient [^115cuFdu]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP) most commonly presents as multiple deep subcutaneous indurated nodules or erythematous plaques involving the face and proximal extremities. Lipoatrophy is another characteristic feature on resolution. Histopathologically, LEP shows lymphoplasmacytic lobular panniculitis, often with dermal mucin deposition, hyaline fat necrosis, and lymphoid follicles. There may be epidermal vacuolar change and a perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate with prominent plasma cells. Treatment options include antimalarials, systemic steroids, dapsone, or rituximab.

LEP may be limited to the subcutaneous fat; in such cases, it can be difficult to entirely exclude subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL). Histopathologic findings of SPTCL show pleomorphic T cells in the subcutaneous adipose tissue in a pattern mimicking panniculitis. Since 2005, SPTCL has been restricted to αβ pannicular infiltrates, usually CD8+ and CD56−, and has an indolent outcome. These patients can be treated with systemic corticosteroids, bexarotene, interferon, or low-dose chemotherapy with a single agent such as methotrexate. In contrast, pannicular lymphomas with a γδ phenotype are usually CD8− and CD56+ and may also involve the dermis or epidermis. These patients are generally treated with multiagent chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, but the prognosis is poor.

The histopathologic distinction of LEP and SPTCL can be challenging because of significant overlap; other clues that can aid in differentiating LEP from SPTCL include.

### Comorbidity screening in hidradenitis suppurativa: Evidence-based recommendations from the US and Canadian hidradenitis suppurativa foundations [^117P6PNi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

The biological link between hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) may be explained by the downstream systemic effects of adipose tissue secretion of proinflammatory mediators in obesity along with insulin resistance in the setting of chronic inflammation. Impaired Notch signaling in HS may result in elevations of TNF and subsequent impairment of insulin signaling. Hyperinsulinemia in the setting of obesity may also lead to overactivation of mTORC1 signaling via insulin-like growth factor, resulting in insulin resistance.

- **Obesity**: A higher prevalence of obesity among patients with HS compared to control individuals was observed across seven studies, with prevalences ranging from 5.9% to 73.1%. In a meta-analysis of eight studies, the adjusted pooled odds of obesity among patients with HS was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.2–5.4) times that of control individuals. Evidence supporting weight loss as a means of improving the disease course is limited.

- **Dyslipidemia**: A higher prevalence of dyslipidemia among patients with HS compared to control individuals was observed across four studies, with prevalences ranging from 3.3% to 45.3%. Adjusted odds of dyslipidemia among patients with HS ranged from 1.4 to 4.1 times that of control individuals. In a meta-analysis of nine studies comprising 6174 patients with HS, the odds of hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein levels among patients with HS were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1–2.5) and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5–4.2) times that of control individuals, respectively.

- **Diabetes mellitus**: A higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among patients…

- **Punch biopsy observations**: A punch biopsy of the skin and subcutaneous tissue from patient 1, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, reveals perivascular and periadnexal inflammation in the dermis, as indicated by arrowheads. An extensive lymphocytic infiltrate is noted in the subcutaneous tissue at ×2 magnification. The infiltrate is composed of mature lymphocytes, occasional atypical lymphocytes, and histiocytes that surround the fat cells at ×20 magnification.

- **Immunohistochemical staining**: The immunohistochemical stains highlight the rimming of fat cells by T-cells and histiocytes from the punch biopsy of patient 1. Numerous CD163+ histiocytes and infiltrate surrounding adipocytes are observed. The majority of lymphocytes test positive for CD3 and consist of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. The CD4 stain highlights a subset of T-cells and histiocytes, while the CD8 stain highlights a subset of T-cells, both viewed at ×20 magnification.

### Patient selection optimization following combined abdominal procedures: Analysis of 4925 patients undergoing panniculectomy/abdominoplasty with or without concurrent hernia repair [^116W9Ka3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Massive weight loss following bariatric surgery causes unwanted excess skin and subcutaneous tissue. Intraoperative abdominal wall exposure during abdominal contouring surgery provides the possibility for ventral, umbilical, or inguinal hernia repair. The authors evaluated the incidence of postoperative complications following abdominal contouring surgery with or without concurrent hernia repair and the impact of surgical specialty.

- **Methods**: Analysis of patients undergoing abdominal contouring surgery with or without concurrent hernia repair was performed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2011. The incidence of postoperative complications was determined. Logistic regression assessed the influence of demographics and comorbidities on postoperative outcomes. A control group (body mass index > 27.5) and a high-risk group (body mass index > 40) undergoing hernia repair were also included for comparison.

- **Results**: Among 4925 patients, 63.7 percent underwent abdominoplasty and/or panniculectomy only, while 36.3 percent underwent a simultaneous hernia repair. The abdominal contouring surgery with simultaneous hernia repair group had a higher complication rate than the abdominal contouring surgery group (18.3 percent versus 9.8 percent, p < 0.001). Body mass index was associated with increased wound complications and major complications in both groups. Diabetes, smoking, chronic steroid use, and hypertension increased wound complications in the abdominal contouring surgery/hernia repair group.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the increased risk of complications when abdominal contouring is combined with hernia repair, particularly in patients with higher body mass indices and comorbidities.

### Complications of abdominal contouring surgery in obese patients: Current status [^115ST43t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Medical records of 122 patients who underwent an abdominoplasty or panniculectomy from 2003 to 2008 were reviewed to determine rates of wound complications associated with these procedures in the presence of obesity. An additional aim was to determine rates of complications as compared with those found 10 years ago at our institution to assess whether the finding of obesity alone continues to adversely affect wound outcomes. Of the patients studied, 63 out of 122 (51.6%) experienced one or more wound-related complications. Major complications occurred in 13 patients (10.7%). Notably, the lowest major complication rate of 4.5% was found in patients with extreme obesity (BMI > 40).

- **Comparisons between past studies**: The difference in major complications in those classified as obese was significant, with 2 (9%) in the current study and 8 (40%) in the 1999 study (P = 0.039).

Our findings suggest that the high rates of major complications found in those with obesity in the 1999 study are not observed today. Extreme obesity is not an absolute contraindication to operation and such procedures may be performed safely.

### "Supersize" panniculectomy: Indications, technique, and results [^117ApCik]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Obesity remains a significant health problem associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Panniculectomy in the obese patient population aims to treat complications related to excess abdominal skin in an attempt to improve quality of life, increase mobility, and potentially prepare the patient for subsequent bariatric surgery or enrollment in a weight-loss program. This study describes the indications and outcomes of "supersize" panniculectomy in the extreme obesity patient population.

- **Patients and methods**: A Duke University institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of patients who underwent a "supersize" panniculectomy by a single surgeon during a 6-year period was conducted. Data on patient demographics, operative indication, preoperative imaging, concomitant operations, and postoperative complications were collected.

- **Results**: Twenty-six patients underwent a "supersize" panniculectomy for indications including immobility secondary to excess abdominal skin, panniculitis, ventral hernia, and the presence of a gynecologic tumor. The mean pannus resection weight was 15.6 kg, and the mean follow-up was 15.7 months. Twelve patients underwent preoperative abdominal computed tomographic imaging. Eleven patients underwent concomitant surgical procedures at the time of their panniculectomy. The overall wound complication rate for the "supersize" panniculectomy was 42.3% (11/26 patients); however, the rate of major complications, defined as those requiring a return to the operating room, was only 11.5% (3/26 patients).

Panniculitis and lipodystrophy are rare disorders of subcutaneous tissue. Recently, the incidence of lipodystrophy has been increasing, primarily due to its appearance in patients with HIV, where it appears to be a direct consequence of drug therapy. A comprehensive review of the available literature regarding the pathogenesis and treatment options is discussed here.

The diagnosis of panniculitis has been hampered by various challenges. However, recent literature has focused on improving pathologic diagnostic yields. New diagnostic aids are presented as part of this ongoing effort.

### Commentary on response to remission of hidradenitis suppurativa after bariatric surgery [^114c4ika]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We are grateful to Dr. Golbari and colleagues from the Stony Brook University School of Medicine for their interest in our recently published article.

Our article describes two cases where our patients' hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) resolved after bariatric surgery. In contrast, Golbari et al. used online forums, discovering that most individuals experienced worsening symptoms caused by an increase in skin folds. These data are interesting, as many of our patients report using online forums to share disease experiences. Although frictional sites are predisposed to HS, neither of our patients required abdominoplasty for excess skin removal. Golbari et al. also commented on obstacles related to insurance coverage for skin removal after surgery. This is another interesting point, as it was something we did not allude to in our article because insurance coverage is less of an issue in our Irish health system.

We agree that patients should be counseled that surgery will not necessarily improve their symptoms. However, we do not believe this should deter patients from undergoing such surgery, as weight loss has other benefits, such as improvement in metabolic indices, which we found in our cases. This results in not only cutaneous benefits but also improvements in overall cardiovascular health.

Their commentary highlights the heterogeneity of patients with HS and reiterates that HS is a difficult disease to treat, with no single therapy effective for every individual. It is clear that further clinical data and open-label trials are required to assess the utility.

### Remission of hidradenitis suppurativa after bariatric surgery [^114Donba]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by recurrent, painful abscesses, nodules, and draining sinus tracts. The primary sites of involvement are the intertriginous skin areas of the axilla, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary regions. The prevalence of HS is estimated to be 1% to 4%, and HS patients are more likely to be obese. A study conducted by Revuz et al. found an increase in the risk of HS by 1.12 for each unit increase in body mass index (BMI).

The treatment of HS is notoriously challenging. Options available include medical treatments in the form of topical and systemic medications, surgery, and lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and smoking cessation. We report on two patients who experienced remission of HS after bariatric surgery.

### Evaluating the cutaneous manifestations and associated comorbidities of childhood obesity [^112GqBK3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Rates of childhood obesity are rising, making it a public health concern due to its link to numerous poor health outcomes over the lifespan. In adults, obesity is associated with various inflammatory skin conditions; however, this is not well-studied in children with obesity. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TrinetX Research Network Database, evaluating children under 18 with and without obesity and various dermatologic conditions and comorbidities. Childhood obesity was associated with increased rates of all dermatologic conditions and associated comorbidities evaluated (p < 0.05). This study highlights associations between various dermatologic conditions and comorbidities in children with obesity, compared with those without, emphasizing the need for early intervention and management strategies to mitigate obesity-related health complications in pediatric populations.

### Gouty panniculitis: A case series [^116N6g8j]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Gouty panniculitis may have a gradual onset, as evidenced by our patients whose cutaneous manifestations had been present for 2, 8, and 10 years before diagnosis. Previous literature has suggested that the average time to diagnosis is measured in years, which implies a chronic progressive disease course with a difficult diagnosis.

The diagnosis of gouty panniculitis depends on histopathology, in which fixation in alcohol and anhydrous processing reveals the key features of the urate crystals. Routine formalin fixation and hematoxylin-eosin staining can wash out the crystals. Histopathologic examination of gouty panniculitis will reveal needle-like urate crystals with typical feathering and a granulomatous reaction with histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells.

Clinical differential diagnoses that should be considered include lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, such as autoimmune disease, panniculitis associated with malignancy, and panniculitis associated with calcium deposition in patients on hemodialysis. Other disorders that must be ruled out include cellulitis, pseudogout, oxalosis, calciphylaxis, and lupus panniculitis.

A standardized treatment for gouty panniculitis has not been established, given the rarity of this entity. Therapy consists of agents to manage hyperuricemia. Some reports indicated that treating patients with allopurinol up to 600–1200 mg/day and colchicine not only improved the lesions but also stopped the formation of new lesions. Low-dose, short-term systemic steroids, such as prednisone 10 mg/day, can be given to control inflammation.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^1166zKwc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Based on aetiology, panniculitis is a relatively rare process in children and is among many diseases that cause panniculitis. Other forms of childhood panniculitis include poststeroidal panniculitis, neonatal scleroderma, cold panniculitis, newborn subcutaneous fat necrosis, among others. There are very few reports of panniculitis in children that are well described in adults.

The most common type is erythema nodosum, a septal panniculitis without vasculitis, which is clinically defined as the appearance of painful and inflammatory cutaneous nodules that primarily affect the pretibial region of the lower limbs. These nodules typically resolve on their own in 1–6 weeks without ulceration or cutaneous atrophy. It is a pluriaetiological condition that usually develops because of a hypersensitivity response linked to paediatric enteric, tuberculosis, or streptococcal infections, as well as beta-lactam and macrolide use.

The patient in this instance had subcutaneous nodules, a fever, and systemic symptoms, all of which were clinical signs of panniculitis and called for a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Clinically, panniculitis manifests as deep plaques or nodules, irrespective of the aetiology. To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, it is important to supplement its investigation with a histological study. Nevertheless, given the restricted capacity of adipose tissue to respond with various patterns, its histology is not easily interpreted. It is the physician's responsibility to decide when to do a skin biopsy, which is the most effective diagnostic tool.

### Clinical and pathological characteristics and outcomes among patients with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and related adipotropic lymphoproliferative disorders [^116tRxCW]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

There is a recognized knowledge gap concerning subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) due to its rarity and diagnostic challenges. This gap has led to a scarcity of well-documented large case series available at the time of writing. To address this, a joint multi-institutional review was conducted to generate consensus knowledge regarding SPTCL and related conditions.

This retrospective clinical and pathological review included cases initially diagnosed as SPTCL at six large US academic centers. The cases were reviewed by a team of pathologists, dermatologists, and oncologists with expertise in cutaneous lymphomas. Through a group consensus process, applying defined clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria, the cohort was classified into two categories: (1) SPTCL and (2) adipotropic lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPD) for similar cases that did not meet the complete histopathological criteria for SPTCL designation.

Cases of SPTCL diagnosed between 1998 and 2018 were examined. The main outcome analyzed was the disease presentation and evolution, including response to therapy, disease progression, and development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

The cohort consisted of 95 patients with a median age of 38 years (range 2–81 years) and a female-to-male ratio of 2.7. It included 75 cases of SPTCL and 20 cases of ALPD. Clinically, both groups presented similarly with multiple (85%) or single (15%) tender nodules, predominantly affecting the extremities and occasionally resulting in lipoatrophy. Notably, HLH was only observed in SPTCL cases.

### Panniculitis in childhood [^117QUsXH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Panniculitis refers to disorders characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. Such inflammation can be primary or may present as a reaction pattern induced by a systemic process. Some types of panniculitis are observed more commonly or exclusively in children, including erythema nodosum, subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, sclerema neonatorum, poststeroid panniculitis, and cold panniculitis. The most typical clinical finding is tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules. Clinical clues can assist in the diagnosis of these conditions; however, pathology is often necessary for confirmation. In general, pediatric panniculitides are treated with supportive care and management of any underlying disorders. Certain types, such as infectious panniculitis and malignancy-related panniculitis, require more specific therapies.

### Rapid cytologic diagnosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn [^115hmWY6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare, self-limited panniculitis that typically presents within the first few weeks of life. Although the diagnosis is usually clinical, some cases require skin biopsy with hematoxylin and eosin stain for confirmation. We report a previously undocumented rapid diagnostic protocol that involves collecting a small amount of exudate from a suppurative lesion, placing it onto a slide without fixation, and simply viewing the material under a microscope. This novel and practical method of diagnosis reveals doubly refractile crystals diagnostic of subcutaneous fat necrosis without a biopsy, which may be helpful for rapid diagnosis or use in low-resource settings.

### An unusual case of acquired generalized lipodystrophy (panniculitis variety) [^116uGrpn]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL) is a rare disease characterized by a variable loss of adipose tissue and consequent metabolic derangements, typically with childhood or adolescent onset. AGL has three subclassifications: panniculitis (type 1), autoimmune disease (type 2), and idiopathic (type 3). This report highlights a rare case of AGL type 1 in a previously healthy 3-year-old female who presented with diffuse erythematous subcutaneous nodules, progressive lipoatrophy, and histopathological findings of a lobular panniculitis.

### Abdominal panniculectomy: Determining the impact of diabetes on complications and risk factors for adverse events [^117SMFZG]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity, along with bariatric surgery and massive weight loss requiring panniculectomy, is increasing in the United States. The effect of diabetes mellitus on outcomes following panniculectomy remains poorly defined despite its prevalence. This study aims to evaluate the impact of diabetes mellitus on complications following panniculectomy and determine risk factors for adverse events.

- **Methods**: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify patients undergoing panniculectomy between 2010 and 2015. Patients were stratified based on diabetes status.

- **Results**: A review of the database identified 7035 eligible patients who underwent panniculectomy, of which 770 (10.9 percent) were diabetic. Multivariate regression showed that diabetes mellitus was a significant risk factor for wound dehiscence (OR, 1.92; 95 percent CI, 1.41 to 3.15; p = 0.02). Obesity was a significant risk factor for superficial (OR, 2.78; 95 percent CI, 1.53 to 3.69; p < 0.001) and deep (OR, 1.52; 95 percent CI, 1.38 to 3.97; p = 0.01) incisional surgical-site infection. Smokers were also at an increased risk for superficial (OR, 1.42; 95 percent CI, 1.19 to 1.75; p = 0.03) and deep (OR, 1.63; 95 percent CI, 1.31 to 2.22; p = 0.02) incisional surgical-site infection.

- **Conclusions**: Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for wound dehiscence following panniculectomy. Obesity and smoking were significant risk factors for superficial and deep incisional surgical-site infections. These results underscore the importance.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^114sUrDN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Although not ideal, the BMI is the internationally recognized standard for the definition of overweight and obesity, and the CDC standard curves are the most readily available standards for American children. The Task Force elected not to recommend another standard without higher quality evidence.

Stunted populations may have an increased BMI without increased body fat. Taller individuals may have a high BMI even if their body proportions are equivalent to those of shorter individuals. In individuals who are not unusually short or tall, a high BMI is likely to predict abnormally high body fat content. However, a normal BMI does not always exclude the presence of increased body fat or increased risk of obesity-associated comorbidities (see 2.2 Remarks). Fat tissue and BMI increase naturally with pubertal progression in girls, so that matching the value to chronological age may be misleading if the child progresses through puberty outside the average age range.

Much research has focused on using the waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio as a marker of obesity, as well as an additional marker for insulin resistance. This approach has the advantage of taking into account body fat distribution and the greater cardiovascular risk associated with visceral fat. Waist circumference standards for American children of various ethnic groups are available. Waist circumference should be recorded because future research may prove this measure to reflect fatness or morbidity better.

BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is plotted according to the standard reference.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^112auSmq]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

The term fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first used by Petersdorf and Beeson at Yale University in the 1960s. They studied 100 patients with a body temperature above 38.3°C for over three weeks without diagnosis despite a week of hospital evaluation. Most panniculitides present similarly, with tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, typically where fatty tissue is prominent, such as the legs, thighs, buttocks, and cheeks. Subtypes of panniculitis are linked to infections, trauma, cancer, and inflammatory illnesses.

Diagnosing panniculitis is challenging due to its rarity and similar clinical presentations. Diagnosis requires a thorough clinical examination, considering patient risk factors, lesion distribution, and related symptoms like ulceration, sclerosis, and atrophy. Histopathologic evaluation can aid in diagnosis but requires careful clinical correlation to avoid inaccuracies. The challenge increases with FUO, necessitating a comprehensive assessment. We describe a young child with panniculitis and recurring fevers, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and the need for a multidisciplinary approach.

### Case report of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma complicated by eyelid swelling [^114x4CFR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The patient initially presented with swelling of one eyelid, accompanied by visual deterioration. After temporary improvement with local/systemic steroid administration, systemic symptoms such as high fever, abdominal dropsy, and hepatosplenomegaly emerged. This was followed by swelling of the opposite (right) eyelid. Initial findings were similar to those of orbital cellulitis, but no fever or increase in inflammatory response value was indicated by blood examination. Previous cases of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) often presented with subcutaneous nodules on the trunk and/or extremities, along with systemic symptoms like fever and arthralgia. No previous case has reported opposite eyelid swelling with systemic symptoms occurring after temporary symptom improvement without systemic involvement in the early stages of SPTCL.

This case was challenging to differentiate as the appearance of facial symptoms in SPTCL is rare. Based on 83 recently reported cases, symptoms originally appeared on the face in only 16 cases, compared to appearing on the lower extremities in 64 cases, the upper extremities in 52 cases, and the trunk in 47 cases.

SPTCL is difficult for doctors from other departments to differentiate and often leads to an initial diagnosis of cellulitis or subcutaneous panniculitis. Eyelid swelling symptoms can also occur in conditions such as orbital phlegmon, orbital inflammatory pseudotumor, immunoglobulin G 4 (IgG4)-related diseases, malignant orbital lymphomas, and collagenoses.

### The accumulating data to optimally predict obesity treatment (ADOPT) core measures project: Rationale and approach [^115ujmJu]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Individual variability in response to multiple modalities of obesity treatment is well documented, yet our understanding of why some individuals respond while others do not is limited. The etiology of this variability is multifactorial; however, at present, we lack a comprehensive evidence base to identify which factors or combination of factors influence treatment response.

- **Objectives**: This paper provides an overview and rationale of the Accumulating Data to Optimally Predict Obesity Treatment (ADOPT) Core Measures Project, which aims to advance the understanding of individual variability in response to adult obesity treatment. This project provides an integrated model for how factors in the behavioral, biological, environmental, and psychosocial domains may influence obesity treatment responses and identifies a core set of measures to be used consistently across adult weight-loss trials. This paper provides the foundation for four companion papers that describe the core measures in detail.

- **Significance**: The accumulation of data on factors across the four ADOPT domains can inform the design and delivery of effective, tailored obesity treatments. ADOPT provides a framework for how obesity researchers can collectively generate this evidence base and is a first step in an ongoing process that can be refined as the science advances.

### Lymphocytic panniculitis: An algorithmic approach to lymphocytes in subcutaneous tissue [^115m593Y]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of panniculitis is a relatively rare occurrence for many practicing pathologists. The smaller subset of lymphocyte-predominant panniculitis is further complicated by the diagnostic consideration of T cell lymphoma involving the subcutaneous tissue, mimicking inflammatory causes of panniculitis. Accurate classification of panniculitis is crucial to direct clinical management, as treatment options may vary from non-medical therapy to immunosuppressive agents to aggressive chemotherapy. Many diseases show significant overlap in clinical and histological features, making the process of determining a specific diagnosis very challenging. However, with an adequate biopsy including skin and deep subcutaneous tissue, a collaborative effort between clinician and pathologist can often lead to a specific diagnosis.

This review provides an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of lymphocyte-predominant panniculitis, including entities of:

- **Septal-predominant pattern panniculitis**: Erythema nodosum, deep necrobiosis lipoidica, morphea profunda, and sclerosing panniculitis.
- **Lobular-predominant pattern panniculitis**: Lupus erythematous panniculitis/lupus profundus, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma, cutaneous γ-δ T cell lymphoma, Borrelia infection, and cold panniculitis.

### Functional panniculectomy vs cosmetic abdominoplasty: Multicenter analysis of risk factors and complications [^117WUvXz]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Amidst the rising trend of bariatric surgical procedures being performed across the country and around the world, patients seeking functional panniculectomy after massive weight loss represent a different population than those seeking cosmetic abdominoplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain complications are more likely to occur in patients undergoing functional panniculectomy, and to identify risk factors implicated in the occurrence of adverse events.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients undergoing cosmetic abdominoplasty and functional panniculectomy in North America between 2015 and 2019 using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, sponsored by the American College of Surgeons. Comorbidities and postoperative complications between these two cohorts were analyzed with appropriate statistics.

- **Results**: During the study interval, 11,137 patients underwent excision of excessive infraumbilical abdominal skin. This included 57.4% (n = 6,397) patients undergoing functional panniculectomy and 42.6% (n = 4,740) patients undergoing cosmetic abdominoplasty. Patients undergoing functional panniculectomy were significantly more likely to have comorbidities than those undergoing cosmetic abdominoplasty (p < .001). Overall adverse events (p < .001), medical complications (p = .047), surgical complications (p < .001), related readmission (p < .001), and related reoperation (p < .001) were significantly higher in patients undergoing functional panniculectomy.

### Does weight loss lead to improvement of dermatological conditions: What is the evidence [^115GFmqz]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Obese and overweight individuals may exhibit a wide spectrum of cutaneous features and can experience more severe manifestations of multiple dermatological conditions. There have been numerous expert opinions on the role of weight loss in improving skin conditions. However, there have been few studies over the past decade evaluating the effects of exercise and other modes of weight reduction on various dermatoses such as psoriasis, acne vulgaris, hidradenitis suppurativa, and acanthosis nigricans. In this review, we attempt to provide a summary of the beneficial effects of weight loss on various dermatological conditions.

### Response to: Remission of hidradenitis suppurativa after bariatric surgery [^112jPb3f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, these anecdotal data suggest that when counseling HS patients about bariatric surgery, it is important to note that disease severity may recur after initial improvement. Additionally, a patient's insurance coverage of skin removal should be determined preoperatively. Persistent skin conditions resulting from the panniculus is a criterion for determining the medical necessity for panniculectomy. Limitations of this review include its retrospective nature and patient-reported severity. Long-term follow-up with verification of disease severity is needed to determine the effect of gastric bypass on the severity of HS, including the potential contributory effects of dietary adjustments and excess skin fold removal.

### Panniculitis. Part ii. Mostly lobular panniculitis [^115Edj65]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The second part of our review of panniculitis summarizes the clinicopathologic features of the mostly lobular panniculitides. Erythema induratum of Bazin (nodular vasculitis) represents the most common variant of lobular panniculitis with vasculitis, although controversy persists about the nature of the involved vessels. Mostly lobular panniculitides without vasculitis comprise a series of disparate disorders. These include sclerosing panniculitis that results from chronic venous insufficiency of the lower extremities, panniculitis with calcification of the vessel walls such as calciphylaxis and oxalosis, and inflammatory diseases with crystals within the adipocytes such as sclerema neonatorum, subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, and poststeroid panniculitis.

Connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis, pancreatic diseases, and alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency may also show mostly lobular panniculitis with characteristic histopathologic features. Lobular panniculitis may also be an expression of infections, trauma, or factitial causes involving the subcutaneous fat. Lipoatrophy refers to a loss of subcutaneous fat due to a previous inflammatory process involving the subcutis, and it may be the late-stage lesion of several types of panniculitis. In contrast, lipodystrophy means an absence of subcutaneous fat with no evidence of inflammation, often associated with endocrinologic, metabolic, or autoimmune diseases. Finally, cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis is the term that has been used to describe…

### Approach to the patient: Diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^111yaxbz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of Cushing syndrome (CS) can be variable, depending on a patient's age, sex, severity, and duration of cortisol excess. Patients often present with nonspecific features such as abdominal obesity and weight gain, rounded (moon) face, menstrual irregularity, and depression. The diagnosis is further complicated if signs and symptoms develop gradually over time and emerge sequentially. Diagnosing endogenous CS at an early stage is therefore a challenging task. Moreover, there is a large overlap of Cushingoid-related features with conditions associated with relatively mild increased cortisol levels. These pseudo-Cushing states, such as severe obesity, alcoholism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and neuropsychiatric disorders, are far more prevalent than endogenous CS.

Testing is recommended in:

- **Patients with adrenal incidentalomas (adenoma)**.
- **Patients showing uncommon Cushingoid-related features for their age**: Such features might include hypertension, osteoporosis, or female balding.
- **Patients exhibiting multiple progressive symptoms over time**: This is particularly crucial when specific Cushingoid features are present, such as ecchymoses, proximal myopathy, wide reddish-purple striae, facial plethora, recurrent infections, and osteopenia.

### Individual article: Psoriasis and obesity: Optimizing pharmacologic treatment and lifestyle interventions [^117QA6TV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity is a metabolic disease marked by excessive fat accumulation and is objectively defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m². It is associated with several other comorbidities, including psoriasis, which is a chronic autoimmune skin disease. Adipocytes produce pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, namely adipokines and classic cytokines, that drive increased inflammation and may contribute to the pro-inflammatory pathways driving psoriasis disease pathogenesis.

Optimizing dermatologic management of obese patients with psoriasis may be challenging due to the effect of comorbid obesity on the pharmacokinetics of systemic therapies. Biologic therapy is a mainstay of psoriasis treatment in these patients. The IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitor classes, including those targeting the IL-17 receptor (brodalumab) and IL-17 cytokine antagonists (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab), as well as IL-23 cytokine antagonists (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab), are commonly used. In general, the most efficacious biologics that work well for generalized plaque psoriasis also tend to work well for most obese psoriasis patients. For example, brodalumab, an IL-17 receptor inhibitor, demonstrated comparable efficacy across BMI categories in both clinical trial and real-world practice data.

In addition to psoriasis-specific therapy, interventions targeted at weight loss may help treat obesity and decrease psoriasis disease severity. These interventions include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy, caloric restriction, and different forms of bariatric surgery.

### Panniculitis with fever of unknown origin [^1138k2Go]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

When discussing the diagnostic challenges of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and clinical implications in children with panniculitis, only a few works are available. A young boy presented with subcutaneous nodular lesions and persistent fever, requiring hospitalization and detailed investigation to exclude immunological and infective etiology. A biopsy established that subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma was among the FUO causes, leading to the conclusion that nodular lesions in FUO patients require early biopsy to prevent complications and delays in treatment. By presenting this case, a team approach and analysis can be applied to address pediatric patients who may present with obscure manifestation of FUO, thereby improving clinical results and efficacy of the patients.

- **Diagnostic challenges**: It can be challenging to diagnose mesenteric panniculitis, especially in cases of FUO and abdominal surgical history. Further studies were required in this clinical case due to recurring fevers, fatigue, and increased urinary frequency in a woman in her 40s with thalassemia and a history of abdominal surgeries. Imaging studies described a misty mesenteric appearance with enlarged nodes, indicating chronic mesenteric panniculitis. The biopsy result was negative, which in essence eliminated cancer and confirmed the medical diagnosis.

- **Treatment choices**: In the case of treatment choices for FUO related to mesenteric panniculitis, the requirement for a complex and personalized approach and specific management interventions, such as steroids or methotrexate, have emerged. As pointed out in the literature, emphasis on personalized treatment strategies is crucial to improve patient outcomes.

### Neutrophilic panniculitis: Algorithmic approach to a heterogeneous group of disorders [^116SLcQ8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic panniculitis encompasses an etiologically and morphologically heterogeneous group of disorders. Correct histopathologic diagnosis is important in identifying certain systemic diseases and guiding appropriate treatment.

- **Objective**: To review the clinical and histopathologic features of different types of neutrophilic panniculitis, and to provide a diagnostic algorithm for these disorders.

- **Data sources**: A review of the literature with emphasis on the distinguishing features of different entities was performed.

- **Conclusions**: Evaluation for neutrophilic panniculitis entails paying close attention to the pattern of inflammation, the type of fat necrosis present, any evidence of vascular damage, and other relevant histopathologic features. An algorithmic approach integrating all histopathologic, clinical, and laboratory findings is required for correct diagnosis.

### Lipoatrophic connective tissue panniculitis [^113xx4UM]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Many causes of what was formerly called Weber-Christian and Rothmann-Makai diseases are being clarified as specific forms of panniculitis. Among them, an autoimmune process involving the subcutaneous fat without criteria for another defined disorder, coined "connective tissue panniculitis" by Winckelman et al. in 1980, has been described. We describe this disease in a 4-year-old boy who presented with multiple subcutaneous inflammatory nodules that extended in an annular fashion and resolved, leaving lipoatrophy, with recurrence 8 years later. The histologic findings were consistent with a granulomatous lipophagic panniculitis.

We review previous reports and emphasize the limited therapeutic options, chronic evolution, severe aesthetic sequelae, and possible association with other autoimmune disorders of this uncommon condition.

### Collection on reframing obesity in health care and ending weight stigma: Presenting evidence for change [^115HyDKt]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding treatment, advances in the pharmacotherapy of obesity are summarized and included in our collection. The review presents evidence for approved and emerging anti-obesity medications, highlighting the scarcity of data on the long-term effects of these medications, and presents a useful treatment algorithm that considers a patient's clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and drug contraindications. Supporting the transition to a more personalized approach to obesity care, an early study shows that a phenotype-tailored lifestyle intervention resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 12 weeks compared with a standard lifestyle intervention.

As highlighted in the collection about personalized approaches for the prevention and management of obesity, the involvement of people with lived experience of obesity is central to developing effective approaches to care that reflect the complexity of the condition, and to shift the perception away from the idea that obesity is a choice. In two articles written by people with a lived experience of obesity, they provide first-hand accounts about how their environment shaped their eating habits and perceptions of obesity, how their body weight cycled through dieting, and the damaging effect of weight stigma on their lives.

The increasing global prevalence of obesity and the continued pervasiveness of weight stigma show that approaches to the prevention, management, and understanding of this disease are inadequate. EClinicalMedicine invites you to explore the wealth of information included in our collection, which informs the ongoing efforts to address these challenges.

### Mesenteric panniculitis as a possible cause of fever of unknown origin [^115yHEed]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Mesenteric panniculitis is a non-neoplastic condition involving inflammation and fibrosis of the small bowel mesentery. We describe a man in his 60s who presented with three months of febrile episodes, confusion, and weight loss. The diagnosis of mesenteric panniculitis had been established two weeks prior based on an abdominal computerized tomography scan. Extensive diagnostic investigations during his hospitalization were unrevealing, and the symptoms were ultimately attributed to the mesenteric panniculitis. The fevers resolved over several weeks, and no further episodes have occurred since discharge. This case suggests that mesenteric panniculitis merits consideration in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for medical care of patients with obesity [^114rULHZ]. Endocrine Practice (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, more specifically with respect to the assessment of obesity-related complications, the AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining clinical evaluations for weight-related complications in all patients with overweight or obesity. This includes anthropometric assessments of adiposity and a clinical assessment of weight-related complications, as BMI alone is not sufficient to indicate the impact of excess adiposity on health status. Patients with overweight or obesity should be reevaluated at intervals to monitor for any changes in adiposity and adiposity-related complications over time.

### Panniculectomy adjuvant to obesity surgery [^114shgne]. Obesity Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Many patients who qualify for obesity surgery have a moderate to large panniculus (grade 1–5). They can benefit from panniculectomy done concurrently with gastric bypass (GBP) or subsequently after significant weight reduction, usually 18 months after the GBP.

- **Method**: Over the last 8 years, 2,231 bariatric operations were performed at the center. A total of 577 panniculectomies were done, with 428 (74.2%) performed concurrently with the GBP, and 149 (25.8%) subsequent to the GBP.

- **Results**: The redundant pannus weighed between 5 to 54.5 kg. Wound problems occurred in 15.1% of panniculectomies, and transfusion was necessary in 1.9%. The hospital stay was 4 to 5 days and was no greater than in patients who underwent the GBP alone. Patients with grades 3–5 suffer more back pain and hygiene problems resulting from panniculitis.

- **Conclusion**: A very redundant panniculus compounds the patient's physical, social, and emotional problems. Where cardiopulmonary and other medical statuses are satisfactory, a panniculectomy may be offered to patients with a symptomatic panniculus at the time of bariatric surgery, as a physically beneficial and cost-effective adjuvant.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^113MCKJX]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for obesity, specifically in the choice of agent, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the following agents, in addition to lifestyle modifications, for adult patients with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications:

- **Semaglutide 2.4 mg**: An effective option for weight management alongside lifestyle changes.
- **Liraglutide 3.0 mg**: Another suitable agent to consider for weight-related issues.
- **Phentermine-topiramate extended-release**: Recommended for its efficacy in managing obesity.
- **Naltrexone-bupropion extended-release**: Useful for patients requiring pharmacological intervention.
- **Phentermine**: Suggested for short-term management of obesity.
- **Diethylpropion**: Considered for addressing weight-related complications.

### Diffuse granulomatous panniculitis associated with anti PD-1 antibody therapy [^112nvLbd]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Panniculitis, inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, is a relatively rare condition that is generally associated with infection, trauma, malignancy, or inflammatory states. The diagnosis of panniculitis can be difficult to make on physical examination, as the subcutaneous nodules or plaques can resemble other conditions, such as vasculitis or tumors. Although a presumptive diagnosis is frequently made clinically, histologic evaluation is required for a definitive diagnosis. Histologic assessment is especially valuable when malignant conditions, such as metastatic cancers or subcutaneous lymphomas, need to be excluded and distinguished from panniculitis, such as in our patient. Although the exact pathophysiology is unknown, panniculitis is generally considered a type IV delayed hypersensitivity cellular reaction primarily to viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other antigens. The reaction is lymphohistiocytic in part, and granuloma formation is a natural end product of a heightened cellular immune response.

In our case, the finding of the erythematous skin nodules showed a lobular, septal, and paraseptal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate that was overtly granulomatous in nature, with the presence of multinucleate histiocytes. The findings were reminiscent of those of erythema nodosum, the most common type of panniculitis, which typically involves inflammation of the septa in the subcutaneous tissue, usually without associated vasculitis. However, our sample involved lobular, septal, and paraseptal lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and was not limited to the septa.

### Insurance coverage criteria for panniculectomy and redundant skin surgery after bariatric surgery: why and when to discuss [^113CjUNP]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A dramatic increase in bariatric surgery has led to a rise in patients with redundant skin or a large panniculus following significant weight loss. This condition is best treated through surgery; however, not all patients with redundant skin or panniculus receive authorization from insurance providers. There are specific insurance coverage criteria for panniculectomy that patients must meet for approval. Our research indicated that there are no established criteria or guidelines for other body parts, such as the inner arms and thighs, aside from the pannus, among third-party payers. These cases are evaluated individually by third-party payers based on the presented signs and symptoms.

It is of utmost importance that members of a bariatric team are knowledgeable about these guidelines and should be able to discuss them if necessary. Currently used criteria should be discussed with patients, preferably in the pre-bariatric surgery phase, and ideally by a plastic surgeon. The advantages are several-fold, as discussed in the article.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, particularly concerning the assessment of obesity-related complications such as dyslipidemia, the AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for dyslipidemia with a lipid panel. This panel should include triglycerides, HDL-C, calculated LDL-C, total cholesterol, and non-HDL-C. It is advised for all patients with overweight or obesity, as well as patients experiencing progressive weight gain.

### Outcome study of the surgical management of panniculitis [^116FYR39]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with panniculus morbidus have an abdominal panniculus that becomes a pathologic entity, associated with the development of candidal intertrigo, dermatitis, lymphedema, and ischemic panniculitis. Panniculectomy is a standard treatment for this problem. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for complications associated with panniculectomy surgery to lower the complication rate.

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent panniculectomy between 1999 and 2007. We examined data related to surgical complications, comorbidities, age, and gender. In a cohort of 563 patients, we recorded the incidence of various complications, including:

- **Wound-related complications**: Infection, dehiscence, and/or necrosis
- **Hematoma/seroma**: Incidents involving blood or fluid accumulation
- **Respiratory distress**: Breathing difficulties
- **Blood transfusions**: Need for additional blood supply
- **Deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism**: Clot-related conditions
- **Death**: Mortality arising post-surgery

Overall, 34.3% of patients suffered at least one complication. In patients with wound complications specifically, there was a significantly higher body mass index compared to those with no wound complications (43.7% vs. 30.7%, P < 0.0001). Smokers also demonstrated a higher rate of wound complications (40.5% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.0001).
