## Question

What mechanisms lead to cough in patients with heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanisms leading to cough in patients with heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary hemodynamic driver in heart failure and its impact on the lungs. Then, I should evaluate how pulmonary congestion and edema stimulate airway afferents. Next, I will examine mechanical contributors such as airway compression, expiratory flow limitation, and posture. After that, I need to consider pleural effusions and trepopnea. I will also review iatrogenic contributors like ACE inhibitor–induced cough. Finally, I should integrate potential neurohormonal sensitization, positional patterns, and clinical correlations, and verify how guideline-directed therapies modify these pathways [^111YV25B] [^113ABCH6].

> Let me first confirm the primary pathophysiological driver: in heart failure, elevated left ventricular filling pressures are transmitted retrogradely to the pulmonary venous circulation, producing pulmonary venous hypertension that alters lung mechanics and gas exchange; this upstream hemodynamic load is the cornerstone from which downstream cough-triggering mechanisms arise [^115zGdp9] [^116p3fuF] [^116t1nWh].

> I need to check how congestion translates into cough at the receptor level; increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure drives interstitial and alveolar fluid accumulation, which distorts airway architecture and directly activates pulmonary C-fiber afferents and rapidly adapting irritant receptors, providing a potent tussigenic stimulus; clinically, this aligns with observational data in acute decompensated heart failure where approximately half of patients report cough, and with the frequent finding of pulmonary crackles when edema is present, which together reinforce the link between congestion and cough [^115zGdp9] [^114d8suT] [^116t1nWh].

> I will now examine mechanical airway effects; peribronchial and interstitial edema can narrow small airways and increase airflow resistance, particularly in the supine position, which both stimulates mechanoreceptors and promotes cough; seated patients with chronic left ventricular failure may show near-normal spirometry, yet moving supine yields a marked rise in total respiratory resistance (about 80% in one study), not fully explained by changes in lung volume and not clearly vagally mediated, as muscarinic blockade had minimal effect, suggesting edema-related airway deformation is key; in acute left heart failure, many patients develop supine expiratory flow limitation, and importantly, short-term treatment with vasodilators and diuretics reverses both expiratory flow limitation and orthopnea, supporting a causal role for congestion in mechanical airway dysfunction and cough, though I should note the small sample sizes and thus interpret with caution [^113ruU8c] [^11487nAp].

> Let me consider pleural effusions; heart failure commonly produces pleural effusions that can provoke cough via pleural mechanoreceptor irritation and adjacent parenchymal compression with atelectasis, and patients frequently adopt positional strategies to mitigate symptoms; a small emergency department study reported trepopnea in roughly half of decompensated heart failure patients with effusions, with a notable association to right-sided effusions, which could reflect avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position, although, wait, I should verify causality — this was an observational association and should be taken as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive proof of laterality mechanisms; nevertheless, pleural effusions plausibly contribute to cough in heart failure through mechanical and inflammatory pathways [^116p3fuF] [^113LqGR1] [^1156xNdu].

> Iatrogenic contributors must be separated from disease mechanisms; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause a persistent nonproductive cough due to impaired bradykinin degradation and related neuropeptidergic sensitization, and critically, this cough resolves after discontinuation, distinguishing it from congestion-driven cough; I initially considered quoting a prevalence range, but hold on, I should double-check — while various studies report wide ranges, the FDA label for fosinopril emphasizes the existence and reversibility of ACE inhibitor cough without specifying a precise rate, so the prudent, reference-anchored statement is that ACE inhibitor cough is a recognized class effect that must be considered and can confound attribution in heart failure [^117LM4Vx].

> Next, I should review neurohormonal modulation; heart failure is characterized by a hyperadrenergic state and systemic neurohormonal activation, which can lower cough thresholds and amplify afferent signaling; in parallel, congestion-related inflammatory mediators may sensitize airway nerves, mirroring concepts from chronic cough pathobiology involving peripheral and central neuronal dysregulation; while this is a mechanistic bridge rather than trial-level proof in heart failure, it provides a plausible link between the heart failure milieu and heightened cough reflex sensitivity, so I need to be explicit that this is inferential but biologically coherent [^116p3fuF] [^112GCyRn].

> Posture-related phenomena deserve explicit attention; orthopnea arises when lying supine increases venous return and pulmonary venous pressures, worsening congestion and thereby augmenting tussigenic stimuli in both the airways and pleura; expiratory flow limitation has been observed to emerge or worsen supine and improve with decongestion, but wait, let's not jump to conclusions — orthopnea is multifactorial, and studies also show that supine positioning increases respiratory muscle load and airway resistance while reducing compliance, with noninvasive ventilatory unloading promptly improving effort and dyspnea, indicating that mechanical and neuromuscular factors accompany congestion in driving positional symptoms and, by extension, cough [^11487nAp] [^115Zv4eB].

> I should integrate these strands into a clinically usable sequence; the path from heart failure to cough typically progresses from hemodynamics to mechanics to neurogenics: elevated left-sided filling pressures increase pulmonary venous pressures, leading to interstitial and alveolar edema with peribronchial fluid, airway narrowing, crackles, and pleural effusions; these mechanical changes and local mediators activate airway and pleural afferents and can produce expiratory flow limitation, particularly supine, while ACE inhibitor therapy may independently provoke cough via bradykinin accumulation; importantly, effective decongestion with diuretics and vasodilators improves these mechanisms and symptoms, and guideline recommendations to initiate diuretics for congestive heart failure symptom relief align with the observed reversal of expiratory flow limitation and orthopnea after decongestive therapy, which often attenuates cough as the central modifiable driver is addressed [^112AfYDC] [^115nirRQ] [^11487nAp].

> But wait, what if the cough is not from heart failure at all; I need to ensure diagnostic vigilance because chronic cough in adults most commonly reflects upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux, and heart failure is one of several important cardiovascular etiologies on the differential; a careful history, exam, and chest radiograph are foundational in chronic cough, and standard imaging guidance recommends chest X-ray as the initial study beyond eight weeks of cough, while in suspected heart failure, supportive findings include crackles, cardiomegaly, interstitial or alveolar edema, and pleural effusions, with biomarkers and echocardiography refining the diagnosis; I should confirm medication exposures, especially ACE inhibitors, before attributing cough solely to heart failure [^113ABCH6] [^112fGGXP] [^115ThUt5] [^116p3fuF].

Cough in heart failure is primarily caused by **pulmonary congestion and edema** [^115zGdp9] from elevated left-sided pressures [^116t1nWh], which irritate airway receptors and trigger the cough reflex [^116p3fuF]. Additional contributors include **pleural effusions** [^113LqGR1] causing pleural irritation [^1156xNdu], **bronchial hyperresponsiveness** from airway inflammation [^113V9MNm], and **ACE inhibitor-induced cough** via bradykinin accumulation [^117LM4Vx]. Management focuses on relieving congestion with diuretics and vasodilators [^112AfYDC], addressing pleural effusions, and switching ACE inhibitors if cough persists [^115GsoSY].

---

## Pulmonary congestion and edema

- **Elevated left-sided pressures**: In heart failure, elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures [^115zGdp9] cause fluid to leak into interstitial and alveolar spaces [^116p3fuF], leading to pulmonary congestion and edema [^116t1nWh].

- **Irritation of airway receptors**: Fluid accumulation irritates airway receptors, triggering the cough reflex [^1148Zbhq].

- **Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**: Pulmonary congestion worsens in the supine position [^113ruU8c], causing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, often accompanied by cough.

---

## Pleural effusions

Pleural effusions, common in heart failure, contribute to cough via **pleural irritation** — of the pleural lining and diaphragm, which stimulates the cough reflex — and via **trepopnea**, a positional symptom associated with pleural effusions that can provoke cough.

---

## Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation

In heart failure, **bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation** contribute to cough via increased mucus production and **bronchoconstriction**, both of which stimulate the cough reflex [^1148Zbhq].

---

## Medications associated with cough in heart failure

Among medications associated with cough in heart failure, **ACE inhibitors**, commonly used in heart failure management, can cause a persistent dry cough in approximately 5–20% of patients due to bradykinin accumulation [^117LM4Vx] [^115ThUt5]. **Beta-blockers** may cause bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, potentially contributing to cough.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Diuretics and vasodilators**: Diuretics and vasodilators [^113QkPqu] are effective in reducing pulmonary congestion and edema [^115nirRQ], thereby alleviating cough symptoms [^112AfYDC].

- **Pleural effusion management**: Therapeutic thoracentesis or pleurodesis may be necessary to manage pleural effusions and reduce cough.

- **Medication adjustment**: Switching from ACE inhibitors to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or other antihypertensive agents may be necessary if medication-induced cough persists [^115GsoSY].

---

Cough in heart failure is **primarily due to pulmonary congestion and edema** [^116t1nWh], with additional contributions from pleural effusions, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and medication side effects. Effective management involves addressing these underlying mechanisms through appropriate **medical therapy** and **medication adjustments**.

### Expiratory flow limitation is associated with orthopnea and reversed by vasodilators and diuretics in left heart failure [^11487nAp]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with acute left heart failure (LHF), orthopnea has also been related to the occurrence or worsening of expiratory flow limitation (EFL) in the supine position. We wished to assess whether short-term treatment with vasodilators and diuretics was able to abolish supine EFL and whether this could help to control orthopnea in patients with acute LHF.

- **Methods**: In nine nonobese patients (mean body mass index, 24 ± 5 kg/m²), who were never-smokers (two men and seven women; mean age, 77 ± 7 years) with acute LHF (mean ejection fraction, 43 ± 15%), we assessed EFL by the negative expiratory pressure method and dyspnea by the Borg scale. Measurements were taken with patients in both the seated and supine positions before and after short-term treatment with vasodilators and diuretics until hospital discharge. Orthopnea was defined as a positive difference in the Borg score between measurements made with the patient in the supine and seated positions. Postural variations in the end-expiratory lung volume were inferred from changes in inspiratory capacity (IC) that were measured under the same circumstances.

- **Results**: Before treatment, with the patient in the seated position, the mean dyspnea score was 1.5 ± 0.5, the mean IC was 1.49 ± 0.38 L, seven patients were non-flow-limited, and two patients were flow-limited. During recumbency, the mean dyspnea score was 2.7 ± 0.5 (p < 0.01 vs. seated position values), the mean IC was 1.66 ± 0.45 L, and seven patients exhibited EFL. After a mean duration of 17 ± 8 days of treatment (range, 7 to 28 days), EFL was detected in two.

### Congestive heart failure: Diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^116p3fuF]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history, physical examination, and characteristic chest radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis.

Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and the slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

### The pulmonary manifestations of left heart failure [^115zGdp9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Determining whether a patient's symptoms are the result of heart or lung disease requires an understanding of the influence of pulmonary venous hypertension on lung function. Herein, we describe the effects of acute and chronic elevations of pulmonary venous pressure on the mechanical and gas-exchanging properties of the lung. The mechanisms responsible for various symptoms of congestive heart failure are described, and the significance of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart disease is considered. While the initial clinical evaluation of patients with dyspnea is imprecise, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide levels may prove useful in this setting.

### Fosinopril sodium [^117LM4Vx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, and it always resolves after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

- **Impaired liver function**: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study involving patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased, and the plasma AUC was approximately doubled.

- **Surgery/anesthesia**: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

- **Hemodialysis**: Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g. AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).

### Trepopnea may explain right-sided pleural effusion in patients with decompensated heart failure [^113LqGR1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Physicians often overlook trepopnea as a symptom, and its prevalence and clinical repercussions are not usually described. We propose that trepopnea is a common symptom in heart failure (HF) and, because of patient avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position, contributes to the greater prevalence of right-sided pleural effusion in patients with HF. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine trepopnea prevalence and evaluate the association of trepopnea with the laterality of pleural effusion in decompensated HF.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients (n = 37) with decompensated HF and evidence of pleural effusion by chest x-ray were included. Data were collected at the emergency department through a standard clinical examination in which patients were specifically asked about the presence of trepopnea and preferred decubitus position while recumbent. Chest x-ray and echocardiographic parameters were recorded.

- **Results**: Of the 37 patients, 19 (51%) reported trepopnea. Most patients presented with right-sided pleural effusion; only 2 patients (5.4%) presented with left-sided pleural effusion. Patients who reported trepopnea had predominant right-sided pleural effusion more frequently than patients without this symptom (73.7% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.049). Participants who reported trepopnea or avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position while recumbent — or both — had a greater probability of having predominant right-sided pleural effusion (likelihood ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.35).

- **Conclusions**: Trepopnea is a common symptom in patients with decompensated HF.

For the medical management of heart failure, particularly concerning diuretics, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend initiating diuretics in patients with HFrEF. This approach aims to improve symptoms of pulmonary congestion, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the rate of heart failure readmissions.

### Origin of symptoms in chronic heart failure [^113brE5u]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle abnormalities are highly prevalent in chronic heart failure and are associated with an increase in the ergoreflex, a muscle reflex stimulated by work done. Stimulation of the ergoreflex results in increased ventilation and contributes to the increased sympathetic activation of the heart failure syndrome. The origin of the skeletal myopathy is related to a chronic imbalance between catabolic and anabolic processes, presumably as a consequence of chronic haemodynamic stress. Symptoms arise from the skeletal myopathy, causing the sensation of fatigue and contributing to the sensation of breathlessness as the myopathy affects respiratory muscle. Ergoreflex activation causes a greater ventilatory response to exercise than normal, contributing to the sensation of breathlessness.

### Value of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and medications in prospective population studies of incident heart failure [^111k1iKp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Prospective population studies of incident heart failure (HF) are often limited by difficulties in assembling HF-free cohorts. In this study, public-use copies of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) data sets were used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), with and without the use of medications used in CHS HF criteria — specifically, diuretics plus digoxin or vasodilators — in the diagnosis of prevalent HF and in the assembly of a relatively HF-free population.

Of the 5,771 community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 65 years, the findings include:

- **Orthopnea and PND patients**: 803 had orthopnea, 660 had PND, 1,075 had either symptom, and 388 had both symptoms.
- **HF medication usage**: 547 were using HF medications, while 4,315 had neither symptom nor were using HF medications.
- **Definite HF**: This condition was centrally adjudicated in 272 participants.

- **Study results**: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for either orthopnea or PND were 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46% to 58%), 83% (95% CI 82% to 84%), 13% (95% CI 11% to 15%), and 97% (95% CI 97% to 98%), respectively. When considering either orthopnea, PND, or the use of HF medications, the values were 77% (95% CI 72% to 82%), 77% (95% CI 76% to 79%), 14% (95% CI 13% to 16%), and 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%), respectively.

In conclusion, less than 20% of those with either orthopnea or PND had definite HF, which limits their usefulness in the diagnosis of prevalent HF in the community. However, the negative predictive value was nearly 99% for those with neither symptom nor using HF medications, making it a potentially useful criterion in identifying individuals without HF.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: A systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^114dutDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies. Based on the PRISMA statement (see Additional File 1) and the recommendations of Donner-Banzhoff et al, methods were pre-specified in a protocol. Our working group applied the same methods to abdominal pain, tiredness, chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnoea.

- **Data sources and search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE in June 2012 and updated our search in 2019. We also searched EMBASE in January 2015 and updated it in 2020. The reference lists of all relevant papers were screened using a snowball search. Our search was limited to publications in English, French, and German. The search syntax included the term "cough" in various forms in the title/abstract or as a MeSH Term, and the term "primary care" in multiple formats in the title/abstract, as a mailing address, in the authors' institute name, or as a MeSH Term, or in journals representing primary care research. We searched for general practice/family medicine, as well as pediatric primary care. For the complete search syntax, see Additional File 2.

- **Study selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria**: We initially screened titles and abstracts to ensure (1) they were original research articles, (2) the study setting was primary care, and (3) "cough" was a reason for the encounter, either primary or secondary. The full-text publications were assessed using the above criteria plus (4) an unselected study population concerning the likelihood of the underlying aetiology, and (5) availability of data on incidence, prevalence, underlying diagnoses, or prognosis of cough.

### Complications of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115rZyop]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review the spectrum and frequency of complications associated with coughing, an Ovid MEDLINE literature review was conducted. This review covered studies published in the English language, including case series and case reports, from 1966 through March 2004, using the MeSH terms "cough" and "complications".

The complications of cough appear to stem from physiological events. The magnitude of pressures, velocities, and energy generated during vigorous coughing make it an effective means of clearing the airways of excessive secretions and foreign material, and providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, these same forces can cause a variety of profound physical and psychosocial complications. Adverse occurrences include cardiovascular, constitutional, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, neurologic, ophthalmologic, psychosocial, respiratory, and skin complications, along with a decrease in health-related quality of life.

Knowledge of the spectrum of complications should enable clinicians to appreciate several critical aspects: the impact of cough on patients, the importance of exhausting all possible diagnostic and therapeutic options to eliminate cough, and the inappropriateness of minimizing a patient's complaint of cough or advising them to "live with it".

### Therapeutic and mechanistic advances in chronic cough [^112NbbbN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care in the outpatient setting. Chronic cough (CC) in adults is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, with a global prevalence of approximately 10%. CC significantly impairs quality of life, affecting physical, social, and psychological well-being. In most cases, CC is attributed to one or more of the following three key conditions: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis — assuming a normal chest X-ray result and no use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If the cough persists despite thorough guideline-based evaluation and treatment, it is classified as refractory CC (RCC).

RCC is thought to arise from neuronal dysregulation involving both peripheral and central mechanisms, termed cough hypersensitivity syndrome. This is typically characterized by a tickle or itch sensation in the throat, leading to an urge to cough in response to seemingly harmless stimuli. Treatment options for RCC include "off-label" use of centrally acting neuromodulators and speech therapy. In addition, a new peripherally acting oral P2×3 receptor antagonist, gefapixant, has been approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan, though not in the United States or Canada. Emerging treatments hold promise for improving management in the future.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^115GsoSY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The initial evaluation of a patient with chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks, should include a focused history and physical examination. In most patients, chest radiography is also recommended. Patients who are taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should switch to a medication from another drug class.

The most common causes of chronic cough in adults are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, alone or in combination. If upper airway cough syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed based on clinical response to empiric therapy with inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Empiric treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease should be initiated, instead of testing, for patients with chronic cough and reflux symptoms. It is advised that patients avoid exposure to cough-evoking irritants, such as cigarette smoke.

Further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography, and referral to a pulmonologist may be indicated if the cause of chronic cough is not identified. In children, a cough lasting longer than four weeks is considered chronic. The most common causes in children are respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Evaluation of children with chronic cough should include chest radiography and spirometry.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: An official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^111iG4RH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Additional considerations include the committee's discussion on the nonspecific nature of cough and dyspnea, which may also be attributed to other causes such as cardiac issues, asthma, and postnasal drainage. This is especially relevant among individuals with relatively minor radiological abnormalities. It is crucial to evaluate alternative explanations for these symptoms. Furthermore, interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) may be associated with other symptoms such as fatigue; however, cough and dyspnea are considered the most common.

The committee did not provide specific recommendations on measuring symptoms. Studies have utilized various instruments, including visual analogue scales, numerical scales for cough and dyspnea assessment, and more extensive questionnaires. The committee acknowledges that the burden of symptom assessment in individuals with ILAs may fall on primary care providers. The type and extent of symptom assessment will depend on the local standard of care and availability of resources.

The committee did not specifically address the physical examination. Nevertheless, the presence or absence of inspiratory crackles on auscultation can aid in the early identification of ILD and should ideally be documented alongside symptom assessment.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about the management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treating these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care.

Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex and jeopardizing the development of improved treatments. We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough.

We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### Postoperative exacerbated cough hypersensitivity syndrome induces dramatic respiratory alkalosis, lactatemia, and electrolyte imbalance [^114z4WLy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024).

While a wide range of well-established drug therapy options exist for acute cough management, particularly for post-extubation cough, limited research has been conducted on perioperative management in patients with chronic cough. Intravenous lidocaine administration is effective for reducing "post-extubation cough". In the present case, the existing lidocaine inhalation was continued only postoperatively. Theoretically, it might have been possible to apply lidocaine in a nebulized form via tubus right before extubation or in alkalized form in the block cuff of a tracheal tube, which could help to reduce coughing after extubation, but, at least in theory, can increase the risk of aspiration. Other data suggest that the combination of a low-dose propofol (0.25 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.15 mg/kg) shortly before extubation may reduce the incidence of "post-extubation cough". Further, continuous administration of remifentanil or a bolus of dexmedetomidine (0.5 mcg/kg) 10 minutes before extubation could be valuable therapy options. In retrospect, intravenous lidocaine and an earlier extension of the described drug therapy options might have been effective. Aggressive treatment of "post-extubation cough" seems reasonable in view of the described effects on the acid/base-associated increase in intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, hemodynamic effects, and consecutive risk of bleeding. Finally, severe cardiac arrhythmia, which can lead to cardiac arrest, is also mentioned in the literature. Video laryngoscopy appears to be ideal for reducing excessive laryngeal pressure.

Among other possible causes, chronic cough can be caused by a variety of conditions:

- **Respiratory disorders**: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, interstitial lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, diffuse panbronchiolitis, tracheobronchomalacia

- **Allergic and sinus conditions**: allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic sinusitis

- **Environmental and lifestyle factors**: tobacco use, passive smoking

- **Infectious diseases**: whooping cough, Mycobacterium avium complex disease, lung abscess, paragonimiasis

- **Other medical conditions**:

- **Cardiovascular**: heart failure
- **Pulmonary diseases**: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, asbestosis, silicosis, coal worker pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis
- **Sleep-related and gastrointestinal**: obstructive sleep apnea, esophageal diverticulum
- **Oncological and functional disorders**: Hodgkin's lymphoma, vocal cord dysfunction

In addition, chronic cough can be caused by medications such as sitagliptin.

### Are otolaryngologists seeing more cough? Longitudinal trends and patterns [^115sFBAQ]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Cough is a very common chief complaint in outpatient medicine. While typically self-limited and benign, it can significantly affect quality of life and has been found to be the most frequent ambulatory visit complaint across all ages in the United States.

Acute cough, lasting less than three weeks, is most commonly caused by upper respiratory infection. Subacute cough, lasting three to eight weeks, could indicate a lingering infection or postinfectious inflammation such as postviral bronchitis. Cough persisting over eight weeks is classified as chronic and warrants further investigation; common etiologies for chronic cough include benign conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, and allergies. However, chronic cough can also be a sign of more serious underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or malignancy. Understanding the nuances of cough characterization allows clinicians to direct patients appropriately within the spectrum of medical specialties, if specialist management is needed.

- **Broadened differential diagnosis**: This broad differential diagnosis is likely related to the wide range of medical and surgical specialties involved in cough evaluation and management, including primary care, pulmonology, gastroenterology, neurology, and otolaryngology. Otolaryngologist evaluation, in particular, has been recommended in prior studies to treat complex etiologies of cough, such as those rooted in neurogenic or rhinologic processes. However, the care of most patients with cough likely does not require the relatively high-cost and procedure-intensive involvement of a specialist.

### Orthopnea and inspiratory effort in chronic heart failure patients [^115Zv4eB]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Orthopnea is a typical feature of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF); however, the factors contributing to it are not completely understood. We investigated changes in dyspnea and other respiratory variables induced by altering posture (from sitting to supine) in 11 CHF patients (NYHA classes II-IV) and 10 control subjects.

- **Methods and results**: We measured dyspnea using the Borg scale, the diaphragm pressure time product per minute (PTPdi/min, index of metabolic consumption), and mechanical properties of the lung such as lung compliance (C, L) and resistances (R, L). CHF patients also underwent a trial of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) in the supine position to ascertain whether unloading the inspiratory muscles could relieve dyspnea. While sitting, the PTPdi/min was significantly higher in CHF patients compared to controls (181 ± 54 cm H2O x s/min vs. 96 ± 32; P < 0.05). Assuming a supine position caused no major changes in controls, whereas CHF patients showed a significant worsening in dyspnea. There was a rise in PTPdi/min (243 ± 97, P < 0.01) and R, L (4.7 ± 1.2 cm H2O/L x s sitting vs. 7.9 ± 2.5 supine; P < 0.01) and a decrease in C, L (0.08 ± 0.02 L/cm H2O sitting vs. 0.07 ± 0.01 supine; P < 0.05). Applying NIMV to supine CHF patients significantly reduced the PTPdi/min to 81 ± 42 (P < 0.001). Changes in dyspnea, produced by varying position or applying NIMV, were significantly correlated with PTPdi/min (r = 0.80, P < 0.005 and r = 0.58, P < 0.01, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: CHF patients had a higher PTPdi/min than controls when sitting, and assuming a supine position indicated significant changes.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^113V9MNm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. Airflow limitation may later become persistent.

Asthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are not necessary or sufficient for diagnosis. Clinical phenotypes, such as childhood onset versus late onset, and allergic versus nonallergic, do not strongly correlate with specific pathological processes or treatment responses.

The diagnosis of asthma is based on a history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation obtained from bronchodilator reversibility testing or from other tests, such as a positive bronchial provocation test result, excessive variability during PEF monitoring, excessive variation in FEV1 between visits, or a significant increase in FEV1 after ICS treatment. Explain to patients that often, more than one of these tests is needed. Evidence for the diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed before starting controller treatment, if possible, to avoid inappropriate treatment or missing other important diagnoses and because diagnosis is often more difficult later. Results from clinical examination, including chest auscultation, may be completely normal.

The concentration of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (F NO) is higher in asthma associated with type 2 airway inflammation.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^112GCyRn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks, is a common medical condition with a global prevalence of approximately 10% and a higher prevalence in Oceania, Europe, and the United States. The burden of CC can be severe, as patients experience substantial physical effects (e.g. stress urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, and chest pain), psychological consequences (e.g. frustration, anxiety, and depression), and social impairments (e.g. social distress/isolation and inability to carry out daily activities), leading to a reduced quality of life. Moreover, the burden of CC is often long-lasting, as some patients experience symptoms that persist for several years despite numerous doctor visits, empirical treatment trials, and frequent medical testing.

### Symptom presentation in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure [^114d8suT]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to examine the type and frequency of symptoms in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (HF), as well as the relationship between symptom patterns and patient characteristics, treatment practices, and hospital outcomes in patients hospitalized with decompensated HF.

The study sample consisted of 4,537 residents of the Worcester, MA metropolitan area hospitalized for decompensated HF at 11 greater Worcester medical centers in 1995 and 2000.

The average age of the study sample was 76 years; the majority (57%) were women, and three-quarters of the patient population had been previously diagnosed with HF. Dyspnea (93%) was the most frequent complaint reported by patients, followed by the presence of peripheral edema (70%), cough (51%), orthopnea (37%), and chest pain/discomfort (30%). Patients reporting few cardiac symptoms were less likely to be treated with effective cardiac therapies during hospitalization than patients with multiple cardiac signs and symptoms and experienced higher hospital (9.7% vs. 7.7%) as well as 30-day (17.1% vs. 10.2%) death rates (P < 0.05).

The results of this study in residents of a large New England community suggest that patients with fewer reported symptoms of decompensated HF were less likely to receive effective cardiac treatments and had worse short-term outcomes. Reasons for these differences in treatment practices and short-term outcomes need to be elucidated and attention directed to these high-risk patients.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to acute decompensated heart failure [^116t1nWh]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Physical exam findings include pulmonary crackles in the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; peripheral edema; ascites; elevated jugular venous distension; abdominojugular or hepatojugular reflux; a third heart sound; and worsening mitral or tricuspid regurgitation murmurs. Signs of end-organ dysfunction secondary to congestion include aforementioned pulmonary edema, gastrointestinal edema, hepatocellular damage, and cardiorenal syndrome. Additionally, in the presence of decreased cardiac output, reduced organ perfusion can contribute to end-organ damage. Increased ventricular pressures and neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms to augment chronotropy and inotropy can trigger tachycardia, arrhythmias, and increased myocardial strain and ischemia.

- **Pathophysiology of ADHF**: The pathophysiology of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is pleiotropic and dependent on several factors, including the degree of systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction, the relative involvement of the right and left ventricles, arterial and venous vascular tone, neurohormonal and inflammatory activation state, and comorbid contributing influences. Further complicating the standardization of ADHF management is the difference between the underlying substrate and pathophysiology of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The central defect in HFrEF can be readily conceptualized as reduced systolic function with resultant increases in left ventricular filling pressures and diastolic dysfunction, producing increased pulmonary venous pressures and congestion, often resulting in right heart failure and peripheral signs of congestion.

### Premature ventricular complex-induced chronic cough and cough syncope [^113c6Sz6]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007).

The present case study reports a case of chronic cough and cough syncope associated with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG monitoring led to the suspicion of PVC-induced cough. A coincidence between PVCs and episodes of cough was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. After the exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic cough and cough syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. Premature ventricular complexes should be considered as a cause of chronic cough and cough syncope; interdisciplinary cooperation can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Oseni [^114s1CJT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Congestive heart failure: Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Instruct patients who experience an unusually rapid increase in weight, edema, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of heart failure while on Oseni to immediately report these symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Pancreatitis: Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during the use of Oseni. Educate patients that persistent, severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue Oseni and contact their healthcare provider if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypersensitivity reactions: Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported during the use of Oseni. Instruct patients that if symptoms of allergic reactions (including skin rash, hives, and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing) occur, they should discontinue Oseni and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Hepatic effects: Instruct patients to promptly stop taking Oseni and seek immediate medical advice if they experience signs or symptoms of liver injury (e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or dark urine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Edema: Inform patients that Oseni use can lead to the new-onset or worsening of edema. Instruct patients to immediately report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: Part 2. Demographic and clinical considerations: CHEST expert panel report [^1148Zbhq]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Cough characteristics vary between patients, and this can impact clinical diagnosis and care. The purpose of part two of this state-of-the-art review is to update the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on the global physiology and pathophysiology of cough.

- **Study design and methods**: A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and MEDLINE databases from 1951 to 2019 using prespecified search terms.

- **Results**: We describe the demographics of typical patients with cough in the clinical setting, including how cough characteristics change across age. We summarize the effect of common clinical conditions impacting cough mechanics and the physical properties of mucus on airway clearance.

- **Interpretation**: This is the second of a two-part update to the 2006 CHEST cough guideline; it complements part one on the basic phenomenology of cough by providing an extended clinical picture of cough along with the factors that alter cough mechanics and efficiency in patients. A greater understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of cough will improve clinical management.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation.

In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent, and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^115ThUt5]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic cough:

- **Definition**: Chronic cough is defined as a cough symptom that persists for longer than 8 weeks.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of cough include upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

- **Disease course**: Cough persistence may lead to vomiting, muscle pain, urinary incontinence, tiredness, syncope, and depression.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic cough is not associated with an increase in mortality in the absence of a serious underlying disease.

### Heart failure in patients with preserved and deteriorated left ventricular ejection fraction [^111Uzzde]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

To determine clinical and prognostic differences between preserved and deteriorated systolic function (defined as left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions ≥ 50% and < 50%, respectively) in patients with heart failure satisfying modified Framingham criteria, records were studied of 1252 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) (mean age 69.4 (SD 11.7) years; 485 women, 767 men). These patients had been admitted to a cardiology service for CHF between 1991 and 2002 and had their LV systolic function echocardiographically evaluated within two weeks of admission. Data were collected on clinical findings, supplementary examinations, treatment, and duration of hospitalization. Whether the patient was alive in the spring of 2003 was evaluated by searching the general archives of the hospital and conducting a telephone survey.

LV systolic function was preserved in 39.8% of patients. Age, female to male sex ratio, and prevalence of atrial fibrillation, valve disease, and other non-ischaemic, non-dilated cardiopathies were all significantly greater in the group with preserved systolic function. Conversely, the New York Heart Association functional class IV, third heart sound, jugular vein congestion, cardiomegaly, radiological signs of lung oedema, pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block, sinus rhythm, ischaemic cardiopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy were all significantly more prevalent in the group with deteriorated systolic function, as was treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and most other antihypertensive drugs.

### The right heart and its distinct mechanisms of development, function, and failure [^116LVsMn]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2008). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for people over the age of sixty-five. As the population ages, the morbidity and mortality from heart failure will become more prevalent. Left heart failure has been, and continues to be, extensively studied. However, a recent report from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute suggests that the right heart has been relatively under-investigated, and unfortunately, most of the basic mechanisms of intracellular signaling within the right heart still remain poorly understood.

Right heart failure is now being increasingly recognized as distinctly different from left heart failure, and an important mediator of overall cardiovascular collapse. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to discuss the understanding of right heart cellular development, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as to review therapeutic interventions that are both currently available and under investigation.

### The relationship between psychogenic cough and the diagnosis and misdiagnosis of asthma: a review [^112PvSyT]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnoses of persistent nonproductive cough include numerous pulmonary and nonpulmonary organic disorders as well as functional illnesses. Many diseases can cause cough, and several studies have shown asthma to be among the most common etiologies associated with chronic cough in adult nonsmokers, as well as children. Psychogenic cough and its relationship to asthma and other asthma-like illnesses is complex since distinct maladies with similar features may coexist individually or in combination in any given patient.

While chronic cough may occur as a sole presenting manifestation of bronchial asthma in all age groups, recent findings suggest that most children with persistent cough without other respiratory symptoms do not have asthma. Since several organic as well as functional diseases may present with persistent cough as their sole manifestation in either adults or children, cough should not be used as a single or major determinant to diagnose and treat asthma, especially when empirically focused therapy trials fail. Given the range of illnesses causing cough, no single management guideline can be expected to be universally effective.

### The role of vagal afferent nerves in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1145iF6u]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that the vagal nervous system is dysregulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This dysregulation can lead to an increased sensitivity of the cough reflex, such that coughing becomes, at times, "nonproductive" or inappropriate. Vagal dysregulation can also lead to an increase in the activity of the parasympathetic reflex control of the airways, contributing to greater mucus secretion and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Indirect evidence indicates that lung disease is accompanied by substantive changes to the entire reflex pathways, including enhanced activity of the primary afferent nerves, increases in synaptic efficacy at secondary nerves in the central nervous system, and changes in the autonomic nerve pathways. Drugs aimed at normalizing neuronal activity may, therefore, be beneficial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Crackle pitch and rate do not vary significantly during a single automated-auscultation session in patients with pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis [^111urYGz]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the variability of crackle pitch and crackle rate during a single automated-auscultation session, a computerized 16-channel lung-sound analyzer was used.

Forty-nine patients with pneumonia, 52 with congestive heart failure (CHF), and 18 with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) performed breathing maneuvers in the following sequence: normal breathing, deep breathing, coughing several times; deep breathing, vital-capacity maneuver, and deep breathing. From the auscultation recordings, the crackle pitch and crackle rate were measured.

Crackle pitch variability, expressed as a percentage of the average crackle pitch, was small across all patients and maneuvers: pneumonia 11%, CHF 11%, and pulmonary fibrosis 7%. Crackle rate variability was also minimal: pneumonia 31%, CHF 32%, and IPF 24%. Compared to the first deep-breathing maneuver (100%), the average crackle pitch did not significantly change following coughing (pneumonia 100%, CHF 103%, IPF 100%), the vital-capacity maneuver (pneumonia 100%, CHF 92%, IPF 104%), or during quiet breathing (pneumonia 97%, CHF 100%, IPF 104%). Similarly, the average crackle rate did not change significantly following coughing (pneumonia 105%, CHF 110%, IPF 90%) or the vital-capacity maneuver (pneumonia 102%, CHF 101%, IPF 99%).

However, during normal breathing, the crackle rate was significantly lower in the patients with pneumonia (74%, P < .001) and significantly higher in the patients with IPF (147%, P < .05) than it was during deep breathing. In patients with CHF, the average crackle rate during normal breathing was not provided in the data.

### Misconceptions and facts about 'diastolic' heart failure [^115wyspw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction has become a fashionable diagnosis. An increasing number of elderly patients with dyspnea carry this diagnosis. Evaluation and management of these patients, typically labeled as having "diastolic" heart failure, are challenging, and misconceptions are common. No drug class has been shown to consistently provide outcome benefits. Therapeutic strategies based on the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism and stage of the disease currently remain the best option in tackling the perplexing syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Due to the sensitive nature of voice recordings, only processed data can be made available.

- **Study design and population**: Patients admitted to the University Hospital Basel because of acute heart failure (AHF) were enrolled between March 2020 and May 2021. Patients with AHF had either preexisting heart failure or new‐onset heart failure and were included within 48 hours after admission if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AHF was defined as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, or weight gain.

- **Additional criteria**: At least one of the following parameters had to be fulfilled:
	- **Signs with high specificity of AHF**: bilateral pulmonary rales, peripheral edema, jugular vein dilatation, and positive hepatojugular reflux.
	- **NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) levels**: > 450 pg/mL if age < 50 years, > 900 pg/mL if age 50 to 75 years, > 1800 pg/mL if age > 75 years (cutoffs should be reduced by 50% in case of severe obesity, body mass index > 35 kg/m²).
	- Treatment with intravenous furosemide or increased doses of oral diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, or metolazone within 24 hours of presentation.
	- **Radiological features with high specificity for AHF**: interstitial or alveolar edema with or without bilateral pleural effusion.

### Why does chronic heart failure cause breathlessness and fatigue [^114YfALB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Traditional explanations for the symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness experienced by patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) focus on how reduced cardiac output during exercise leads to impaired skeletal muscle blood supply, thus causing fatigue, and on how the requirement for a raised left ventricular filling pressure to maintain cardiac output results in reduced pulmonary diffusion owing to interstitial edema, thus causing breathlessness. However, indices of left ventricular function relate poorly to exercise capacity and symptoms, suggesting that the origin of symptoms may lie elsewhere.

There is a specific heart failure myopathy that is present early in the condition, which may contribute largely to the sensation of fatigue. Receptors in skeletal muscle sensitive to work (ergoreceptors) are overactive in patients with CHF, presumably as a consequence of the myopathy, and their activity is related both to the ventilatory response to exercise and breathlessness, and to the sympathetic overactivity of CHF. In this paper, we review the systemic consequences of left ventricular dysfunction to understand how they relate to the symptoms of heart failure.

### Cough syncope [^1158ysRh]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Loss of consciousness following a cough was first described in 1876 as "laryngeal vertigo". Since then, several hundred cases of what is now most commonly termed cough syncope have been reported, often in association with various medical conditions. Some early authors assumed this entity to be a form of epilepsy, but by the mid-20th century, the general consensus was that post-tussive syncope was a consequence of markedly elevated intrathoracic pressures induced by coughing.

A typical profile of the cough syncope patient emerging from the literature is that of a middle-aged, large-framed, or overweight male with obstructive airways disease. Presumably, such an individual would be more likely to generate the extremely high intrathoracic pressures associated with cough-induced fainting.

The precise mechanism of cough syncope remains a matter of debate. Theories proposed include various consequences of the marked elevation of intrathoracic pressures induced by coughing:

- **Diminished cardiac output**: This causes decreased systemic blood pressure and, consequently, cerebral hypoperfusion.
- **Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure**: This results in increased extravascular pressure around cranial vessels, leading to diminished brain perfusion.
- **Cerebral concussion-like effect**: This results from a rapid rise in CSF pressure.

More recent mechanistic studies suggest a neurally mediated reflex vasodepressor-bradycardia response to cough. Since loss of consciousness is a direct and immediate result of the cough, elimination of cough will eliminate the resultant syncopal episodes. Thus, the approach to the patient…

### Benefits of tolvaptan on early dyspnea relief in patients with acute heart failure: A meta-analysis [^111nkbyR]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

- **Methods**: This meta-analysis was designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published up to July 2021.

- **Study selection**: To be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, studies had to meet the following criteria: (a) include patients aged over 18 years with acute heart failure (AHF) and dyspnea, and at least one additional sign or symptom of congestion such as orthopnea, edema, jugular venous distention, ascites, pleural effusion, rales, or congestion on chest radiograph; (b) use a randomized controlled design to compare tolvaptan with placebo or blank; and (c) provide information on early dyspnea relief by a 7-point Likert scale. Studies were excluded if they included patients with: (a) hypotension (systolic blood pressure below 3.5 mg/dl or requiring renal replacement therapy); or (b) acute coronary syndrome on admission. The search strings used were "tolvaptan" AND "heart failure". Reference lists of any relevant review articles were also screened to identify studies that were potentially missed in this search. Our study selection process did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Two reviewers independently screened articles according to the inclusion criteria. The reviewers compared selected studies, and differences were resolved by consensus.

### Unexplained (idiopathic) cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1142fp6n]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the literature on unexplained cough, previously referred to as idiopathic cough.

- **Methods**: A search of MEDLINE (through May 2004) was conducted for studies published in the English language since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "unexplained cough", and "idiopathic cough". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected. Additionally, any references from these studies pertinent to the topic were obtained.

- **Results**: The diagnosis of unexplained (idiopathic) cough should only be considered following a thorough diagnostic and treatment approach for the most common causes of cough has been completed and uncommon causes have been adequately evaluated. Unless this is done, it is likely that many patients with a definable cause of cough will be misdiagnosed as having "unexplained cough".

- **Conclusion**: The diagnosis of unexplained cough is probably made too often based on an inadequate diagnostic workup or treatment course to determine the specific cause of cough. Nevertheless, there may be a group of patients in whom none of the usual explanations for cough may be present. For this group, the committee unanimously recommends using the diagnostic term unexplained cough, rather than idiopathic cough.

### Energetic basis for exercise-induced pulmonary congestion in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116bZ71E]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Although patients in this study had a preserved LVEF at rest, there was a markedly abnormal left heart response to low-intensity exercise, characterized by lower peak LV diastolic filling rates, blunted LV contractile reserve, and LA dilatation. We observed clear links between impaired cardiac energetics and this abnormal response to exercise. Lower cardiac energetics were related to lower peak LV filling rates, lower LV diastolic reserve, and LA dilatation during exercise, consistent with higher LA pressure in those with an underlying energetic deficit. It follows that if LA pressure is higher, then pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure is also higher, predisposing to pulmonary congestion through Starling forces and thus impairing pulmonary gas exchange.

The association between exercise-induced high left heart filling pressures and symptoms is well described in HFpEF, but is less clear in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We speculate that the key hemodynamic differences between HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction include a more profound impairment of cardiac output reserve, which may result in tissue or skeletal muscle hypoperfusion, leading to effort intolerance and activation of central feedback pathways, resulting in dyspnea. We also speculate that the right heart and systemic venous responses to exercise may be more profoundly dysfunctional in HFpEF than heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, resulting in and compounding greater fluid transudation for a given pulmonary pressure.

### Cough duration, energy and sound frequency in COVID-19 patients: The spectral analysis results [^113SNPzR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated that cough in COVID-19 patients and induced cough in control volunteers differ in time-frequency parameters, which may be of some importance in the differential diagnosis of cough. The most significant indicators for diagnosis are those of the second phase of cough sounds, as this phase corresponds to the passage of air through the respiratory tract. Cough in COVID-19 is characterized by a shorter duration and a predominance of higher frequencies compared with induced cough in control individuals. Regarding Q and Q2, this can be explained by the presence of edema of the lower respiratory tract walls, elements of bronchospasm, and/or excessive mucus production.

In addition, significant differences were found in some time-frequency parameters of cough sounds in asthma and COPD patients compared with COVID-19 patients, based on which the differentiation of COVID-19 and these highly common diseases of the respiratory tract is possible.

Recently, attempts have been made to analyze the various characteristics of cough in patients with various respiratory diseases. Rudraraju et al. described the features of cough sounds in normal conditions and in various respiratory diseases, which they combined into groups: obstruction - narrowed (asthma, bronchitis) and dilated (COPD) airways; and restriction - interstitial lung disease and fluid-filled (pneumonia). In addition, the study compared the obtained audiograms of cough sounds with spirometry data and the clinical picture. The main goal of the study was to use machine learning to predict the na…

### A register-based study: Cough - a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^111pePCo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cough is one of the most common reasons for contact with the primary health sector. It may be present as an acute, subacute, or chronic condition, where the latter may be very disturbing for patients and difficult to treat for medical staff.

Coughing is a normal physiological process; it is a protective reflex that clears debris and secretions from the airways. The cough reflex consists of an afferent sensory limb and the central processing center, activating the efferent limb. The afferent nerves involved are the vagal nerve and its sensory branches. These important sensory nerves are found from the pharynx to the terminal bronchioles; most are located in the larynx, carina, and bifurcation of the larger bronchi. The signal that irritants are present in the bronchial system is mediated to the cough center in the brainstem. The efferent pathways are then mediated back to the respiratory tract through the vagal, phrenic, and spinal motor nerves. This causes activity in the respiratory muscles, with the closure of the vocal cords and activation of the bronchial smooth muscles.

This mechanism is present in cough as a protective mechanism, in cough as a symptom of underlying conditions, and as a reflex that has become dysregulated. Chronic cough is often, but not always, associated with different comorbidities both in the respiratory area and outside the thorax. The most common underlying conditions in patients with chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome, chronic eosinophilic bronchitis, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

### Effect of supine posture on respiratory mechanics in chronic left ventricular failure [^113ruU8c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of orthopnea and the role of changes in respiratory mechanics in left ventricular failure (LVF) are poorly understood. We have measured total respiratory airflow resistance (Rrs) using forced oscillation in the sitting and supine positions in 10 patients with chronic LVF (NYHA II-III) shortly after recovery from acute LVF and in 10 matched control subjects (CON). Seated, the patients with LVF had small lung volumes but no evidence of airway obstruction (mean FEV(1)/FVC, 81%). Mean Rrs at 6 Hz was only slightly higher in LVF (3.4 cm H(2)O. L(-1). s) than in CON (2.6 cm H(2)O. L(-1). s). After 5 minutes supine, breathlessness in LVF increased. Despite much smaller mean falls in mid-tidal lung volume (MTLV) in LVF than in CON, the supine rise in Rrs was 80.5% in LVF and 37.6% in CON; mean increases in specific Rrs (SRrs = Rrs.MTLV) were 75.8% in LVF and 16.6% in CON (p 0.001). Five minutes after resuming the sitting position, all values had reverted almost to the original sitting values. In 5 LVF patients, nebulized ipratropium, a muscarinic antagonist, only slightly attenuated the supine rise in SRrs. We conclude that patients with chronic LVF, who had little evidence of airways obstruction when seated, showed a large rise in airflow resistance after lying supine for 5 minutes. This cannot be attributed to reduction in lung volume when supine, and no evidence was found of vagally-induced bronchoconstriction. Further experiments are required to establish the cause of the rapid supine rise in airflow resistance in LVF.

### Chronic cough in a 70-year-old woman [^112Dj3z1]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old lifelong nonsmoking woman with a past medical history of hypertension was referred to the respiratory clinic for evaluation of chronic cough. She presented with a 5-month history of dry cough, night sweats, fatigue, and a 4.5-kg weight loss. Her cough tended to be worse while lying flat. She denied having shortness of breath, chest pain, wheeze, or hemoptysis. She was taking amlodipine for her blood pressure as well as omeprazole for indigestion. She denied having any reflux symptoms or heartburn. She worked as a receptionist for an optician. She did not have any pets at home and had no family history of asthma or allergic conditions. She had not been abroad recently.

### Research priorities for patients with heart failure and central sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1128w26p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Research priority 2: Determine mechanisms that mediate breathing instability in CSA.

Despite substantial progress in understanding both the control of breathing and the physiology of CSA, neurobiological mechanisms by which heart failure leads to CSA remain poorly understood. The most consistent pathophysiological determinant of CSA in heart failure is increased chemosensitivity to CO2 and hypoxia, typically measured during wakefulness. CSA severity is more strongly associated with dynamic CO2 responses (designed to measure carotid body/peripheral chemosensitivity) than with responses measured from the slower rebreathing method (designed to assess predominantly central CO2 responses).

Consistent with this view, carotid body denervation in rabbits with cardiac ventricular pacing-induced heart failure has been shown to resolve CSA, suggesting that heightened peripheral chemosensitivity is required for CSA to occur. Interestingly, CSA in patients with heart failure is equally well correlated with ventilatory responses to CO2 and hypoxia; when both responses are augmented, CSA becomes particularly severe. The precise pathway between heart failure and augmented chemosensitivity in CSA remains unclear. Chemoreflex sensitivity has been related to increased left heart filling pressures and pulmonary congestion in humans. Of note, a lower DCO may be a marker of such congestion. In addition, changes in the pulmonary blood volume from wakefulness/upright positioning to sleep/supine positioning may relate to fluid movement from the periphery toward the lung.

### Increased expression of transient receptor potential channels and neurogenic factors associates with cough severity in a guinea pig model [^113Ltf5V]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrotic lung disease with an unknown etiology. The main clinical manifestations include cough, progressive dyspnea, and fatigue, with a survival period after diagnosis of approximately 2–5 years. Chronic irritant dry cough is a common clinical symptom of IPF, occurring in about 73–86% of IPF patients. These symptoms are severe during the day and significantly affect the quality of life in affected patients. Furthermore, cough in patients with IPF is an independent predictor of disease prognosis and is often refractory, while traditional cough medicines show poor efficacy.

The pathophysiological mechanism underlying IPF-related cough remains unclear. Some studies suggest that it might relate to neurogenic inflammation, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and increased cough sensitivity. Neurogenic inflammation involves the activation of sensory neurons when thermally or chemically stimulated, leading to the release of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A (NKA), and other inflammatory mediators. This results in inflammatory reactions, such as local tissue edema. It has been shown that mediators of neurogenic inflammation, such as CGRP and SP, play crucial regulatory roles in the cough reflex. When neurogenic inflammation occurs, neurons release bradykinin, nerve growth factor (NGF), and other inflammatory mediators, which can directly stimulate and activate cough pathways.

### Not all coughs are asthma or allergies: Churg-Strauss syndrome [^116zJ7Zw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiomyopathy in patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) carries a poor prognosis, with a high 5-year mortality rate, and requires treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. There is no single pathognomonic test or clinical finding for diagnosing CSS; instead, it is based upon meeting four of six criteria.

- **Case report**: A 47-year-old woman with a 6-month medical history of "asthma" presented to our hospital with a 1-month history of dyspnea on exertion. She denied any chest pain, cough, fever, orthopnea, or leg swelling. She was afebrile and normotensive, and her physical examination was unremarkable. Her white blood cell count was 23,000/mm³ with 23% eosinophils, and her troponin T level was 1.08 ng/ml. Extensive work-up revealed CSS.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Emergency physicians should be aware of unusual cases because not every patient who walks into an emergency department has a simple case of "asthma" or "allergies". Our patient had been diagnosed with asthma for 6 months before her symptoms had progressed to a point that prompted her to seek medical attention in a hospital. Emergency physicians are in a unique position to identify patients who present with complaints of asthma — especially late-onset asthma, which gradually worsens and is refractory to usual treatment. A complete blood cell count with a differential will prove valuable. Assessments of a patient's C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are inexpensive and check for signs of inflammation, although they are nonspecific.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JuhHm]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

We performed systematic reviews using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) format to address the following key clinical question: Are the CHEST 2006 classifications of acute, subacute, and chronic cough, as well as the associated management algorithms in adults based on durations of cough, useful?

- **Methods**: We utilized the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for systematic reviews, along with the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews, together with patient values, preferences, and clinical context, were used to form recommendations or suggestions. The Delphi methodology was employed to obtain the final grading.

- **Results**: In the case of acute cough (< 3 weeks), only three studies met our quality assessment criteria, and all presented a high risk of bias. Consistent with the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines, the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral origin, followed by exacerbations of underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and pneumonia. The participants were located across three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. For subacute cough (duration: 3–8 weeks), only two studies met our quality assessment criteria, both indicating a high risk of bias. According to the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were postinfectious cough and exacerbation of underlying conditions such as asthma, COPD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). These subjects were located in various countries in Asia.

### Respiratory syncytial virus-associated illness in adults with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or congestive heart failure [^111giRBZ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2019). Low credibility.

This was a prospective and observational study conducted across multiple consecutive RSV seasons to determine the incidence rate of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MARI) or events leading to worsening cardiorespiratory status in adults with severe COPD and/or advanced CHF associated with RSV and other viral infections. Fifty-seven sites in nine countries (Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) in the Northern Hemisphere participated in the study from fall 2011 through spring 2014. The protocol was approved by independent institutional review boards, and all subjects signed written informed consent at enrollment.

The study population included adults aged 50 years or older with severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage III/IV) and/or CHF (New York Heart Association Class III/IV or American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association Stage C/D) who had expected exposure to children (under 18 years of age) at least once a month.

An acute respiratory illness (ARI) was defined as a new onset or worsening of at least two of the following respiratory symptoms: sore throat, nasal congestion or discharge, hoarseness, cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain, or one respiratory symptom and at least one systemic symptom such as feverishness, fatigue, headache, and myalgia. Worsening cardiorespiratory events were defined as follows: AECOPD as the worsening of at least two major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence).

### Acunivive 15 [^117TZzH4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema, and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS). Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. Patients should also be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat) and, if these occur, to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS). In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

- **Laboratory tests**: Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

- **Drug interactions**: Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capa.

### Cough-variant asthma: A review of clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathophysiology [^1171qkfh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Chronic cough is among the most common symptoms prompting medical care. Cough-variant asthma (CVA) is an asthma subset where cough is the primary symptom, without wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea. It is an important cause of chronic cough, estimated to account for 25% to 42% of cases, but is likely underdiagnosed due to delayed recognition and pitfalls of diagnostic testing. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and delay its progression to more typical asthma. This review details the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of CVA and contrasts it with classic asthma and other causes of chronic cough.

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: Results from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study [^113vXZm1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Patients assessed their dyspnoea at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 24 hours from randomization. Assessments continued daily to Day 5, and then at Day 14, using patient-reported assessment tools. These tools included the following two main measures:

- **Absolute dyspnoea severity**: Assessed at each time point on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using a 100 mm vertical line. Patients drew a horizontal line rating their breathing, with 100 representing the 'best imaginable health state' and zero 'the worst imaginable health state'. - **Relative changes in dyspnoea**: Captured using a 7-point Likert scale by which patients rated their breathing as markedly, moderately, or minimally better; no change; or minimally, moderately, or markedly worse compared to baseline.

Dyspnoea assessment was done at all time points with the patient lying on the bed, the head elevated to 30 degrees, legs on the bed, and oxygen withdrawn for 5 minutes. If the patient could not tolerate the position or being taken off oxygen for this period, these measures were discontinued, and the patient was requested to complete the dyspnoea assessment, describing how they felt when the oxygen was withdrawn. Dyspnoea questionnaires were translated into all languages by certified translators.

After the assessment of dyspnoea, physicians were requested to perform daily additional clinical evaluations, including assessment of orthopnoea, dyspnoea on exertion, and congestion by assessing jugular vein distention.

### Cough reflex testing with inhaled capsaicin in the study of chronic cough [^113TAfBY]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess the utility of the capsaicin test in the differential diagnosis of non-productive causes of chronic cough and to examine the effects of treatment on this reflex.

The study involved 86 healthy volunteers and 101 patients with chronic cough. These patients were diagnosed with conditions such as asthma (54 subjects), gastroesophageal reflux (35 subjects), and post-nasal drip syndrome (12 subjects).

The research was conducted as a prospective intervention trial. Initially, spirometry, bronchoprovocation tests with histamine (PC20), and cough challenges with ascending concentrations of capsaicin (0.49–500 microM) were performed on all participants. Patients received treatment for 3 months based on the origin of their cough. Concentrations of capsaicin that elicited two (C2) and five or more coughs (C5) were determined before and after the treatment period.

The results indicated that, in healthy individuals, cough sensitivity to capsaicin was not influenced by gender or smoking status. However, women with chronic cough were more sensitive to the cough challenge compared to men. The C2 and C5 values were significantly lower in patients with asthma or gastroesophageal reflux when compared to those with post-nasal drip syndrome. No significant correlation was found between the capsaicin cough threshold and PC20 values. Even with adequate treatment over three months, cough sensitivity did not improve significantly in most patients with asthma or gastroesophageal reflux. The capsaicin test showed poor discriminative value in differentiating healthy subjects from patients with asthma or reflux.

In conclusion, cough sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin is a safe and reproducible tool for the study of chronic cough. However, its usefulness in the management and differential diagnosis of chronic cough is limited.
