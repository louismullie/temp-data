## Question

What are retractable testicles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what retractile testicles are, including the definition and differentiation of retractile testicles, along with pathophysiology, natural history, risks, and practical management considerations for surveillance and when to intervene. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise clinical definition and how it differs from a true undescended testis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological basis, especially the role of the cremasteric reflex. Next, I will review longitudinal data on natural history and predictors of ascent. After that, I need to check malignancy and fertility risks. Finally, I will clarify the differential diagnosis and outline evidence-based evaluation and follow-up, including when imaging is and is not useful, and consolidate guideline-based recommendations for monitoring and referral.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition to avoid mixing retractile and undescended entities. A retractile testis is suprascrotal at rest but can be easily manipulated into the dependent scrotum, where it will remain without tension once the cremaster is fatigued, yet it may reascend with stimulation of the cremasteric reflex shortly thereafter, which contrasts with a truly undescended testis that either cannot be brought into the scrotum or will not stay there without continuous traction, making manual placement-and-observation the key bedside maneuver for differentiation [^notfound] [^113oHmfD].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiological basis because overcalling "hyperactive cremaster" without data would be sloppy. Retractility is driven by an exaggerated cremasteric reflex that is most pronounced in prepubertal boys, especially around early school age, and often wanes approaching puberty, explaining why many testes stabilize in the scrotum over time, consistent with physiologic reflex maturation rather than fixed anatomic maldescent [^111pViMq] [^115dvdVj].

> Next, I should review the natural history carefully, and I need to reconcile seemingly divergent ascent rates. In a frequently cited longitudinal cohort of 204 retractile testes, about 30% ultimately became non-retractile and stayed scrotal, 32% ascended to acquired undescended status, and 38% remained retractile, with higher ascent risk when the spermatic cord felt taut or inelastic and lower chance of spontaneous stabilization in younger boys, indicating this is not a trivial normal variant and warrants surveillance [^115dvdVj]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; another institutional series following 274 retractile testes to resolution reported secondary ascent requiring orchiopexy in only 3.2%, underscoring that ascent rates vary with case definition, exam standardization, and follow-up capture, yet both data sets agree on the need for follow-up until resolution because ascent does occur, even if the absolute risk differs across settings [^113otben].

> I will now examine malignancy and fertility implications, but I should be cautious not to over-extrapolate from cryptorchidism data. The malignancy risk in purely retractile testes appears extremely low, though not zero, with a reported case of testicular carcinoma emerging during follow-up in a cohort otherwise largely managed expectantly, suggesting surveillance rather than prophylactic surgery in retractility per se, while recognizing the risk escalates if a testis secondarily ascends and becomes undescended [^112rpk8M]. Regarding fertility, data suggest that retractile testes may be associated with altered spermatogenesis, particularly when bilateral or when ascent occurs, although the signal is far stronger and more consistent for true cryptorchidism; thus, counseling should emphasize the importance of monitoring for ascent as the modifiable inflection point for risk [^114MBVhy] [^117PWghZ].

> Let me think about the practical bedside differentiation and preserve a point of self-correction I almost glossed over. Clinically, after gently sweeping the testis into the scrotum and holding it to fatigue the cremaster, a retractile testis stays transiently without tension and reascends with stimulation, whereas an undescended testis does not remain in the scrotum without persistent traction; I initially wrote "requires orchid… " — wait, I should correct that to "requires orchiopexy" if undescended is confirmed, generally by 6–18 months in congenital cases, using a scrotal or inguinal approach in prepubertal boys with palpable testes per guideline recommendations [^1178UWL2] [^112zK71z] [^117MHoi7]. I should confirm also that acquired ascent of a previously scrotal or retractile testis is a recognized pathway to undescended status, reinforcing the need for serial examinations through childhood [^115SY39a] [^115ZKQEi].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of imaging and ancillary testing because unnecessary ultrasound is a common pitfall. For a palpable testis, ultrasound adds little and often misleads; both Choosing Wisely-aligned studies and specialist series show low specificity and poor concordance with expert exam, so routine imaging before referral is not recommended, and serial expert physical examinations remain the mainstay for retractile and palpable undescended testes, with endocrine or genetic workups reserved for specific scenarios such as bilateral nonpalpable testes or proximal hypospadias suggestive of a disorder of sex development [^111m23sf] [^116UBbrf] [^11174rS9] [^1179eogq]. But wait, what if someone proposes HCG to "test" retractility? Limited older data suggest HCG responses may differ between retractile and undescended testes, yet this is not part of contemporary standard evaluation, and I should emphasize that management decisions hinge on serial examinations, not HCG provocation in typical cases [^116p7LmE] [^114zJKK3].

> Next, I should review surveillance and thresholds for intervention to ensure alignment with high-quality guidance. For retractile testes, do not offer routine medical or surgical treatment; instead, arrange regular follow-up until puberty to monitor for secondary ascent or volume loss, with at least annual examinations documented, and expedite referral if ascent is suspected or the testis fails to remain in the scrotum on examination over time [^115dvdVj] [^113XBk58]. I need to ensure I am not conflating this with hormonal therapy guidance; in contrast to UDT, there is no role for hormonal therapy in unilateral cases to induce descent, and even for UDT the pediatric guidelines discourage hormones except selected bilateral contexts focused on fertility potential, reinforcing that observation is the correct stance for retractility itself [^116FJEV2] [^1134nV1P].

> I should double-check counseling points for families because expectations shape adherence to follow-up. Key messages are that retractile testes often stabilize with age as the cremasteric reflex attenuates, but a subset will ascend and then require orchiopexy; therefore, continued annual exams are important, and parents should seek reassessment sooner if the testis is increasingly difficult to position or does not remain in the scrotum, which are warning signs of ascent that change management from observation to surgical correction per pediatric urology standards [^115dvdVj] [^115dvdVj] [^113XBk58].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency with the evidence. A retractile testis is defined by manipulability and temporary scrotal retention with subsequent reflex-mediated retraction; it is a physiologic variant with a dynamic course that is not entirely benign, given documented risks of secondary ascent and rare malignancy, and the recommended approach is vigilant, guideline-concordant surveillance rather than routine imaging, hormones, or surgery unless ascent or other concerning changes occur, at which point standard orchiopexy timing and techniques apply [^115dvdVj] [^113otben] [^115dvdVj] [^1178UWL2] [^117MHoi7].

Retractable testicles are testes that move between the scrotum and groin due to a strong cremasteric reflex, but can be gently brought into the scrotum and remain there without tension. They are common in prepubertal boys and usually resolve spontaneously [^1148Secc], but about 3–32% can ascend [^113otben] and require surgery [^115dvdVj], so **annual follow-up until puberty** is essential [^113XBk58]. No treatment is needed unless the testis becomes undescended or shows atrophy, in which case **orchidopexy is indicated** [^1178UWL2]. Retractile testes do not increase cancer risk [^1148Secc] but may slightly reduce fertility if bilateral or persistent [^114MBVhy]; routine imaging is not recommended [^116if87Y], and ultrasound is only for uncertain cases [^111m23sf].

---

## Definition and clinical features

By **definition**, a retractile testis is a normally descended testis that moves between the scrotum and groin due to a hyperactive cremasteric reflex but can be gently brought into the scrotum, where it remains without tension [^1148Secc]. The **clinical features** include a palpable, mobile testis that can be manipulated into the scrotum and remains there without tension; retraction is often triggered by cold, anxiety, or physical activity [^111pViMq].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

The **cremasteric reflex** is the primary mechanism; hyperactivity causes the testis to retract into the inguinal canal or groin [^111pViMq]. Hormonal factors — notably **androgens** — influence testicular descent and positioning, but **hormonal therapy** is generally not recommended for retractile testes [^116FJEV2].

---

## Prevalence and demographic patterns

Prevalence and demographics: Retractile testes are common in prepubertal boys, with a reported incidence of approximately **1–2%** in school-aged boys, and the condition typically resolves spontaneously with puberty [^1148Secc].

---

## Clinical significance and potential complications

Regarding **clinical significance**, retractile testes are generally benign but require monitoring due to the risk of secondary ascent (acquired undescended testis) [^113XBk58]. The main **potential complication** is secondary ascent, occurring in approximately 3–32% of cases and necessitating surgical intervention (orchidopexy) [^113otben] [^115dvdVj].

---

## Diagnostic methods

On **physical examination**, diagnosis relies on gently manipulating the testis into the scrotum, where it remains without tension [^115ZKQEi]. Imaging is not routinely recommended [^115oBJz1]; **ultrasound** may be used in uncertain cases but has limited specificity [^111m23sf].

---

## Management strategies

- **Observation**: Most retractile testes resolve spontaneously. Annual follow-up until puberty is recommended [^113XBk58] to monitor for secondary ascent [^113otben].

- **Surgical intervention**: Orchidopexy is indicated if the testis becomes undescended or shows signs of atrophy [^1178UWL2].

- **Hormonal therapy**: Generally not recommended due to limited efficacy and potential side effects [^116FJEV2].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Regarding **fertility**, retractile testes generally do not significantly affect fertility, though bilateral or persistent cases may slightly reduce fertility potential [^114MBVhy]. For **testicular cancer risk**, no significant increase has been documented for retractile testes [^1148Secc].

---

## Patient education and counseling

For **education**, patients and caregivers should understand the benign nature of retractile testes, the importance of regular follow-up [^1157vFYQ], and the potential for secondary ascent. For **counseling**, emphasize annual examinations [^113XBk58] and prompt medical attention if a testis becomes non-palpable or shows signs of atrophy.

---

## Current research and controversies

Current **research** examines the natural history of retractile testes [^1148Secc], optimal follow-up intervals, and the role of hormonal therapy. Controversies center on the necessity and timing of **surgical intervention**, particularly in persistent cases [^115SY39a].

---

Retractable testicles are a **benign condition** characterized by a hyperactive cremasteric reflex, requiring **annual follow-up until puberty** [^113XBk58] to monitor for secondary ascent. Surgical intervention is only necessary if the testis becomes **undescended** or shows signs of **atrophy** [^1178UWL2].

## References

### Retractile testis — is it really a normal variant [^115dvdVj]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Retractile testes are thought to represent a normal variant of descended testes in prepubertal boys. This study examined the natural history of retractile testes.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 122 boys, with a mean age of 5.4 years, who were referred for a suspected undescended testis and were found to have a retractile testis. A retractile testis was defined as a suprascrotal testis that could be manipulated easily into the scrotum and remained there without traction until the cremasteric reflex was induced. Annual examinations followed the boys, demonstrating the presence of retractile, descended (nonretractile) or undescended testes, and the presence or absence of a taut or inelastic spermatic cord in association with a retractile testis.

- **Results**: Of 204 retractile testes, 61 (30%) descended (became nonretractile), 66 (32%) became undescended testis (UDTs), and 77 (38%) remained retractile. Of the 62 retractile testes with a taut or inelastic spermatic cord, 35 (56%) became UDTs. Among the 61 orchiopexies performed, 8 (13%) showed a patent processus vaginalis. Boys in whom UDTs developed were a mean of 4.9 years old, compared to 6.6 years for boys with descended testes (p = 0.001). The chance of spontaneous descent was 58% in boys 7 years or older, compared to 21% in boys younger than 7 (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: A retractile testis is not a normal variant. Retractile testes have a 32% risk of becoming an ascending or acquired undescended testis. The risk is higher in boys younger than 7 years old, or when the spermatic cord seems tight or inelastic.

### Incidence of testicular ascent in boys with retractile testes [^113otben]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence of testicular ascent of a previously descended but retractile testis is reported to be between 2% and 45%. It has been our bias that only a small percentage of retractile testes ascend and ultimately require orchiopexy.

- **Materials and methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all retractile testes diagnosed by any of four pediatric urologists at our institution from 1996 to 2005. A retractile testis was defined as one that could be brought to at least the mid scrotum without tension despite a history of maldescent or a retractile nature. Patients were excluded if follow-up was less than 6 months or they had a history of ipsilateral inguinal surgery. A follow-up telephone survey was conducted in patients not reexamined at resolution.

- **Results**: A total of 172 patients met our inclusion criteria and were followed to resolution. Initially, 274 retractile testes were identified, including 26% unilateral and 74% bilateral testes. Nineteen testes ascended and ultimately required orchiopexy within a follow-up of 6 to 101 months. A patent processus vaginalis was identified in 13 cases (68%). Another 235 patients initially diagnosed with a retractile testis who had no follow-up examination at our institution were contacted via telephone. This set of boys initially had a total of 392 involved testes, of which 2 underwent orchiopexy elsewhere before resolution. The incidence of secondary ascent was 3.2% in the combined set of patients.

- **Conclusions**: Retractile testes can ascend and, therefore, they require follow-up until resolution. In our experience, this monitoring is essential to ensure timely intervention if ascent occurs.

### Use of ultrasound for the palpable undescended testis: A wasteful practice [^111m23sf]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Many primary care physicians order an ultrasound (US) before referring patients to specialist care for suspected undescended testis; however, the value of this practice is questionable.

- **Objective**: To determine the proportion of boys referred for suspected undescended testis who had accompanying US, the cost of this practice, and the accuracy of US for testis localization compared with physical examination by a pediatric urologist.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review at a pediatric urology service, including all patients referred for suspected undescended testis from 2008 to 2012. We determined the cost of US ordered and calculated Cohen's kappa, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive value.

- **Results**: We identified 894 eligible patients; 32% (289/894) were accompanied by US. In 77% (223/289), the urologist was able to palpate the testis: 51% (147/289) had a normal/retractile testis and 26% (76/289) had a palpable undescended testis. At a cost of 71.10 CAD per US, 20,547.90 CAD was expended on this practice. Of the 223 patients with palpable testes, we gathered detailed US and physical examination results for 214 patients. Cohen's kappa was 0.06 (95% CI -0.005, 0.11; P = 0.10). US had 92.8% sensitivity (95% CI 84.1, 96.9%) and 15.2% specificity (95% CI 10.2, 21.9%) to detect an undescended testis. The positive predictive value was 34.2% (95% CI 27.8, 41.3%), while the negative predictive value was 81.5% (95% CI 63.3, 91.8%).

### Management of undescended testis may be improved with educational updates for referring providers [^117CL3jU]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2014). Low credibility.

A large proportion of boys referred for undescended testis (UDT) is not managed optimally prior to referral, with the majority seen at over one year of age, and many undergoing unnecessary ultrasound (US). Our objective was to assess the magnitude of these problems in our area and to determine if unnecessary US decreased following interventions to educate referring providers (RPs).

A chart review was conducted on new patients referred for UDT from January 2010 to June 2012. Data collection included the age on the date of the pediatric urology office visit, whether or not RPs obtained an US, and whether the pediatric urology examination revealed an UDT or retractile testis. Several educational updates for RPs were provided, and the proportion having US was tracked during the study period.

Of 363 boys referred for UDT, only 17% (62) were seen at less than one year of age, and 62% (227) had a retractile testis. US had been obtained in 24% (87/363). There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of patients having had an unnecessary US following the last update (p < 0.01).

Delayed urology consultation and unnecessary US for UDT are common in our area. A brief, focused educational update was effective in decreasing US usage in our area.

### Does the contralateral testicular volume decide the need for diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of unilateral impalpable undescended testis [^1114m2wY]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

The status of the DIR on the affected side was examined during laparoscopy, revealing a closed DIR in 52 patients (68.42%) and a patent DIR in 24 patients (31.58%). The calculated volume of the contralateral normal side was larger in patients with closed DIR (0.81 ± 0.22) than in patients with patent rings (0.54 ± 0.17), which was statistically significant (p < 0.001*).

- **The operative findings of the studied patients (n = 76)**:
	- The intra-operative procedure was determined based on the laparoscopic findings. No further procedure was conducted in patients with a blind-ending vas and vessels (26; 34.21%). In 19 patients with vas and vessels passing through the DIR, inguinal exploration with inguinal orchiopexy was performed in 9 (11.84%), all of whom had an open DIR. Excision of an atrophic remnant was performed in the remaining 10 patients (13.15%) with a closed DIR. Patients with intra-abdominal testes underwent different procedures depending on their testicular status. The relation between the procedure done for the affected testis and the pre-operative calculated volume of the contralateral normal one was statistically significant (p < 0.001*), indicating that patients with the highest calculated volume had no procedure done for their impalpable testis as they already had blind-ending vas and vessels.

### Natural course of acquired undescended testis in boys [^116aiqu1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Although orchidopexy is commonly performed for acquired undescended testis, therapy remains controversial. A prospective study on the natural course of acquired undescended testis in boys was initiated.

- **Methods**: At present, the study includes 63 boys with 74 acquired undescended testes in whom treatment and follow-up have been completed. In 15 boys with 20 acquired undescended testes, orchidopexy was performed before the onset of puberty, mainly at the request of the parents. In the remaining 48 boys with 54 acquired undescended testes, the onset of puberty was awaited. Of these, four boys with four acquired undescended testes were lost to follow-up.

- **Results**: In 42 of 50 boys, the testis descended spontaneously at puberty with a testicular volume appropriate for age. In the remaining eight boys, the testis failed to descend at puberty and orchidopexy was performed.

- **Conclusion**: The preliminary results of this study indicate that spontaneous descent at puberty commonly occurs in boys with acquired undescended testes, with testicular volume appropriate for age. It is suggested that surgical intervention before the onset of puberty may not always be necessary in acquired undescended testis.

### Is surgical exploration necessary in bilateral anorchia [^117CTrwr]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to review the management of boys with bilateral anorchia and assess whether surgical exploration is necessary when endocrine investigation indicates absent testicular function.

- **Patients and methods**: The medical records of 11 boys being managed for bilateral anorchia were reviewed in relation to clinical presentation, pituitary-gonadal function, and surgical and histological findings.

- **Results**: All boys showed absence of testicular function based on undetectable levels of serum anti-Müllerian hormone, elevated basal or peak follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels, and no testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation. Each boy underwent abdominal exploration; ten showed no macroscopic signs of testis tissue, confirmed histologically in seven. Histology was not available for the remaining three boys. Abnormally small intra-abdominal testes were found bilaterally in one boy. These testes were sited in the scrotum at orchidopexy but had subsequently atrophied. Endocrine tests confirmed absent testicular function.

- **Conclusion**: Based on the high degree of concordance between the surgical and histological findings and the results of the endocrine tests, it is suggested that surgery is unnecessary in bilateral anorchia when endocrine tests confirm the absence of functioning testicular tissue.

### Undescended testis: A roundtable discussion based on clinical scenarios - part 1 [^114XEth1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genital tract. Despite its high incidence, the management of UDT varies between specialties: urology, pediatric surgery, pediatric urology, and pediatric endocrinology. Therefore, as the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we requested experts around the world to express their personal approaches to various case scenarios of UDT to explore their individual reasoning. We intended to broaden the perspectives of our colleagues who deal with the treatment of this frequent genital malformation.

### EAU guidelines on testicular cancer [^115xG3tP]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

The EAU 2025 guidelines on medical management for testicular cancer, specifically concerning advanced/metastatic nonseminoma, recommend offering nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as an initial treatment. This procedure should be performed by an experienced surgeon in a specialized center for patients with clinical stage IIA nonseminoma without elevated tumor markers.

### Empty scrotum: Undescended testis or ectopic [^115Npzpp]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

This case of ectopic testis highlights the importance of a thorough first newborn examination, followed by senior review when appropriate, along with the expertise required to interpret neonatal ultrasounds. Following a provisional diagnosis of unilateral undescended testicle in a newborn, an ultrasound scan was unable to correctly identify the condition, resulting in a delay in diagnosis. The condition was later recognized incidentally, which led to a successful surgical correction. Early clinical examination and recognition of ectopic testis allows timely surgical intervention, preventing potential complications.

### Is the Fowler-Stephens procedure still indicated for the treatment of nonpalpable intraabdominal testis [^116twNf6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

There are no formal guidelines for the management of boys with nonpalpable testis. In this article, we report our experience in treating all nonpalpable intraabdominal testis (NPIT) with standard inguinal orchidopexy without dividing the spermatic vessels, stating that the Fowler-Stephens technique is no longer indicated for the treatment of the intraabdominal testis.

- **Methods**: Between June 2003 and April 2008, we treated 23 boys with NPIT confirmed by ultrasound or laparoscopy. All cases were treated through an inguinal orchidopexy without division of the spermatic vessels by fixing the testis to the scrotum with 2 absorbable stitches, even if there was an upward retraction of the scrotal skin. Location and size of the testis were reported at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months through physical examination.

- **Results**: The average age at presentation was 24 months. Ten patients (43%) had the NPIT on the right side, 8 (35%) on the left side, and 5 (22%) were bilateral. We had no intraoperative complications. All patients were discharged on the same day. In all cases, the testis was normal in size and found in the scrotum after 6 months of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: On the basis of our experience, we believe that the Fowler-Stephens procedure is not indicated anymore in the management of NPIT. Orchidopexy without division of the spermatic vessels should be the treatment of choice, even for the cases of very high intraabdominal testis, because it does not affect normal testicular vascularization and is minimally invasive.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early stage testicular cancer: AUA guideline [^114UD5Df]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for testicular cancer, specifically with respect to testis-sparing surgery, AUA 2023 guidelines recommend considering testis-sparing surgery through an inguinal incision as an alternative to radical inguinal orchiectomy in highly selected patients wishing to preserve gonadal function with masses less than 2 cm and any of the following:

- **Equivocal ultrasound/physical examination findings** and negative tumor markers (hCG and α-fetoprotein).

- **Congenital, acquired, or functionally solitary testis**.

- **Bilateral synchronous tumors**.

### Retractile testes: An outcome analysis on 150 patients [^112rpk8M]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Retractile testes are testicles that can be brought down into their normal position in the scrotum but then immediately retract upward and out of the scrotum. The purpose of this study is to provide data on the outcome of pediatric patients with retractile testes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on prospectively collected data on the outcome of 150 consecutive patients with retractile testis, examined and followed up by one pediatric surgeon from April 1982 to April 1999 inclusive.

- **Results**: Age at presentation was 5.2 ± 3.0 years, and follow-up duration was 3.8 ± 3.0 years. The number of retractile testes was 205: right-sided for 58 patients (38.6%), left-sided for 37 (24.6%), and bilateral for 55 (36.7%). A family history of retractile testis was positive in 8 patients (5.3%). Thirty-four patients required surgery (22.7%); the indication for surgery was given when retractile testes ascended and became cryptorchid or if testicular size decreased during follow-up. Orchidopexy was required more frequently (P < 0.001) in patients with an associated hernia (68.8% of cases) than in patients without hernias (9.2%). One patient with spontaneous testicular descent during follow-up had testicular carcinoma.

- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that the majority of patients (77.3%) with retractile testes have a spontaneously favorable evolution by 14 years of age and do not require surgical treatment. The authors report the first case of testicular carcinoma in a patient with retractile testis, indicating that these patients should be followed up more closely.

### Canadian Urological Association-Pediatric Urologists of Canada (CUA-PUC) guideline for the diagnosis, management, and followup of cryptorchidism [^116z2LsW]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for cryptorchidism, specifically related to orchidopexy in pre-pubertal patients, the CUA 2017 guidelines recommend choosing either inguinal or prescrotal techniques for surgical management of patients with palpable cryptorchidism. The choice should depend on the surgeon's preference and experience.

### Surgical management of the adult symptomatic retractile testicle [^113uByVv]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy and safety of circumferential cremasteric lysis in the treatment of adult symptomatic retractile testicles.

- **Materials and methods**: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone circumferential cremasteric lysis at a single institution performed by a single surgeon between January 2010 and December 2011. We evaluated the etiology, pre- and postoperative pain intensity, postoperative pain alleviation, and any surgical complications. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pain levels before and at last follow-up after surgery.

- **Results**: Eight patients (mean age, 31.5 ± 10.60; range, 22–51 years) underwent circumferential cremasteric lysis. The procedure resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant difference in postoperative pain intensity. The mean pain levels decreased from 5.6 (preoperatively) to 1.5 (at last follow-up) [p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test]. The mean follow-up was 21.63 ± 13.70 months (range, 9–50 months). Four patients (50%) reported complete resolution and four (50%) reported partial resolution of their testicular pain at last follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: In this limited retrospective study, it was demonstrated that circumferential lysis of the cremasteric muscle through a small subinguinal incision is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for physical activity-precipitated painful retractile testicular pain.

### Referral patterns for undescended testis: A 7 year comparative analysis of primary care providers [^114fqzM8]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism, or undescended testis (UDT), is identified in 1% of boys by one year of age and carries long-term risks of infertility and testicular neoplasia. In 2014, the American Urological Association (AUA) released a guideline statement stating that patients with UDT should be referred to a urologist by 6 months of age to facilitate timely surgical correction. This study is the follow-up to a 2010 study assessing referral patterns to our university center from primary care providers.

- **Objective**: In this new study, we aim to identify changes in referral patterns in response to the establishment of the 2014 AUA guidelines and to understand how our referring physicians stay abreast of knowledge regarding UDT.

- **Study Design**: A 9-question anonymous survey regarding UDT referral patterns was sent to providers who had previously referred a patient to our pediatric urology practice. The results were categorized by specialty and were compared to the similar survey from 2010.

- **Results**: Surveys were sent to 500 physicians with 138 (27.6%) responses received. Less than half of respondents reported that they would refer a boy with unilateral or bilateral palpable UDT by 6 months of age (37.0% and 38.4%, respectively). This was not significantly different from the 2010 survey (p = 0.68 and 0.27, respectively). Two-thirds of physicians would refer a patient with unilateral nonpalpable UDT within the recommended timeframe (68.8%); this was also unchanged from 2010 (p = 0.87). There was an improvement in respondents who would refer immediately for bilateral cases, although the sentence appears incomplete and may have been cut off.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^116ug9z4]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Primary outcome variables were the mean age at orchidopexy, the prevalence of hormonal therapy, and the prevalence of referral to a pediatric surgery center. Secondary outcome variables included the prevalence of reported success and failure of hormonal therapy, as well as the incidence of surgical complications. We analyzed the data from the five Italian regions with the highest number of enrolled children to examine any regional differences in primary outcomes.

- **Data analysis**: Categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentages; continuous variables are displayed as means, standard deviations, and the minimum and maximum range. Only the means are shown as their values largely overlapped with medians. All data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS for Windows, version 11. A chi-square test for trend was calculated to detect significant differences among regions. The data showed a non-normal distribution, both visually and according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Therefore, a non-parametric test (either the Mann-Whitney test or the Kruskal-Wallis test in the case of more than two independent comparisons) was employed to compare continuous data.

### Effect of cryptorchidism and retractile testes on male factor infertility: A multicenter, retrospective, chart review [^114MBVhy]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

This multicenter retrospective chart review study, performed on 162 cryptorchid patients and 34 subjects with retractile testes, suggests that cryptorchidism and retractile testes can alter spermatogenesis, with more serious damage observed in bilateral cryptorchidism. This spermatogenetic impairment is probably related to the lack of an appropriate or timely surgical correction.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^111D3ock]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

An evidence-based consensus on the treatment of undescended testis (UT) was recently published. It recommends performing orchidopexy between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis, and advises avoiding the use of hormones. In Italy, practices on UT management are little known. Our aim was to describe the management of UT in a cohort of Italian children in comparison with the consensus guidelines. As management of retractile testis (RT) differs, RT cases were described separately.

- **Methods**: Ours is a retrospective, multicenter descriptive study. An online questionnaire was filled in by 140 Italian family paediatricians (FP) from Associazione Culturale Pediatri (ACP), a national professional association of FP. The questionnaire requested information on all children with cryptorchidism born between January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2006. Data on 169 children were obtained. Analyses were descriptive.

- **Results**: Overall, 24% of children were diagnosed with RT, and 76% with UT. Among the latter, cryptorchidism resolved spontaneously in 10% of cases at a mean age of 21.6 months. Overall, 70% of UT cases underwent orchidopexy at a mean age of 22.8 months (SD 10.8, range 1.2–56.4), 13% of whom before 1 year. The intervention was performed by a paediatric surgeon in 90% of cases, with a success rate of 91%. Orchidopexy was the first-line treatment in 82% of cases, while preceded by hormonal treatment in the remaining 18%. Hormonal treatment was used as first-line therapy in 23% of UT cases with a reported success rate of 25%. Overall, 13 children did not undergo any intervention.

### Testicular catch up growth: The impact of orchiopexy age [^114zzfnn]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the long-term follow-up growth of congenital, unilaterally palpable, undescended testes after orchiopexy according to age at the time of surgery. The optimal age for surgical treatment remains controversial.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 86 patients (108 testes) between the ages of 1 and 9 years underwent orchiopexy. Patients were divided according to age at the time of surgery: group I, < 2 years (n = 43); group II, 2 ≤ age < 5 years (n = 35); and group III, ≥ 5 years (n = 30). The boys were then followed for more than 2 years after surgery. Ultrasonography was used to determine testicular volume. Testicular volume percentage was compared by the equation of (operated testis volume/normal testis volume × 100%).

- **Results**: Testicular location was the inguinal canal in 92 (85.2%) and lower to the external inguinal ring in 16 (14.8%). Only group I, which received orchiopexy within two years from birth, showed significant recovery of testicular volume at follow-up (P < 0.05), compared with groups II and III.

- **Conclusions**: Orchiopexy performed at less than 2 years from birth was a significant factor for recovery of delayed cryptorchid testicular growth. This result suggests that early orchiopexy improves subsequent testicular catch-up growth.

### Guideline implementation for the treatment of undescended testes: Still room for improvement [^1158KMmS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Early orchidopexy (OP) around the age of 1 year is recommended in boys with congenital undescended testis (UDT) worldwide. Former retrospective studies did not distinguish congenital from acquired UDT, leading to a negative bias concerning the age at surgery.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective analysis, data of all boys who underwent OP in eight pediatric surgery institutions from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. Congenital or acquired UDT was differentiated. Patients were categorized into three groups based on age at surgery: less than 1 year, between 1 and 2 years, and more than 2 years. Data from one institution were analyzed in detail, including the exact age of first referral, exact age at surgery, and intraoperative findings.

- **Results**: Out of 4,448 boys, 3,270 had congenital UDT. In 81% (2,656 cases), surgery was performed beyond the age of 1 year; in 54.4% (1,780 cases), it was performed beyond the age of 2 years. Chi-square statistics showed a higher rate of early operations in hospitals compared to outpatient services and in Germany compared to Switzerland. In 694 detailed congenital cases, the median age at referral was 13 months (range 0–196 months), and the median age at surgery was 15 months (range 0–202 months).

- **Conclusion**: Delayed referral is the main reason for the guideline non-conformity and delayed surgery in UDT.

- **Type of study**: Clinical research paper.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III: Treatment study.

### Undescended testis in older boys: Further evidence that ascending testes are common [^115SY39a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

We recommend orchiopexy between 9 and 18 months of age for surgical, testicular, and psychological reasons. However, in practice, we observed many patients coming to orchiopexy at a later age. To understand this difference better, we reviewed our experience with patients undergoing late orchiopexy.

- **Methods**: We reviewed retrospectively the office medical records of all boys who had undergone an orchiopexy between July 1997 and April 2006. We defined a "late" orchiopexy as that performed at 4 years of age or later. Each boy was examined carefully by a pediatric urologist, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative findings were reviewed.

- **Results**: There were 191 late orchiopexies in 177 patients (from a total of 587 orchiopexies in 552 patients). Median age at the operation was 7.2 years (range, 4.0–16.2). Preoperatively, the testes were palpable in 140 (72%) and nonpalpable in 51 (28%). The apparent reason for the late orchiopexy was an ascending testis (previously descended) in 85 (45%), parental delay in 41 (22%), late referral in 39 (20%), and iatrogenic cryptorchidism in 18 (9%). Ascended testes were more likely to have a history of being retractile (85% vs. 30%), to have a patent processus vaginalis (78% vs. 54%), and to be localized to the superficial inguinal area (87% vs. 50%).

- **Conclusions**: Primary care provider and parent education on the benefits of early orchiopexy is important, but in addition, ascending testes are much more common than previously thought. Patients with retractile testes should be followed regularly.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116if87Y]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism is one of the most common pediatric disorders of the male endocrine glands and the most common genital disorder identified at birth. This guideline is intended to provide physicians and non-physician providers (primary care and specialists) with a consensus of principles and treatment plans for the management of cryptorchidism, typically isolated non-syndromic.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature was conducted using controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords relating to the relevant concepts of cryptorchidism. The search strategy was developed and executed by reference librarians and methodologists to create an evidence report limited to English-language, published peer-reviewed literature. This review yielded 704 articles published from 1980 through 2013 that were used to form a majority of the guideline statements. Clinical principles and expert opinions were used for guideline statements lacking sufficient evidence-based data.

Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians on the proper methods of history-taking, physical exam, and evaluation of the boy with cryptorchidism, as well as the various hormonal and surgical treatment options.

Imaging for cryptorchidism is not recommended prior to referral, which should occur by 6 months of age. Orchidopexy (orchiopexy is the preferred term) is the most successful therapy to relocate the testis into the scrotum, while hormonal therapy is not recommended. Successful scrotal repositioning of the testis may reduce the associated risks and complications.

### Management of cryptorchidism: A survey of clinical practice in Italy [^114fw7RH]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The correct and timely management of children with cryptorchidism is important to promote gonadal development and to avoid adulthood consequences of spermatogenesis defects. The results of our study allowed, for the first time, a description of how cryptorchidism was managed in Italy before the publication of the Consensus. Hormone therapy was used in about one-quarter of the cases. The average age at surgery was much higher than recommended in the Consensus, and only 13% of children underwent surgery before 12 months of age.

Our results suggest that the distribution of the Consensus guidelines on the management of cryptorchidism among all pediatricians is warranted to reduce age at orchidopexy and to ensure a more homogeneous approach throughout Italy.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^113oHmfD]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Undescended testicle (UT) is present at birth with a frequency varying from 2% to 8%; in Italy, the estimated prevalence is 3.5% in term babies. UT includes both a non-palpable testis and a palpable supra-scrotal testis, which cannot be pulled down to the scrotum or does not remain there by six months of age. UT should be differentiated from a retractile testis (RT), a condition where the testis is palpable in the supra-scrotal region but, once pulled down to the scrotum, remains there after the exhaustion of cremasteric activity. In this case, RT should not be treated. The differential diagnosis between a true RT and a supra-scrotal UT may not be easy.

The difficulty in achieving consensus on UT management depends largely on the long follow-up from diagnosis until the attainment of full testicular function in adulthood. An up-to-date, evidence-based consensus on the treatment of UT has been published with the following recommendations:

- **Hormone therapy**: Hormones are not recommended.
- **Surgical intervention**: Orchidopexy should be performed between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis if it occurs later.
- **Specialized centers**: Orchidopexy should be performed at centers with both pediatric surgeons or urologists and pediatric anesthesiologists.

These recommendations, in line with those by Swiss surgeons, are important to avoid adulthood consequences of UT, such as azoospermia or oligospermia, endocrine insufficiency, and possible tumoral degeneration.

Retractile testis (RT) may be more difficult to diagnose. According to the consensus, RT should not undergo surgery but should be followed up once yearly.

### Surgical exploration for impalpable testis: Which should be first, inguinal exploration or laparoscopic abdominal exploration [^1174TGd7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the optimal surgical approach for impalpable testis in children by reviewing our own treatment results and those reported in the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: Seventy-two impalpable testes were diagnosed in 68 patients, with unilateral cases in 64 patients and bilateral cases in 4 patients. All patients underwent surgical exploration at ages ranging from 6 to 140 months (median, 15 months). Initially, the inguinal canal was explored, and abdominal exploration was performed with laparoscopy when an extra-abdominal testis was not identified. Articles regarding surgical exploration for impalpable testis published over the last 20 years were also retrieved and examined.

- **Results**: Testes were detected by inguinal exploration in 28 of 72 (39%) impalpable testes: intracanalicular in 22 testes and at the internal inguinal ring (peeping or low abdominal testis) in 6 testes. All these testes were treated by conventional inguinal orchidopexy. Laparoscopic exploration was performed in 44 (61%) impalpable testes, and 4 (5.6%) high abdominal testes were detected and treated by two-stage Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy. Vanishing or absent testis was the final diagnosis in the remaining 40 testes (55.6%). The literature review showed that the ratios of intra- and extra-abdominal testes were lower in the articles reporting inguinal or scrotal exploration results than in those reporting laparoscopic exploration, although the difference was not significant.

- **Conclusions**: Considering the relatively low incidence of high abdominal testis, we recommend starting with inguinal exploration.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^112HhRyE]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Timing of orchidopexy in patients with undescended testis: Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the age distribution of all boys who received orchidopexy for UDT between 2003 and 2012 (n = 3587). Forty-one percent of the patients were older than four years. From 2003 to 2008, 4% were operated on before age one and 22% before age two. After the guideline recommendation was modified (including one-year tolerance), only 5% were operated on in their first year of life and 27% before age two. Respective 95% confidence intervals were [-3%; +1%; corresponding Fisher p = .209] for the incidence difference of children operated on in their first year of life and [-13%; -5%; corresponding Fisher p < .001] for the first two years of life. Figure 2 demonstrates the age distribution at the time of orchidopexy of all cases from one to 17 years of age before and after the change in the guideline recommendation, respectively. Considering only boys aged four years and younger, only 8% received orchidopexy in the first year of life from 2003 to 2008 and 9% from 2010 to 2012.

### Age at orchiopexy for undescended testis in the United States [^116a1WrN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the male genitalia. The American Urological Association guidelines recommend orchiopexy by the age of 18 months to reduce the risk of subfertility. This study aimed to assess adherence to these guidelines on a national level.

We retrospectively reviewed the State Ambulatory Surgery Database (SASD) for 2012 and the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) for 2015. All patients aged 18 years or less with a diagnosis of UDT who underwent orchiopexy were included. Demographic data, including age at repair, surgical subspecialty, and payer status, were extracted.

Analysis of the 2012 SASD for New Jersey, Florida, and Maryland yielded 1,654 patients. The majority were white, 791 (48.3%), with a median age at repair of 4 years (IQR 1–8). Most patients, 1,048 (64%), had orchiopexy later than age 2. A total of 844 males were identified from the PHIS database. Of these, 63% were white, with a median age at repair of 5 years (IQR 1–9). There were 577 (68%) patients older than 2 years at orchiopexy.

Almost 70% of boys with undescended testes in the United States are undergoing orchiopexy at least 6 months later than the recommended age.

- **Type of study**: Retrospective.
- **Level of evidence**: III.

### EAU guidelines on paediatric urology [^117PWghZ]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for cryptorchidism, particularly in terms of general counseling, the EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend informing patients and caregivers about the following:

- **Increased risk of malignancy**: An undescended testis carries an increased risk of malignancy, which rises with the age at orchidopexy. The risk of later malignancy is higher with a failed or delayed orchidopexy; thus, the earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer.

- **Fertility concerns**: There are reduced rates of fertility with a unilateral undescended testis and reduced rates of fertility and paternity with bilateral undescended testes.

### A management protocol for gonad preservation in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome [^111MSavM]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) were managed with removal of gonadal tissue at various ages to avert the risk of gonadal malignancy. Recently, clinical practice changed, with gonadectomy being postponed until late adolescence. Adolescents and adults with complete AIS have questioned this approach. Additionally, testicular germ cell tumors are increasingly believed to be quite rare, with rates as low as 0% in molecularly confirmed individuals with AIS. Gonadectomy deprives patients of the benefits of their endogenous hormones and potential fertility. Furthermore, human rights organizations advocate for deferring irreversible surgery in conditions known as differences of sex development, which includes AIS, to allow patient autonomy in decision-making. Recent literature supports an approach that uses risk stratification to manage gonads in AIS. Herein, we review what is known about malignancy risk in the different subtypes of AIS and propose a management protocol for gonad retention.

### Inappropriate imaging for management of cryptorchidism: Has the Choosing Wisely® recommendation reduced occurrence [^116UBbrf]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism is one of the most common referral diagnoses to pediatric urologists. It is well recognized in the urologic community that diagnostic imaging is unnecessary in the work-up of these patients, and the Choosing Wisely® recommendation (CWR) on this subject re-emphasized this in 2013. Many boys, however, still are sent for testing prior to referral.

- **Objective**: The purpose of our study was dual in nature. We pursued, first, to identify any factors that make patients more likely to be sent for imaging prior to referral, and second, to determine if rates of diagnostic imaging for cryptorchidism decreased after the release of the CWR.

- **Study design**: We included all boys who had surgery for cryptorchidism by Urology at our institution between January 2007 and August 2018. Demographics and clinical data were collected including height, weight, race, insurance type, pre-referral imaging status, testis location at time of surgery, and distance from our medical center. Chi-squared analysis was utilized to compare imaging use before and after CWR. Influence of other clinical and socioeconomic factors on imaging utilization was also evaluated using chi-squared and two-sample t-tests. Those found to be significant at the 0.2 level were analyzed in multivariate logistic regression. Significance was set at 0.05.

- **Results**: 1010 boys were available for analysis. Of the 256 patients (25.3%) with pre-referral studies, 7 had axial exams (CT or MRI), and the remainder underwent ultrasounds. Children living closer to the medical center were more likely to undergo imaging.

Regarding surgical interventions for cryptorchidism, specifically in relation to orchiectomy, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend considering orchiectomy in patients with a normal contralateral testis who meet at least one of the following criteria:

- **Very short testicular vessels and vas deferens**: The presence of significantly shortened vasculature and vas deferens.

- **Dysmorphic or very hypoplastic affected testis**: The affected testis exhibits abnormal morphology or significant underdevelopment.

- **Postpubertal age**: The patient has reached postpubertal age.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^116XEzR9]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common disorder in pediatric surgery and one of the most important risk factors for malignancy and subfertility. In 2009, local guidelines were modified to recommend that treatment be completed by the age of 1. The aim of this study was to analyze age distribution at the time of orchidopexy, evaluate whether the procedure is performed according to guideline recommendations, and assess primary care pediatricians' attitude regarding their treatment approach.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 3587 patients with UDT regarding age at orchidopexy between 2003 and 2012 across 13 German hospitals. Furthermore, an anonymized nationwide survey among primary care pediatricians regarding their management approach to UDT was conducted.

- **Results**: Before the guideline modification, 78% (n = 1245) of boys with UDT were not operated on according to guideline recommendations. After the modification, that number rose to 95% (n = 1472). 42% of the orchidopexies were performed on patients aged 4 to 17 years. Additionally, 46% of primary care pediatricians were not aware of this discrepancy, and 38% would only initiate operative management after the first year of life. In hospitals with pediatric surgery departments, significantly more patients received orchidopexy in their first year of life (p < .001).

- **Conclusion**: The guideline for UDT in Germany has not yet been sufficiently implemented. Timing of orchidopexy must be optimized to improve long-term prognosis. Both primary care providers and parents should be educated about the advantages of early treatment.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

It is generally accepted that investigations are necessary in cases where the appearance of the genitalia is so ambiguous that sex assignment is not possible at birth or the appearance is not consistent with any prenatal genetic tests. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer. Before presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of atypical genitalia may be as high as 1 in 300 births, but the birth prevalence of a condition that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as 1 in 5000 births.

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in a clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus, and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only

### Targeted testicular excision biopsy: When and how should we try to avoid radical orchidectomy [^113Dqxf5]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Small, incidental testicular lesions are often benign, but in the past have usually been treated by orchidectomy. An alternative is an operative excision biopsy, with localization by ultrasound if necessary, and characterization of the lesion by frozen section analysis. The present review summarizes the indications for the procedure, lists the likely diagnoses, and describes the technique. Frozen section is accurate for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions, testicular function is usually preserved, and there is no evidence that oncological safety is impaired. Such testis-preserving surgery is a rewarding ground for collaboration between urologists, radiologists, and pathologists.

### The undescended testicle: diagnosis and management [^112n7ZnX]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis and management of the undescended testicle are essential to preserve fertility and improve the early detection of testicular malignancy. Physical examination of the testicle can be challenging; therefore, consultation should be considered if a normal testis cannot be definitively identified. Observation is not recommended beyond one year of age as it delays treatment, lowers the rate of surgical success, and likely impairs spermatogenesis. By six months of age, patients with undescended testicles should be evaluated by a pediatric urologist or other qualified subspecialist experienced in diagnosis and treatment.

Earlier referral may be necessary for newborns with bilateral nonpalpable testes or any child presenting with both hypospadias and an undescended testis. Therapy for an undescended testicle should commence between six months and two years of age, involving either hormone or surgical treatment. The success of these treatment modalities depends on the position of the testicle at diagnosis. Recent advancements in surgical techniques, including laparoscopic approaches to diagnosis and treatment, promise improved outcomes.

While orchiopexy may not shield patients from developing testicular malignancy, it facilitates earlier detection through self-examination of the testicles.

### Should manual detorsion be a routine part of treatment in testicular torsion [^114J9NLs]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Manual detorsion (MD) is a non-invasive procedure that can be applied as soon as the diagnosis of testicular torsion is made. It decreases the duration of ischemia when compared to emergency scrotal exploration. The long-term results of this study have shown that it is safe when applied together with elective orchiopexy. MD is a simple procedure that may be performed safely with little to no delay in definitive scrotal exploration and orchiopexy, which remains the gold standard.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^1147Vkwh]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Primary undescended testis is the most common congenital anomaly of the urogenital system and the most common disorder in pediatric surgery, affecting up to 30% of preterm and 3% of term infants worldwide. The non-scrotal position of the testis bears a considerable risk for the development of both uni- and contra-lateral testicular malignancy as well as impaired fertility. Testicular descent takes place in two stages under the control of insulin-like hormone 3 between 8 and 15 weeks of development as well as androgens facilitating inguinoscrotal migration afterward. While plenty of research is dedicated to improving the understanding of the morphological complexity involved in the process of testicular descent, the exact cause of cryptorchidism currently remains elusive.

Relevant risk factors include prematurity, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders (e.g. disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis), small-for-gestational-age (SGA), birth weight < 2500 g, as well as environmental factors (nicotine, alcohol, pesticides). Ten percent of the cases are bilateral and are commonly associated with complex syndromes or other congenital malformations such as abdominal wall defects or neural tube defects. Spontaneous descent occurs in approximately 70% of the cases, mostly within the first three to six months of life. After six months of life, therapeutic intervention is indicated, as a spontaneous descent is then unlikely. Hormonal treatments with GnRH monotherapy or other interventions are generally considered.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^114hyanQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Contrary to our expectations, 1480 (> 41%) of the documented patients were ≥ 5 years old when they received orchidopexy for UDT. Is a wide-ranging screening failure the reason for this high rate of late orchidopexies? It has only gradually been accepted over the last two decades that beside the primary (congenital) form of UDT, a non-scrotal position of the testis can also be acquired (ascending testes, secondary cryptorchidism).

A study published in 2003 in the Netherlands postulated acquired UDT to occur three times as often as the more commonly known primary form. Until the 1980s, secondary ascent of the testis was largely unknown, and publications dealing with this topic were titled "Ascent of the Testis: Fact or Fiction" and consisted merely of individual case reports. Motivated by the unexplained advanced age at orchidopexy (mean age: Lamah et al.: 5.5 years; Hack et al.: 6.6 years), several studies have covered the "enigma" of the high rate of late orchidopexies in UDT.

In a study from 2013 by van der Plas et al, 660 cases of non-scrotal testis managed with orchidopexy after the age of 2 were assessed. In more than two-thirds of the cases (n = 421), the previous position of the testes was documented several times before in the clinical records. Thirty-four percent of these cases were primary UDT. For 278 boys (66%), however, a previous scrotal position of the non-scrotal testes had been documented at least twice before (secondary ascent of the testis). Given the retrospective nature of this study, the significance of these findings may be somewhat limited by inter-observer variation.

### The anatomic findings during operative exploration for non-palpable testes: A prospective evaluation [^115F31uv]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted a randomized trial comparing one- and two-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy for intra-abdominal testes. During recruitment, it became apparent that most patients with non-palpable testes do not require vascular division. In this report, we outline the location and quality of testes found during operative exploration in patients who consented to the study but were not randomized.

- **Methods**: Analysis was performed on 80 patients undergoing operative exploration for non-palpable testes between 2007 and 2014. The location and pathology of undescended testes were analyzed.

- **Results**: There were 87 preoperative non-palpable testes in 80 patients who consented but were not randomized to one- or two-stage orchiopexy with vascular division. Forty (46%) of nonrandomized testes were atrophic or absent, and 47 (54%) were normal in appearance. Sixty-eight testes were evaluated via laparoscopy. The most common location for normal (81%) and absent/atrophic (70%) testes was the inguinal canal. Atrophic testes were more often left-sided (72.5%) with normal testes equally divided. Patients with atrophic or absent testicles were more likely to have a closed internal ring (p < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates the majority of patients undergoing operative exploration for non-palpable testes will not require vascular division and instead would be either atrophic or able to undergo traditional orchiopexy.

### Cremasteric reflex and retraction of a testis [^111pViMq]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

A clinical study was designed to define the clinical characteristics of the cremasteric reflex (CR) in relation to the possibility of a prolonged suprascrotal stay of a testis through this reflex.

- **Methods**: Five hundred boys, ranging in age from 3 days to 16 years, were divided into six groups based on age and assessed for the presence of the CR. After evoking the CR, changes in testicular location and the highest position reached by the testis were documented. Testicular position difference (TPD), the duration of testis stay in the highest position (DEP), and the interval for re-evoking the CR (IRCR) were calculated. Reproducibility (R) was recorded based on the number of consecutive responses following repeated stimulations. Mean values for TPD, DEP, IRCR, and R on both sides were calculated and compared across the groups. Boys with a positive reflex were further classified based on TPD, DEP, IRCR, and R values into three equal groups according to their parameter values. Associations among these parameters were analyzed.

- **Results**: Bilateral positive CR was observed in 42.7% of newborns, 36.3% of boys aged 1 month to 1 year, 38.1% of boys aged 2 to 4 years, 75.2% of boys aged 5 to 8 years, 70.3% of boys aged 9 to 12 years, and 72.1% of boys aged 13 to 16 years. The highest percentage of contralateral activations during ipsilateral evocations was found in boys within a specified age range.

### Management of undescended testes: European Association of Urology/European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines [^115zojP6]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Undescended testis is the most common endocrinological disease in the male newborn period. Incidence varies between 1.0% and 4.6% in full-term neonates, with rates as high as 45% in preterm neonates. Failure or delay of treatment can result in reduced fertility and/or increased testicular cancer risk in adulthood.

- **Objective**: To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of boys with undescended testes, which reduce the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer in adulthood.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Embase and PubMed were searched for all relevant publications from 1990 to 2015, limited to English language. Data were narratively synthesized in light of methodological and clinical heterogeneity. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed.

- **Evidence synthesis**: There is consensus that early treatment, by 18 months at the latest, for undescended testes is mandatory to avoid possible sequelae regarding fertility potential and cancer risk. The standard therapy is orchidopexy, while hormonal therapy is still under debate. However, in some individuals, the successful scrotal placement of previously undescended testes may not prevent potential negative long-term outcomes regarding fertility and testicular malignancy.

- **Conclusions**: There is good evidence for early placement of undescended testes in the scrotal position to prevent potential impairment of fertility and reduce the risk of testicular malignancy. No consensus exists on the various forms of hormonal treatment, which are assessed on an individual basis.

### Cryptorchidism: A practical review for all community healthcare providers [^111iMaQ4]. Canadian Urological Association Journal (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cryptorchidism:

- **Definition**: Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is a common congenital abnormality among males characterized by the failure of one or both testes to permanently descend.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cryptorchidism is caused by a disruption in any phase of testicular descent triggered by hereditary, hormonal, anatomical, environmental, or social factors.

- **Disease course**: The disruption in any phase of testicular descent results in cryptorchidism, which causes an increased chance of inguinal hernia, torsion, and trauma, leading to psychological distress in parents. It may also lead to reduced fertility and testicular cancer in adult males.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Orchiectomy for ASA 3 and ASA 4 is associated with a 0.49% and 3.31% mortality risk, respectively.

### The nonpalpable testis: A narrative review [^113g7PRq]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

While the nonpalpable testis represents a small portion of all cryptorchid testes, it remains a clinical challenge for pediatric urologists. Controversy exists surrounding the best evaluation and management of this condition. In this review, we update what is known about the nonpalpable testis, including its etiology, preoperative evaluation, and best surgical management, as well as novel techniques and ongoing controversies.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® and MEDLINE® from January 2000 to January 2017 using relevant key terms. Of 367 articles, 115 were considered for inclusion based on a priori design. Using a narrative review format, an update on the evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis, including novel concepts and techniques, was synthesized.

- **Results**: The nonpalpable testis should be evaluated by physical examination only. Imaging is not indicated for routine cases. The optimal surgical approach and technique remain debatable, but several novel techniques have been described. Due to the rarity of the nonpalpable testis, randomized controlled trials and other quality comparisons are difficult. Therefore, management remains controversial.

- **Conclusions**: Evaluation and management of the nonpalpable testis remain difficult, and some aspects are still debated. Future research should focus on multi-institutional collaborative trials to determine the optimal operative management.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: Guidelines and reality — a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^111CQYCm]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In Germany, the first official treatment guideline for UDT (AWMF-register, no. 006/022) from 1999 targeted orchidopexy to be performed within the first two years of life. In 2009, this guideline recommendation was modified, indicating that operative treatment must be completed by the end of the first year of life. This modification was preceded by consensus statements of several international expert consortiums in 2008. The importance of early orchidopexy in undescended testis can be expressed by the fact that age at orchidopexy has been suggested as a general indicator of the quality of regional child health services.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the age distribution at orchidopexy and determine whether the timing of operative treatment in patients with UDT in Germany is managed according to guideline recommendations. Furthermore, we investigated whether the guideline modification concerning earlier timing of orchidopexy has been implemented in day-to-day clinical routine. In addition, a nationwide survey was carried out to assess primary care pediatricians' attitudes regarding the operative management of UDT.

### Prospective evaluation of human chorionic gonadotropin in the differentiation of undescended testes from retractile testes [^116p7LmE]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the treatment of undescended testis and sought to determine whether HCG assists in differentiating undescended testis from retractile testis.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients with undescended testes were offered HCG. Testis position, laterality, and the presence or absence of a hypoplastic scrotum were noted. The same physician recorded physical findings prospectively and stated clinical impression of descent.

- **Results**: A total of 67 patients with 90 undescended or retractile testes were treated and evaluated with HCG. Of the 64 undescended testes, 13 (20%) descended with HCG therapy, with none requiring subsequent surgery. Of the 26 retractile testes, 15 (58%) descended with HCG (p < 0.001). Based on physical examination, 100% of retractile testes descended if the testis was in the high scrotal position, but only 40% descended if the testis was in the superficial pouch or inguinal area. In the undescended testes group, no ectopic or nonpalpable testis descended with HCG. Evaluation of HCG with age demonstrated minimal response (15%) to HCG at less than 24 months and a peak response between ages 2 and 6 years (75%), with response decreasing thereafter.

- **Conclusions**: HCG may have a limited role in the evaluation of undescended testis in patients younger than 2 years. HCG can serve as an adjunct in the clinical diagnosis of retractile testis in older children.
