## Question

Keppra oral 500mg to Iv conversion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to convert a 500 mg oral levetiracetam (Keppra) regimen to an intravenous dose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether oral and IV formulations are bioequivalent and the conditions under which that equivalence holds. Then, I should verify the practical dose-conversion rule and frequency when switching from oral to IV. Next, I will review IV preparation, dilution, and infusion requirements. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic considerations, especially renal elimination and whether hepatic disease matters. Finally, I should confirm renal dosing and dialysis/CRRT adjustments, clarify when loading doses are indicated, and note any IV duration caveats from labeling.

> Let me first confirm bioequivalence so I don't assume a 1:1 conversion without evidence. The FDA labeling states that equivalent doses of IV and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure when IV is administered as a 15‑minute infusion, and that levetiracetam tablets and injection are bioequivalent, supporting a direct conversion under those conditions [^113KfR5h] [^113Zg911].

> I should now apply the direct conversion principle carefully. If a patient is taking 500 mg orally twice daily, the IV conversion is 500 mg IV every 12 hours to maintain the same total daily dose and frequency; if a patient is taking 500 mg orally once daily, the conversion would be 500 mg IV every 24 hours to match the same total daily dose and frequency, per the labeled instruction to keep the total daily dosage and frequency equivalent during the transition from oral to IV [^112hmvu8].

> Wait, I should double-check that once-daily IV maintenance is actually appropriate in routine practice. The immediate-release formulation is ordinarily dosed twice daily, and IV administration experience is limited to short courses; in most non-dialysis adults, IV maintenance is given every 12 hours rather than once daily, whereas once-daily schedules are typically relevant to extended-release oral regimens or to certain dialysis protocols where daily dosing with post-dialysis supplements is advised; importantly, there is no IV extended-release formulation, and the label notes no clinical study experience with IV administration beyond four days, so when converting an ER once-daily oral regimen to IV, I should use the equivalent total daily dose divided into q12h IV dosing unless a specific renal replacement protocol dictates otherwise [^1154prKF] [^1151bSJd] [^11449osS] [^117N93KB] [^111JJm13].

> Next, I should review IV preparation and infusion requirements to ensure safe administration. Levetiracetam injection is for IV use and should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent and infused over 15 minutes; if smaller volumes are required, do not exceed a final concentration of 15 mg/mL, and compatible diluents include 0.9% sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, and dextrose 5% in water; each single-dose vial contains 500 mg in 5 mL, which is important when calculating the total volume to dilute and infuse [^112giVBm] [^117W6TDa].

> Hold on, I need to confirm the pharmacokinetic basis that guides dose conversion and adjustments. Levetiracetam exhibits linear, time-invariant pharmacokinetics with minimal protein binding, a half-life around 6–8 hours in adults, and approximately 66% renal excretion of unchanged drug; metabolism is non–CYP-based, so drug–drug interactions are limited, and hepatic impairment generally does not necessitate dose adjustment unless associated renal dysfunction is present, which aligns with the emphasis on renal function–based dosing [^113KfR5h] [^112fpHZo] [^115gkhWw].

> I will now examine renal dosing because clearance correlates with creatinine clearance and inappropriate dosing risks under- or overdosing. In mild to severe renal impairment, levetiracetam clearance is reduced by roughly 40–60%, necessitating dose reductions; labeling recommends, for example, lower twice-daily doses for CrCl 30–50 mL/min and CrCl < 30 mL/min, and supplemental dosing after hemodialysis given that a standard 4‑hour session can remove about half of the body pool; conversely, hepatic disease without renal impairment typically requires no adjustment [^112TUniG] [^114hQb7q] [^112cesbW] [^117QAAf2] [^116i72pP].

> Let me be precise about special renal replacement scenarios so I don't gloss over practical dosing. For intermittent hemodialysis, start with daily dosing and give a supplemental post-dialysis dose; for peritoneal dialysis, lower daily dosing is recommended; for continuous renal replacement therapies, higher divided doses such as 750–1000 mg twice daily are commonly used, reflecting continuous clearance in CRRT; these schedules are consistent with SPL dosing recommendations and should be tailored to clinical response and levels when available [^11449osS] [^111JJm13] [^117N93KB] [^116MenY1] [^116XT9gU].

> I need to ensure I separate maintenance conversion from status epilepticus care. No loading dose is required when converting a stable patient from oral to IV maintenance because exposure is equivalent with a 1:1 switch, but in benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus, the recommended IV loading is 60 mg/kg over 10 minutes up to 4,500 mg, which is a different clinical pathway from simple formulation conversion and should not be conflated with maintenance dosing [^112hmvu8] [^116x3BCf].

> Next, I should review safety and operational caveats so the plan is complete. Behavioral and neuropsychiatric adverse effects, somnolence, fatigue, hematologic abnormalities, and rare hypersensitivity or severe cutaneous reactions are recognized; monitoring for mood or behavioral changes is prudent, and as noted, the IV experience in trials spans up to about four days, so patients typically transition back to oral as soon as feasible once enteral access is reliable [^1166tPED] [^1154prKF].

The oral and IV forms of levetiracetam are bioequivalent [^113KfR5h], so **no dose adjustment** is needed when switching from 500 mg PO BID to IV 500 mg BID [^112hmvu8]. Administer each 500 mg IV dose over 15 minutes [^112giVBm], diluted to a maximum of 15 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl, D5W, or lactated Ringer's [^112giVBm]; **do not exceed 3,000 mg/day** [^112hmvu8]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment [^112TUniG] and give a supplemental dose after hemodialysis [^117N93KB] [^114hQb7q].

---

## Pharmacokinetic equivalence

- **Bioequivalence**: Oral and IV levetiracetam are bioequivalent [^113KfR5h], with similar Cmax, Cmin, and AUC when IV is infused over 15 minutes [^113Zg911].
- **Linear kinetics**: Levetiracetam shows linear, time-invariant pharmacokinetics [^113KfR5h] with low variability.
- **Protein binding**: Minimal protein binding (< 10%) [^113Zg911] and a volume of distribution near total body water [^113KfR5h].
- **Elimination**: About 66% is excreted unchanged in urine [^112fpHZo]; the main inactive metabolite is renally excreted [^113KfR5h].
- **Half-life**: Approximately 6–8 hours in adults [^113KfR5h], prolonged in renal impairment and the elderly [^115gkhWw].

---

## Recommended IV dosing regimen

- **Dose**: 500 mg IV every 12 hours (BID), matching the oral regimen [^115AH8Pp] [^112hmvu8] [^113w3TZk].
- **Infusion**: Administer each dose over 15 minutes [^112giVBm].
- **Dilution**: Dilute to a maximum of 15 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl, D5W, or lactated Ringer's [^112giVBm].
- **Daily maximum**: Do not exceed 3,000 mg/day [^112hmvu8].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce dose based on creatinine clearance [^112TUniG]; give a supplemental dose after hemodialysis [^117N93KB] [^114hQb7q].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No adjustment needed [^112TUniG], but monitor closely in severe hepatic disease.
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for somnolence, fatigue, behavioral changes, and hematologic abnormalities [^1166tPED] [^114nXYAA].
- **Abrupt discontinuation**: Avoid abrupt stops to prevent withdrawal seizures or status epilepticus [^114nXYAA] [^114RVLEK].

## Summary table: oral to IV conversion

| **Oral dose** | **IV dose** | **Infusion time** | **Dilution** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| 500 mg BID | 500 mg IV BID | 15 minutes [^112giVBm] | ≤ 15 mg/mL | 3,000 mg/day |
| 1,000 mg BID | 1,000 mg IV BID | 15 minutes | ≤ 15 mg/mL [^112giVBm] | 3,000 mg/day [^112hmvu8] |

---

Switching from oral to IV levetiracetam is a 1:1 conversion [^112hmvu8]; **no dose adjustment** is required [^113KfR5h]. Use a 15-minute infusion [^112giVBm], appropriate dilution [^112giVBm], and adjust for renal impairment to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize adverse effects [^114hQb7q].

### Levetiracetam [^112giVBm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam injection is for intravenous use only and should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent prior to administration. If a smaller volume is required (e.g. pediatric patients), the amount of diluent should be calculated to not exceed a maximum levetiracetam concentration of 15 mg per mL of diluted solution. Consideration should also be given to the total daily fluid intake of the patient. Levetiracetam injection should be administered as a 15-minute IV infusion. One vial of levetiracetam injection contains 500 mg levetiracetam (500 mg/5 mL).

- **Diluents and storage**: Levetiracetam injection may be mixed with the following diluents and antiepileptic drugs and may be stored in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at controlled room temperature [15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F)].

	- **Diluents**:
		- Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP
		- Lactated Ringer's injection
		- Dextrose 5% injection, USP

	- **Other Antiepileptic Drugs**:
		- Lorazepam
		- Diazepam
		- Valproate sodium

	- There are no data to support the physical compatibility of levetiracetam injection with antiepileptic drugs that are not listed above.

- **Inspection and disposal**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used. Any unused portion of the levetiracetam injection vial contents should be discarded.

- **Adults**:

Refer to the relevant guidelines for the recommended preparation and administration of levetiracetam injection.

### Levetiracetam [^114hQb7q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function, and supplemental doses should be given to patients after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### Levetiracetam [^113KfR5h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (less than 10% bound), and its volume of distribution closely approximates the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of the dose) involves enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not dependent on liver cytochrome P450. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. This half-life increases in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, and in subjects with renal impairment.

### Levetiracetam [^112hmvu8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosing for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures**:

	- **Adults 16 years of age and older**: Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, administered as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied.

	- **Pediatric patients 6 to < 16 years of age**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg, divided into 2 doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg twice daily) to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.

- **Switching from oral dosing**: When transitioning from oral levetiracetam, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of levetiracetam should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral levetiracetam.

- **Switching to oral dosing**: At the end of the intravenous treatment period, patients may be transitioned to levetiracetam oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam, zonisamide, or lamotrigine for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^113w3TZk]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed as monotherapy for patients with focal epilepsy. However, there is uncertainty regarding their recommendation as first-line treatments due to insufficient evidence of their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The aim was to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine in individuals with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.

- **Methods**: This randomised, open-label, controlled trial compared levetiracetam and zonisamide with lamotrigine as first-line treatments for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) who experienced two or more unprovoked focal seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) using a minimisation programme with a random element to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide compared to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission.

Anti-seizure medications were administered orally. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1.5 mg/kg twice per day.

### The case for levetiracetam to be included in essential medicine lists [^115NA1Ef]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfills the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, it neither has the propensity for clinically relevant drug interactions, nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution, and injectable forms, making it suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalised epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin, but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required apart from some situations, such as pregnancy, adherence check, and critical illnesses at extremes of age.

Adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:

- **Behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms**
- **Somnolence and fatigue**
- **Anaphylaxis and angioedema**
- **Serious dermatological reactions**
- **Coordination difficulties**
- **Hematologic abnormalities**
- **Increase in blood pressure**

Clinical trials experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The adverse reactions resulting from levetiracetam injection use include all of those reported for levetiracetam tablets and oral solution. Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Partial-onset seizures in adults

In controlled clinical studies using levetiracetam tablets in adults with partial-onset seizures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], the most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than the placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, and infection.

---

### Levetiracetam [^113Zg911]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

- **Distribution**:
	- The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmax after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time-independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0 to 12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUCinf following an equivalent single dose.

	- Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.

- **Metabolism**:
	- Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring.

### Levetiracetam [^112fpHZo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and remains unchanged by dose, route, or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation through renal excretion as unchanged drug, representing 66% of the administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg, and renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The excretion mechanism involves glomerular filtration followed by partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite UCB L057 is excreted through glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated with creatinine clearance, and its clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Elderly**: Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (ages 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration with twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38%, and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults, most likely due to decreased renal function in these subjects.

### Keppra [^115gkhWw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. It is eliminated from the systemic circulation through renal excretion as unchanged drug, which represents 66% of the administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg, and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption.

The metabolite UCB L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated with creatinine clearance, and its clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Elderly**: Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61–88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38%, and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.

### Levetiracetam [^112TUniG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min), and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

### Effectiveness of intravenous levetiracetam as an adjunctive treatment in pediatric refractory status epilepticus [^114hgXuv]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Intravenous levetiracetam (LEV) has been shown to be effective and safe in treating adults with refractory status epilepticus (SE). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous LEV for pediatric patients with refractory SE.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective medical-record review of pediatric patients who were treated with intravenous LEV for refractory SE. Clinical information regarding age, sex, seizure type, and underlying neurological status was collected. We evaluated other anticonvulsants that were used prior to administration of intravenous LEV and assessed loading dose, response to treatment, and any adverse events from intravenous LEV administration.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (8 boys and 6 girls) received intravenous LEV for the treatment of refractory SE. The mean age of the patients was 4.4 ± 5.5 years (range, 4 days to 14.6 years). Ten of the patients were neurologically healthy prior to the refractory SE, and the other 4 had been previously diagnosed with epilepsy. The mean loading dose of intravenous LEV was 26 ± 4.6 mg/kg (range, 20–30 mg/kg). Seizure termination occurred in 6 (43%) of the 14 patients. In particular, 4 (57%) of the 7 patients younger than 2 years showed seizure termination. No immediate adverse events occurred during or after infusions.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrated that the adjunctive use of intravenous LEV was effective and well tolerated in pediatric patients with refractory SE, even in patients younger than 2 years. Intravenous LEV should be considered as an effective and safe treatment.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy [^116fut3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001).

The majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 30% develop refractory seizures, particularly those with partial seizures. In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam on seizures, side effects, quality of life, and cognition when used as an add-on treatment for patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000). In addition, we contacted UCB SA (makers of levetiracetam) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of levetiracetam in patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) side effects; (d) cognitive effects; (e) quality of life. Primary analyses were intention to treat, and sensitivity best and worst case analyses were also undertaken. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each outcome. Dose response was evaluated in detail.

### A prospective analysis of the outcome of levetiracetam in clinical practice [^116685oR]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In this post-licensing surveillance study conducted within a large unselected population, data were collected prospectively on all patients prescribed levetiracetam (LEV) at a regional epilepsy clinic over a two-year period. A total of 245 patients (69.2%) remained on LEV, with 8.8% achieving remission and some improvement in seizure control observed in 49.3%. Sedation was identified as the most common adverse effect, occurring in 10.7% of patients, but mood disturbance was more likely to lead to discontinuation, affecting 4.8%. The cumulative probability of remaining on LEV at 12 months was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79). Factors predictive of poorer retention included a greater number of prior antiepileptic drugs and a faster initial titration regimen.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials, including adults with refractory partial epilepsy. Two were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it were an independent parallel-group study. A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation; it included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures.

The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 mg/day.

### Levetiracetam [^113ruN5U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric patients were examined to assess the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Intravenous formulation**: A population pharmacokinetic analysis for the intravenous formulation was conducted in 49 pediatric patients (1 month to < 16 years of age) weighing 3 to 79 kg. Patients received levetiracetam as a 15-minute IV infusion at doses between 14 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day twice daily. Plasma concentrations and model-derived steady-state exposure AUC(0 to 12) were within the exposure range observed in pediatric patients receiving equivalent doses of the oral solution.

- **Oral formulations**: Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6 to 12 years) following a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of the immediate release formulation of levetiracetam. The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.

- **Repeat dose pharmacokinetic study**: Conducted in pediatric patients (age 4 to 12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day of the immediate release formulation of levetiracetam. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption at all doses, with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across all dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in pediatric patients were linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

### Seizure risk in brain tumor patients with conversion to generic levetiracetam [^1174vDhQ]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Breakthrough seizure activity has been reported with the conversion from brand name to generic anticonvulsants. This has prompted several organizations to support physician notification of generic substitution and patient consent. Recently, a generic formulation of levetiracetam has become available, but the risk of seizures with generic levetiracetam has yet to be reported. A review of the literature regarding the risk of generic substitution revealed four cases of seizure activity in primary brain tumor patients after conversion from Keppra to generic levetiracetam. In all cases, there was no evidence of tumor growth or concurrent illness that would increase the risk of seizures. In three cases, the patients have remained seizure-free with conversion back to Keppra. The final patient required an increased dose of levetiracetam. As has been described with the generic substitution of other anticonvulsants, patients switched to generic levetiracetam may be at risk for breakthrough seizure activity.

### Prospective, randomized, single-blinded comparative trial of intravenous levetiracetam versus phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis [^113rvbRQ]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Anti-epileptic drugs are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis after neurological injury. We performed a study comparing intravenous (IV) levetiracetam (LEV) to IV phenytoin (PHT) for seizure prophylaxis after neurological injury.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, single-center, randomized, single-blinded comparative trial of LEV versus PHT (2:1 ratio) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (NCT00618436), patients received an IV load with either LEV or fosphenytoin followed by standard IV doses of LEV or PHT. Doses were adjusted to maintain therapeutic serum PHT concentrations or if patients had seizures. Continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring was performed for the initial 72 hours; outcome data were collected.

- **Results**: A total of 52 patients were randomized (LEV = 34; PHT = 18); 89% had sTBI. When controlling for baseline severity, LEV patients experienced better long-term outcomes than those on PHT; the Disability Rating Scale score was lower at 3 months (P = 0.042) and the Glasgow Outcomes Scale score was higher at 6 months (P = 0.039). There were no differences between groups in seizure occurrence during cEEG (LEV 5/34 vs. PHT 3/18; P = 1.0) or at 6 months (LEV 1/20 vs. PHT 0/14; P = 1.0), and mortality (LEV 14/34 vs. PHT 4/18; P = 0.227). There were no differences in side effects between groups (all P > 0.15) except for a lower frequency of worsened neurological status (P = 0.024) and gastrointestinal problems (P = 0.043) in LEV-treated patients.

- **Conclusions**: This study of LEV versus PHT for seizure prevention in the NSICU showed improved long-term outcomes for LEV patients.

### Safety and efficacy of levetiracetam for critically ill patients with seizures [^112XUQpF]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, treatment for seizures or status epilepticus with intravenous benzodiazepines or conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, may lead to cardiovascular depression or hypotension. Levetiracetam (LVM) is a novel AED that does not undergo extensive liver metabolism, does not require drug level monitoring, and is not associated with hemodynamic instability. We retrospectively analyzed the use, safety, and efficacy of LVM in ICU patients.

- **Methods**: Collected data included age, sex, therapy indication and duration, dosing regimen, documented seizure activity, ICU admission diagnoses, length of ICU stay, serum creatinine, liver function tests, adverse reactions, concomitant use of other AEDs, and drug interactions.

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients were identified (26 males; mean (SD) age, 58.2 (19.8) years). Most patients (65%) did not receive a loading dose; the most common loading dose was 1,500 mg (50% of 18 patients). The most common maintenance dose was 500 mg twice daily (59% of 51 patients), and average duration of therapy was 13.6 (12.7) days. Approximately 47% of patients had preexisting liver disease, and 25% had elevated serum creatinine. Twenty-two patients received LVM therapy for seizure prophylaxis; 29 for acute seizure treatment. Ninety-three percent of patients treated with LVM for acute seizures had no subsequent seizures; the remaining patients (7%) required additional AEDs. One patient receiving LVM for seizure prophylaxis had documented seizures requiring additional AEDs. No adverse hemodynamic instability was reported.

### Levetiracetam [^112RVAi6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following a single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (aged 1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The half-life of levetiracetam in these pediatric patients was shorter (5.3 hours) than in adults (7.2 hours), and the apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that body weight significantly correlated with the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased as body weight increased.

- **Pregnancy**: Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Gender**: Levetiracetam Cmax and AUC were 20% higher in women (N = 11) compared to men (N = 12). However, when adjusted for body weight, clearances were comparable.

- **Race**: Formal pharmacokinetic studies on racial effects have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons between Caucasians (N = 12) and Asians (N = 12) show that the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. As levetiracetam is primarily excreted renally, and no significant racial differences in creatinine clearance exist, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy: An updated Cochrane review [^115Tz7Qz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Epilepsy is an important neurological condition, and drug resistance in epilepsy is particularly common in individuals with focal seizures. In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as add-on treatment for controlling drug-resistant focal epilepsy. This is an update to a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2001.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam, added to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 7, 2012), and MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012). We also contacted the manufacturers of levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in focal seizure frequency (response); less than 50% reduction in focal seizure frequency (non-response); treatment withdrawal; adverse effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behavior); cognitive effects, and quality of life (QoL). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of e.

### Levetiracetam [^115CtwbA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved ≥ 50% reduction in weekly seizure rates from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) is presented in Figure 4.

- **Effectiveness in partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years of age**:
	- Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). It was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG, on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo.

	- **Randomization stratification by age range**:
		Patients were stratified by age range as follows:
		- 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam)
		- 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam)
		- 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam)
		- 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam)

### Optimal dosing of levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in critically ill patients: A prospective observational study [^114XPUXL]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Critically ill patients eliminate levetiracetam (LEV) more rapidly than healthy controls, yet low doses are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in the ICU setting. We compared the rates of achievement of target serum levels and new-onset seizure (clinical and/or electrographic) among patients who received low (500 mg bid) versus high (750–1,000 mg bid) dose LEV.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care, academic center.

- **Patients**: We included patients who received prophylactic LEV following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, or supratentorial neurosurgery between 2019 and 2021. Patients with a history of seizure, antiseizure medication use, or renal failure requiring dialysis were excluded.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements**: LEV levels were obtained at steady state. The impact of low-dose versus high-dose LEV on the primary outcome of target LEV levels (12–46 μg/mL), and the secondary outcome of clinical and/or electrographic seizure, were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, LEV loading dose, BMI, primary diagnosis, and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

- **Main results**: Of the 205 subjects included in analyses, n = 106 (52%) received LEV 500 mg bid (median 13 mg/kg/d), and n = 99 (48%) received LEV 750–1,000 mg bid (median 25 mg/kg/d). Overall, 111 of 205 patients (54%) achieved target levels: 48 (45%) from the low-dose group versus 63 (64%) from the high-dose group (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; p = 0.009). In multivariable analyses, high-dose LEV was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving target levels.

### A missed opportunity - consequences of unknown levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a peritoneal dialysis patient [^113UDb4j]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Several guidelines list levetiracetam as the drug of first choice for adult patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization and as the second choice for patients in status epilepticus. Levetiracetam (molecular weight 170.2 Da) is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion, with a bioavailability of almost 100%. Peak concentrations are reached 1.3 hours after ingestion. Neither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolites are bound to plasma proteins. Its volume of distribution is 0.5–0.7 l/kg. The elimination half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hours. Only about a quarter of the dose is metabolized by enzymatic hydrolysis in the blood. The cumulative renal excretion rate of levetiracetam is 66% in the first 48 hours.

These pharmacokinetic coordinates vividly illustrate that meticulous attention must be paid when patients with chronic kidney disease are treated. It has been advocated to decrease the dose in parallel with the decline of the glomerular filtration rate. For patients "on dialysis", the package insert suggests a dose of 500–1000 mg once a day. As the small unbound molecule is easily removed by dialysis, a supplemental dose of 250–500 mg after dialysis is suggested. Despite the fact that levetiracetam was approved 13 years ago, there are no data for dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients. We therefore analyzed pharmacokinetic data of levetiracetam in a patient on peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of partial seizures.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of valproate versus levetiracetam for newly diagnosed generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^1145U33t]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult-to-classify epilepsy, but it is not recommended for women of child-bearing potential due to its teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations, despite the scarcity of evidence regarding its clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy.

- **Methods**: An open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. A total of 69 centres across the UK, comprising adult and paediatric neurology services, recruited participants aged 5 years or older, with no upper age limit, who had experienced two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either levetiracetam or valproate, using a minimisation programme with a random element. Participants and investigators were aware of the treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for both levetiracetam and valproate. For children aged 5–12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. The SANAD II study was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for treatment.

### Levetiracetam dosing optimization in neurocritical care population: Neuro-ARC study [^1169Kku8]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam, a first-line antiseizure medication, is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with approximately 66% renal elimination. Consequently, its pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by kidney function. Augmented renal clearance (ARC), a condition characterized by renal hyperfiltration, is frequently observed in critical care settings and can profoundly impact the disposition of renally eliminated drugs such as levetiracetam. Our objectives were to characterize levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neurocritical care patients, identify covariates significantly influencing drug clearance, and provide clinicians with optimal dosage recommendations in those with and without ARC.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study involving patients admitted to the participating centers with life-threatening neurological illnesses. Each participant had up to four plasma samples collected, and the samples were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The creatinine clearance (CL CR) of enrolled participants was measured using the 8-hour urine collection method (measured CL CR [mCL CR]). Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using Monolix software. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explore various dosage strategies and to suggest optimal levetiracetam regimens.

- **Results**: Our study included 50 patients, with 35 patients (70%) experiencing ARC. Trough levetiracetam levels were significantly lower in the ARC group compared with the no-ARC group (median [interquartile range] 4.4 [11.5] vs.

### Valproate sodium [^111Ac19i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Bioavailability: Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) valproate and oral valproate products are expected to result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to the valproate ion when the IV valproate is administered as a 60-minute infusion. However, the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation used. These differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.

Administration of divalproex sodium tablets and IV valproate (given as a one-hour infusion), 250 mg every 6 hours for 4 days to 18 healthy male volunteers, resulted in equivalent AUC, Cmax, and Cmin at steady state, as well as after the first dose. The Tmax after IV valproate sodium occurs at the end of the one-hour infusion, while the Tmax after oral dosing with divalproex sodium occurs at approximately 4 hours. Because the kinetics of unbound valproate are linear, bioequivalence between valproate sodium and divalproex sodium up to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/kg/day can be assumed. The AUC and Cmax resulting from the administration of IV valproate 500 mg as a single one-hour infusion and a single 500 mg dose of divalproex sodium syrup to 17 healthy male volunteers were also equivalent.

Patients maintained on valproic acid doses of 750 mg to 4,250 mg daily (given in divided doses every 6 hours) as oral divalproex sodium alone (n = 24) or with another stabilized antiepileptic drug [carbamazepine (n = 15), phenytoin (n = 11), or phenobarbital (n = 1)], showed comparable plasma levels for valproic acid.

### KeppraXR [^1151bSJd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Absorption and distribution

Extended-release levetiracetam peak plasma concentrations occur in about 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentrations is approximately 3 hours longer with extended-release levetiracetam than with immediate-release tablets.

A single administration of two 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets once daily produced comparable maximal plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve as did the administration of one 500 mg immediate-release tablet taken twice daily under fasting conditions. After multiple doses of extended-release levetiracetam tablets, the extent of exposure (AUC0–24) was similar to the extent of exposure after multiple doses of immediate-release tablets. Cmax and Cmin were lower by 17% and 26%, respectively, after multiple doses of extended-release levetiracetam compared to multiple doses of the immediate-release tablets. Intake of a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast before the administration of extended-release levetiracetam resulted in a higher peak concentration and a longer median time to peak. The median time to peak (Tmax) was 2 hours longer in the fed state.

Two 750 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets were bioequivalent to a single administration of three 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets.

Metabolism

Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose), and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.

### Prospective open-label, single-arm, multicenter, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic studies of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy [^116DKerg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam given via intravenous administration has been shown to be an effective alternative in adults with epilepsy when oral administration is not feasible. This study was a prospective single-arm, multicenter study to assess tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous levetiracetam in children with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy aged 1 month to 16 years, requiring intravenous levetiracetam, were enrolled.

Assessments included vital signs, electrocardiogram, hematology, chemistry, plasma concentrations of antiepileptic medications, weight, physical/neurological examinations, and pharmacokinetics. A total of 52 patients were enrolled. Mild to moderate treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 63%, with the most frequent being pyrexia and dry mouth. Most other treatment-emergent adverse events were considered unrelated to intravenous levetiracetam administration. Therefore, intravenous levetiracetam in the acute setting was overall well tolerated in children aged 1 month to 16 years.

### Levetiracetam for the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic seizures [^112EPmjt]. Neurology (2008). High credibility.

Currently, no published randomized controlled trials evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive antiepileptic therapy in idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic seizures.

- **Methods**: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial assessed the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive treatment with levetiracetam at 3,000 mg/day in adolescents (≥ 12 years) and adults. The trial involved participants experiencing ≥ 8 days of myoclonic seizures during a prospective 8-week baseline period, despite antiepileptic monotherapy. The 8-week baseline period was followed by a 4-week up-titration, a 12-week evaluation, and a 6-week down-titration/conversion period.

- **Results**: Of the 122 patients randomized, 120 (levetiracetam, n = 60; placebo, n = 60) were evaluable. Diagnoses were either juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (93.4%) or juvenile absence epilepsy (6.6%). A reduction of ≥ 50% in the number of days per week with myoclonic seizures was observed in 58.3% of patients in the levetiracetam group and 23.3% of patients in the placebo group (p < 0.001) during the treatment period. Levetiracetam-treated patients were more likely to respond to treatment than those receiving placebo (OR = 4.77; 95% CI, 2.12 to 10.77; p < 0.001). Additionally, levetiracetam-treated patients showed higher rates of freedom from myoclonic seizures (25.0% vs. 5.0%; p = 0.004) and all seizure types (21.7% vs. 1.7%; p < 0.001) during the evaluation period. The only adverse events more frequently observed with levetiracetam were somnolence and neck pain.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that levetiracetam is an effective adjunctive treatment for individuals experiencing idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic seizures.

### Levetiracetam [^1154prKF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The recommended dosing regimen for partial-onset seizures is consistent for both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, as outlined below. Notably, there is no clinical study experience with the administration of intravenous levetiracetam for periods longer than four days.

- **Adults 16 years of age and older**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg, administered as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments of 1000 mg per day may be administered every two weeks, up to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. Evidence does not support additional benefits for doses exceeding 3000 mg per day.

- **Pediatric patients**:
	- **1 month to < 6 months**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg, divided into two doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg until reaching the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). During clinical trials, the mean daily dose for this age group was 35 mg/kg.

	- **6 months to < 4 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg, divided into two doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). After two weeks, increase the daily dose by 20 mg/kg increments to reach the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). Should the patient be unable to tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the dose may be reduced. The mean daily dose observed in clinical trials for this age group was 47 mg/kg.

	- **4 years to < 16 years**: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every two weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily).

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^113c5m4r]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Study design**: A dose-escalation study titrating eLVT to seizure freedom based upon cEEG and limited by toxicity with pre-specified stopping rules.

	- **Randomized controlled trial**: Using the dose of eLVT identified as effective in the dose-escalation study, we conducted an open-label RCT of eLVT compared to phenobarbital for acute seizure control [see study protocol, Additional file 1]. PK data were obtained throughout.

	- **Patient population**: Studies were conducted on the Paediatric Research Ward (PRW) of Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. All aspects of this study received ethical review in Malawi and the US.

	- **Inclusion criteria**: PRW admission; age 24–83 months; Blantyre Coma Score (BCS) ≤ 2; P. falciparum infection; no other known coma etiology; seizures within past 24 hours; guardian written consent.

	- **Exclusion criteria**: Serum creatinine (SCr) > 2 mg/dL; use of enzyme-inducing medication in past 14 days; contraindication for nasogastric tube (NGT) and/or administration of enteral medications. For the RCT, additional exclusions were treatment with > 2 doses of short-acting antiseizure drug (ASD) in the past 12 hours or a long-acting ASD in the past 3 days.

	- **Randomization**: Patients were block randomized with randomly selected block sizes of 4 and 6. Treatment was allocated based on a pre-defined randomly generated list with assignment available through the OpenClinica database or sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes prepared by the Biomedical Research Informatics Core at Michigan State University.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^112a49wq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

This study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), investigated the use of enteral levetiracetam (eLVT) for treating acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria.

Children allocated to eLVT received the optimal dose identified in the Dose-Escalation Study for 72 hours. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were assessed at the start and at 7 and 24 hours, extending to 4–40 hours after the last dose. If clinical or electrographic seizures recurred or continued after the initial eLVT dose, an LVT level at the time of failure was captured. Escalation to the next dosing strata occurred, and more frequent PK assessments followed at intervals of 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 hours. Benzodiazepines (maximum of 2 doses per 24 hours) were administered as needed to address breakthrough seizures and allow time for eLVT absorption.

- **Dose escalation study**: Designed to identify effective dosing for most patients, this study did not delineate the dose of eLVT for children with refractory seizures or status epilepticus. Escalating therapy is commonly used for treating refractory seizures. Given eLVT's established safety profile in other populations and data indicating higher doses can benefit refractory seizures, this study allowed for crossover to phenobarbital (PB) if higher dose LVT proved ineffective. Insights into clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of escalating eLVT in this population were a key outcome. Consequently, eLVT dose escalation was undertaken for children who failed the standard dose.

- **RCT year 1**: Children randomized to 'usual care' received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg load, then 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for 72 hours.
- **RCT year 2**: The Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended changes to the 'usual care' protocol; however, details are incomplete due to truncation.

### Safety and tolerability of rapid administration undiluted levetiracetam [^117JykKe]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is an antiepileptic drug used widely in patients with a favorable safety profile. Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) LEV included volumes of at least 100 mL. Minimally diluted doses administered over 5–6 minutes were found to be both safe and effective. Given the complexities of admixing, this practice can be impractical and result in delays in antiepileptic therapy. This study aimed to retrospectively review the safety and tolerability of rapid administration of undiluted LEV doses ≤ 1000 mg.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study evaluating adverse drug reactions associated with undiluted LEV from January 1, 2018, to June 1, 2018. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of undiluted LEV and were ≥ 18 years old. Safety endpoints were reviewed and collected from the time of administration until hospital discharge. Endpoints included injection site pain and discomfort, injection site erythema, extravasation, IV line replacement, and any documented adverse effect leading to IV LEV discontinuation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.

- **Results**: A total of 199 patients were included in the study, totaling 1626 doses of LEV. Most patients were administered LEV 1000 mg (60.8%), through a peripheral line (64.3%), and were prescribed LEV for seizure prophylaxis (58.3%). Patients received a mean of 8.1 ± 8 doses for a mean duration of therapy of 5 ± 4.5 days. About 98.5% of patients did not experience an adverse effect, whereas 1.5% of patients experienced agitation, delirium, confusion, and/or lethargy.

### The long term retention of levetiracetam in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy [^116Q1M3f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam (Lev) is a new antiepileptic drug with a distinct mechanism of action, shown in regulatory trials to be effective. These controlled trials do not always predict how useful a drug will be in day-to-day clinical practice. Retention rates can provide a better indication of efficacy and tolerability in everyday use. Patients attending a tertiary referral centre for epilepsy and who received Lev in the first two years of its marketing were assessed (n = 811) to determine continuation rates of treatment with this drug. At the last follow-up, 65% of patients were still taking Lev, and the estimated three-year retention rate was 58%. In total, 11% attained seizure freedom of at least six months. Patients taking greater numbers of concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were more likely to discontinue Lev, and those reaching higher maximum daily dosages were less likely to discontinue Lev. The retention rate for Lev compares favourably with that of other new AEDs.

### SPL drug information for levetiracetam ER [^116wTWim]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of levetiracetam ER PO (also known as Keppra XR) are critical for patient safety and successful treatment outcomes:

- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Behavioral or personality changes**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral changes, including aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, and personality disorder.

- **Exacerbation of seizures**: Do not discontinue abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus.

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.

- **Incoordination**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of coordination difficulties, including ataxia, abnormal gait, and incoordination.

- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.

- **Somnolence**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of somnolence and fatigue.

- **Suicidal ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

### Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus (EcLiPSE): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^117Gy9R6]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Other treatment-related factors might be relevant to the interpretation of our findings, including the widespread use of levetiracetam as maintenance therapy for many childhood epilepsies due to its broad-spectrum activity and safety profile. In the EcLiPSE trial participants, levetiracetam was the most commonly used oral antiepileptic drug at the time of presentation. Anecdotally, clinicians are reluctant to administer a loading dose of phenytoin to children in convulsive status epilepticus who are on oral maintenance phenytoin due to potential cardiovascular toxicity. There seemed to be no similar concerns for levetiracetam, and no increase in adverse events was observed when administering 40 mg/kg to children already receiving maintenance levetiracetam.

A substantial minority of children who present in convulsive status epilepticus for the first time are subsequently commenced on maintenance therapy. Levetiracetam is more likely than phenytoin to be used as maintenance therapy due to phenytoin's adverse event profile and complex pharmacokinetics. One observational study in adults showed that 8% of patients treated with intravenous fosphenytoin for convulsive status epilepticus were subsequently commenced on oral phenytoin, whereas 78% of those treated with intravenous levetiracetam were subsequently commenced on oral levetiracetam.

Ease of drug preparation and administration is also a factor in the management of convulsive status epilepticus. Throughout the EcLiPSE trial, clinical teams in the participating centres reported that levetiracetam was easier to prepare.

### Intravenous levetiracetam as treatment for status epilepticus [^116j99iL]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

There are established drugs for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE), but their potentially hazardous side effects are well known. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel anticonvulsant available for intravenous (i.v.) application. It could serve as an alternative when standard drugs fail or should be avoided.

We retrospectively identified patients from two German teaching hospitals who were treated with i.v. LEV for SE. Their charts were reviewed regarding sociodemographic data, type, etiology, onset and duration of SE, dose of LEV, concurrent antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, tolerability, and outcome. Thirty-two patients (15 female) were found who were treated with i.v. LEV for SE, with a median age of 71 years.

- **Patient treatment**: Two patients were exclusively treated with LEV. Eight received a low dose, and a further 20 patients received a high dose of benzodiazepines before LEV. Two patients were treated with LEV to enable discontinuation of narcosis. SE was generalized convulsive in five patients, nonconvulsive in 20, and simple focal in seven patients.

- **Etiology and therapy**: Etiology was acute 13 times and remote symptomatic 16 times, with three instances of unknown etiology. Therapy was initiated within a median time of 3 hours, and i.v. LEV was applied within a median time of 6 hours. The median LEV bolus was 2,000 mg, and the median total dose on day 1 was 3,500 mg.

- **Outcome and adverse effects**: Benzodiazepines plus i.v. LEV terminated SE in 23 patients without the application of additional anticonvulsants, with 10 patients responding within 30 minutes. LEV could not terminate SE in seven patients. We documented nausea and emesis in one patient and elevation of liver enzymes in another, which were likely to be attributed to LEV.

### The SANAD II study of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam, zonisamide, or lamotrigine for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy: an open-label, non-inferiority, multicentre, phase 4, randomised controlled trial [^1112Bii1]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

The SANAD II study aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared to lamotrigine in individuals with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Levetiracetam and zonisamide, although licensed as monotherapy for focal epilepsy, have uncertain recommendations as first-line treatments due to limited evidence on their clinical and cost-effectiveness.

This randomised, open-label, controlled trial enrolled participants who were five years or older with two or more unprovoked focal seizures, recruited from adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide using a minimisation programme with a random allocation method. The study was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome, which was the time to a 12-month remission.

- **Participant and treatment details**: Participants and investigators were unmasked and informed of the treatment allocations. Anti-seizure medications were administered orally. For participants aged 12 years and older, the initial recommended maintenance doses were 50 mg of lamotrigine in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, levetiracetam at 500 mg twice daily, and zonisamide at 100 mg twice daily. For children aged 5 to 12 years, the advised initial daily maintenance dose of lamotrigine was 1.5 mg/kg.

### Status epilepticus prognosis following levetiracetam administration: Analysis of loading doses [^117T5nhn]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Recommended loading doses of levetiracetam (LEV) for status epilepticus (SE) treatment have increased over time. However, this was not evidence-based, and the benefit of the increase remains unclear. The effect of different LEV loading doses on SE prognosis was explored.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective analysis of an SE adult registry (January 2016-December 2021), including patients receiving LEV as a second-line SE treatment. Patients were stratified according to LEV loading doses (threshold 35 mg/kg). Main outcomes were global mortality, LEV use as last SE treatment, and return to baseline conditions at discharge, exploring LEV as a dichotomized or continuous dose.

- **Results**: Among 202 patients, 44 received LEV at ≥ 35 mg/kg and 158 below it. Global mortality, adjusted for SE severity and potentially fatal aetiology, was more frequent in the high LEV dose group (27.2% vs. 17.1%, odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.23–8.06; p = 0.017), whilst LEV prescription as last treatment and return to baseline conditions were comparable. Considering continuous LEV dosages or mortality in ongoing SE, however, no outcome reached statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: Lower LEV loading doses do not seem to correlate with worse clinical outcome, challenging guidelines. Further studies, ideally prospective, are needed on this topic.

### Adverse events of undiluted intravenous push levetiracetam [^113phhSf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

In patients who experience a seizure, the seizure duration is a strong indicator of prognosis. Thus, reducing the time to administer antiepileptic medications in patients who are actively seizing is critical. While findings from retrospective studies suggest that the rapid administration of undiluted intravenous (IV) levetiracetam may be safe, some gaps in the literature remain.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this research study was to prospectively assess adverse events associated with the rapid administration of undiluted IV levetiracetam.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who received rapid administration of undiluted IV levetiracetam at doses up to 4500 mg in the emergency department (ED) of a large community, teaching hospital. The primary endpoint was the incidence of any pre-defined adverse event. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of each type of adverse event, the incidence of seizure termination, and the time to completion of drug administration in patients actively seizing at the time of study inclusion.

- **Results**: A total of 321 doses of IV push levetiracetam were ordered for 318 patients, and 250 patients were subsequently included. Fourteen (5.6%) patients experienced an adverse event, most commonly due to injection site reactions (9/14). Clinically relevant hypotension, tachycardia, and hypertension occurred in five patients. For actively seizing patients, 79% (15/19) achieved seizure termination, and the median time from medication order to completion of therapy was 12 minutes.

- **Conclusion**: This study found that the rapid administration of undiluted IV levetiracetam is associated with a low incidence of adverse events, with injection site reactions being the most common.

### Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in patients with moderate to severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C): characterization by dynamic liver function tests [^112xgCvL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug approved for use as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. We sought to investigate possible changes in the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its metabolite ucb L057 in patients with liver cirrhosis, who may require dose adjustments.

- **Methods**: A single dose of levetiracetam was administered to five healthy subjects and to patients with Child-Pugh class A (n = 5), B (n = 6), or C (n = 5) alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and ucb L057 were measured and correlated with biochemical liver function parameters, with creatinine clearance, and with the kinetics of caffeine, lidocaine, and d-sorbitol as probes for specific liver functions.

- **Results**: Dynamic liver function tests revealed a deterioration of liver function. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its metabolite did not differ between healthy subjects and those with class A or B cirrhosis. However, in patients with class C cirrhosis, levetiracetam total clearance was reduced by 57% (90% confidence interval, 43%-67%; P < .001). The geometric mean ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for levetiracetam, Child-Pugh class C versus control, was 2.41 (90% CI, 1.80–3.23), and the geometric mean of the half-life ratio was 2.27 (90% CI, 1.74–2.97). This was explained by the deterioration of renal function in patients with severe hepatic disease.

- **Conclusions**: In pharmacokinetic studies of hepatic impairment, including all classes of cirrhosis may be more revealing than including only selected classes.

### Evaluation of levetiracetam loading dose in adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus [^1142mXiK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency defined as continued seizure activity greater than five minutes or seizure activity without return to baseline. Benzodiazepine-refractory SE is continuous seizure activity despite treatment with a benzodiazepine. Treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory SE includes levetiracetam with loading doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 4500 mg. While levetiracetam has minimal adverse effects, there is currently a lack of studies directly comparing the safety and efficacy of various loading doses of levetiracetam.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three loading doses of levetiracetam in the setting of benzodiazepine-refractory SE.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients with benzodiazepine-refractory SE who were treated with levetiracetam from April 1, 2016, to August 31, 2023. Patients with documented hypersensitivity to levetiracetam, those who were pregnant or incarcerated, and patients who received an alternative antiepileptic drug (AED) prior to levetiracetam were excluded. Patients with other identifiable causes of SE including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or who were post cardiac arrest were also excluded. Patients were divided into three arms based on the loading dose of levetiracetam administered (≤ 20 mg/kg [LEVlow], 21–39 mg/kg [LEVmed], or ≥ 40 mg/kg [LEVhigh]). The primary endpoint was the rate of seizure termination, defined as the lack of need for an additional AED within 60 minutes.

### Intravenous levetiracetam: A new treatment alternative for refractory status epilepticus [^115NQFDk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous levetiracetam (LEV-iv) in refractory status epilepticus (SE). A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who received LEV-iv for the treatment of SE (n = 36) and had failed at least one other antiepileptic drug. LEV-iv (median 3000 mg/day; range 1000–9000) was administered as a bolus loading (500–2000 mg per 30–60 min, n = 30) or as a continuous pump infusion (n = 6).

SE was terminated in 69% ("responders"); 31% ("non-responders") remained in SE. Factors associated with failure were dose escalation over 3000 mg/day, lack of bolus loading, treatment latency over 48 hours, age over 80 years, non-convulsive SE with coma ("subtle SE"), periodic lateralised epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) on EEG, acute cerebral lesion, and intubation narcosis. SE was terminated in all eight patients without brain lesion (p = 0.033), and in all seven patients with complex partial SE (p = 0.051).

The outcome was favourable (ambulatory patients) in 48% of responders compared with 0% of non-responders, and "adverse" (death or continuing coma/stupor) in 24% of responders compared with 100% of non-responders. Mortality was 17% (responders 4%, non-responders 45%). No patient had cardiocirculatory side effects or worsening of SE. Two patients experienced nausea and vomiting during LEV-iv loading, leading to aspiration pneumonia in one.

This study suggests that LEV-iv may be a safe and efficacious treatment for SE. Prospective and controlled trials are imperative to confirm these preliminary findings.
