## Question

A 68-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of postprandial abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss of 10 kg, and fear of eating. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Physical examination is unremarkable. Duplex ultrasonography and CT angiography reveal significant stenosis (> 70%) of the proximal superior mesenteric artery with patent distal vessels and no evidence of bowel infarction. She is otherwise a good surgical candidate, but is anxious to avoid open surgery if possible.

Based on current Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines, what is the recommended initial treatment approach for this patient, and what type of stent should be considered if endovascular revascularization is performed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended initial treatment approach for a 68-year-old woman with chronic mesenteric ischemia due to a > 70% proximal SMA stenosis, and what type of stent should be used if endovascular therapy is chosen. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity using guideline-based criteria. Then, I should verify the recommended first-line treatment modality. Next, I will examine the choice of target vessel and whether single-vessel disease is sufficient. After that, I need to check the specific stent type and technical considerations. Finally, I should review peri-procedural management, surveillance, and when open surgery is appropriate, ensuring each step aligns with SVS guidance and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has classic symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischemia (postprandial pain, food fear, weight loss) and imaging showing > 70% stenosis of the proximal SMA, which meets SVS diagnostic criteria for CMI and supports the need for revascularization rather than medical therapy alone [^c4ec415b] [^c231703e].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line treatment recommendation. The SVS gives a Grade 1 (Strong) recommendation for endovascular revascularization as the initial treatment for suitable lesions, reserving open surgery for those not amenable to endovascular therapy, endovascular failures, or select younger patients where long-term durability may offset perioperative risk. This aligns with contemporary practice trends and is echoed by ESVS guidance endorsing an endovascular-first strategy in suitable anatomy [^acad8695] [^7b7869b6] [^f7c946a9].

> I need to ensure the target vessel choice is correct. The SMA is the primary target for revascularization because it supplies the midgut and is most predictive of symptom relief; single-vessel SMA disease can indeed cause CMI when collateral flow is inadequate, so treating the SMA alone is appropriate here rather than routinely treating multiple vessels [^20d4b8dc] [^f46b79b9] [^41fe7da9].

> Hold on, I should verify the stent type. The SVS suggests using balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stents for mesenteric artery occlusive disease in CMI, particularly for ostial lesions, based on observational data showing improved freedom from restenosis, symptom recurrence, and reintervention compared with bare-metal stents. ESVS 2025 also recommends considering covered stents for shorter lesions without branch coverage, which fits this proximal SMA scenario [^727b0098] [^5d009645] [^ded8a8b6] [^27131f91].

> Let me think about technical execution and peri-procedural care. I should confirm that the stent will extend 1–2 mm into the aorta to cover the ostium, use balloon-expandable sizing matched to the distal normal SMA diameter (typically 6–8 mm), and deploy with adequate flare at the aortic interface. Completion imaging is essential, and adjuncts like intravascular ultrasound or pressure gradients can help assess residual stenosis. All patients should receive antiplatelet therapy and a statin unless contraindicated, and systemic heparin is standard during the procedure [^4fb15e8f] [^727b0098].

> Next, I should review surveillance because recurrence is common. SVS recommends duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually, with confirmatory CTA or angiography if symptoms recur or duplex suggests significant restenosis. Thresholds such as SMA PSV > 420 cm/s or a substantial rise from baseline warrant further evaluation and potential reintervention [^7445a409] [^7445a409].

> But wait, what if endovascular therapy fails or is not feasible? I should double-check the role of open surgery. Open revascularization (bypass or endarterectomy) is reserved for lesions not amenable to endovascular therapy, failed endovascular procedures, or select younger patients with low surgical risk where durability may be favorable. Importantly, an endovascular-first approach does not preclude later open repair, and outcomes remain acceptable even after prior stenting [^acad8695] [^bee7657e] [^9ea9c964].

> Let me reconsider the overall plan to ensure internal consistency. The recommended approach is endovascular revascularization of the SMA with a balloon-expandable covered stent, given the patient's symptomatic CMI, suitable anatomy, and preference to avoid open surgery. This strategy is supported by SVS Grade 1 recommendations and contemporary comparative data favoring covered stents for primary patency and symptom durability, with structured surveillance to detect and treat recurrence early [^acad8695] [^ded8a8b6] [^7445a409].

The recommended initial treatment for this 68-year-old woman with chronic mesenteric ischemia from a > 70% proximal SMA stenosis is **endovascular revascularization with a balloon-expandable covered stent** [^acad8695] [^727b0098], as this approach offers lower perioperative morbidity and faster recovery than open surgery [^f553a3ff] [^7c772329]. Covered stents are preferred for ostial lesions because they reduce restenosis and reintervention rates compared with bare-metal stents [^ded8a8b6] [^4fb15e8f]. Open surgery is reserved for endovascular failure or unsuitable anatomy [^bee7657e] [^c4a718c4]. Post-procedure, she should receive antiplatelet therapy and statin, and undergo duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually [^727b0098] [^7445a409].

---

## Recommended initial treatment approach

Current SVS guidelines recommend **endovascular revascularization as the initial treatment** for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) in patients with suitable anatomy, given its lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgery [^acad8695] [^7b7869b6]. Open surgical revascularization is reserved for patients with lesions not amenable to endovascular therapy, endovascular failures, or select younger patients in whom long-term benefits may outweigh perioperative risks [^bee7657e] [^c4a718c4].

---

## Choice of stent: balloon-expandable covered stent

When performing endovascular revascularization, the SVS suggests using a **balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent** for mesenteric artery occlusive disease in CMI [^727b0098] [^5d009645]. Covered stents are particularly advantageous for ostial lesions, such as this patient's proximal SMA stenosis, because they reduce restenosis and reintervention rates compared with bare-metal stents [^ded8a8b6] [^4fb15e8f]. Balloon-expandable stents provide precise deployment and radial strength, which are beneficial for ostial lesions prone to recoil [^f553a3ff].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting endovascular-first approach

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the **effectiveness and safety** of endovascular revascularization for CMI:

- **Technical success**: High technical success rates (80–100%) have been reported for mesenteric stenting [^d09449b0].
- **Clinical efficacy**: Symptom relief is achieved in 80–95% of patients undergoing endovascular revascularization [^d09449b0].
- **Perioperative outcomes**: Lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgery, particularly beneficial for elderly or high-risk patients [^f553a3ff] [^7c772329].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Comparable long-term survival between endovascular and open surgical approaches, with endovascular therapy associated with higher recurrence rates but lower perioperative risks [^23c5a94f] [^9ea9c964].

---

## Post-procedural management and surveillance

Following endovascular revascularization, patients should receive **antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy** to reduce the risk of restenosis and cardiovascular events [^727b0098]. Surveillance imaging with duplex ultrasound is recommended at 1, 6, and 12 months post-procedure, then annually thereafter, to detect recurrent stenosis or symptoms [^f83c1a8c] [^7445a409].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Endovascular revascularization as initial treatment | Grade 1 (Strong) | Lower perioperative morbidity and mortality; high technical success and clinical efficacy [^acad8695] [^d09449b0] |
| Balloon-expandable covered stent for proximal SMA lesions | Grade 2 (Weak) | Reduced restenosis and reintervention rates compared with bare-metal stents [^727b0098] [^ded8a8b6] |
| Antiplatelet and statin therapy post-procedure | Grade 1 (Strong) | Reduce risk of restenosis and cardiovascular events [^727b0098] |
| Duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 6, 12 months, then annually | Grade 2 (Weak) | Early detection of recurrent stenosis or symptoms [^f83c1a8c] [^7445a409] |

---

The recommended initial treatment for this patient is **endovascular revascularization of the proximal SMA using a balloon-expandable covered stent**, with post-procedural antiplatelet and statin therapy and structured duplex ultrasound surveillance. This approach balances efficacy, safety, and patient preference while aligning with current SVS guidelines.

Background

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) results from the inability to achieve adequate postprandial intestinal blood flow, usually from atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the origins of the mesenteric vessels. Patients typically present with postprandial pain, food fear, and weight loss, although they can present with acute mesenteric ischemia and bowel infarction. The diagnosis requires a combination of the appropriate clinical symptoms and significant mesenteric artery occlusive disease, although it is often delayed given the spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders associated with abdominal pain and weight loss. The treatment goals include relieving the presenting symptoms, preventing progression to acute mesenteric ischemia, and improving overall quality of life. These practice guidelines were developed to provide the best possible evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CMI from atherosclerosis.

Methods

The Society for Vascular Surgery established a committee composed of vascular surgeons and individuals experienced with evidence-based reviews. The committee focused on six specific areas, including the diagnostic evaluation, indications for treatment, choice of treatment, perioperative evaluation, endovascular/open revascularization, and surveillance/remediation. A formal systematic review was performed by the evidence team to identify the optimal technique for revascularization. Specific practice recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system based on review of literature, the strength of the data, and consensus.

Results

Patients with symptoms consistent with CMI should undergo an expedited workup, including a computed tomography arteriogram, to exclude other potential causes. The diagnosis is supported by significant arterial occlusive disease in the mesenteric vessels, particularly the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment requires revascularization with the primary target being the superior mesenteric artery. Endovascular revascularization with a balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent is the recommended initial treatment with open repair reserved for select younger patients and those who are not endovascular candidates. Long-term follow-up and surveillance are recommended after revascularization and for asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric occlusive disease. Patient with recurrent symptoms after revascularization owing to recurrent stenoses should be treated with an endovascular-first approach, similar to the de novo lesion.

Conclusions

These practice guidelines were developed based on the best available evidence. They should help to optimize the care of patients with CMI. Multiple areas for future research were identified.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — management of symptomatic recurrent stenosis mirrors initial symptomatic lesions and emphasizes advanced imaging and endovascular therapy: The management of patients with a recurrent stenosis and recurrent symptoms consistent with CMI is similar to the management of a symptomatic de novo lesion. Patients should undergo a CTA to facilitate the intervention, if not already performed. An endovascular-first approach is recommended for both failing endovascular and open revascularization with procedure specifics based on lesion extent and thrombus, with options including balloon angioplasty alone for in-stent stenosis and/or the placement of a balloon-expandable covered stent within a bare metal stent.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on follow-up after vascular surgery arterial procedures [^f553a3ff]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Mesenteric arteries — clinical context and treatment options indicate that chronic mesenteric arterial insufficiency is manifested by postprandial pain and weight loss and, if untreated, is a potentially fatal condition; open reconstruction options include transaortic endarterectomy of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, antegrade bypass from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, and retrograde bypass from the infrarenal aorta or an iliac artery to the superior mesenteric and celiac arteries; endovascular approaches consist of balloon angioplasty, with or without stenting, often using balloon-expandable stents due to ostial stenoses and plaque recoil; open surgical repair is described as more durable than endovascular repair, yet because patients are typically malnourished, frail, and poor candidates for major surgery, endovascular intervention has become the more frequent modality, trading increased risk of recurrent stenosis or occlusion for lower periprocedural morbidity and mortality.

Society for Vascular Surgery chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) — scope, definition, imaging, and treatment trends: The guidelines were "limited to patients with CMI related to atherosclerotic occlusive disease" and define CMI as ischemic symptoms from insufficient intestinal blood flow "for a duration of 3 months", while the current guidelines "do not address the management of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) or nonatherosclerotic causes (eg, median arcuate ligament syndrome, SMA dissection)". For diagnosis, "CTA is currently recommended as the first-line imaging study for mesenteric ischemia (both acute and chronic)". For therapy, "Endovascular treatment with angioplasty and intraluminal stents has largely replaced open surgical bypass as the first treatment option for mesenteric revascularization", with use that "has increased 10-fold over the past decade and now accounts for more than 70% of the initial revascularization procedures". Symptom patterns "do not occur unless at least two of the mesenteric vessels are involved", though "symptoms can develop in patients with single vessel disease, particularly the SMA".

This review article focuses on stent placement in mesenteric arteries in older patients with an increasingly common diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). We reviewed the articles that focused on the treatment of this gastrointestinal disorder by stenting/open surgical revascularization to avoid further ischemic episodes and bowel infarction and necrosis. The advantages of stent placement in mesenteric arteries are discussed in comparison to open surgical revascularization. In summary, the low morbidity and high technical success rate of catheter-based techniques have made this approach the first line of therapy for CMI due to superior mesenteric artery stenosis for many elderly patients especially high-risk operative candidates.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — implementation considerations state that the recommended endovascular-first approach to revascularization for patients with CMI largely reflects the current national practice although open revascularization should still play a significant role and should be considered within the treatment algorithm; the evolution of endovascular therapies has decreased the overall number of open procedures and has impacted the number of open aortic procedures performed in many training programs, with the potential to diminish the open operative skill set of graduating trainees and, ultimately, the care of patients with CMI.

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: updated guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^43842674]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Continued surveillance for stent or graft restenosis is important, as AMI after mesenteric revascularization accounts for 6–8% of late deaths.

Patients undergoing revascularization should have surveillance imaging obtained via CTA or duplex ultrasound within 6 months, with frequent follow-up to enable early intervention for recurrent disease. Current Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend duplex ultrasonography at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention, and then annually thereafter.

Long-term care should be focused on the patient's underlying medical comorbidities in order to minimize the risk of relapse. Lifestyle modification as well as management of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes is necessary.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^868dcd65]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Rationale and background — management of recurrent disease after chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) revascularization emphasizes surveillance imaging criteria and an endovascular-first strategy: "Patients may develop recurrent stenoses and/or recurrent symptoms after both endovascular and open revascularization for CMI". It is noted that "endovascular revascularization is associated with a higher rate of recurrent stenoses and symptoms". For imaging thresholds, "DUS examination is the optimal surveillance imaging study after revascularization although the criteria for the native arteries tend to overestimate the degree of stenosis (ie, 70% stenosis in treated arteries associated with higher PSV and EDV). CTA can help to confirm or refute the DUS findings". Treatment scope states, "The management of significant recurrent stenoses, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, should be the same as outlined for de novo lesions", and specifically, "patients with recurrent CMI should undergo revascularization with an endovascular-first approach, regardless of the initial approach, whereas open revascularization should be reserved for patients who are not amenable to the endovascular approach". Additionally, "A select group of patients with asymptomatic recurrent stenosis may also benefit from reintervention, but the exact indications for such reintervention remain undefined".

Endovascular revascularization — We suggest using balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stents for the treatment of the MAOD in patients with CMI. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). A completion imaging study is an integral part of any endovascular intervention and should be performed routinely. Intravascular ultrasound examination and/or intraluminal pressure measurements can be helpful to further interrogate any residual stenoses or lesions. All patients should be maintained on antiplatelet agents and a cholesterol-lowering agent, preferentially a statin, unless there is a contraindication.

### Recurrent superior mesenteric artery stent fracture [^6d9bdc42]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Ostial stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is usually a benign finding due to the significant collateralization inherent with visceral vessels. There is a subset of patients, however, with significant atherosclerotic disease leading to in situ thrombosis and subsequent mesenteric ischemia requiring intervention. Over the last 20 years, management of mesenteric ischemia-acute or chronic-has transitioned from an open embolectomy or bypass to an endovascular-first approach involving angioplasty and stenting. We are reporting a unique case of recurrent SMA stent fracture with imaging demonstrating diaphragmatic compression of the SMA during the respiratory cycle, subsequent management, and recommendations for future intervention.

Mesenteric vascular insufficiency is a serious medical condition that may lead to bowel infarction, morbidity, and mortality that may approach 50%. Recommended therapy for acute mesenteric ischemia includes aspiration embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stenting for the treatment of underlying arterial stenosis. Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia may respond to transarterial infusion of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, papaverine, glucagon, and prostaglandin E1. Recommended therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia includes angioplasty with or without stent placement and, if an endovascular approach is not possible, surgical bypass or endarterectomy. The diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome is controversial, but surgical release may be appropriate depending on the clinical situation. Venous mesenteric ischemia may respond to systemic anticoagulation alone. Transhepatic or transjugular superior mesenteric vein catheterization and thrombolytic infusion can be offered depending on the severity of symptoms, condition of the patient, and response to systemic anticoagulation. Adjunct transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation can be considered for outflow improvement. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^f46b79b9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — target vessel selection and endovascular considerations indicate that the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is the most important of the three mesenteric vessels and is the primary target for revascularization, with overall better symptomatic relief when the SMA is revascularized regardless of other vessels or whether the approach is open or endovascular. Isolated revascularization of the celiac artery (CA) or inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) may be justified in select patients when the SMA is not suitable, and endovascular revascularization of the SMA is possible for long segment occlusions and/or severe calcifications. Endovascular CA stenting is associated with a high risk of restenosis and is relatively contraindicated if there is significant median arcuate ligament compression, although ligament release is feasible by laparoscopic or open approaches. Experience with isolated IMA revascularization is limited and somewhat equivocal, and isolated endovascular CA or IMA treatment in the setting of a severely diseased SMA may be considered as a bridge to open bypass or retrograde SMA stenting.

### Endovascular treatment of chronic arterial mesenteric ischemia: a changing perspective? [^a2127ac3]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment for chronic mesenteric ischemia is growing in popularity because of its lower periprocedural morbidity and mortality than open surgery. It is especially suitable for the high-risk surgical candidate and for those who have a poor nutritional state, although endovascular surgery may not be possible in patients with ostial occlusions or heavily calcified vessels. A positive response to angioplasty is helpful to secure a diagnosis in patients with slightly atypical symptoms. There are little data at present to suggest that primary stenting is better than angioplasty alone, but insertion of a stent may be valuable as a rescue procedure following dissection, vascular recoil, or thrombosis during angioplasty. The superior mesenteric artery is probably the most important vessel to treat but, where this is impossible, celiac or inferior mesenteric artery dilatation may have therapeutic benefit. However, there is some evidence at present favoring multiple, as opposed to single-vessel, angioplasty or stenting. Long-term patency is better after mesenteric bypass, which may be preferred in the younger and fitter patient. Treatment of the celiac artery compression syndrome is primarily surgical, but stent insertion may have a role as a secondary procedure where there is a residual stenosis after median arcuate ligament division.

### Management of chronic mesenteric ischemia. the role of endovascular therapy [^a3be4d91]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon disorder manifested most commonly as abdominal pain. Surgical revascularization has traditionally been the treatment of choice. Endovascular management of this entity was originally attempted as an alternative for high-risk patients. Improvements in stent technology, refinement in technique, and increased efficiency of antiplatelet regimens have, over time, increased the popularity of this minimally invasive approach. We present a review of the available series on endovascular treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia, with emphasis on short- and long-term outcome and morbidity and mortality results. Principles of operative technique and controversial issues and topics of interest are also discussed.

Endovascular-first approach in chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) — consensus signals, caveats, and survival. Aggregate evidence from meta-analyses, case series, and nationwide experience "seems to support an endovascular-first approach for patients with CMI", and "The longer term survival rates are comparable between the open and endovascular approaches, although there seems to be trend toward a higher perioperative mortality in the open cohort". It is noted that "the endovascular-first approach does not seem to preclude subsequent open revascularization", and "the endovascular-first recommendation is consistent with other practice guidelines from the European Society of Vascular Surgery, the American College of Radiology, and the Society of Interventional Radiologists". However, "The recommendation for an endovascular-first approach must be tempered by the quality of the underlying evidence", because "the trials that comprised the review were largely retrospective, single-center studies and the overall quality of the evidence in our review was defined as low", and "The optimal treatment approach to patients with CMI should likely encompass the patient's anatomy, comorbidities, life expectancy, and individual goals of care and may not be as simple as an endovascular-first or open-first issue". Regarding long-term outcomes, one analysis found "the independent predictors of death were age greater than 80 years, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and home oxygen" and that "The 5-year survival was identical for the open and endovascular cohorts in their propensity-matched analysis".

Mesenteric ischemia is a serious medical condition characterized by insufficient vascular supply to the small bowel. In the acute setting, endovascular interventions, including embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stent placement, are recommended as initial therapeutic options. For nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, transarterial infusion of vasodilators, such as papaverine or prostaglandin E1, is the recommended initial treatment. In the chronic setting, endovascular means of revascularization, including angioplasty and stent placement, are generally recommend, with surgical options, such as bypass or endarterectomy, considered alternative options. Although the diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome remains controversial, diagnostic angiography can be helpful in rendering a diagnosis, with the preferred treatment option being a surgical release. Systemic anticoagulation is recommended as initial therapy for venous mesenteric ischemia with acceptable rates of recanalization. If anticoagulation fails, transcatheter thrombolytic infusion can be considered with possible adjunctive placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to augment antegrade flow. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Chronic mesenteric ischemia: clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery [^fb377cc3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Rationale and background — The SMA is the primary target vessels for revascularization, whereas the CA and IMA are secondary targets if it is not possible to revascularize the SMA or the clinical result is inadequate. Several anatomic findings can complicate the endovascular revascularization of the mesenteric vessels, including flush aortic occlusion, small caliber vessels, extensive calcification, the presence of tandem lesions, and the extent of involvement. Multiple reports have documented successful endovascular revascularization for these scenarios, although the long-term patency rates for these higher risk lesions remains unclear and the requisite skill set may not be universal. The use of balloon-expandable intraluminal stents has replaced balloon angioplasty alone for the treatment of de novo lesion. Balloon-expandable covered stents seem to have better longer term patency, presumably owing to the prevention of tissue ingrowth through the interstices of the stent by the fabric.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — extent of revascularization across vessels shows that although there are theoretical advantages to revascularizing both the SMA and CA, most reports indicate that treatment of the SMA alone is sufficient. Two recent retrospective studies have shown a nonsignificant trend towards a lower recurrence rate with treatment of both vessels, but similar recurrence rates at 2 years have also been reported when comparing stenting of the SMA alone with stenting of both SMA and CA. Revascularization of both the CA and SMA may have a role in select patients with severe gastric ischemia and those without adequate collaterals, yet there is no proven benefit that treating both vessels provides more durable relief and the second (or additional) intervention adds cost and potential risk.

Target vessel strategy in MAOD — distal targets and adjuncts: The atherosclerotic occlusive disease that leads to MAOD typically affects the origin of the vessels; accordingly, the more distal extent of the mesenteric vessel tends to be spared and, thus, is a suitable bypass target. This choice of distal target can be complicated by the presence of an occluded stent, prior mesenteric bypasses, or more extensive occlusive disease, and an option in this setting includes selecting a target that is further distal on the involved vessel with a limited endarterectomy and a vein patch to help create a more patulous vessel and better bypass target.

REVASCULARIZE

Early and effective revascularization can significantly reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes. In most cases, we recommend completing revascularization prior to making decisions on bowel resection; exceptions are discussed hereinafter. Acute mesenteric ischemia generally falls into one of four categories (arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, NOMI, and MVT), the relative distribution of which depends upon the patient population being served in an individual hospital. The revascularization approach and subsequent steps depend on the type of insult and the patient's physiology. Anticoagulation should be considered at the time of diagnosis unless there is an absolute contraindication.

F. Arterial embolism accounts for roughly 25% of all AMI diagnoses and has been decreasing in recent decades. The source of the embolus is typically the heart or the aorta; approximately 50% of patients have concurrent atrial fibrillation, and 33% have a history of previous emboli. Emboli typically lodge at points of normal anatomic vessel narrowing, and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is commonly involved because of its relatively large diameter and low takeoff angle. More than 20% of SMA emboli are associated with concurrent emboli, most commonly to the kidney and spleen. For arterial embolism, embolectomy is generally preferred. Thrombolytic therapy is an option, but it is not recommended as it may take hours to days to lyse clot and risks progression of bowel ischemia. Postintervention antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy may be beneficial in the setting of small-vessel thrombosis and is recommended as long as the source of potential emboli remains.

G. Arterial thrombosis has increased in recent decades, accounting for about 40% of all cases. The gradual formation of plaque can eventually progress to critical stenosis with thrombosis of mesenteric vessels, and patients with acute on chronic disease will often have concurrent atherosclerosis and stenosis of the celiac artery. Thrombosis typically occurs at the origin of the celiac trunk, SMA, and inferior mesenteric artery. Endovascular treatment options include thrombectomy and angioplasty with or without stenting. Compared with open techniques, endovascular revascularization is associated with lower short -and long-term mortality; however, there is no significant difference in the need for second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. – If bypass is performed, antegrade is preferred over retrograde because of a lower reintervention rate. If the patient has shock, peritonitis, or evidence of bowel necrosis on CT, then a joint procedure is recommended, including open revascularization, to reduce time to resection of necrotic intestine.

Chronic mesenteric ischemia — single-vessel disease and classic teaching note that there is likely a role for revascularization in patients with symptoms consistent with CMI and occlusive disease isolated to a single mesenteric vessel, particularly the SMA. Although classic teaching stressed that patients cannot develop CMI unless at least two of the three mesenteric vessels are involved, this teaching point is likely incorrect because it is possible to develop CMI from isolated mesenteric involvement, usually with a poor collateral network between vessels. The common scenario is significant occlusive disease isolated to the SMA or CA with vague abdominal complaints, and treatment decisions balance the natural history of untreated CMI with the risks and costs of open or endovascular treatment.

Superior mesenteric artery aneurysm (SMAA) — treatment approach: We recommend an endovascular-first approach to all SMAAs if it is anatomically feasible. Strength of recommendation 1 (Strong) and Quality of evidence B (High). Endovascular procedures are significantly less morbid than open procedures and should be preferentially offered if it is anatomically feasible, and endovascular interventions include coil embolization and use of covered stents, with good results. In cases where an endovascular approach leads to significant loss of collaterals, strong consideration should be given to open repair, with options including simple ligation of aneurysm, aneurysmorrhaphy in case of saccular aneurysms, and repair with an interposition graft; open resection may require intestinal resection, and close observation for occurrence of peritoneal symptoms is essential after either type of repair. Angiography is critical to delineate superior mesenteric artery anatomy and collaterals, and both open and endovascular techniques must exclude the aneurysm and maintain patency of the vessels.

### Inferior mesenteric artery stenting as a novel treatment for chronic mesenteric ischemia in patients with an occluded superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk [^bf68df96]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a challenging problem, with revascularization the mainstay of treatment. Management of CMI is especially challenging in the patient with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) occlusions.

Report

We report a case series of four patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia who were not candidates for CA or SMA revascularization who were successfully treated with inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) angioplasty and stent placement to improve collateral circulation and palliate symptoms.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest case series to date reporting the use of an IMA stent to improve collateral circulation in patients with CMI.

Chronic Mesenteric Ischaemia

Percutaneous stent placement is the current standard approach due to the higher technical success rate compared to PTA alone. The SMA is the primary target. The CA is generally targeted when SMA recanalisation fails or is highly likely to fail due to heavy calcification, long lesions, or occlusion. CA angioplasty or stenting should not be performed in patients with active compression by the median arcuate ligament.

The pressure gradient across the lesion can be assessed using a 4-Fr or 5-Fr catheter, either routinely or only when the severity of the stenosis is unclear. In general, severe SMA stenosis is defined as a mean arterial pressure gradient of 10 mmHg or more. Others have considered a systolic pressure gradient of 20 mmHg or more to indicate significant stenosis (≥ 70%).

After initial aortography and target vessel assessment, a long flexible 6-Fr or 7-Fr sheath is placed in or near the target vessel ostium. The CA or SMA is then catheterised using an appropriate catheter with a flexible hydrophilic guidewire. Catheter position downstream of the stenosis must be confirmed by angiography. An exchange catheter is placed and used to exchange the guidewire for a stiffer wire. Some authors prefer small-profile, stiff, 0.014″ or 0.018″ wires. The long sheath is advanced over its dilator into the target artery. When advancement is not possible, a balloon 5 mm to 6 mm in diameter and 2 cm in length can be brought through the orifice of the artery and inflated. The sheath is then advanced into the artery as the balloon is deflated. Systemic heparin must be administered before PTA or stenting. If necessary, the stenosis is pre-dilated (5–6 mm). Both monorail and over-the-wire PTA balloon systems can be used at this stage, depending on operator preference and lesion complexity. Monorail systems allow easier handling, while over-the-wire systems offer greater support, particularly in tortuous or calcified anatomy. A balloon-expandable stent is then positioned. A covered stent can be used for proximal SMA lesions if no side branches will be covered. Recent data support the use of covered stents rather than bare-metal stents, as they offer better primary patency. The size and length of the stent are determined using angiography to measure the arterial diameter immediately distal to the target lesion and the length of the stenosis to be covered, allowing for proximal and distal extension beyond the lesion. The CA and SMA generally require stents 2–3 cm in length with a diameter of 5–7 mm and 6–8 mm, respectively. The stent must cover the ostium. Approximately 5 mm of stent is allowed to protrude into the aorta. This intra-aortic segment is usually flared using a balloon 2 mm larger than the index balloon for the stent across the orifice. While extending the stent into the aorta is generally required, it is preferable to avoid excessive protrusion when using a covered stent. An angiogram is then performed to check that the target vessel and peripheral branches are patent with no residual stenosis exceeding 30%. Repeated dilation may be considered for residual stenosis > 30%. The use of embolic protection devices to avoid distal embolisation when treating the SMA, particularly in patients with heavily calcified stenosis, occlusion, or an acute or subacute presentation, has been described but is not routinely used.

Aortic reconstruction and concomitant mesenteric disease — preoperative evaluation and treatment — review of the preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) to examine the status of the CA, SMA, IMA, and internal iliac artery should be obligatory before any aortic reconstruction, with evaluation of collateral vessels; preoperative or concomitant revascularization of the SMA and/or CA is likely justified in this setting, although the role for prophylactic revascularization remains unresolved; the Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysms have recommended (2C) "prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic high-grade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of a meandering mesenteric artery based off a large IMA, which will be sacrificed during the course of treatment", with endovascular or open approaches, generally favoring endovascular when lesions are amenable; nationwide data found simultaneous renal revascularization at open infrarenal aneurysm repair associated with increased mortality and single-institution series have shown somewhat equivocal morbidity/mortality findings for simultaneous mesenteric revascularization, and it remains unclear whether simultaneous mesenteric revascularization increases or decreases overall mortality; in patients with CMI requiring aortic reconstruction, mesenteric revascularization should be performed before or simultaneous with the aortic procedure, and patients with symptomatic disease of the SMA (ie, CMI) should undergo angioplasty and stenting before open or endovascular repair (IA), whereas those not amenable to an endovascular approach should undergo concomitant revascularization at the time of open aneurysm repair (IA).

### Comparison between endovascular and surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia [^cd925de8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening vascular insult which can frequently be fatal without timely intervention. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding the optimal initial treatment modality for arterial occlusion: endovascular versus surgical.

Recently published guidelines on AMI note a benefit of endovascular therapy compared to open surgery in terms of lower bowel resection rates and lower 30-day mortality rates. Nevertheless, it is important to note that all studies scrutinizing endovascular revascularization have a significant level of population heterogeneity. Thus, the authors recommend endovascular treatment in the early phases of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI); however, acute peritonitis universally mandates open surgery. Endovascular treatment may in some instances be associated with adverse outcomes. Li et al. suggested that endovascular treatment as a primary approach did not improve outcomes compared to open surgery. These investigators documented that endovascular treatment may raise several concerns that could potentially worsen patient outcomes. Firstly, endovascular treatment cannot preclude assessment of the viability of the gastrointestinal tract and may delay necessary bowel resection. Secondly, endovascular treatment failures may delay open revascularization and worsen outcomes. These concerns were also noted by Murphy et al. and Arthurs et al.

Another novel approach is retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS), combining open and endovascular interventions, thus also allowing inspection of gut viability. Studies comparing it to open surgical revascularization or solely endovascular treatment are still lacking.

Due to the absence of randomized controlled studies, any valid comparisons of endovascular and surgical treatment modalities are lacking. Hypothetically, improved outcomes are achieved with endovascular interventions early after onset of symptoms or in "acute-on-chronic" AMI, whereas the opposite may be true for delayed interventions. Evidence-based time-limits for efficient revascularization are followed in stroke and acute coronary syndrome treatment guidelines, but still lacking for AMI. Watada and co-authors observed in their retrospective study on 48 AMI patients that 78% of patients did not suffer transmural necrosis within 3.5 h from onset of symptoms to diagnosis in patients with proximal SMA occlusion. However, the time to admission of about 24 h from onset of symptoms in multiple investigations far exceeds the window of opportunity to intervene without the need for bowel resection. Given the nonspecific symptoms and lack of biomarkers, it seems currently unrealistic to achieve a verified diagnosis followed by endovascular treatment within the very first few hours from the onset of symptoms.

### Management of patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia across three consecutive eras [^7a1bc7fc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endovascular intervention (EI) is the most commonly used modality for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). Since the inception of this technique, numerous publications have reported the associated clinical outcomes. However, no publication has reported the comparative outcomes over a period of time in which both the stent platform and adjunctive medical therapy have evolved. This study aims to assess the impact of the concomitant evolution of both the endovascular approach and optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) on CMI outcomes over three consecutive time eras.

Methods

A retrospective review at a quaternary center from January 2003 to August 2020 was performed to identify patients who underwent EIs for CMI. The patients were divided into three groups based on the date of intervention: early (2003–2009), mid (2010–2014), and late (2015–2020). At least one angioplasty/stent was performed for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and/or celiac artery. The patients' short- and mid-term outcomes were compared between the groups. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were also conducted to evaluate the clinical predictors for primary patency loss in SMA only subgroup.

Results

A total of 278 patients were included (early, 74; mid, 95; late, 109). The overall mean age was 71 years, and 70% were females. High technical success (early, 98.6%; mid, 100%; late, 100%; P = 0.27) and immediate resolution of symptoms (early, 86.3%; mid, 93.7%; late, 90.8%; P = 0.27) were noted over the three eras. In both the celiac artery and SMA cohorts, the use of bare metal stents (BMS) declined over time (early, 99.0%; mid, 90.3%; late, 65.5%; P < .001) with a proportionate increase in covered stents (CS) (early, 0.99%; mid, 9.7%; late, 28.9%; P < .001). The use of postoperative antiplatelet and statins has increased over time (early, 89.2%; mid, 97.9%; late, 99.1%; P = 0.003) and (early, 47%; mid, 68%; late, 81%; P = 0.001), respectively. In the SMA stent-only cohort, no significant differences were noted in primary patency rates between BMS and CS (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–2.87; P = 0.94). High-intensity preoperative statins were associated with fewer primary patency loss events compared to none/low- or moderate-intensity statins (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.11–0.72; P = 0.014).

Conclusions

Consistent outcomes were observed for CMI EIs across three consecutive eras. In the SMA stent-only cohort, no statistically significant difference in early primary patency was noted for CS and BMS, making the use of CS at additional cost controversial and possibly not cost effective. Notably, the preoperative high-intensity statins were associated with improved SMA primary patency. These findings demonstrate the importance of guideline-directed medical therapy as an essential adjunct to EI in the treatment of CMI.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the interventional radiology management of acute and chronic arterial mesenteric ischaemia [^aa11fa5e]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

For atherosclerotic AMI or acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischaemia with occlusion of both the SMA and the CA, SMA recanalisation is the primary goal. If SMA recanalisation is not feasible or fails, the CA is targeted. The stenotic or occluded arterial segment is crossed using a hydrophilic 0.035″ or 0.018″ guidewire and an appropriate catheter. The intraluminal position of the catheter distal to the stenosis must be confirmed via angiography. In the event of failure with the 0.035″ guidewire, a microguidewire (usually 0.014″) and microcatheter (2.0-Fr to 2.4-Fr) combination may be useful. A stiffer guidewire is usually substituted for the hydrophilic guidewire to improve stability. Pre-dilatation of the stenosis can be performed using an undersized percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheter, usually 3–4 mm in diameter, especially in patients with heavily calcified, hard plaques. An appropriately sized balloon-expandable stent, bare-metal stent, or covered stent is then deployed to cover the ostium and the lesion. The proximal stent may be extended with a second stent, usually a self-expanding nitinol stent, to cover long lesions. For residual stenosis (> 30%), repeat PTA can be considered. An angiogram is then performed to confirm adequate patency of the target vessel and peripheral branches with no residual stenosis > 30%. In the absence of strong evidence, some authors consider a trans-stent pressure gradient > 10 mmHg as a threshold for further angioplasty or stenting.

Following endovascular revascularisation, a planned second-look surgery is often advocated to assess bowel viability and determine the need for resection. In this context, diagnostic laparoscopy may be performed to evaluate bowel ischaemia and identify areas of irreversible damage, allowing for a tailored surgical resection. However, in the presence of initial or new clinical or radiological evidence of peritonitis or bowel infarction, immediate laparotomy is required.

Symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia results from intestinal hypoperfusion and is classically thought to result from involvement of two or more mesenteric arteries. The celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery are most frequently implicated in this disease process, and their involvement usually results in symptoms of small intestinal ischemia. Symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia resulting predominantly from inferior mesenteric artery involvement has largely been overlooked but does gives rise to its own, unique clinical presentation with symptoms resulting from large intestinal ischemia. We present four patients with atherosclerotic inferior mesenteric artery stenosis with symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia that have unique clinical presentations consistent with large intestinal ischemia that resolved following percutaneous endovascular treatment of the inferior mesenteric artery stenosis. These cases represent a novel approach to the diagnosis and management of this disease process and may warrant a further subclassification of chronic mesenteric ischemia into chronic small intestinal ischemia and chronic large intestinal ischemia.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaImaging of mesenteric ischemia [^a9866ba2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon condition resulting from decreased blood flow to the small or large bowel in an acute or chronic setting. Acute ischemia is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; however, it is difficult to diagnose clinically. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion and prompt imaging evaluation are necessary. Chronic mesenteric ischemia is less common and typically caused by atherosclerotic occlusion or severe stenosis of at least two of the main mesenteric vessels. While several imaging examination options are available for the initial evaluation of both acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia, CTA of the abdomen and pelvis is overall the most appropriate choice for both conditions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Mesenteric stenting for chronic mesenteric ischemia [^7c772329]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mesenteric stenting has not been widely adopted for the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). The recent availability of embolic protection and low-profile devices with the theoretical ability to decrease perioperative bowel necrosis, led us to begin using mesenteric stenting for patients with CMI. We review our initial experience to examine short-term outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who were treated by vascular surgeons with mesenteric stenting for CMI. Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia were excluded. We evaluated perioperative morbidity and mortality, restenosis, recurrent symptoms, and reintervention. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess events during follow-up. We also compared these outcomes with a historical control group of patients treated with open surgical revascularization.

Results

Fourteen patients underwent mesenteric stenting over the past 3 years. Mean age was 73, and 64% were women. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity. Early restenosis and recurrent symptoms occurred in 10% and 9% of patients at 6 months. At a mean follow-up of 13 months, 53% of patients underwent reintervention. However, 93% were symptom-free at their last follow-up. Compared with open surgery, stent patients had lower perioperative major morbidity (30% vs 0%, P < .01) and shorter hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (median 10 days vs 2 days, and 3 days vs 0 days, respectively, P < .01 for both). However, stent patients were seven times as likely to develop restenosis (P < .01), four times more likely to develop recurrent symptoms (P < .01), and 15 times more likely to undergo reintervention (P < .01). There was one death 13 months after stenting due to mesenteric infarction in a patient lost to follow-up. One patient was successfully converted to open surgery after a second restenosis. He had regained 20 pounds and was determined to be a better operative candidate than at his initial presentation. There was no perioperative or 30-day mortality or major morbidity with reintervention after mesenteric stenting.

Conclusion

Mesenteric stenting for CMI can be performed with low perioperative risk. However, stenting is associated with early restenosis and recurrent symptoms requiring secondary procedures. Patients with severe nutritional depletion or high surgical risk may benefit from mesenteric stenting for CMI, but close follow-up is required. Later open surgery can be performed for restenosis if nutritional status and surgical risk are improved, or repeat angioplasty and stenting can be effectively performed if operative risk remains high.

Asymptomatic severe MAOD — selection for prophylactic revascularization — revascularization may be justified in a small subset with severe disease involving all three mesenteric vessels, with close monitoring and counseling; revascularization may be justified for noncompliant patients or those with limited access to medical care, and revascularization is also likely indicated in the presence of vague or nonspecific abdominal pain given the potential adverse sequelae, including progression to acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI).
