## Question

What antibiotic do you sugest for a lip mouth abscess in a child

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what antibiotic to suggest for a lip abscess in a child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is a simple cutaneous abscess or an odontogenic/oral cavity infection. Then, I should verify the primary therapy and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Next, I will consider pediatric-specific issues, including MRSA prevalence and dosing. After that, I need to check penicillin allergy stratification and appropriate alternatives. Finally, I will confirm duration, follow-up, and when to escalate or obtain cultures, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and pediatric data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. A "lip mouth abscess" in a child is most consistent with a superficial cutaneous abscess of the lip or perioral region rather than a deep odontogenic infection, so the management principles for purulent skin and soft tissue infections apply, with incision and drainage as the cornerstone and antibiotics reserved for select indications [^1949fbf9] [^137b3cd8].

> Wait, let me verify the primary therapy before discussing antibiotics. For uncomplicated purulent SSTI, incision and drainage is the essential treatment; routine antibiotics do not improve cure rates when drainage is adequate, so antibiotics are not automatically required after successful I&D in otherwise healthy children [^1949fbf9] [^137b3cd8] [^62bf4b3a].

> I should confirm when antibiotics are indicated despite adequate drainage. Indications include systemic features (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, abnormal WBC), markedly impaired host defenses, extremes of age, multiple lesions, or failure to improve after 48–72 hours. In these scenarios, empiric therapy should cover S. aureus, with MRSA coverage considered based on local epidemiology and severity [^1949fbf9] [^22bde77c] [^137b3cd8].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric-specific considerations. Community-associated MRSA is common in pediatric SSTI, with many centers reporting MRSA in more than 40% of isolates; therefore, empiric MRSA-active therapy is reasonable when antibiotics are indicated, especially with moderate severity or systemic features [^f364e288] [^137b3cd8].

> Let me think about first-line oral options when antibiotics are indicated. TMP-SMX or clindamycin are preferred empiric choices for pediatric abscess because they cover MRSA; TMP-SMX is often favored when local clindamycin resistance exceeds about 10–20%, and clindamycin is a strong alternative when local resistance is low and GI tolerance is acceptable [^137b3cd8] [^ea2ad945].

> I need to check dosing and formulation details. For clindamycin, pediatric dosing is approximately 10–13 mg/kg per dose every 6–8 hours (max 40 mg/kg/day), and for TMP-SMX, dosing is based on the TMP component at about 8–12 mg/kg/day divided twice daily; liquid formulations are available and facilitate adherence in young children [^05392933].

> But wait, what if there is a true penicillin allergy? I should double-check the allergy phenotype. If there is no history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillins, cephalexin can be considered for MSSA coverage, though it will not cover MRSA; if there is a severe IgE-mediated allergy, avoid beta-lactams and use clindamycin or TMP-SMX for MRSA coverage, tailoring to local susceptibility and patient tolerance [^4da44506] [^137b3cd8].

> Let me reconsider duration and follow-up. Typical courses are 5–7 days when antibiotics are indicated, with reassessment at 48–72 hours; if the child is clearly improving, shorter courses may suffice, and if there is no improvement, I should verify source control, consider culture, and broaden therapy if MRSA was not initially covered [^137b3cd8] [^1949fbf9].

> I should confirm when to obtain cultures. Routine cultures are not required for uncomplicated first-time abscesses, but cultures are reasonable in recurrent infections, severe disease, immunocompromised hosts, or treatment failure to guide targeted therapy and detect resistance patterns [^1949fbf9] [^9de8b8a0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about odontogenic sources. If the abscess is clearly odontogenic or there is periapical or periodontal involvement, dental source control is mandatory and antibiotic choices should cover oral flora, including anaerobes; in that scenario, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is preferred, with metronidazole added if anaerobic coverage is inadequate, but that is a different clinical pathway than a simple lip abscess [^466f2b17] [^61cf71de].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation for a child with a simple lip abscess is: perform incision and drainage as primary therapy. If antibiotics are indicated by systemic features, host factors, or lack of improvement, prescribe clindamycin or TMP-SMX for 5–7 days with pediatric-appropriate dosing, avoid routine beta-lactam monotherapy for abscess due to poor MRSA activity, and reassess within 48–72 hours to ensure clinical response and adherence [^137b3cd8] [^1949fbf9] [^05392933].

---

For a child's lip abscess, **incision and drainage is the primary therapy** [^1949fbf9]; antibiotics are only adjuncts for systemic symptoms, rapid progression, immunocompromise, or failure to improve [^137b3cd8]. If antibiotics are needed, **clindamycin or TMP-SMX are first-line** for MRSA coverage [^137b3cd8]; use amoxicillin-clavulanate if anaerobes are suspected (e.g. odontogenic source) [^notfound]. Avoid fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in children; typical courses are 5–7 days, reassessing at 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated lip abscesses after adequate incision and drainage [^137b3cd8]. Indications for antibiotic therapy include:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever (temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C), tachypnea (> 24 breaths per minute), tachycardia (> 90 beats per minute), or abnormal white blood cell count (> 12,000 or < 4,000 cells/µL) [^1949fbf9].

- **Immunocompromised state**: Immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive therapy.

- **Rapid progression or cellulitis**: Extensive surrounding erythema, induration, or lymphangitis.

- **Failure of initial management**: Lack of improvement after 48–72 hours of incision and drainage alone.

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **empiric therapy should cover Staphylococcus aureus**, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and consider anaerobic coverage if an odontogenic source is suspected [^1949fbf9].

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage (pediatric)** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | First-line for MRSA coverage | 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (max 40 mg/kg/day) | - Effective against MRSA and anaerobes <br/> - Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects, including C. difficile infection [^7fb45163] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | Alternative for MRSA coverage | 8–12 mg/kg/day of TMP component divided every 12 hours | - Effective against MRSA <br/> - Limited anaerobic coverage <br/> - Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Suspected anaerobic or odontogenic source | 25–45 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin component divided every 12 hours | - Broad-spectrum coverage including anaerobes <br/> - Not effective against MRSA |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

Certain antibiotics are **not recommended** in pediatric patients due to safety concerns or lack of efficacy:

- **Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)**: Contraindicated in children due to potential musculoskeletal adverse effects and cartilage toxicity.

- **Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline)**: Contraindicated in children under 8 years due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and impaired bone growth.

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **typical duration** of antibiotic therapy for a lip abscess in children is 5–7 days. Clinical improvement should be reassessed within 48–72 hours, and therapy adjusted based on response and culture results if available [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

With appropriate incision and drainage, with or without antibiotics, **clinical resolution is high** and recurrence is uncommon. Recurrence may occur if the initial drainage is inadequate, if there is persistent nidus of infection, or if there is immunocompromise.

---

## Potential complications of untreated or inadequately treated lip abscesses

Untreated or inadequately managed lip abscesses can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Spread of infection**: Cellulitis, lymphangitis, or deeper space infections.

- **Scarring and cosmetic deformity**: Particularly if the abscess is large or chronic.

- **Systemic infection**: Sepsis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should occur within 48–72 hours to assess clinical improvement, adherence, and adverse effects. If there is no improvement or if the infection worsens, **obtain cultures and adjust antibiotic therapy** accordingly [^notfound].

---

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for pediatric lip abscesses; antibiotics are reserved for specific indications. Clindamycin or TMP-SMX are **first-line** when antibiotics are needed, with amoxicillin-clavulanate for suspected anaerobes. Therapy should be individualized, with close follow-up to ensure resolution and prevent complications.

### What are the antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infections, and how long should the treatment course last? [^c879c501]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In the everyday practice of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the face of uncertainty. Is there a highly resistant organism present? Are the old-line antibiotics no longer effective? Should a broad-spectrum antibiotic be used just to cover all the bases in this case? The surprising result of this systematic review is that when combined with appropriate surgery, the usual antibiotics are all effective. Safety and cost become the differentiating factors in this clinical decision.

Education into practice

Do you currently consider antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated skin abscesses after surgical treatment?
What information could you share with your patient to help reach a decision together?
Would you consider using online decision aid tools (such as the one available on MAGICapp) to facilitate shared decision making?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Three people with lived experience of skin abscesses were full panel members: two had previously experienced skin abscesses before (one with recurrent abscesses), and one person is a parent of a child who experienced a skin abscess. These panel members identified patient-important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and preferences. These patient partners agreed that, although pain reduction was the most important outcome to them, these values may not be shared by all patients. The close balance between desirable and undesirable consequences made it difficult for them (and the panel) to decide which options most individuals would choose.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lip infections [^de805e5c]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, cocci bacterium that naturally colonizes the skin. S aureus can cause a mild to severe infection depending on the location, depth of invasion, and immune status. Guidelines regarding treatment of patients with lip infections are scant. The purpose of this study was to present the diagnosis, management, and outcome of a cohort of patients with lip infections caused by S aureus.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with a lip infection caused by S aureus treated by Emory Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service (Atlanta, GA). Predictor variables were patient demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging characteristics, intervention, and length of stay. The outcome variable was infection resolution or persistence. Data were collected using a standardized collection form. Descriptive statistics were computed.

Results

Seven patients (mean age, 38 years) with lip swelling met the inclusion criteria. The patients did not undergo recent hospitalization and/or recent surgery. Patients had immunodeficiency virus or other medical comorbidities. Radiographic findings were consistent with abscess formation. Management consisted of antibiotics only or surgical intervention with antibiotics. Lip cultures showed S aureus with methicillin-sensitive or -resistant S aureus. Treatment was intravenous followed by oral antibiotics. The average length of inpatient stay was 4 days. There were no postoperative complications. All lip infections achieved complete clinical resolution.

Conclusions

In this cohort, treatment of lip swelling caused by S aureus required surgical intervention and/or antibiotics. Immune compromise and antibiotic resistance should be considered in a patient with a similar presentation.

### Optimizing antimicrobial therapy in children [^1ed1f8ef]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Management of common infections and optimal use of antimicrobial agents are presented, highlighting new evidence from the medical literature that enlightens practice. Primary therapy of staphylococcal skin abscesses is drainage. Patients who have a large abscess (> 5 cm), cellulitis or mixed abscess-cellulitis likely would benefit from additional antibiotic therapy. When choosing an antibiotic for outpatient management, the patient, pathogen and in vitro drug susceptibility as well as tolerability, bioavailability and safety characteristics of antibiotics should be considered. Management of recurrent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections is vexing. Focus is best placed on reducing density of the organism on the patient's skin and in the environment, and optimizing a healthy skin barrier. With attention to adherence and optimal dosing, acute uncomplicated osteomyelitis can be managed with early transition from parenteral to oral therapy and with a 3–4 week total course of therapy. Doxycycline should be prescribed when indicated for a child of any age. Its use is not associated with dental staining. Azithromycin should be prescribed for infants when indicated, whilst being alert to an associated ≥ 2-fold excess risk of pyloric stenosis with use under 6 weeks of age. Beyond the neonatal period, acyclovir is more safely dosed by body surface area (not to exceed 500 mg/m(2)/dose) than by weight. In addition to the concern of antimicrobial resistance, unnecessary use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential later metabolic effects, thought to be due to perturbation of the host's microbiome.

Breastfeeding during maternal infections and mastitis — breastfeeding is encouraged when mothers have infectious illnesses, and "Hand hygiene and covering the nose and mouth with a mask is recommended when the mother is breastfeeding directly". Mastitis management notes that "Mastitis occurs in one third of women postpartum", mothers are encouraged to continue breastfeeding, "Regular feeding or expression of milk is an adjunct to other treatment", "Antibiotics may be indicated", and "Approximately 10% of cases progress to breast abscesses, which require drainage", with breastfeeding allowed on the affected side if "the infant's mouth does not contact purulent drainage". For infectious disease guidance, "A pediatric infectious disease specialist, the AAP Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, or the CDC Web site should be consulted".

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — discharge therapy strategy (oral therapy vs OPAT): For children with suspected or documented AHO who respond to initial intravenous antibiotic therapy, we recommend transition to an oral antibiotic regimen rather than OPAT when an appropriate (active against the confirmed or presumed pathogen(s)) and well-tolerated oral antibiotic option is available (strong recommendation and low certainty of evidence). For children with suspected or documented AHO who respond to initial parenteral antibiotic therapy but for whom oral antimicrobial therapy is not feasible, we suggest transition to OPAT, rather than remaining in an acute-care hospital for the total duration of therapy (conditional recommendation and very low certainty of evidence).

### Lip abscess associated with isotretinoin treatment of acne vulgaris [^1ba28cac]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Isotretinoin is frequently prescribed for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Among the numerous documented adverse effects, most common are xerostomia and cheilitis. Lip abscesses as a consequence of cheilitis present dramatically and may pose a diagnostic challenge.

Observations

We present a case of a 15-year-old boy with a severe lip abscess requiring incision and drainage and hospital admission for intravenous antibiotic treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We discuss the pathophysiologic characteristics of isotretinoin therapy and the likely causative role that the medication played in the development of the lip abscess.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although rare, lip abscesses related to isotretinoin therapy present with substantial morbidity and should be promptly recognized. Misdiagnosis of mucositis and angioedema may delay appropriate therapy.

### Oral infections and antibiotic therapy [^4a13250f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral infections commonly originate from an odontogenic source in adults and from tonsil and lymphatic sources in children. Odontogenic infections arise from advanced dental caries or periodontal disease. Oral trauma, radiation injury, chemotherapy mucositis, salivary gland infection, lymph node abscess, and postoperative infection are potential nonodontogenic sources of infections that could potentially be life threatening. This article reviews the serious nature and potential danger that exists from oral infection and the antibiotics available to treat them are reviewed. Successful treatment requires an understanding of the microflora, the regional anatomy, the disease process, the treatment methods available, and interdisciplinary team collaboration.

### Should I prescribe antibiotics after draining an abscess in a young child? Should I pack his wound? Do I prescribe decolonizing measures? [^729947fb]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

How would you approach this patient. Incision and drainage are clearly indicated, but what about antibiotics. Should the wound be packed. Should the child be decolonized. How. Classically, antibiotics have not been prescribed once an abscess has been drained; however, with the emergence of community associated MRSA many have advocated antibiotics. There is also the concern for a cellulitic component to these processes in children. Two recent studies have addressed this question in pediatric populations. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, Chen et al. compared clindamycin to cephalexin, assuming that clindamycin would be superior because of its efficacy against CA-MRSA. 1 The primary outcome was clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours, and the secondary outcome was resolution at 7 days. Participants were 6 months to 18 years old who presented to the ER with an abscess, furuncle, or carbuncle in which outpatient management was expected, and received a. Comments.

### Antibiotic treatment of pediatric infections in primary healthcare setting: evaluation and comparison of 80 national treatment guidelines with the WHO AWaRe book recommendations [^20d8ecd0]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

First STEP–collection of STGs

Countries and infectious diseases selected

Eighty countries were selected based on the availability of national STGs to represent all six WHO regions: African Region (AFR), Region of the Americas (AMR), South-East Asia Region (SEAR), European Region (EUR), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), and Western Pacific Region (WPR).

Based on the AWaRe book's primary health care section, the main infections included in our study were: Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs), such as acute otitis media (AOM), pharyngitis, and acute sinusitis; Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); odontogenic infections (periodontitis, bacterial gingivostomatitis, and odontogenic abscess); gastrointestinal infections, such as acute gastroenteritis (including acute hemorrhagic diarrhea like shigellosis), cholera, and enteric fever; skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including impetigo and cellulitis; and urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Search strategy

The bibliographic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS using keywords like "national standard treatment guidelines", and "national antibiotic guidelines". Grey literature was reviewed to ensure comprehensive coverage, including pediatrics, infectious diseases, and general medicine National Scientific Societies' library (last search in May 2025). Additionally, for LMICs, public archives from Ministries of Health, drug regulatory agencies, national centers for the control of infectious diseases, and national reference institutes were consulted for STGs (last search in May 2025).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Documents developed or published by national institutions, the national Ministry of Health, national societies, or centers were included if they focused on pediatric (i.e. aged < 18 years) recommendations for single or multiple infectious diseases.

In cases of uncertainty regarding the validity of the documents, collaborators of Antibiotic Data to Inform Local Action project (ADILA) working in the relevant country were contacted.

Documents published or endorsed by international societies were excluded, unless they had been officially adapted by national societies.

Data extraction and collection

For each country and each infection with available STGs, data were collected for the three first-line and three second-line antibiotics recommended, including route of administration, daily dose (in mg/kg/day or IU/kg/day when available), frequency of administration, length of therapy, and recommendations for penicillin-allergic patients.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^39ea1892]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^137b3cd8]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding medical management for skin abscess, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, initial empiric therapy, BMJ 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering TMP/SMX or clindamycin along with incision and drainage rather than incision and drainage alone in patients with an uncomplicated skin abscess. Discuss both options with each patient.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9de8b8a0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

IDSA = Infectious Diseases Society of America; EBM = Evidence-Based Medicine; NHG = Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap; ESCMID = European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Quality improvement guidelines for pediatric abscess and fluid drainage [^12e02b64]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Image-guided drainage of abscesses and fluid collections is a valuable tool in the treatment of pediatric patients. It may obviate surgery or optimize the child's clinical condition for subsequent surgery. Compared with adults, several differences exist in terms of etiology, risks (especially radiation exposure), preprocedural imaging and planning, technical considerations, support issues such as sedation, and complications. Knowledge of these differences is important in the planning and treatment of these patients. In addition, a quality improvement plan can be used to assess practice performance.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^ea351376]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a novel methodology using collaborative research coordinated online be successfully applied to the development of a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis?

Findings

This consensus statement and systematic review using a novel WikiGuidelines methodology addresses 7 questions regarding the management of osteomyelitis, resulting in the establishment of 2 clear recommendations (concerning oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy) and 5 clinical reviews that outline a present lack of adequate, hypothesis-confirming data.

Meaning

These results suggest that this novel, egalitarian methodology enables a clear separation of established care standards based on hypothesis-confirming evidence from practice preferences that are based on lower quality or no evidence.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3b916cf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^37424ca0]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prescriptions

Twenty-nine of 291 patients (10%) received antibiotics, including all patients with a positive GAS test. In 27/29 cases (93%) there was sufficient documentation to categorize the test as indicated or non-indicated; in all of these cases it was indicated. Nineteen of 29 antibiotic prescriptions (66%, 95% CI: 46–81%) were indicated according to guidelines, while 8/29 (28%, 95% CI: 13–47%) were not indicated. In all cases where antibiotics were not indicated, testing was appropriate but RADT and culture results were negative. Further characterization of these patients is presented in Table 2. Of note, in the case of one patient who presented with fever and trismus and was treated with ampicillin-sulbactam upon hospitalization, antibiotic therapy may have been initiated because of concern for a peritonsillar abscess and thus could be considered appropriate for a separate indication. In one case antibiotics were prescribed in the setting of a negative RADT because of high clinical suspicion, but the family was contacted and told to stop the antibiotics when the culture returned negative. As defined above, this patient was not considered to have received antibiotics. Two of 29 prescriptions could not be classified as indicated or non-indicated because the McIsaac score was indeterminate, although in both cases the tests were positive. There were no cases of patients not receiving antibiotics when guidelines suggested they should have.

Antibiotic prescriptions: Recommended and non-recommended agents

Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 26/29 (90%, 95% CI: 72–97%) received recommended antibiotics and 3/29 (10%, 95% CI: 3–28%) received non-recommended antibiotics. Recommended antibiotics included penicillin V (1), amoxicillin (22), and azithromycin (1, in a patient allergic to penicillin and cephalexin). Non-recommended antibiotics included a second-generation cephalosporin (1), clindamycin (1), and ampicillin-sulbactam during inpatient hospitalization followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate upon hospital discharge (1).

### Dalbavancin (Dalvance) [^56614a60]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A study population of 191 pediatric patients received study medication (DALVANCE single dose regimen n = 83, DALVANCE two-dose regimen n = 78, comparator n = 30); 62% of the patients were male and 89% were white, and 83% were from Eastern Europe. The pediatric age groups who received DALVANCE were as follows: 12 to < 18 years (n = 58), 6 to < 12 years (n = 49), 2 to < 6 years (n = 35), 3 months to < 2 years (n = 14), and birth < 3 months (n = 5). Patients had diagnoses of major cutaneous abscess (53%), cellulitis (29%), or surgical site/traumatic wound infection (18%). The predominant pathogen at baseline was Staphylococcus aureus (84%).

The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DALVANCE. The trial was not powered for a comparative inferential efficacy analysis. Efficacy was assessed in the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 183) which included all randomized patients who received any dose of study drug and had a diagnosis of ABSSSI caused by Gram-positive organism(s). Patients with ABSSSI only caused by Gram-negative organisms were excluded. The five patients in the age group birth to < 3 months of age were not included in efficacy analyses since they were enrolled with expanded inclusion criteria and only received the single dose DALVANCE regimen. An early clinical response at 48–72 hours was defined as ≥ 20% reduction in lesion size compared to baseline and no receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. The proportion of patients with early clinical response, was 97.3% (73/75) in the DALVANCE single-dose arm, 93.6% (73/78) in the DALVANCE two-dose arm, and 86.7% (26/30) in the comparator arm. The difference in responder rates between the dalbavancin single-dose and comparator arms was 10.7%, with an exact 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of (-1.7%, 31.6%). The difference in responder rates between the dalbavancin two-dose and comparator arms was 6.9%, with an exact 97.5% CI of (-6.4%, 27.7%).

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

### Antibiotic therapy in necrotizing soft tissue infections: a narrative review of the greater paris SURFAST consortium [^1b76d1eb]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic choice according to the site of infection

NSTIs are commonly classified based on microbiological findings. The most widely accepted classification distinguishes between type I and type II NSTIs. Type I infections are polymicrobial and typically occur in elderly patients or individuals with underlying comorbidities. A portal of entry, such as a skin ulcer or mucosal breach, is often identified. In contrast, type II NSTIs are monomicrobial, most frequently caused by GAS or S. aureus, and can affect patients of any age, including those without pre-existing conditions. Some authors also describe a type III category, encompassing infections caused by organisms such as Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio vulnificus or clostridial species.

In our protocol, we chose to categorize NSTIs according to the anatomical location of the infection rather than on microbiological documentation. This pragmatic approach is intended to help clinicians select the correct empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected NSTIs, before microbiological results are available.

Antibiotic dosing regimens for adults and children are presented in Table 1. Adult dosages follow the 2025 European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommendations for high-dose therapy. Pediatric dosages follow the Red Book recommendations, except for levofloxacin, for which higher doses are proposed based on recent pediatric pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses and the recommendations of the Société de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Française (SPILF) for pediatric use.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^418fd95e]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses: factors in medical management failure [^3ae69d36]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscesses are the most common deep neck infections in the pediatric population. How best to treat these patients, be it intravenous antibiotics or immediate surgical incision and drainage, has long been debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient and abscess characteristics associated with failure of medical treatment. We retrospectively examined 46 patients between 1999 and 2009 at Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando. Patient charts were reviewed, and data collected included age, gender of the patient, size of the abscess, days of admission to the hospital, admission to the intensive care unit, and surgical intervention, if applicable. All patients first received 24 to 48 hours of IV antibiotics, at which point a clinical decision was made to proceed with surgery or continue conservative management. When comparing antibiotic treatment failure across age, gender, and abscess size, statistically significant correlation occurred only with the size of the abscess. Medical management was more likely to fail, and surgery needed, when abscesses were larger than 2 cm. Additionally, hospital stay was not statistically different between the medical and surgical groups. Our data demonstrate statistical significance for the ability to treat retro- and parapharyngeal abscesses 2 cm or less in diameter with IV antibiotics alone, without complications, and with a statistically similar average hospital stay compared with surgery. Abscesses larger than 2 cm may be managed medically, as well, but failure of antibiotic therapy alone is more likely, with surgical intervention more often required.

American Dental Association guideline — antibiotic decision pathway and selections for immunocompetent adult patients when definitive, conservative dental treatment (DCDT) is immediately available: "Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis" is managed with "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". For "Pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess", the pathway asks "Does the patient have systemic involvement?"; without systemic involvement it states "NO ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT", and with systemic involvement it states "YES ANTIBIOTICS AS ADJUNCTS TO DCDT". When antibiotics are indicated, for patients without a penicillin allergy use "Oral amoxicillin (500 milligrams, 3 times per day, 3–7 d)" or "Oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and if first-line treatment fails "broaden antibiotic therapy to complement with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d)". For penicillin-allergic patients, the pathway asks about a "history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin"; without such history use "Oral cephalexin (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)", and with such history use "Oral azithromycin (loading dose of 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for an additional 4 d) or oral clindamycin (300 mg, 4 times per d, 3–7 d)".

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^dfc93750]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

The consortium that established the WikiGuidelines Charter consisted of 63 participants from 8 countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. These participants included physicians, pharmacists, and microbiologists with expertise in general internal and hospital medicine, pediatrics, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology.

The participants addressed 7 questions regarding the diagnosis and management of pyogenic osteomyelitis but found data sufficient to establish clear recommendations for only 2: oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy. In contrast, 5 questions were addressed with clinical reviews in the absence of high-quality data: diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis, management of osteomyelitis underlying pressure ulcers, appropriate timing of empirical therapy, rational selection of antimicrobial options, and use of serial biomarkers or imaging studies to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: advisory statement 2008 [^8aff172b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic prophylaxis is an important component of dermatologic surgery, and recommendations in this area should reflect the updated 2007 guidelines of the American Heart Association, the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines, and recent prospective studies on surgical site infection.

Objective

To provide an update on the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery for the prevention of infective endocarditis, hematogenous total joint infection, and surgical site infection.

Methods

A literature review was performed, expert consensus was obtained, and updated recommendations were created, consistent with the most current authoritative guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

Results

For patients with high-risk cardiac conditions, and a defined group of patients with prosthetic joints at high risk for hematogenous total joint infection, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended when the surgical site is infected or when the procedure involves breach of the oral mucosa. For the prevention of surgical site infections, antibiotics may be indicated for procedures on the lower extremities or groin, for wedge excisions of the lip and ear, skin flaps on the nose, skin grafts, and for patients with extensive inflammatory skin disease.

Limitations

These recommendations are not based on multiple, large-scale, prospective trials.

Conclusions

There is a strong shift away from administration of prophylactic antibiotics in many dermatologic surgery settings, based on updated authoritative guidelines. These recommendations provide guidance to comply with the most current guidelines, modified to address dermatology-specific considerations. Managing physicians may utilize these guidelines while individualizing their approach based on all clinical considerations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^055385d6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Pediatric neck abscesses: changing organisms and empiric therapies [^f60136c3]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the causative organisms in pediatric neck infections, delineate risk factors in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pediatric neck infections, and define patient populations that should be empirically treated with MRSA sensitive antibiotics.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Methods

Two hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients were reviewed, ages 0 to 17, presenting at a tertiary care center between 1999 and 2007 with computed tomography proven neck abscesses. Characteristics of patients with differing causative organisms were compared.

Results

Forty-eight percent of all pediatric patients' with head and neck abscesses had S. aureus as the causative organism, 29% of which were community-acquired MRSA — recent years showed that up to 66% of pediatric neck abscesses were MRSA culture positive. When comparing MRSA infections vs. other causative organisms multiple clinical characteristics were found which did not help to differentiate those patients at a higher risk for MRSA. Characteristics which did trend to predict an MRSA infection were few. For example, the average age of patients with MRSA was 32.5 months compared with only 16 months for the methicillin-sensitive S. aureus patients. MRSA sensitivities and resistances were also examined.

Conclusions

This study presents a large cohort of pediatric neck abscess patients, in which the emergence and characteristics of MRSA are shown. As community-acquired MRSA infections become more prevalent, empiric antibiotic therapy must be considered. The results of this study show that the incidence of MRSA has greatly increased and clinical risk factors are not helpful in choosing those patients which may be at higher risk for an MRSA infection.

### Surgical management of retropharyngeal space infections in children [^00d5699f]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the perioperative management strategies in a large group of pediatric patients undergoing surgical therapy for suppurative adenitis of the parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of all patients treated surgically from January 1, 1989, to December 31, 1998, in a tertiary care pediatric hospital.

Methods

Charts were reviewed for demographic data, duration and nature of symptoms, radiological workup, surgical approach, complications, duration of medical therapy and antibiotic choice, and bacteriological findings. Computed tomography (CT) results were correlated to surgical findings.

Results

A dramatic increase in the incidence of deep neck space infection was seen during the study period; this increase was congruent with the increase in culture-positive group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal abscesses. More than two-thirds of the patients were boys with the peak incidence being in the 3- to 5-year-old group. The duration of symptoms before presentation was less than might be expected, especially in the younger age groups. Seventy of 73 children were treated with a transoral approach. Sixty-eight of 73 were successfully treated with one operative intervention. Irregularity of the abscess wall was found to be a stronger predictor of the presence of pus than the presence of ring enhancement.

Conclusions

The current study represents the largest series of pediatric retropharyngeal abscesses in the modern medical literature. Changes in the disease process and in management from the first half of the century to today are reviewed, and recommendations for optimal management presented. The data in this series support a transoral approach to these abscesses unless there is extension lateral to the great vessels.

The management and treatment of odontogenic infection, and its frequent extension into the head and neck, remains an important section of oral and maxillofacial surgical practice. This area of maxillofacial expertise is widely recognized by the medical community and an essential component to the hospital referral system. Although the general principles of infection management have not changed, there have been modifications in the timing of treatment sequences and treatment techniques. These modifications are influenced by the development of diagnostic methods and advances in bacterial genetics and antibiotic usage.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 3 — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — first-choice parenteral therapy includes ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime, 35–50 mg/ kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/ day) IV. For children who are receiving effective cART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other community-acquired pneumonia pathogens, add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected, and for patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use… [^1e4ad513]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intra-oral swelling Supporting Files 11 2019 By Lockhart, Peter B.; Tampi, Malavika P.; Abt, Elliot;. File Language: English. Description: Background: An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs and the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations for the urgent management of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, or pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess using antibiotics, either alone or as adjuncts to definitive, conservative dental treatment in immunocompetent adults.

Types of Studies Reviewed: The authors conducted a search of the literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to retrieve evidence on benefits and harms associated with antibiotic use. Authors used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty in the evidence, and the Evidence-to-Decisions Framework. Results: The panel formulated five clinical recommendations and two good practice statements, each specific to the target conditions, for settings where DCDT is and is not immediately available. With likely negligible benefits and potentially large harms, the panel recommended against using antibiotics in the majority of clinical scenarios, irrespective of DCDT availability. They recommended antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement due to the dental conditions, or when the risk of progression to systemic involvement is high.

Conclusion and Practical Implications: Evidence suggests that antibiotics for the target conditions may provide negligible benefits and probably contributes to large harms. The expert panel only suggests antibiotics for target conditions when systemic involvement is present, and immediate DCDT should be prioritized in all cases.

### News, views, and reviews. less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^5cda8467]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate for a particular individual.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^234e3dce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^fafc9a00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 February 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 February 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 26 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. A grey literature search was conducted using OpenGrey (to 26 February 2018) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 26 February 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. A fixed-effect model was used in the meta-analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. The patients included in these trials had no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables reported in both studies were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects, as reported in one study, were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). Neither study reported quality of life measurements. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessTwo studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth, while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscessWe found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

Human bite wound infections — key antibiotic choices and organism considerations — include oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6 h, with doxycycline 100 mg bid as an oral option, for which the table states "Good activity against Eikenella species, staphylococci, and anaerobes; some streptococci are resistant". The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^a9dc2722]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Erythema

Immediately after injection, some skin redness may occur and is normal. Treatments for rosacea may be effective, including oral tetracycline or isotretinoin. A medium-strength topical steroid is advocated for persistent erythema. However, long-term use of high-potency steroids should be avoided. Additionally, vitamin K cream may be useful in accelerating resolution of erythema.

Infections

Any procedure that breaks the surface of the skin carries with it a risk of infection, and injecting dermal fillers is no exception. Acute infections, which appear as acute inflammation or abscesses at the site of injection, are typically due to common pathogens present on the skin such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

If untreated, the conditions may lead to sepsis, particularly in elderly people or in patients with other conditions that alter the immune system. Mild forms may be treated with oral antibiotics, while more serious ones require intravenous antibiotics and hospitalization.

The panel recommends:
i. Amoxicillin clavulanic acid 4 g/24 h 15 days.
ii. Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg bid for 2–4 weeks.

The different antibiotics recommended by the panel are listed in Table 4.

Table 4
Different antibiotic treatments recommended by the panel

Herpetic Outbreak

Dermal filler injections can lead to reactivation of herpes virus infections. The majority of herpetic recurrences occur in the perioral area, nasal mucosa, and mucosa of the hard palate.

Patients with a history of severe cold sores (more than 3 episodes) should be prescribed antiherpes medication prophylactically before treatment when injections in vulnerable areas are planned. In these patients, the panel recommends: Valaciclovir 1 g/24 h 1 day before and 3 days after filler injection.

Additionally, according to the panel recommendations, in patients with active herpes lesions, injections should be delayed until their complete resolution.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^60f646c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### A de-escalated treatment strategy in the management of paediatric cervicofacial actinomycosis [^0c393b5b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Actinomycosis is a rare invasive bacterial disease that is characterised by granulomatous inflammation often mistaken as malignancy. Traditionally, this has been managed with prolonged courses of antibiotics with durations up to 6–12 months. Surgical intervention as an adjuvant treatment has been shown to reduce the length of antibiotic treatment significantly to 4 weeks. We report a case of cervicofacial actinomycosis in a 12-year-old girl who was adequately treated with an 11-day course of antibiotics without surgical intervention and shows no signs of recurrence at 6 months post-treatment.

### Ceftaroline fosamil (Teflaro) [^705084b8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with lesion size ≥ 75 cm2and having one of the following infection types:

Major abscess with ≥ 5 cm of surrounding erythema
Wound infection
Deep/extensive cellulitis

The results of this analysis are shown in Table 9.

The protocol-specified analyses included clinical cure rates at the Test of Cure (TOC) (visit 8 to 15 days after the end of therapy) in the co-primary CE and MITT populations (Table 10) and clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) population (Table 11). However, there are insufficient historical data to establish the magnitude of drug effect for antibacterial drugs compared with placebo at a TOC time point. Therefore, comparisons of Teflaro to vancomycin plus aztreonam based on clinical response rates at TOC cannot be utilized to establish non-inferiority.

Of the 693 patients in the MITT population in the Teflaro arm in the two ABSSSI trials, 20 patients had baseline S. aureus bacteremia (nine MRSA and eleven MSSA). Thirteen of these twenty patients (65%) were clinical responders for ABSSSI at Study Day 3 and 18/20 (90%) were considered clinical success for ABSSSI at TOC.

Pediatric Patients

The ABSSSI pediatric trial was a randomized, parallel-group, active controlled trial in pediatric patients 2 months to < 18 years of age.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^f364e288]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting > 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates. –

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S aureus and enterococci strains. Current guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIwere published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI known or suspected to be caused by susceptible strains of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: S aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S agalactiae, S dysgalactiae, S anginosus (including S anginosus, S intermedius, S constellatus), and vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Dalbavancin is also approved in the United States for the treatment of ABSSSI in pediatric patients from birth to < 18 years, and is the first and only single-dose IV treatment for ABSSSI currently approved in the United States and the European Union. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dalbavancin, including its long half-life, makes it a convenient treatment option, even in the outpatient setting, and a single-dose regimen may improve compliance and reduce healthcare resource use.

Tularemia — diagnosis and treatment recommendations state that serologic tests are the preferred method of diagnosing tularemia (weak, low). For severe cases, streptomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours IM) or gentamicin (1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours IV) is recommended (strong, low). For mild cases, tetracycline (500 mg qid) or doxycycline (100 mg bid given by mouth) is recommended (strong, low). Notify the microbiology laboratory if tularemia is suspected (strong, high). Routine cultures are often negative unless cysteine-supplemented media are utilized, the laboratory should be notified because of health risks to personnel, and unsuspected growth of F. tularensis can cause laboratory-acquired disease. No prospective controlled or randomized trials of therapy have been performed and the optimal duration is not established; Francisella is resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, which should be avoided. When static drugs such as tetracyclines or chloramphenicol are used, relapses may be more common, often after brief therapy (ie, < 7–10 days). For adults, streptomycin dosing can be 30 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (no more than 2 g daily) or gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^7b5071a7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Management of SSTIs — purulent infection (furuncle/carbuncle/abscess): For mild infection, "incision and drainage is indicated". Moderate infection involves incision and drainage (I & D) and culture and sensitivity (C & S) with empiric "TMP/SMX or Doxycycline", then defined treatment as "MRSA — TMP/SMX" and "MSSA — Dicloxacillin or Cephalexin". Severe infection involves I & D and C & S with empiric "Vancomycin or Daptomycin or Linezolid or Telavancin or Ceftaroline" and defined treatment as "MRSA — See Empiric" and "MSSA — Nafcillin or Cefazolin or Clindamycin". Since "daptomycin and telavancin are not approved for use in children, vancomycin is recommended; clindamycin may be used".

Antibiotic follow-up and modification — patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient's symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### MRSA infection of masticatory spaces in a paediatric patient [^278bb22c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of source of maxillofacial infection in paediatric patients can be challenging due to difficulty in eliciting a proper history and multiple potential sources of infection. Identification and removal of the nidus of infection with decompression and institution of antibiotic therapy as per the culture-sensitivity report form the mainstay treatment of the infection. Deviation from it may result in persistence or even progression of infection, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In the past decade, the incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the oral cavity has seen an upward trend. This has further led to an increase in complexity in the diagnosis of maxillofacial infections. In this case, the authors want to bring to light the challenges faced in managing a paediatric patient with persistent fascial space infection even after removal of the offending tooth, which signifies the importance of managing the infection by the time-tested protocol.

### Risk factors for life-threatening complications of maxillofacial space infection [^1e42f125]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although the prevalence and complication incidences of MSI has decreased with advancement of diagnostic techniques, availability of effective antibiotics and improvement in oral hygiene, MSI remain potentially life threatening. Even though adequate antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage of abscess were given, patients with NEUT% upon hospital admission ≥ 85.0% carry a higher risk of life-threatening complications, and the treatment strategy of these patients should be aggressive.

### Skin and soft tissue infection treatment and prevention practices by pediatric emergency medicine providers [^0873c4a9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) treatment and prevention practices among pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) clinicians in the context of current clinical practice guidelines and contemporary evidence.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional survey of PEM clinicians belonging to the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine Survey listserv. Four varying hypothetical clinical scenarios of children with SSTI were posed to respondents; subsequent items assessed SSTI treatment and prevention practices. Provider demographics were collected.

Results

Of 160 survey respondents, more than half stated that they would prescribe oral antibiotics for each clinical scenario, particularly for more complex presentations (small uncomplicated abscess, 51.8%; large uncomplicated abscess, 71.5%; recurrent abscess, 83.5%; febrile abscess, 90.3%; P < 0.001). Most commonly selected antibiotics were clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Across scenarios, more than 80% selected a duration of treatment 7 days or more. Of the 121 respondents who prescribe preventive measures, 85.1% recommend hygiene measures; 52.5% would prescribe decolonization with topical antibiotic ointment and 77.5% would recommend antiseptic body washes. Half of the respondents reported that their institution has standard guidance for SSTI management.

Conclusions

Although current evidence supports adjuvant antibiotics for all drained SSTI and decolonization for the index patient and household contacts, PEM clinicians do not consistently adhere to these recommendations. In light of these findings, development and implementation of institutional guidelines are necessary to aid PEM clinicians' point-of-care decision making and improving evidence-based practice.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^058f24cb]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — clinician implications: Table 1 provides categories (strong recommendation, recommendation, option, and no recommendation) with explicit practice implications. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

This article briefly reviews some of the most common skin lesions in the head and neck of a child. Benign "lumps and bumps" are very common in children and it is prudent for the pediatric maxillofacial surgeon to be familiar with their presentation, workup (including radiographic studies), and definitive surgical management. Inflammatory and infectious lesions require prompt treatment to avoid more serious sequelae of progressive infection and scarring.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.
