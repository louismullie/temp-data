## Question

arm numbness from the triceps to the fingers

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about arm numbness that extends from the triceps to the fingers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and map the symptom distribution to plausible nerves. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis, prioritizing by likelihood and red flags. Next, I will outline the focused history and examination elements that separate mimics. After that, I need to check which diagnostic tests are most appropriate and when to order them. Finally, I will consider initial management pathways and when to escalate to imaging, electrodiagnostics, or surgical referral, making sure each step aligns with the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy and symptom mapping. Numbness spanning the triceps region down to the fingers suggests a lesion involving the radial nerve or its contributions from the brachial plexus, with the radial nerve supplying the posterior arm and forearm and the dorsolateral hand via the superficial radial branch; however, I should not jump to conclusions because ulnar and median contributions, as well as cervical roots, can produce overlapping patterns, so I need to keep a broad differential while I verify the distribution against known dermatomes and peripheral nerve territories [^114AmhKz] [^112bZVML] [^115dAD7v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should prioritize the differential. High on the list is radial neuropathy, especially at the spiral groove or proximal arm, given the triceps-to-fingers distribution and the classic association with humeral shaft fractures or compression, though I must remember that triceps function may be spared if the lesion is distal to the triceps branch origin; posterior interosseous nerve involvement would spare wrist extension and cause finger drop, while superficial radial neuropathy would present with dorsal hand numbness and minimal motor deficit, so I should confirm motor involvement carefully on exam [^114AmhKz] [^114dxBwE] [^1113RWDJ].

> Wait, let me verify competing proximal causes. Cervical radiculopathy, particularly C7, can mimic this pattern with arm pain and paresthesias, and although numbness in the hand and fingers is common, the distribution is often dermatomal and may be provoked by neck motion; I should double-check for Spurling's, traction, and Valsalva responses, and remember that atypical C7 presentations without classic triceps findings do occur, so I must integrate neck symptoms and reflex changes before excluding radiculopathy [^116hmEpT] [^115dAD7v] [^117BUfcg].

> I need to ensure I consider brachial plexus and thoracic outlet etiologies. Lower trunk or posterior cord lesions can produce combined ulnar and radial features, and neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome often presents with non-dermatomal hand symptoms worsened by overhead activity. I should confirm local neck or chest wall pain and use provocative maneuvers, recognizing that NTOS remains a diagnosis of exclusion and may require scalene block for confirmation in select cases [^114oUvYb] [^117QPckC].

> But wait, what if this is ulnar neuropathy masquerading as a broader arm syndrome. Cubital tunnel syndrome typically causes ring and little finger numbness with ulnar-innervated intrinsic weakness, and although symptoms can radiate proximally, the triceps is not ulnar-innervated, so true triceps numbness would argue against isolated ulnar neuropathy. Still, I should confirm the sensory territory and look for clawing or Froment's sign before ruling it out [^1129SMZz] [^1151PtVY].

> I will now examine less likely but important mimics. Median nerve pathology such as carpal tunnel syndrome can cause nocturnal hand symptoms and clumsiness, but it does not explain triceps-region numbness, so if present it may be concurrent rather than causal. Similarly, complex regional pain syndrome can produce distal limb pain with vasomotor changes, but I should confirm the presence of color/temperature asymmetry, edema, and distal generalization before labeling CRPS, and I must not forget medication-induced peripheral neuropathy such as with fluoroquinolones, which can be diffuse and painful, prompting immediate cessation if suspected [^111mTRPH] [^1178E4oy] [^1137NxJy] [^115vVXti].

> Next, I should review the focused history to refine pretest probabilities. I need to check for acute trauma or fracture, recent repetitive elbow extension against resistance, new exercise or crutch use, recent surgery or anesthesia with arm positioning, vibration exposure, diabetes or other systemic diseases, cancer or B symptoms, and any fluoroquinolone exposure. I should also ask about neck pain, nocturnal symptoms, and whether symptoms are provoked by neck or shoulder motions, as this helps separate cervical from peripheral causes [^116hmEpT] [^1149Gznw] [^117MADkh] [^111Auwvy].

> Let me first confirm the critical examination steps. I should map sensory loss precisely to radial versus ulnar versus median versus dermatomal patterns, test elbow extension and wrist/finger extension for radial nerve function, assess triceps reflex, perform Spurling's and traction maneuvers for cervical disease, and palpate along the radial nerve course for Tinel's. If radial neuropathy is suspected, I should also look for wrist or finger drop and remember that PIN palsy spares wrist extension while producing finger drop, which can localize the lesion more distally [^114AmhKz] [^115dAD7v] [^115nszFM].

> Hold on, I should verify when to order tests and which to choose. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after history and exam, or if symptoms are severe or progressive, electrodiagnostic studies can distinguish radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy and grade severity. High-resolution ultrasound can visualize nerve caliber changes, neuromas, or mass lesions along the radial nerve and at the spiral groove and is particularly helpful when EMG/NCS are equivocal or when a structural lesion is suspected. Cervical MRI is indicated when radiculopathy is suspected or when myelopathic signs are present, and I should remember that EDX may be normal early after injury, so timing matters [^1113RWDJ] [^114dxBwE] [^116hmEpT].

> Let me consider initial management by scenario while I double-check the strength of evidence. For suspected radial neuropathy, conservative care with activity modification, elbow extension splinting at night, and physical therapy focused on nerve gliding and avoiding compression at the spiral groove is reasonable for up to 6–12 weeks if deficits are mild; urgent surgical exploration is indicated for open injuries, known or suspected transection, or failure of recovery with persistent severe deficits; I should confirm triceps involvement because proximal lesions carry a poorer prognosis and may warrant earlier surgical consultation [^1113RWDJ] [^114AmhKz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that a negative Tinel sign and negative Phalen would preclude carpal tunnel syndrome and thus support a radial diagnosis, but I should verify that assumption. While a negative Tinel and Phalen reduce the likelihood of CTS and can support deferring nerve conduction studies in low-probability cases, these tests are not perfect, and symptom distribution plus provocative maneuvers should be integrated; importantly, the presence of triceps-region numbness still points away from isolated CTS, so my earlier inclination is directionally correct but needs the nuance that no single bedside test rules in or out CTS definitively [^1161fQB8] [^113y1poU].

> I should double-check the cervical radiculopathy pathway. If Spurling's, traction, or Valsalva reproduce concordant arm symptoms and the neurologic exam shows dermatomal sensory loss or reflex asymmetry, cervical MRI becomes the imaging of choice to confirm disc or foraminal stenosis compressing the root. Management then follows severity, with conservative care first and surgical decompression reserved for refractory or progressive cases, especially with motor deficits [^116hmEpT] [^115dAD7v].

> Next, I should review the ulnar neuropathy considerations to avoid anchoring. If the sensory loss is restricted to ring and little fingers with ulnar intrinsic weakness and a positive elbow flexion/compression test, cubital tunnel syndrome is likely. Conservative options include night splinting and activity modification, with surgical decompression or transposition if symptoms persist or worsen. Ultrasound can identify anconeus epitrochlearis or nerve enlargement to support the diagnosis and guide intervention [^1129SMZz] [^1151PtVY] [^112nLzwx].

> I need to ensure I have a plan for systemic or medication-related neuropathies. If there is a stocking-glove pattern, distal symmetric findings, or a history of neurotoxic chemotherapy or fluoroquinolone use, I should address the offending agent and consider neuropathic pain management principles. Immediate discontinuation of fluoroquinolones is advised when neuropathy symptoms occur, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is primarily a clinical diagnosis with supportive care and symptom control prioritized [^1137NxJy] [^115vVXti] [^115n11ZW].

> Let me reconsider red flags that mandate expedited workup or urgent referral. Acute severe weakness, rapidly progressive sensory loss, new bowel or bladder dysfunction, or signs of myelopathy such as hyperreflexia, clonus, or gait imbalance require urgent cervical MRI and neurosurgical consultation. Similarly, suspected compartment syndrome, open injury with suspected nerve transection, or postoperative acute pain with neurologic change need immediate surgical evaluation [^117MADkh].

> In summary, I should confirm the distribution and associated motor signs to localize to radial nerve versus cervical root versus combined pathologies, use history and examination to screen for trauma, compression, systemic disease, and medications, apply EDX and ultrasound selectively when the diagnosis is uncertain or severity grading is needed, and align management with the most likely etiology while maintaining vigilance for red flags and atypical presentations that warrant early escalation [^114AmhKz] [^116hmEpT] [^1113RWDJ] [^114E49aL].

Arm numbness from the triceps to the fingers most often reflects **radial nerve injury** at the spiral groove (Saturday night palsy) [^114NMx6i] or a brachial plexus lesion, but can also be due to ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^1129SMZz], cervical radiculopathy (C7–T1) [^115dAD7v], or thoracic outlet syndrome [^114oUvYb]. Key diagnostic steps include a focused exam to localize motor and sensory deficits [^1113RWDJ], **electrodiagnostic testing** (NCS/EMG) [^1113RWDJ] to confirm level and severity, and MRI to exclude mass lesions or cervical pathology [^111bGEXw]. Management is cause-specific: radial neuropathy often improves with observation and splinting [^1113RWDJ]; ulnar neuropathy may need decompression; radiculopathy or TOS may require surgery if conservative care fails. Persistent or progressive symptoms warrant **urgent neurologic evaluation** [^1122wdmM].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

A **focused neurologic examination** should map sensory loss, identify weakness patterns, and elicit provocative signs (Tinel's, Phalen's, Spurling's) [^111mTRPH] [^112XDSBa]. Upper-quarter screening helps exclude proximal lesions and serious conditions [^115wuSvX].

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

- **Nerve conduction studies (NCS)**: Localize radial or ulnar neuropathy, distinguish from radiculopathy [^1132pu4C].
- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Assess severity, axonal loss, and reinnervation [^111myxqo].

---

### Imaging studies

- **MRI**: Evaluate cervical spine, brachial plexus, or peripheral nerve compression [^111bGEXw].
- **Ultrasound**: Identify nerve enlargement, compression, or masses [^116yBYGX].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Radial neuropathy**: Observation, splinting, physical therapy; most recover spontaneously [^notfound].
- **Ulnar neuropathy**: Activity modification, elbow splinting, NSAIDs [^notfound].
- **Cervical radiculopathy**: Physical therapy, analgesics, epidural steroids [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **severe or progressive deficits** or failure of conservative care. Radial neuropathy may require decompression or exploration when compression is confirmed. Ulnar neuropathy is managed with cubital tunnel release or transposition. Cervical radiculopathy is treated with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion when indicated, and thoracic outlet syndrome is addressed with first rib resection or scalenectomy.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by cause and severity. Radial neuropathy generally has a good prognosis with recovery over weeks to months, whereas **ulnar neuropathy** has a good prognosis with timely intervention. Cervical radiculopathy prognosis depends on the severity of **nerve root compression**, and thoracic outlet syndrome prognosis is favorable with **surgical decompression**.

---

Arm numbness from the triceps to the fingers most often reflects radial or ulnar neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, cervical radiculopathy, or thoracic outlet syndrome. Accurate diagnosis relies on **clinical evaluation, electrodiagnostics, and imaging**, with management tailored to the cause and severity.

Purpose

Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome commonly present with paresthesias and pain extending into the small finger and proximal to the hand. This study was conducted to assess the ability of carpal tunnel release to relieve symptoms outside of the median nerve distribution.

Methods

We enrolled 34 consecutive surgical patients (40 wrists) diagnosed exclusively with carpal tunnel syndrome based on the history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic studies. Preoperative symptoms were categorized as pain, numbness, tingling, or "burning and electrical shocks". The presence or absence of each symptom type was recorded in 5 topographical areas (zone I, palmar thumb/index/long; zone II, small finger; zone III, volar forearm; zone IV, volar arm; and zone V, dorsal hand/forearm/arm). Patients were contacted at 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively to assess resolution of each symptom type by topographic zone.

Results

Preoperatively, the cohort reported symptoms in all zones: zone I, 120 reports; zone II, 47 reports; zone III, 33 reports; zone IV, 7 reports; and zone V, 23 reports. Numbness (n = 40) and tingling (n = 38) were the most common symptoms, followed by pain (n = 29) and "burning/shocks" (n = 16). Postoperatively, the total number of reports within the 5 zones decreased from 230 to 20. The probability that surgery would eliminate patient symptoms was 88% (104 of 120) in zone I, 96% (45 of 47) in zone II, 97% (32 of 33) in zone III, 86% (6 of 7) in zone 4, and 100% (23 of 23) in zone V. Across zones, the overall probability of symptom resolution was as follows: pain > 80%, numbness/tingling > 85%, and "burning/shocks" > 90%.

Conclusions

Symptoms experienced outside of the median nerve distribution had a high likelihood of resolution after carpal tunnel release. Over 85% of symptoms in each of the anatomic zones studied resolved. Feelings of burning or shock-like sensations were most reliably relieved at early follow-up.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is by far the most common entrapment neuropathy (Adams et al. Am J Ind Med 25:527–536, 1994; Cheadle et al. Am J Public Health 84:190–196, 1994; Stevens et al. Neurology 38:134–138, 1988). A combination of described symptoms, clinical findings and electrophysiological testing is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several studies have suggested that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CTS, the accuracy of nerve sonography is similar to that for electromyography (Chen et al. BMC Med Imaging 11:22, 2011; Guan et al. Neurol Res 33:970–953, 2011; Kele et al. Neurology 61:389–391, 2003; Tai et al. Ultrasound Med Biol 38:1121–1128, 2012). In special cases though, the nerve sonography can reveal the cause of the median entrapment neuropathy (Fumière et al. JBR-BTR 85:1–3, 2002; Kele et al. J Neurosurg 97:471–473, 2002; Kele et al. Neurology 61:389–391, 2003; Zamora et al. J Clin Ultrasound 39:44–47, 2011).

Methods

A 43-year-old farmer was admitted to our department with 1 year of intermittent pain in the left hand and numbness of the thumb, index and middle finger. The pain and the numbness could be reproduced by extension of the wrist and fingers. The electrophysiological testing revealed signs of an entrapment median neuropathy in carpal tunnel.

Results

The high-resolution sonography (18 MHz) revealed signs of entrapment neuropathy with increased cross-sectional area, disturbed echostructure of the nerve and pathological wrist-to-forearm ratio, confirming the results from a similar study (Kele et al. Neurology 61:389–391, 2003). In addition, an elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis in the carpal tunnel could be identified. During the extension of the wrist and fingers, a greater protrusion of the muscle belly could be demonstrated causing compression of the median nerve.

Conclusions

We present a video case report of the sonographic findings of a patient diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome due to an elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis in the carpal tunnel. Our case highlights the importance of nerve sonography in the differential diagnosis of the cause of a carpal tunnel syndrome. With the aid of ultrasonography, it is possible to obtain very important information concerning different aspects of this case. First, in showing the presence of the elongated muscle belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis, the cause of the symptoms could be explained. Second, it was possible through the ultrasound study to explain the atypical clinical appearance in this case, demonstrating the compression neuropathy only after extension of the wrist and fingers. There have been no previous reports in which authors described an elongated muscle belly as cause of a CTS. Third, and perhaps most important, ultrasonography had a direct influence on our selection of therapeutical strategy and approach. As a result, we recommended in this patient a surgical therapy to completely solve the problem, but the patient declined this option and preferred a conservative therapy with a hand orthosis to prevent wrist extension. In conclusion we recommend ultrasonography as a very useful method in the diagnostic evaluation of carpal tunnel syndrome. We have clearly demonstrated that ultrasonography can be used to discover the cause of median nerve compression, especially in cases with an atypical clinical presentation.

### Neurosensory component of hand-arm vibration syndrome: a 22-year follow-up study [^1149Gznw]. Occupational Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

In 1994, all employees (n = 211) in two workshop units (sheet metal workers performing grinding/welding and machinists) of an engineering and construction company participated in a HAVS examination. We used the 1994 questionnaire to select workers for the 2017 study. Workers who reported previous work-related exposure to hand–arm vibration (HAV), symptoms of hand numbness and/or white finger attacks were classified as the 'HAVS group'. Those who answered 'no' to these three items were classified as the 'non-HAVS' group. Participation was voluntary. Written informed consent was obtained. The Regional Ethics Committee, South-East-B approved the study.

We interviewed the workers about work and leisure exposure to hand-transmitted vibration (tool, hours per day, days per year, number of years). Exposure was calculated as hours of occupational vibration exposure during follow-up. Neurosensory symptoms were assessed by the Stockholm Workshop Scale (SWS): 0 = no problems; 1 = periodically recurring numbness/paraesthesia; 2 = commonly recurring numbness/paraesthesia; 3 = constant numbness marked by reduced sensitivity, clumsiness and reduced dexterity. Scores for shoulder/arm pain and finger pain were assessed by the questions 'Over the past five days, have you felt pain in your shoulder or arm?' and 'Over the past five days, have you felt pain in your fingers?' Response alternatives were no pain/a bit of pain/some pain/quite a lot of pain (score range: 0–3). The carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis was based on a prior known diagnosis of the condition.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the elbow, forearm, and wrist [^113Esuxa]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Nerve entrapment syndromes usually have typical clinical presentations and findings on physical examination. Imaging can be used to evaluate a structural cause of the entrapment, such as a mass or enlarged muscle or to show secondary findings that confirm the diagnosis, such as nerve swelling or muscle edema or atrophy. This article will review entrapment syndromes of the elbow, forearm, and wrist.

Conclusion

To make an accurate assessment of the images, the radiologist must know the normal anatomy of the nerve, the places where the nerve can be compressed, and the muscles that are innervated by a particular nerve.

Positioning strategies to reduce perioperative ulnar neuropathy — For a supine patient with arm on an armboard, position the upper extremity to decrease pressure on the postcondylar groove of the humerus (ulnar groove), and use of either supination or the neutral forearm positions may be used to facilitate this action. For a supine patient with arms tucked at side, place the forearm in a neutral position, and when possible, avoid flexion of the elbow to decrease the risk of ulnar neuropathy; there is no consensus on an acceptable degree of flexion during the perioperative period.

### Diagnosis and treatment of scapulocostal syndrome… [^116P3ddZ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The scapulocostal syndrome is manifested by the insidious development of pain in the superior or posterior aspect of the shoulder girdle with radiation into one or more of the following regions: the neck and occiput, often associated with severe headache; the upper arm, particularly in the upper triceps and point of insertion of the deltoid muscle; around the chest to the front of the thoracic wall; and down the medial aspect of the forearm into the hand and fingers. Often there is numbness and tingling of the fingers, most commonly the fourth and fifth. The syndrome is caused by long-standing alteration of the relationship between the scapula and the posterior thoracic wall. It is characterized by remissions and exacerbations and may become acute, but it is more often chronic and can persist for years. It is refractory to the usual forms of physical therapy and is.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis - History

Although NTOS is the most common subtype, representing up to 95% of TOS diagnoses, it is also the most controversial because it is difficult to diagnose, and remains without objective measures/criteria for diagnosis. As a result, the diagnosis remains one of exclusion, and relies heavily on a detailed and thorough history and physical examination. Unlike ATOS and VTOS, which can be diagnosed using ultrasound or CTA, objective measures and testing procedures for diagnosing NTOS remain limited. Further obscuring the diagnosis is confounding diagnoses that present with similar symptoms. For instance, patients who present with neck and arm pain may be misdiagnosed with cervical radiculopathy, rotator cuff injury, or peripheral nerve entrapment.

More recently, the Society for Vascular Surgery developed reporting standards for Thoracic outlet syndrome, including standardized nomenclature, definitions, and more consistent reporting standards. The most recent definition from 2016 by Illig etdefines NTOS as the presence of three of the four criteria:

1. Local symptoms in an area of compression (e.g. chest wall, trapezius, neck) and confirmed with pain on palpation in the specific area

2. Peripheral findings of arm or hand symptoms based on history, and confirmed by provocative maneuvers that reproduce or worsen the symptoms.

3. Absence of other reasonable/likely diagnoses such as cervical, shoulder, or peripheral nerve pathology.

4. Positive response to a scalene injection (typically local anesthetic)

Patients may also note a history of trauma. It is important to evaluate occupational, avocational, or sports activity risk factors. Other key symptoms that can be obtained from a thorough history include complaints of pain, numbness, tingling, sleep disturbances, and weakness, while exacerbating factors can include exercising, overhead arm motion, and driving. Symptom distribution generally involves all five fingers but can be more pronounced in the fourth and fifth digits and the ulnar forearm. Symptoms can sometimes be distinguished from cervical disc syndrome since NTOS generally presents without dermatomal preference, while cervical stenosis or disc syndrome may often present with a more defined dermatomal pattern; however, this can also make it difficult for general physicians, as the patient may complain of a nonspecific clinical presentation thereby confounding the picture and leading to an inaccurate or delayed diagnosis.

### A rare case of erythema elevatum diutinum presenting as diffuse neuropathy [^1123unkZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

An otherwise healthy 56-year-old white woman presented in 2000 with extreme nausea attacks followed by cold sweats and shivering of 6 months' duration. An extensive gastrointestinal workup had normal results. Several months later, she reported seeing the muscles of her extremities contracting tightly during nausea attacks, with extremity pain on standing and sitting. Over the next few years, she slowly lost mobility in her arms and legs. She visited many doctors without a clear diagnosis.

In 2006, she reported discrete lumps at locations of pressure, mostly her fingers and soles, worse in the evening and associated with shooting pain and numbness of her hands and feet. She presented to the neurology department where she received a diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Electromyography found a diffuse neuropathy of unknown etiology.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^113gYsNA]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Widely accepted mechanistic explanations for ulnar neuropathy are stretch or compression of the nerve, causing physical distortion to normal nerve architecture and disruption to the vasa nervorum. Resultant nerve ischaemia disrupts normal axonal transmission and causes neuropathy. There is evidence that the ulnar nerve is more sensitive to global ischaemia than other nerves. In one study of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in 10 healthy volunteers undergoing general anaesthesia, the change in ulnar nerve signal amplitude brought about by brachial artery occlusion was significantly greater compared with both median and radial nerves. Similarly, in awake volunteers subjected to upper-limb tourniquet ischaemia, paraesthesia in an ulnar distribution is observed before median or radial nerve symptoms (although the degree to which this effect is observed as a result of solely ischaemia, rather than combined ischaemia and direct compression, is uncertain). The topography of the ulnar nerve at the elbow (with relatively little epineural tissue and a superficial position) may increase susceptibility to injury. In healthy volunteers, reduced blood flow is observed in the posterior ulnar recurrent artery (supplying the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel) when the elbow is flexed to 120°. This could contribute to nerve ischaemia and subsequent injury during excessive or prolonged elbow flexion during anaesthesia.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^113jfjWG]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathological Findings

The large number of terminal rami of the MCNF and their unpredictable course around the medial aspect of the elbow explain why this nerve can pose challenges in cubital tunnel surgery. Understanding the normal anatomy of the MCNF is clinically significant, as injuries to this nerve can occur not only during surgical cubital tunnel release but also during various procedures such as brachial plexus block, phlebotomy, venipuncture, and elbow injections or surgeries (Figures 5 and 6). The nerve is also susceptible to compression and damage by soft tissue masses around the arm and elbow, such as lipomas.

Figure 5
Iatrogenic neuropathy of the posterior branch of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (MCNF) following cubital tunnel surgery. Axial ultrasound imaging obtained with a 24‐8 MHz probe reveals an enlarged ulnar nerve (white arrowheads) with a loss of fascicular echotexture, a consequence of long‐standing compressive neuropathy. After cubital tunnel release, the enlarged posterior branch of the MCNF is visible immediately anterior to the medial epicondyle (white asterisk), resulting from the formation of an in‐continuity neuroma.

A 32-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of numbness of the little finger and the ulnar aspect of the ring finger of his right hand. He complained about the weakness of grip strength and ulnar-sided pain. At the first glance, wasting of the first interossei muscle could be recognized. In his detailed examination, the medial half of the palmar aspect of the hand, including the hypothenar eminence, along with the palmar side of the fourth and fifth digits showed decreased sensation to light touch. Severe weakness of the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) was noted. No sensory loss was found in the dorsum of the hand, excluding the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.

### Multifocal sensory demyelinating neuropathy: report of a case [^114rrvFw]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multifocal sensory demyelinating neuropathy has not been adequately reported in the literature.

Methods

A 42-year-old man with numbness of the left hand for 3 years and of the right hand for 6 months had a pure multifocal sensory neuropathy involving both hands, most prominently affecting 2-point discrimination, number writing, and object recognition of the left hand. Near-nerve needle sensory and mixed nerve conduction studies were performed on the left ulnar nerve.

Results

Studies of the left ulnar nerve documented a demyelinating neuropathy characterized by temporal dispersion and marked decrease in the amplitudes of the sensory and mixed compound nerve potentials in the above-elbow-axilla segment. With intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, there was improvement in his neuropathic condition.

Conclusion

In this study I describe a case of multifocal sensory demyelinating neuropathy as a counterpart of multifocal motor neuropathy. Muscle Nerve 56: 825–828, 2017.

### Isolated medial head of triceps rupture [^116NKKP5]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Triceps ruptures are less common injuries presenting to the orthopaedic or emergency department setting compared with other musculoskeletal injuries. This to some extent reduces the level of index of suspicion or chances of considering the triceps rupture as one of the differential diagnosis while examining a patient following upper limb injury. The literature search shows that a significant proportion of patient diagnosis has been missed during initial presentation, leading to a delay in diagnosis and in providing definitive treatment, ranging from 6 to 18months. The triceps are the primary extensor of the elbow and are supplied with the radial nerve. Any injury to the triceps can adversely affect the functioning of the limb and influence the ability to work and return to employment. We share our experience of treating a patient with a triceps rupture, in whom the diagnosis was made 6months after injury; the patient was able to return to manual work 3months after surgical repair.

### A panorama of radial nerve pathologies-an imaging diagnosis: a step ahead [^114NMx6i]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients with radial neuropathy can present either with motor dysfunction or sensory symptoms only. Pain over the lateral aspect of the arm extending up to the wrist is the most common complaint in cases of radial tunnel syndrome. Injury to the radial nerve high up in the arm can result in complete loss of extensor function while injuries distal to the supply of triceps brachii spares its function. Fracture of the humerus shaft can result in wrist drop as injury to the nerve usually occurs in the spiral groove or in the mid-arm. The patients will also have loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of arm, forearm, thenar eminence and radial three and a half digits.

Compression of the superficial branch causes paralysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digiti quinti and extensor digitorum communis, while compression of the PIN causes paralysis of the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus and extensor indicis proprius. Function of the extensor carpi radialis longus is spared as the fibres arise more proximally from the main branch of the radial nerve. This results in finger drop with deviation of the wrist to the radial aspect which is the classical presentation in cases of PIN palsy. Wartenburg syndrome is entrapment of the superficial branch at the distal radius and presents with pain and numbness in the posterior part of the thumb.

Patients with peripheral nerve sheath tumours may present with visible swelling with no motor or sensory deficit.

Clinical examination and electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction velocity [NCV] and electromyography [EMG]) have been the mainstays of diagnosis in neuropathies as they provide essential information about the type of dysfunction and help in clinical monitoring. EMG may not be positive for 3–6 weeks following injury. Tinel's sign helps in assessing the possible site of injury and helps in assessment of improvement over time. Nerve injuries were classified by Seddon in 1943 and expanded by Sunderland in 1951. Mackinnon and Dellon in 1992 added grade VI injury to Sunderland's grading scheme and defined it as a mixed type of injury which denotes various types of injuries across the cross section of the nerve. Table 1 illustrates this classification along with imaging findings in different types of nerve injuries.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^111vxUhM]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical symptoms

Pain

Eleven studies reported pain as selection criterion. One study reported that pain intensity should be above 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). One study mentioned using the inclusion criteria from another study.

The location of pain (arm and/or neck) was described in 11 studies as criterion, but in two studies the location 'cervicobrachial pain' and 'neck pain' was not further explained. Two studies solely reported arm pain to be present, of which one study stated that arm pain, with radiation distal to the elbow, plus at least provocation of arm pain by neck movements should be positive as selection criterion. Six studies included patients with neck pain and arm pain. In three of these studies, patients also had to have nerve root distribution of the pain for inclusion.

Five studies described the duration of pain as selection criterion. These studies included patients with pain duration of < 1 month, > 1 month, < 3 months, or > 3 months. The total range of duration of pain ranged from 1 month to 1 year, from 6 months to 1 year, or from 1 month to 2 years.

We concluded that there was consensus (11 out of 13 studies; 85%) on pain as a selection criterion, but no consensus on the exact location, intensity, or duration of pain. Only 6 out of 13 studies (46%) require both neck and arm pain to be simultaneously present.

Sensory symptoms

There were five studies which used sensory symptoms as selection criteria. One study mentioned using reflex disturbances, motor and sensory deficits, together with the distribution of pain, to determine the clinical level of radiculopathy.

Other inclusion criteria used were paraesthesia, numbness, and sensory changes. A definition of these terms or what the symptoms include was often not explicitly outlined.

Three studies provided information concerning the location of the sensory symptoms. The C7 dermatome, one or more adjacent dermatomes, and symptoms in unilateral upper extremity were mentioned. The exact location of the sensory symptoms was not further explained in any of the studies.

No study described whether the information on sensory symptoms was gathered during history taking or by physical examination. In conclusion, we found no consensus (5 out of 13; 38%) across the studies about sensory symptoms as a selection criterion.

A 38-year-old woman gave a 1-year history of difficulties climbing stairs and walking long distances, needing a wheelchair at times. More recently, she had also experienced weakness of her arms with difficulties doing her hair or lifting light weights. She reported shortness of breath on mild exertion and had lost 12 pounds in weight because of muscle loss. She had no muscle pain, episodes of dark urine, muscle twitching, visual disturbances, hearing loss, speech difficulties, dysphagia, numbness or tingling, bladder or bowel difficulties, fevers, rash or joint pain. She had met all milestones at a normal age and had normal development.

Her medical history was unremarkable. She had not taken any lipid-lowering agents and there was no illicit drug use or toxic exposure. There was no relevant family history and no consanguinity.

On examination, she showed bilateral and symmetric scapular winging. There was no percussion or action myotonia or paramyotonia, and no fasciculations. Her muscle bulk and tone were normal. Cranial nerves were all normal. Manual muscle strength testing showed the following Medical Research Council (MRC) grades (right/left where applicable): neck flexion 4–, neck extension 5, shoulder abduction 4/4, external rotation of elbow 4/4, elbow flexion 4/4, elbow extension 4+/4+, wrist flexion 5/5, wrist extension 5/5, finger flexion 5/5, finger extension 5/5, hip flexion 4/4, hip extension 3/3, hip abduction 3/3, knee extension 4+/4+, knee flexion 4/4, ankle dorsiflexion 5/5 and ankle plantar flexion 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ at triceps, brachioradialis and ankles, and 2+ at biceps and knees bilaterally. She had a waddling gait. Plantar responses were flexor. Sensory and coordination exams were normal.

Hand-arm vibration (HAV) is a global work-related exposure that can cause different injuries. Vibration white fingers (Raynaud's phenomena caused by HAV exposure) and vibration neuropathy are well known symptoms of HAV. HAV exposure is also associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

CTS is one of the most common peripheral entrapments and is caused by compression of the median nerve passing the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Symptoms of CTS are neurological symptoms from the median nerve innervated area with numbness and tingling during the night or when the wrist is flexed. Clinically, CTS is often diagnosed with provoking tests, such as Tinel's test (percussion on palmar side) and Phalen's test (flexion of the wrist), which may induce symptoms or decrease vibro-tactile sense. Nerve conduction examination of the median nerve is often used to confirm the diagnosis prior to any treatment such as wrist brace, steroid injection, or surgery.CTS is an important contributor to work disability and is important to prevent.

The presence of pain in the arm corresponded to the site compression in 23% of cases, forearm pain or paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 32% and 66%, respectively, hand pain and paresthesia corresponded to a single root or one of two roots in 70% and 27%, respectively, and subjective weakness corresponded to a single level in 22/34 (79%) cases. Potential level was II with downgraded level II, and conclusions state that clinical findings related to the fingers are the most accurate for localizing a CDH to a single level, and that single level CDH may produce signs and symptoms that correspond to overlapping dermatomal levels.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115dAD7v]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — history and examination findings emphasize paresthesia distribution and specific provocative tests. Paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and the distribution of paresthesia in the hand is also considered more valid than the distribution of paresthesia in the forearm. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to vocalize the paresthesia to a distinct region. Dermatomal mapping notes that paresthesia of the thumb or index finger is attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index) to the C7 dermatome, and the little finger to the C8 dermatome. In a best evidence review, a positive Spurling's, traction/neck distraction, and Valsalva can be used to establish a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, and the existing literature appears to indicate high specificity, low sensitivity, and good to fair interexaminer reliability. For detection of radiculopathy, the presence of numbness has varied significantly from 24% to 48%, and 60% to as high as 86%; numbness is most often seen in the C6 and C7 dermatomes, and the predictive validity of numbness was calculated to be 0.7. Regarding imaging, in patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease; however, plain radiography was not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain, and no systematic reviews were identified which examined the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic imaging in those with neck pain.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^116yBYGX]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Relevance and General Scanning Recommendation

Patients with cutaneous sensory nerve disorders typically experience symptoms resulting from either loss of function (anesthesia) or irritation (paresthesia or stabbing pain) of the affected nerve. The distribution of sensory symptoms along an area supplied by specific nerve can help identify the source of the problem. However, in some cases, the syndromes may be harder to recognize, as major nerve trunks may be affected alongside minor cutaneous nerves (eg, in large penetrating lesions). Additionally, when the affected cutaneous nerve is a terminal branch of a mixed nerve, such as the musculocutaneous nerve, sensory alterations may be associated with atrophy of specific muscle groups.

US imaging can accurately localize the site of injury, assist in formulating a prognosis, and help plan surgical intervention. With recent advances in ultrasound transducer technology, high and very high‐frequency probes (24–33 MHz) are now available, enabling the detection of even subtle pathological changes along the course of millimetric and submillimetric nerves. Cutaneous sensory nerves may be affected by traumatic injuries, compressive syndromes, tumors (Figure 1), diffuse neuropathies (eg, dysimmune conditions), and infectious diseases (eg, leprosy).

Figure 1
Fifty‐year‐old patient complaining of shooting pain on the lateral aspect of the forearm during flexion of the elbow against resistance. Electroneurography of the upper limb turned out negative. Considering the distribution of pain, a systematic scanning of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (LCNF) was performed. The image in A shows an axial view at the distal third of the arm. The LCNF (white arrowheads) is seen in the fascial plane between biceps and brachialis. More distally (image B) a round, regular, hypoechoic structure along the LCNF is demonstrated (white asterisk), in close proximity to the lateral side of the biceps tendon (outlined arrowheads). The axial image C obtained immediately distally to the mass shows the enlarged LCNF (with arrowheads), as commonly found in proximity to a nerve sheath tumor. The diagnosis of schwannoma was proposed and the mass removed. Outlined arrowhead in A: intramuscular aponeurosis of biceps; white arrow in A: median nerve; BA: brachial artery; outlined arrowheads in C: distal biceps tendon; BRad: brachioradialis.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^115QiNxk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting levofloxacin or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid levofloxacin in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.3); Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of levofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

Discontinue levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Peripheral nerves of the upper limb may become entrapped at various points during their anatomical course. While physical examination and nerve conduction studies are the mainstay of diagnosis, there are multiple imaging options, specifically ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offer important information about the potential cause and location of nerve entrapment that can help guide management. This article overviews the anatomical course of various upper limb nerves, including the long thoracic, spinal accessory, axillary, suprascapular, radial, median, ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves, and describes the common locations and causes of entrapments for each of the nerves. Common ultrasound and MRI findings of nerve entrapments, direct or indirect, are described, and various examples of the more commonly observed cases of upper limb nerve entrapments are provided.

### Pain and carpal tunnel syndrome [^1151M5HN]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pain is not a classical symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), with the exception of numbness that is so intense that it is described by patients as painful. The primary aim of our study was to determine which factors correlated with pain for patients diagnosed with CTS.

Methods

We prospectively assessed all patients diagnosed with CTS in our unit over a 1-year period. We recorded demographic details for all patients, including past medical history, body mass index, smoking, and occupation. The diagnosis and severity of carpal tunnel syndrome were established through a combination of history, clinical assessment, and nerve conduction studies. Of 275 patients diagnosed and treated for CTS, 183 were women (67%), the mean age was 55 years (range, 22–87 y), and 166 cases were bilateral (60%). The mean body mass index was 29.5 kg/m2 (range, 17–48 kg/m2), and 81 patients smoked (30%). Patients completed a Short Form-McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) as a measure of pain at initial presentation. We assessed outcome 1 year after intervention using the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score.

Results

We found no association between pain according to the SF-MPQ and the positive clinical signs of CTS or positive nerve conduction studies. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that smoking and bilateral disease independently correlated with the overall SF-MPQ, with similar findings on subanalysis. Independent factors associated with an increased improvement in the QuickDASH at 1 year were the presentation QuickDASH score, positive nerve conduction studies, and smoking.

Conclusions

The only independent factors that correlated with pain at presentation of CTS were smoking and bilateral disease. Pain according to the SF-MPQ was not associated with classical clinical findings of the disease or with positive findings on nerve conduction testing.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114X1p9K]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Examination

No single sign or physical finding is diagnostic of neuropathic pain. Nearly 50% of patients with musculoskeletal pain use words that are commonly associated with neuropathic pain (e.g. "shooting" and "tingling") to describe their pain, and as much as 30% of patients with non-neuropathic pain will describe "burning", thus making it difficult to rely on patient history and descriptions alone. Consequently, a thorough examination is crucial to determining the actual presence of neuropathic pain over more ambiguous symptoms or conditions.

The physical examination for neuropathic pain is straightforward and should include evaluation of tone, strength, reflexes, sensation, and vasomotor/sudomotor activity. It requires a paperclip or pin to test "pinprick" sensation, a cotton ball or fingers to test "light touch", a reflex hammer cooled with tap water to test response to "cold", a tuning fork at 128 Hz for "vibration" sensation, and a thermometer to assess vasomotor responses. Classically, a patient with neuropathic pain should have abnormal sensation in the area of maximal pain intensity. Sensory changes should be rated as "increased", "decreased", or "normal"; a patient with neuropathic pain will commonly demonstrate decreased sensation to some sensory modalities and report pain in response to others. The overall purpose of the examination should be to rule in, or out, the relevant neural pathways related to the patient's history.

If a neural lesion is suspected, an electroneuromyography (EMG) and nerve stimulation study (NCS) can be performed to better define the region/area of defect and narrow the possibilities. If the examination fails to reveal a clear diagnosis but neuropathic pain is still suspected, referral to neurology or a more detailed investigation using quantitative sensory testing (QST) may be warranted in ambiguous cases. Referral to a pain physician also may be indicated for diagnostic nerve blocks to further narrow down the source of the pain. Lastly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or skin biopsy can be used to identify central lesions or small fiber neuropathy, respectively.

### The tinel sign: a historical perspective [^115nszFM]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The Tinel sign is one of the most well-known and widely used clinical diagnostic tools in medicine. Aside from Jules Tinel, after whom the sign is named, several authors have described the famous "tingling" sign seen in regenerating injured nerves. In fact, Tinel was not the first to present the sign to the scientific community. The clinical value and utility of the Tinel sign have remained in question since its introduction; many may misinterpret the sign as a prelude to complete functional recovery of injured nerves, when in fact it only signals the progress of nerve regeneration. Today the Tinel sign is widely associated with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and in the evaluation of regenerating peripherally injured nerves. Knowledge of the history and misconceptions surrounding the sign provides clinicians today with a greater appreciation of current debates on the use of the Tinel sign.

### Mottled Raynaud's phenomenon and hand-arm vibration syndrome: followed up for 10 years [^113DTHPb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Clinical examination ruled out other conditions presenting with RP, including connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma and lupus or mixed connective tissue diseases. The patient had no history of use of any drugs that cause secondary RP, including nicotine, ergotamine, beta-blockers and cocaine. Additionally, no hypothyroidism or malignant disease was found. Buerger's disease and arteriosclerosis obliterans were excluded.

Neurological examination and cervical spine MRI showed no evidence of radiculopathy or cervical myelopathy. This case might be complicated by carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common complication of HAVSand is also well known to present with RP. However, it was difficult to diagnose these symptoms with carpal tunnel syndrome alone because the numbness was stronger in the 10 fingertips and extended to both hands. The most common neurological symptoms of HAVS, as in this case, are tingling, numbness and pain in the symmetrical distribution of the glove, caused by small nerve fibre injuries.

Other diseases causing peripheral neuropathy were also excluded, including diabetes, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, hereditary neuropathy, neurofibromatosis and sarcoidosis. In this case, the neurological symptoms were speculated to be a combination of carpal tunnel syndrome and peripheral neuropathy caused by hand-arm vibration. In the cold season, ischaemic symptoms of peripheral circulatory disturbance appeared, and the patient's pain worsened even more.

### Diagnosis and treatment of work-related ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^111AC9BR]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common entrapment neuropathy after carpal tunnel syndrome and occurs most commonly at the elbow due to mechanical forces that produce traction or ischemia to the nerve. The primary symptom associated with UNE is diminished sensation or dysesthesias in the fourth or fifth digits, often coupled with pain in the proximal medial aspect of the elbow. Treatment may be conservative or surgical, but optimal management remains controversial. Surgery should include exploration of the ulnar nerve throughout its course around the elbow and release of all compressive structures.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^116TPueP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome classification — severity-based clinical and electrodiagnostic criteria: Carpal tunnel syndrome is most commonly classified by severity (mild, moderate, severe, or extreme). According to Gelberman et al, mild CTS included a symptom duration of less than 1 year with diffuse complaints, intermittent numbness, normal 2-point discrimination (2PD), absence of weakness or atrophy, and nerve conduction velocities increased only by 1 to 2 m/s with no fibrillations on electromyographic testing, whereas advanced CTS was characterized by permanent sensory and motor loss and thenar muscle atrophy. Maggard et al defined mild disease as all 3 of: symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS, intermittent symptoms, and no abnormalities of physical exam; moderate CTS included symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS, no thenar atrophy, and at least 1 of constant symptoms, thenar musculature weakness, or loss of sensory function in fingers 1, 2, or 3; and severe disease included symptom pattern at least characteristic of CTS and thenar muscle atrophy, and a Delphi consensus study identified thenar muscle atrophy, location/presence of sensory symptoms, nocturnal symptoms, and APB muscle weakness among the top 5 diagnostic criteria.

### Peripheral neuropathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^1122wdmM]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. 3 Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. 3 One-third of patients with peripheral neuropathy have neuropathic pain. 1 Other common presenting symptoms include a stabbing or electric shock sensation, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperesthesia. 1, 4, 13, 14 Patients may also report autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, gastroparesis, changes in bowel and bladder function, erectile dysfunction, and blurry vision, or vasomotor symptoms such as dryness of the eyes, mouth, or skin, and burning or flushing.

1. Nerve compression or injury from trauma or medical procedures should be considered. Common areas of compression include the sciatic nerve, fibular nerve, and femoral cutaneous nerve.

3 Common compression peripheral neuropathies include carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and radiculopathy from spinal degeneration.

1. In up to 50% of cases, the cause of peripheral neuropathy may not be identified with a history and physical examination, especially if the symptoms are mild. Additional physical examination testing may be needed for certain high-risk patient populations, such as those with diabetes. Combining vibratory sensation testing with a 128-Hz tuning fork plus sensory testing with a 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament increases the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy compared with either test alone in patients with diabetes. 1, 22 Studies also show that electrodiagnostic tests have low utility as part of initial workup. 1, 23 Given these findings, electrodiagnostic studies are not routinely indicated. However, patients should be referred for electrodiagnostic studies if symptoms are worrisome or if initial workup is normal and symptoms persist. Principles of Treatment Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying condition. In addition, treatment of the associated symptoms can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as proper foot hygiene, wearing appropriate footwear, weight loss, and physical therapy and gait training can help improve symptoms in those with lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^116Zy2qQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Documentation of the steps taken to reduce the risk of PUN in high-risk patients is important. In one analysis of closed claims of peripheral nerve injury after general anaesthesia, documentation was judged to be missing or erroneous and to be a contributory factor to the claim in 24% of cases. Patient positioning during anaesthesia and surgery is often documented in both medical (i.e. anaesthetic) and nursing (i.e. perioperative care practitioner) records. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, retrospective review of records typically yields incomplete or conflicting information about how patients were positioned and protected during anaesthesia. The anaesthetist carries overall responsibility for the physical safety of patients during anaesthesia, and therefore should satisfy themselves of the overall standards of record keeping kept during anaesthetic care. Minimum suggested intraoperative documentation regarding the prevention of PUN that we consider reasonable is listed in Table 4. In surgical procedures of prolonged duration (> 2 h), local protocols should advise intermittent checks and repositioning of limbs. In the absence of such protocols, clinicians are advised to document the intermittent checks they perform during anaesthesia, acknowledging that surgical draping and the sterile field may reduce access to the patient to perform such inspection. In addition to these measures, prevention of systemic insults to nerve tissue (hypotension, hypoperfusion, etc.) is advisable.

Table 4
Minimum suggested intraoperative documentation regarding the prevention of postoperative ulnar neuropathy (PUN).

Clinical presentation

Ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel is characterised by paraesthesia or pain in the fourth and fifth digits or medial forearm. Weakness of flexor digitorum profundus, lumbricals, and intrinsic hand muscles may be present. The diagnostic value of Tinel's sign or flexion compression tests at the elbow is poor. Tinel's sign has a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 62%, 53%, 77%, and 30%, respectively; it therefore offers little benefit over routine sensory and motor neurological examination. Atrophy of the ulnar intrinsic hand muscles has been described after surgery. In lesions arising from the cubital tunnel, the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle may be unaffected. The differential diagnosis for paraesthesia in the fourth or fifth digit or hand grip weakness in the postoperative period should always include carpal tunnel syndrome, as this is a known mimic of ulnar neuropathy, also presenting with digital numbness, paraesthesia, and weakness. Carpal tunnel syndrome can usually be differentiated clinically because the compression of the median nerve affects the first to third digits.

### Multimodality imaging of peripheral neuropathies of the upper limb and brachial plexus [^111bGEXw]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

The peripheral nerves of the upper limb are affected by a number of entrapment and compression neuropathies. These discrete syndromes involve the brachial plexus as well as the musculocutaneous, axillary, suprascapular, ulnar, radial, and median nerves. Clinical examination and electrophysiologic studies are the traditional mainstay of diagnostic work-up; however, ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging provide spatial information regarding the affected nerve and its surroundings, often assisting in narrowing the differential diagnosis and guiding treatment. Imaging is particularly valuable in complex cases with discrepant nerve function test results. Familiarity with the clinical features of various peripheral neuropathies of the upper extremity, the relevant anatomy, and the most common sites and causes of nerve entrapment assists in diagnosis and treatment.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^112zMx6A]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — best-practice documentation advises that in the course of the examination and episode of care, clinicians should document results of the following questions, tests, and measures; upon completion of the clinical patient/client data, clinicians should differentiate CTS from other nerve injuries and then assess the CTS severity to determine if an immediate surgical referral is warranted. Patients may require electrodiagnostic studies when the clinical exam is inconclusive, and when assessing effectiveness of nonsurgical management, results should be documented again at discharge or at other follow-up point. Documentation of standard elements supports standardization for quality improvement in clinical care and research.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^1114yLnd]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first SR on definitions and selection criteria for CR. Even though CR is often mentioned as a separate entity in the assessment of patients with neck pain, most studies use their own criteria to sub-classify patients with CR, making comparisons difficult.

One of our limitations was that we only included published RCTs. Relevant unpublished trials were not included, thus potentially leading to publication bias. However, if they exist, these studies are likely to be small and to increase heterogeneity and therefore are unlikely to change our results.

For the purpose of this review, we have chosen to exclude studies that only included surgical interventions, as surgical studies may possibly recruit a different group of patients to justify the need for an invasive treatment.

We recommend to aim for consensus on a definition of CR and selection criteria among experts in this area, preferably with criteria that are quantifiable with validated clinical tests. Data from two recent RCTs support the clinical finding that patients usually report experiencing more arm pain than neck pain. We therefore suggest defining CR as: "Radiating pain in the arm with motor, reflex and/or sensory changes (such as paraesthesiae or numbness), provoked by neck posture(s) and/or movement(s)". It is the researchers' intent to conduct a Delphi study on this definition among different international researchers and practitioners. We would suggest the following selection criteria: pain radiating into the arm and motor, reflex, and/or sensory changes in the upper limb such as paraesthesia or numbness.

Future research should aim at the validity of selection criteria.

### Mottled Raynaud's phenomenon and hand-arm vibration syndrome: followed up for 10 years [^1144Zysb]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

In this case, routine skin temperature testing between summer and winter showed no improvement. Therapeutic efficacy in severe cases is limited, so early diagnosis and occupational health interventions are critical. Patients often do not mention RP unless the clinician asks about it. Additionally, 'mottled' RP is rarely identified by clinicians and is often dismissed as atypical RP. Patients with 'mottled' RP may have severe circulatory impairment, and it should be recognised as a form of RP.

Patient's perspective

I have been working in civil engineering since my early twenties and have used vibration tools such as jackhammers, breakers, and tamper for 30 years. In the late thirties, my hands were cold, and tingling, so I could not sleep. I visited a hospital, but the doctors did not make a definite diagnosis. In the fifties, I was surprised to find that my fingers were white when I took off my gloves. Despite my symptoms, I continued to work to ensure my livelihood.

With the increasing age, symptoms gradually worsened, and the frequency of white fingers increased. It is hard to describe the numbness in words, but it is always a tingling numbness, like a bunch of ants crawling around. I have a poor sense of holding tools at work, and sometimes I drop a shovel or a hammer. I also experienced difficulties in daily life, such as dropping chopsticks, using toilet paper, and being unable to write properly.

I underwent various medical tests and was diagnosed with hand-arm vibration syndrome. I know an energetic colleague who is still working at 70. I was at the limit of my ability to work, so I decided to receive workers' compensation while receiving treatment. The treatment effect is temporary, and my symptoms continue. The frequency of white fingers has decreased, but it also appears in winter.

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^1178E4oy]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A Clinical Examination is Mandatory for CRPS

In particular, with red flags, a comprehensive clinical examination must be performed. The first steps are inspection and palpation. For instance, a skin lesion as an entrance for an infection could be found by inspection. If the "refractory" CRPS patient presents with an overprotected arm fixed to the body but without muscle wasting or contractures and with rough palms indicating physical work, there might be a mismatch between reported symptoms and objective findings. Objective typical CRPS findings are skin color changes, temperature difference, sweating, edema and reduced range of motion. However, those signs alone cannot differentiate between CRPS and localized inflammation like infection or arthritis. It is the distal limb generalization, which characterizes CRPS (see Figure 3 for illustration of non-CRPS where fingers are not affected).

Figure 3
Example of a toxic-induced skin ulcer. This painful extremity is red, swollen and has extensive hair growth, and the proximal skin was dry. The CRPS criteria 1–3 would be fulfilled but notice that the distal fingers have normal color and are without edema. The lack of a distal generalization of the symptoms speaks against CRPS. The obvious etiology in this case is a skin ulcer which developed after erroneous subcutaneous infusion of mitoxantrone and was finally cured with skin transplantation. In less obvious cases, when the phenomenon of distal generalization is ignored, such a constellation of symptoms could lead to a false CRPS diagnosis.

Sweating might be of particular interest. A local trauma does not induce hyperhidrosis, a peripheral nerve lesion causes sweat loss within the innervation territory, while sympathetic chain lesion causes sweat loss in the respective quadrants of the body. This means that hyperhidrosis might be relatively specific for CRPS while hypohidrosis is unspecific. Affected distal and proximal joints and trigger points in muscles of the affected limb (possibly involved in guarding mechanisms) should be manually investigated. A generalized joint affection in connective tissue disease should be recorded. The peripheral arterial pulses should be palpated and the capillary responses have to be noticed in some cases. Signs of deep venous thrombosis with pain in the lower leg should be looked for particularly after immobilization or after travelling a long distance.

Thereafter, patients should be exposed to a full neurological examination looking for upper and lower motor neuron signs and sensory symptoms including the spatial distribution of sensory loss or gain.

### Anatomical, clinical, and electrodiagnostic features of radial neuropathies [^1113RWDJ]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The radial nerve is the major nerve serving the extensor compartment of the arm. This article describes the anatomic features, clinical features based on lesion location, electrodiagnostic assessment, prognosis, and treatment of radial neuropathies. Numerous traumatic causes have been reported to result in radial neuropathies, including compression or stretch injury, surgical insult, or trauma. Entrapment is a rare cause of radial neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic testing has been used to distinguish radial neuropathy from other disorders presenting with wrist or finger drops. In addition, its use may aid in determining the prognosis for recovery of functional movement.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^114AmhKz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The RN can establish communicating branches with the sensory nerves of the forearm, the medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. It also has connections with the median nerve and its branches. The PIN contributes to the anterior interosseus branch of the median nerve, and the SBRN communicates with the palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve.

The typical motor deficits related to RN paralysis depend on the location of the pathology. The symptoms of PIN impairment include disrupted extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb and fingers and the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. This is called "finger drop". Normal sensation is retained. The result of paralysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris is radial deviation of the wrist during extension. The impairment of wrist extension resulting from RN injury is called "wrist drop". It is a symptom of weakening of the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi brevis. High radial nerve entrapment (HRNE), which is related to neuropathy of the higher levels of the RN, above the radial groove, can involve the triceps brachii and the anconeus. It subsequently leads to impairment of elbow extension. Long-term paralysis of the supplied muscles eventually leads to their atrophy.

The RN can be compressed at multiple locations from its origin at the brachial plexus to the ends of its terminal branches. Knowledge of the anatomy of these entrapments is crucial for establishing a correct diagnosis and implementing appropriate treatment (Table 2). Most RN neuropathies are related to its main trunk in the arm. However, the abundance of compressing factors and mimicry of the symptoms of other pathologies can present a real clinical challenge. The compressive neuropathy of the RN with nontraumatic origin is not an ordinary finding; therefore, each patient should undergo complex and thorough examination which may rule out more common causes of symptoms. For this reason, the individual approach to each patient is strongly advised.

What you need to know

Consider degenerative cervical myelopathy in patients over 50 with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck or limbs, imbalance, numbness, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and/or incontinence
Perform a full neurological assessment as early symptoms are subtle and non-specific
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is essential to detect degenerative changes in the cervical spine and cord compression
Time is Spine: Refer patients with suspected DCM promptly to a specialist for consideration of spinal surgery, as delayed diagnosis can lead to residual symptoms and functional disability

A 54 year old man presents with neck stiffness for about a year. He complains of numbness in his fingers and difficulty buttoning up his shirt, which has not improved following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. Of late, he has experienced unsteadiness and has started to use a walking stick after sustaining falls. He sees a neurologist who identifies hyperreflexia in his arms and legs. An MRI scan shows multilevel cervical spondylosis and disc herniation causing cord compression. He is diagnosed with degenerative cervical myelopathy and referred to spinal surgery for operative decompression.

### A rare manifestation of sarcoidosis with sensomotoric neuropathy of the ulnar nerve as the only symptom [^113CWX57]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 79-year-old woman was admitted complaining of progressive weakness and numbness of the right hand. The patient was otherwise healthy. The patient's history was unremarkable. Clinical and electrophysiological examination revealed a compression of the ulnar nerve in the ulnar sulcus and in Guyon's canal. Ultrasound evaluation showed a suspicious tumour proximal to the elbow close to the ulnar nerve. The ulnar sulcus was then released and an epineural and perineural lesion 3–4 cm proximal to the sulcus was excised under microscope. The histopathology confirmed the lesion as non-caseating sarcoid granulomas. The patient showed no other signs of systemic sarcoidosis, as neuropathy was the only symptom and the condition improved postoperatively. Sensory deficits and paraesthesia resolved fully. The extension of the minor finger remained slightly inferior compared with the not affected side. Sarcoid neuropathy is a rare neurological complication of sarcoidosis and has to be included in differential diagnosis of nerve conduction impairments.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: a systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^1151PtVY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Whereas the signs and symptoms of ulnar nerve dysfunction are straightforward to detect at the bedside, identifying the site, severity, and aetiology of the condition is more challenging. Neurological examination of the limbs and cranial nerves should be documented at the earliest opportunity in a patient suspected of having PUN. Routine screening of patients for evidence of PUN in the recovery room should not be undertaken. Sensory findings in PUN may include paraesthesia, numbness, pain, and loss of two-point discrimination in the ring and little finger.

Broad differential diagnoses to consider in such cases are muscle diseases, radiculopathy, myelopathy, spinal cord trauma/infarction, and stroke. A brachial plexus lesion arising from compression on a cervical rib is a further differential diagnosis to consider. A pre-existing abnormality along the course of a peripheral nerve, for example an area of nerve compression, may increase the likelihood that a further physically distinct insult will manifest with signs of symptoms of nerve injury. This is known as the 'double-crush' phenomenon. A history of pre-existing neurological symptoms in the upper limb should, therefore, be sought. New, acute postoperative pain or paralysis should trigger assessment for compartment syndrome or acute vascular compromise. Communication to the patient of examination findings, possible diagnoses, and further assessment should be undertaken by the relevant anaesthetist and must be documented in the medical record. When notified that a patient has developed PUN (which may come to the attention of anaesthetists months or even years after anaesthesia), practitioners should express their sympathy and offer any assistance to patients. In UK practice, offering an apology when something goes wrong does not mean admitting legal liability and does not automatically mean taking personal responsibility for preceding events. Such communication should be copied to the patient's general practitioner/family doctor. It is imperative that the anaesthetist or surgical team or both ensure a responsible physician is involved in the patient's care until either PUN symptoms resolve or treatment or oversight of long-term dysfunction is established.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome [^117QPckC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a well-described disorder caused by thoracic outlet compression of the brachial plexus and/or the subclavian vessels. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is the most common manifestation, presenting with pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and vasomotor changes of the upper extremity. Vascular complications of thoracic outlet syndrome are uncommon and include thromboembolic phenomena and swelling. The clinical presentation is highly variable, and no reproducible study exists to confirm the diagnosis; instead, the diagnosis is based on a physician's judgment after a meticulous history and physical examination. Both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods are available for thoracic outlet syndrome. Whereas nonsurgical management appears to be effective in some persons, surgical treatment has been shown to provide predictable long-term cure rates for carefully selected patients. In addition, physicians who do not regularly treat patients with thoracic outlet syndrome may not have an accurate view of this disorder, its treatment, or the possible success rate of treatment.

### Entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve [^1129SMZz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Ulnar nerve entrapment is the second most common nerve entrapment syndrome of the upper extremity. Although it may occur at any location along the length of the nerve, it is most common in the cubital tunnel. Ulnar nerve entrapment produces numbness in the ring and little fingers and weakness of the intrinsic muscles in the hand. Patient presentation and symptoms vary according to the site of entrapment. Treatment options are often determined by the site of pathology. Many patients benefit from nonsurgical treatment (eg, physical therapy, bracing, injection). When these methods fail or when sensory or motor impairment progresses, surgical release of the nerve at the site of entrapment should be considered. Surgical release may be done alone or with nerve transposition at the elbow. Most patients report symptomatic relief following surgery.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^114JzgK8]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The ultrasonographic features of small cutaneous nerve disorders are similar to those seen in larger nerves. Clinicians should look for focal or multifocal changes in nerve caliber or echogenicity, nerve discontinuity with or without neuroma formation, thickening of the epineurium, or hypoechoic scar tissue trapping the nerve. Certain cutaneous nerves are more vulnerable to injury in specific areas due to their proximity to tendons (eg, the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve) or common surgical sites (eg, the MCNF).

Small‐caliber superficial nerves should be examined in a short‐axis view along their entire course. If pathology is suspected, the nerve should also be imaged in the long axis for further characterization. While small superficial nerves are less prone to anisotropy compared to medium and large nerves, the probe should still be placed perpendicular to the major axis of the nerve during scanning. An oblique orientation can result in fewer sound waves being reflected back to the transducer, causing a falsely hypoechoic appearance of the examined structures. Finally, a side‐to‐side comparison can enhance diagnostic confidence by helping to identify abnormal findings more clearly.

### A woman with forearm amyotrophy [^111myxqo]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with benign sporadic monomelic amyotrophy of the distal part of the arm, called Hirayama disease. Clinical features included forearm amyotrophy sparing the brachioradialis muscle, cold paresis and causalgia. Neck magnetic resonance imaging was normal in neutral and flexion position. Electromyography showed denervated patterns in the extensor digitorum communis, and conduction studies ruled out multifocal motor neuropathy. Motor evoked potentials were normal. Serum IgG anti-GM1 antibodies were moderately raised but were negative 8 months later. Outcome was favourable within 15 months, with partial motor recovery. Pathogenesis remains controversial: neck flexion induced myelopathy via chronic anterior horn ischaemia due to forward displacement of the posterior wall of the dura mater, or benign variant of lower motor neuron disease? Whatever the pathomechanism is, the clinical features and outcome are the same.

### Median and ulnar nerve compressions: simplifying diagnostics and surgery at the elbow and hand [^111rGzxL]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the anatomy of the median and ulnar nerves. 2. Perform clinical examination of the upper limb. 3. Analyze examination results to diagnose level of nerve compression.

Summary

Numbness and loss of strength are common complaints in the hand surgery clinic. Two nerves that are commonly entrapped (median and ulnar nerves) have several potential sites of entrapment, and in busy clinical practice, the less common sites may be overlooked, leading to wrong or missed diagnoses. This article reviews the anatomy of the median and ulnar nerves, provides tips to assist the busy clinician in diagnosis of site of entrapment(s), and discusses how to simplify surgery. The goal is to help the clinician be as efficient and accurate as possible when evaluating the patient with numbness or loss of strength in their hand.

Digital nerves arise from the radial, median and ulnar nerves. They are divided into palmar and dorsal branches and provide sensory and motor supply to the distal fingers. Injury to the digital nerves impairs hand dexterity and causes numbness and/or pain which radiates down the fingers. They are most commonly damaged by trauma (including surgical as shown in Fig. 17), but other causes of entrapment include inflammation, vascular malformations and neoplasms.

Fig. 17

There is fusiform enlargement of the digital nerve (blue arrows) palmar-radial to the site of the prior A1 pulley release, extending over a length of 5 mm. Sonographic palpation elicited the usual symptom of pain radiating down the thumb. There is an echogenic focus (white arrow) immediately superficial to the nerve which may represent suture material (or calcification). This is consistent with entrapment given the proximity to the site of prior intervention

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^115n11ZW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy diagnosis and testing relies primarily on clinical history, as the diagnosis of the more chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can generally be made by clinical history and if a patient receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy develops new or worsening numbness, tingling, and/or pain in their hands and/or feet without another good reason, then the diagnosis is made; neurologic physical examination can be abnormal, electromyography (EMG) can be used but is not usually necessary, and although nerve conduction studies in asymptomatic patients can predict the development or worsening of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), these tests are not routinely used.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^117JWvP4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 10 — AV access early postoperative evaluation and complications states that KDOQI considers it reasonable for AV access (arteriovenous fistula [AVF] and arteriovenous graft [AVG]) to be evaluated by a surgeon/operator for postoperative complications within 2 weeks and for an appropriate member of the vascular access team to evaluate for AVF maturation by 4–6 weeks after AV access creation and refer for further investigation if not maturing as expected (Expert Opinion). Ideally, the surgeon/operator evaluating for complications would be the same individual who created the AV access, early surgical complications need immediate attention and are best addressed by the surgeon or operator who created the vascular access, and surgeons typically see patients within 2 weeks to assess wound healing and potential complications; early complications include thrombosis, immaturity, infection, pain, numbness, weakness, and edema of the ipsilateral arm/hand, infections are more common after AVG than AVF and the majority of AVG infections occur in the first month, hand or finger tingling and numbness usually resolves within 4 weeks, and persistent edema (> 2 weeks) suggests central vein stenosis.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — nonsurgical management monitoring and baseline assessment: Clinicians should assess symptom duration, severity of nighttime symptoms, presence of a positive Phalen test, presence of thenar eminence muscle wasting, and prior nonsurgical interventions in individuals with CTS because these factors have been shown to influence results with nonsurgical management. In light of a preponderance of studies reporting fairly high rates of progression to surgery, clinicians must measure progress carefully and refer patients for surgical consultation if improvement with nonsurgical management is not observed.

Neurogenic TOS is the most common. Neuropathic pain is manifested by tingling and numbness in the fingers. In venous TOS, swelling and pain, mostly seen in the upper extremity, are at the forefront. Special tests that trigger the patient's symptoms are used for diagnosis. In addition, thoracic output can be evaluated with computed tomography (CT) and MRI. The continuity of vascular structures can be evaluated with Doppler USG, and nerve conduction can be evaluated with EMG. The diagnosis is clarified with history, physical examination, and imaging methods. Since our hospital is a low-budget hospital, we were only able to perform CT and superficial USG. Considering the patient's neurological and vascular symptoms in the right upper extremity, we decided to excise the mass without performing any other examination.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^114E49aL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The superficial sensory nerves of the upper limb are prone to several pathological conditions that may lead to disabling and often difficult to diagnose syndromes. US should be considered as a first level diagnostic modality in cases of suspected neuropathies of the MCNA, MCNF, PCNF, and LCNF, as it may provide critical information on nerve status that is often missed by electrodiagnostic and MRI studies. However, performing high‐ and ultra‐high‐resolution ultrasound examinations requires advanced, high‐end equipment, which may limit the widespread adoption of this specialized imaging technique.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^111gVjVP]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Scanning Technique

US can effectively evaluate the MCNF from its origin to the distal branches, providing valuable information for patients with neuropathic pain on the medial aspect of the distal arm and forearm (Figures 2 and 3). The patient should be seated in front of the examiner with the arm extended on the bench. The MCNF can be easily identified in the middle third of the arm, where it lies in close proximity to the basilic vein, and can then be traced proximally along the medial aspect of the arm. In the axilla, the nerve initially lies superficially to the axillary artery and the main nerve trunks of the upper extremities before moving deeper, where it typically joins the ulnar nerve and the MCNA to form the medial cord in the retropectoralis minor space.

In the distal third of the arm, the distal branches of the MCNF can be indentified and traced along the dorsal and ventral aspects of the proximal forearm, particularly when using probes with a frequency of 20 MHz or higher. For patients experiencing a snapping sensation at the medial aspect of the elbow, the examination should not be limited to evaluating the structures within the cubital tunnel. Instead, it should also include a dynamic assessment of the posterior branches of the MCNF during active elbow flexion and extension to determine if they contribute to the snapping, alongside the ulnar nerve and the medial head of the triceps.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common reason for referral to neurology. Chronic acquired demyelinating neuropathies are an important and varied group with overlapping presentations, and may have an immune-mediated cause. Their correct diagnosis is important as they respond to different treatments; timely intervention can prevent irreversible axonal degeneration. We present a case that highlights the approach to an adult presenting with a chronic demyelinating neuropathy.

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Neurosensory component of hand-arm vibration syndrome: a 22-year follow-up study [^1134hu6j]. Occupational Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

What is already known:
Knowledge about the long-term course of the neurological component of hand–arm vibration syndrome is scarce.
A few follow-up studies have suggested a tendency towards chronic hand numbness and a degree of improvement in hand pain.
To our knowledge, no prior study has investigated possible prognostic factors, such as comorbidity and lifestyle factors.

What this study adds:
This 22-year follow-up study of workers with hand–arm vibration syndrome indicates a tendency towards irreversibility in hand numbness and finger pain.
The workers showed a normal age-related decline in Pegboard score over 22 years of follow-up. A diagnosis of hand–arm vibration syndrome in 1994 was not associated with poor hand strength 22 years later.
Our study showed no effect of lifestyle factors or comorbidity on the long-term course of neurosensory symptoms in workers with hand–arm vibration syndrome.

What impact this may have on practice:
Our findings highlight the importance of hand–arm vibration syndrome prevention.
Continued exposure to vibration seems to predict increased finger pain and therefore warrants exposure reduction.
Numbness occurs with a shorter latency than white finger which and health professionals who follow up of vibration-exposed workers should be mindful of this.

### Atypical presentation of C-7 radiculopathy [^117BUfcg]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

The authors retrospectively reviewed the presenting symptomatology and 6-month outcome in 241 consecutive patients who underwent C6–7 anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) from an overall series of 1008 patients in whom the senior author performed one-level procedures.

Methods

In 28 (12%) of the 241 patients, the sole complaint was subscapular pain on the side ipsilateral to nerve root compression. In 11 patients (5%), the primary complaint was unilateral deep breast or chest pain. No patient experienced any of the traditional radicular signs involving C-7 such as numbness of the second or third digits, pain in the triceps, and/or atrophy or weakness of the triceps or pronator muscles. Of the 28 patients presenting with subscapular pain 238 (93%) of 241 experienced complete symptom relief within 6 months, and of the 11 who presented with chest pain complete relief or relief to the point of requiring nonnarcotic analgesic agents occurred in nine cases.

Conclusions

Approximately 15% of patients with a C-7 radiculopathy are likely to present with atypical symptoms that, if persisting after nonsurgical therapy, will often resolve after ACD and fusion.

### MR imaging of peripheral nervous system involvement: parsonage-Turner syndrome [^112Txs7M]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old woman complained of right scapular pain, like burning, radiating down his right arm and numbness in the first three fingers of the hand. Neurologic examination showed a slight deficit of the right brachial triceps muscle. Neurophysiological assessment showed a mild involvement of the seventh right spinal root (C7). Conventional MR imaging of the cervical spine showed mild disc protrusion at level C5-C6 without spinal root compression. High resolution MR neurography with multiplanar reconstruction along the course of the right brachial plexus showed a mild increase in signal intensity and thickening of the C7 root, middle trunk and posterior cord, consistent with Parsonage-Turner Syndrome. STIR images showed increased signal intensity in the right infraspinatus muscle innervated by the suprascapular nerve. In our case, sensitivity and specificity of the new MR sequences are higher than the clinical and neurophysiological evaluations.

Technological advancements in ultrasound systems, particularly the development of high‐ and ultra‐high‐frequency transducers, now allow for the detailed evaluation of sub‐millimetric sensory nerves in the upper limb, extending to their distal branches. This provides invaluable insights in patients with suspected neuropathies. This review aims to outline the scanning techniques and normal ultrasound appearance of cutaneous nerves of the upper limbs, including the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm, medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm, lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, and posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Furthermore, several cases of nerve pathologies where ultrasound has played a crucial role in accurate diagnosis and therapeutic management are presented.

Abstract

Background

Knowledge about the long-term course of the neurologic component of hand–arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) is scarce.

Aims

To study the course and prognostic factors of the neurosensory component of HAVS over a period of 22 years.

Methods

Forty male sheet metal workers, with a mean age of 60 (range 45–78) years at follow-up, were examined with a test battery in 1994 and 2017. At baseline, the sample comprised 27 workers with HAVS symptoms and 13 workers without HAVS symptoms. Among the 27 workers, 25 workers reported work-related hand–arm vibration during follow-up (mean 3639 h). In 2017, the mean time since vibration stopped was 8.4 years.

Results

Among the 27 workers with HAVS in 1994, no overall statistically significant change was observed in hand numbness (Stockholm Workshop Scale), shoulder/arm pain (pain scale) or finger pain from 1994 to 2017. However, vibration exposure during follow-up was associated with increased finger pain. Cotinine, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, glycosylated haemoglobin and folate were not associated with changes in neurosensory symptoms or manual dexterity (Grooved Pegboard) from 1994 to 2017. A diagnosis of HAVS in 1994 did not predict poor hand strength 22 years later. Isolated hand numbness (without white finger attacks) was more common at baseline than at follow-up.

Conclusions

This 22-year follow-up study indicates a tendency towards irreversibility of hand numbness and finger pain in workers with HAVS. Continued vibration exposure seems to predict increased finger pain. Our findings highlight the importance of HAVS prevention.
