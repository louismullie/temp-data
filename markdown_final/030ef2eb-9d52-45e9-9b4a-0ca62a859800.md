## Question

For an 11-year-old with a questionable focal seizure, should the MRI be ordered with contrast or without?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an 11-year-old with a questionable focal seizure should have a brain MRI with or without gadolinium contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether MRI is indicated at all in a child with a possibly focal seizure. Then, I should quantify how often gadolinium adds diagnostic value on an initial seizure MRI. Next, I need to check which clinical scenarios genuinely require contrast and which do not. After that, I should weigh benefits versus risks of gadolinium in this age group. Then, I will review recent pediatric decision rules that stratify risk and the likelihood of emergent pathology. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic algorithm and specify a non-contrast epilepsy MRI protocol with clear triggers for adding contrast, documenting any caveats and self-corrections as I go.

> Let me first confirm the indication for MRI in this setting, because I need to ensure we are justified before debating contrast use. Focal or possibly focal semiology in children raises the pretest probability of a structural lesion detectable by MRI, and major guidelines consider MRI appropriate in children with focal seizures or epilepsy of unknown etiology, especially outside a clearly benign generalized syndrome [^117WZsVD] [^111rjrM1]. I should double-check yield data in pediatrics, and indeed a large prospective series of 1,000 children with new-onset unprovoked seizures found an epileptogenic lesion in 26%, with cortical malformations the most common class, supporting the utility of MRI in this scenario [^114eorT6]. Hold on, I also need to consider modality choice acutely, and although CT can be used for emergent hemorrhage or trauma, MRI is preferred for subtle malformations, hippocampal pathology, and posterior fossa assessment while avoiding ionizing radiation in children, which strengthens the case for MRI as the first advanced study when time and stability permit [^1111eQZ7] [^115nPzc8].

> Next, I should review how MRI protocolization affects detection because I need to ensure the study is optimized for epilepsy. Dedicated epilepsy MRI with high-resolution 3D T1, tailored FLAIR, coronal hippocampal coverage, diffusion, and susceptibility sequences improves sensitivity for focal cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, and other subtle lesions in pediatric epilepsy compared with generic brain MRI, and 3T platforms further enhance lesion conspicuity when available [^112WrNVX] [^112bw482] [^115nPzc8]. Wait, let me verify the emergency context again, since peri-ictal timing can confound imaging, and yes, even if CT is normal in the ED, an outpatient epilepsy-protocol MRI remains indicated to identify underlying structural causes that might not be apparent on CT [^1111eQZ7].

> I will now examine the added value of gadolinium at the initial seizure evaluation, because the crux is whether contrast meaningfully changes diagnosis. A large pediatric cohort of 1,884 new-onset seizure patients showed 46% received gadolinium in practice, but only 5% of those contrast-enhanced studies were later judged to have needed contrast, and only 31% of that 5% specifically required it for diagnosis, translating to roughly 1.5% net benefit from contrast across all-comers, which is strikingly low in the unselected initial evaluation [^113fZtHP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because that estimate is retrospective and single-system, but even with that caveat, it suggests routine contrast adds little in the absence of targeted clinical concern on the first MRI in children with new-onset seizures [^113fZtHP].

> Let me consider when contrast actually matters, because I need to delineate scenarios where it changes management. Gadolinium is valuable when we suspect processes characterized by blood–brain barrier disruption or abnormal vascularity such as primary brain tumors and their mimics, intracranial infection or abscess, leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory or vasculitic conditions, and certain vascular malformations where contrast or adjunct MRA/VWI contribute to characterization and surgical or medical planning [^111rjrM1] [^1168Si9b]. Conversely, many common pediatric epileptogenic substrates including focal cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, remote ischemic injury, and malformations of cortical development are detected and characterized on optimized non-contrast structural sequences, so contrast is not routinely required at the outset to see them, although it may be added selectively for further characterization when a lesion is found [^112bw482] [^112WrNVX] [^117S8by9].

> Now, a risk–benefit pause is needed for an 11-year-old, and I should be precise here. Initially, I thought about contrast-induced encephalopathy with an estimated incidence around 0.1–0.5% and noted it has been reported in children, but wait, I should verify the agent context because CIE classically refers to iodinated contrast used in angiography rather than gadolinium for MRI, so that initial framing was misleading for GBCA risk and I need to correct it to avoid conflation [^1168uTnB] [^116RjraZ] [^117QKfDR] [^1118x38x]. For gadolinium-based contrast, relevant considerations in pediatrics include rare hypersensitivity reactions, the need for IV access with associated distress, regulatory labeling that emphasizes its use to detect areas of disrupted blood–brain barrier or abnormal vascularity, and evolving recognition of tissue retention, though the clinical significance of retained trace gadolinium in the brain remains uncertain, which nudges us toward selective rather than routine use in low-yield scenarios [^1168Si9b]. I should also factor in scan time and cost, as adding contrast lengthens the exam and resources without clear diagnostic gain in most initial pediatric seizure MRIs, reinforcing a conservative initial stance when pretest probability is low [^113fZtHP].

> Next, I should review risk stratification data to anchor the pretest probability for emergent pathology in this clinical vignette. A recent pediatric ED cohort identified that multiple seizures at presentation, prolonged seizure duration of at least 5 minutes, and developmental delay significantly increased the odds of an epileptogenic lesion, with classification based on any of these risk factors yielding 94% sensitivity for any lesion and 100% sensitivity for emergent MRI findings, whereas children without these risk factors had only 6.3% lesions and 0% emergent findings, which is highly informative for triage [^114UMB7q]. Let me reconsider the case description, and a "questionable" focal seizure in a neurologically normal, systemically well 11-year-old typically implies lower severity and likely absence of red flags, placing the child in a low-risk group for emergent contrast-requiring pathology at first pass, which argues against routine gadolinium upfront [^114UMB7q].

> But wait, what about peri-ictal imaging confounders that could prompt unnecessary contrast or misinterpretation. Seizures can produce transient MRI abnormalities including cortical and subcortical T2/FLAIR changes, restricted diffusion, and even occasional leptomeningeal enhancement that resolve over weeks, and splenial lesions can also be benign and transient, so I should caution that early postictal imaging may show effects of the seizure rather than the structural cause, and careful follow-up can prevent overcalling and unwarranted interventions [^113ACCgS] [^114K3anc] [^115iTpa2]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not preclude imaging, and it does not; it simply means we interpret early findings with clinical correlation and may withhold contrast unless there is a targeted suspicion that truly needs it now, reserving enhancement for problem-solving when non-contrast sequences show an indeterminate lesion or clinical red flags emerge [^113ACCgS] [^114K3anc].

> I will now specify the default non-contrast epilepsy MRI protocol, because I need to ensure the ordered study is technically appropriate. A high-quality pediatric epilepsy protocol should include 3D T1-weighted volumetric imaging with 1 mm isotropic voxels, axial and coronal FLAIR with coronal oblique coverage of the hippocampi, axial and coronal high-resolution T2 to evaluate cortical morphology, diffusion-weighted imaging with ADC maps, and susceptibility-weighted imaging to assess for blood products or calcifications, preferably on a 3T scanner to optimize detection of subtle cortical and hippocampal changes [^115nPzc8] [^112WrNVX]. Let me double-check institutional variation, and while protocols vary across centers, these core sequences are consistent elements of pediatric epilepsy MRI and form the backbone of an optimized non-contrast first study for new-onset focal seizure evaluation in children [^117S8by9] [^111uYsaR].

> Next, I should define clear, selective triggers to add gadolinium so we are explicit about when contrast is warranted. Add contrast if the non-contrast MRI reveals an abnormality that needs lesion characterization such as differentiating tumor from dysplasia, if there is strong clinical suspicion for neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory disease based on persistent focal neurologic deficits, signs of raised intracranial pressure, fever or immunocompromise, or rapidly progressive symptoms, if there is a history of known malignancy or immunosuppression, or when presurgical planning requires delineation of lesion-to-cortex borders after a target has been identified, consistent with how GBCA is labeled for detecting areas of disrupted blood–brain barrier or abnormal vascularity [^111rjrM1] [^1168Si9b]. Hold on, I should verify that this selective approach aligns with the low added value observed at initial presentation, and yes, it reserves gadolinium for the small subset in whom enhancement likely changes diagnosis or immediate management based on clinical and non-contrast imaging cues [^113fZtHP].

> Synthesis for this 11-year-old with a questionable focal seizure and no red flags now becomes straightforward, but I should still state it cautiously. Order an epilepsy-protocol brain MRI without gadolinium as the initial study, because it maximizes detection of the common pediatric epileptogenic substrates while avoiding the low-yield, added time, and potential risks of routine gadolinium at first pass, and this approach is consistent with pediatric imaging principles, ACR pediatric seizure imaging appropriateness, and observational data showing minimal incremental diagnostic benefit from contrast in unselected initial pediatric seizure MRIs [^115nPzc8] [^117WZsVD] [^113fZtHP]. If the non-contrast MRI is non-diagnostic but clinical suspicion for tumor, infection, or inflammation remains high, or if new red flags appear, then add contrast in a focused follow-up exam after neurology review, documenting the rationale for escalation and the specific clinical question that enhancement is intended to answer [^111rjrM1] [^1168Si9b].

> Finally, let me document the decision pathway and anticipated next steps so the reasoning is transparent. I would record: "Non-contrast epilepsy-protocol MRI ordered per pediatric imaging recommendations and ACR criteria for focal seizure, given absence of red flags and evidence that routine gadolinium at initial presentation has low diagnostic yield in children; contrast reserved for selective scenarios including lesion characterization or strong clinical suspicion of neoplastic, infectious, or inflammatory processes" and then re-evaluate for contrast addition only if non-contrast findings or clinical changes indicate it, which keeps care aligned with evidence and safety for this age group [^117WZsVD] [^113fZtHP] [^111rjrM1] [^1168Si9b].

> In summary, hold on while I recap to ensure internal consistency. MRI is indicated in a child with a questionable focal seizure, but start with a high-quality non-contrast epilepsy protocol on a 3T scanner, reserve gadolinium for selective indications anchored in clinical red flags or specific non-contrast abnormalities, and remember that peri-ictal changes can mimic pathology and may resolve, so interpretation and contrast use should be judicious and context-driven in this low-risk presentation [^114eorT6] [^114UMB7q] [^113ACCgS] [^113fZtHP].

For an 11-year-old with questionable focal seizure, **start with a non-contrast MRI** as the initial study [^117WZsVD]. Contrast is reserved for **specific indications** such as suspected tumor, infection, vascular malformation, or prior abnormal MRI findings [^1168Si9b] [^113fZtHP]. A non-contrast epilepsy protocol (3D T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, SWI) is usually sufficient to detect the most common epileptogenic lesions in children [^114eorT6]. If the initial MRI is abnormal or clinical suspicion remains high, **contrast can be added later** [^111rjrM1].

---

## Indications for MRI in pediatric focal seizures

MRI is indicated in pediatric focal seizures to **identify structural abnormalities** that may underlie seizure activity [^115nPzc8]. Common epileptogenic lesions in children include:

- **Malformations of cortical development (MCD)**: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), polymicrogyria, heterotopia [^114eorT6].

- **Hippocampal sclerosis**: Less common in children than adults, but still relevant [^112bw482] [^112WrNVX].

- **Tumors**: Low-grade gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) [^112bw482] [^111rjrM1].

- **Vascular malformations**: Cavernous malformations, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) [^112bw482] [^1111eQZ7].

- **Infections or inflammatory lesions**: Encephalitis, abscesses [^112bw482] [^111hYg3Y].

---

## Role of contrast in pediatric MRI for focal seizures

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) enhance visualization of lesions with a disrupted blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity [^1168Si9b]. However, contrast administration carries potential risks, including allergic reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal impairment, and gadolinium deposition in brain tissues [^1168Si9b]. Accordingly, contrast use should be carefully considered and **reserved for specific clinical indications** [^11169Nnk].

---

## Current guidelines and expert recommendations

The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for pediatric seizures recommend **initial MRI without contrast** for children presenting with new-onset focal seizures [^117WZsVD]. Contrast-enhanced MRI is reserved for specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Suspected neoplasm**: Based on clinical presentation or prior imaging findings [^117WZsVD].

- **Suspected infection or inflammation**: Clinical suspicion of encephalitis, abscess, or autoimmune encephalitis [^111hYg3Y].

- **Suspected vascular malformation**: Clinical or imaging suspicion of AVM or other vascular anomalies [^1111eQZ7].

- **Abnormal initial MRI**: When initial non-contrast MRI reveals abnormalities requiring further characterization [^113fZtHP].

---

## Diagnostic yield of non-contrast MRI

Non-contrast MRI with dedicated epilepsy protocols (including 3D T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI, and SWI sequences) is **highly effective** in detecting most common epileptogenic lesions in children [^111rjrM1]. Studies have demonstrated that non-contrast MRI identifies epileptogenic lesions in approximately 26% of children with new-onset seizures, with malformations of cortical development being the most common lesion detected [^114eorT6].

---

## Diagnostic yield of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI provides additional diagnostic information primarily when neoplasm, infection, inflammation, or vascular malformation is suspected [^1168Si9b]. In a recent study evaluating gadolinium-based contrast in pediatric seizures, **only 5% of cases** retrospectively required contrast — mostly for suspected tumors, infections, or vascular malformations [^113fZtHP] — whereas in the remaining 95%, contrast did not add clinically significant information beyond non-contrast MRI.

---

## Risks and considerations associated with contrast administration

While gadolinium-based contrast agents are **generally safe**, potential risks include [^1168Si9b]:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible.

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)**: Rare, primarily in patients with severe renal impairment.

- **Gadolinium deposition**: Recent studies have shown gadolinium deposition in brain tissues, although clinical significance remains unclear.

Given these potential risks, contrast administration should be **reserved for cases where clear clinical indications exist** [^115nPzc8].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI **should be considered** in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for contrast** |
|-|-|
| Suspected neoplasm | Clinical suspicion or abnormal initial MRI [^117WZsVD] |
| Suspected infection or inflammation | - Clinical suspicion of encephalitis <br/> - Clinical suspicion of abscess <br/> - Clinical suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis [^111hYg3Y] |
| Suspected vascular malformation | Clinical or imaging suspicion of AVM or other vascular anomalies [^1111eQZ7] |
| Abnormal initial MRI | Further characterization of identified lesions [^11169Nnk] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For an 11-year-old with questionable focal seizures, **the initial MRI should be performed without contrast** [^117WZsVD]. Non-contrast MRI with a dedicated epilepsy protocol is highly effective for detecting the most common epileptogenic lesions in children [^114eorT6]. Contrast-enhanced MRI should be reserved for specific clinical indications — such as suspected neoplasm, infection, inflammation, vascular malformation, or abnormalities on the initial non-contrast MRI that require further characterization.

The frequency and utility of gadolinium in the evaluation of acute pediatric seizure presentation are not well known. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR imaging performed for the evaluation of acute pediatric seizure presentation.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified consecutive pediatric patients with new-onset seizures from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2021, who presented to the emergency department and/or were admitted to the inpatient unit and had an MR imaging of the brain for the evaluation of seizures. The clinical and imaging data were recorded, including the patient's age and sex, the use of IV gadolinium, and the underlying cause of epilepsy when available.

- **Results**: A total of 1884 patients were identified for inclusion. Five hundred twenty-four (28%) patients had potential epileptogenic findings on brain MR imaging, while 1153 (61%) patients had studies with normal findings and 207 (11%) patients had nonspecific signal changes. Epileptogenic findings were subclassified as follows: neurodevelopmental lesions, 142 (27%); intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or germinal matrix), 89 (17%); ischemic/hypoxic, 62 (12%); hippocampal sclerosis, 44 (8%); neoplastic, 38 (7%); immune/infectious, 20 (4%); phakomatoses, 19 (4%); vascular anomalies, 17 (3%); metabolic, 3 (< 1%); and other, 90 (17%). Eight hundred seventy-four (46%) patients received IV gadolinium. Of those, only 48 (5%) cases were retrospectively deemed to have necessitated the use of IV gadolinium. Fifteen of 48 (31%) cases required it specifically.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® seizures-child [^117WZsVD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

In children, seizures represent an extremely heterogeneous group of medical conditions, ranging from benign cases such as a simple febrile seizure, to life-threatening situations like status epilepticus. The underlying causes of seizures also encompass a wide range of pathologies, from idiopathic cases, usually genetic, to a variety of acute and chronic intracranial or systemic abnormalities. This document discusses the appropriate utilization of neuroimaging tests in a child with seizures.

- **Clinical scenarios**: This document takes into consideration different circumstances at the time of a child's presentation, including the patient's age, any precipitating events, and clinical and electroencephalogram findings. It includes scenarios such as neonatal seizures, simple and complex febrile seizures, post-traumatic seizures, focal seizures, primary generalized seizures in a neurologically normal child, and generalized seizures in a neurologically abnormal child.

- **Guidance for clinicians**: This practical approach aims to guide clinicians in clinical decision-making and to help identify efficient and appropriate imaging workups.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions. These guidelines are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Their development and revision involve an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness.

### The Australian diagnostic criteria for contrast-induced encephalopathy [^1168uTnB]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a recognized complication of contrast administration; however, diagnosis remains challenging due to its symptom overlap with other neurological conditions and the absence of formal diagnostic criteria.

- **Methods**: A modified Delphi study was performed. Consultant physicians with active clinical experience with CIE patients were invited from neurovascular centers in Australia. Initial diagnostic items were derived from an extensive literature review and analysis of local institutional cases across Australia. Three Delphi rounds were conducted, with consensus defined as ≥ 75% agreement.

- **Results**: Seventeen neurovascular specialists from nine neurovascular centers participated (81.0% response rate) between May 2024 and July 2024. In round 1, 15 diagnostic items were presented to participants, which were revised and one additional criterion suggested. In round 2, 14 out of 16 diagnostic items achieved consensus. In round 3, all 14 items achieved consensus. Ultimately, a 14-item diagnostic criteria was developed based on participant consensus. The absolute criteria exclude CIE if symptom onset is more than 24 hours after contrast administration, or if symptoms can be explained by vessel occlusion/territory ischemia, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, metabolic derangement, intracranial malignancy, or head trauma. The supporting criteria indicate that CIE is more probable if symptoms are reversible, correspond with the distribution of contrast administration, or are associated with reversible contrast staining, cerebral edema, or cortical/s.

### New-onset afebrile seizures in infants: Role of neuroimaging [^1132Mz3X]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate the presenting characteristics of new-onset afebrile seizures in infants (ages 1–24 months) and the yield of neuroimaging, prospective data were obtained from a standardized evaluation and management plan mandated by a critical care pathway. A total of 317 infants presented with new-onset afebrile seizures between 2001 and 2007. EEG was performed on 90.3% of patients, head CT was obtained on 94%, and MRI was obtained on 57.4%.

Half of the infants exhibited partial features in their seizures, with evidence for primary generalized seizures being rare. The majority had more than one seizure upon presentation. Seizures in this age group tended to be brief, with 44% lasting less than one minute. EEG abnormalities were found in half of the cases. One-third of CTs were abnormal, with 9% of all CTs requiring acute medical management. Over half of MRIs were abnormal, with cerebral dysgenesis being the most common abnormality (p < 0.05). One-third of normal CTs had a subsequent abnormal MRI, with only one case resulting in altered medical management.

Infantile seizures are usually brief but commonly recurrent; therefore, strong consideration should be given for inpatient observation. Acute imaging with CT can alter management in a small but important number of infants. Due to the superior yield, strong consideration for MRI should be given for all infants, as primary generalized seizures are rare and there is a high rate of cerebral dysgenesis.

### Cerebral abscess presenting as a complex febrile seizure [^112UTkP1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no standardized approach to the management of complex febrile seizures in children, and there are no published practice guidelines for the procurement of neuroimaging. Presented is a 2-year-old female patient who experienced a 3- to 5-minute episode of staring and unilateral mouth twitching associated with high fever. On initial presentation, the patient appeared well and had a normal neurological examination. No focus of infection was identified, and she was diagnosed with a complex febrile seizure. The patient was discharged home with close neurology and primary care follow-up but returned the following day with altered mental status, toxic appearance, and right lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed left-sided cranial empyema, and the patient was managed with antibiotics and surgical drainage.

A literature review to answer the question "Do children with complex febrile seizures require emergent neuroimaging?" yielded a small number of retrospective reviews describing the utility of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture in the work-up of febrile seizures. Evidence indicates that neuroimaging is not indicated in an otherwise healthy child who presents with a complex febrile seizure if the patient is well-appearing and has no evidence of focal neurological deficit on examination. As this case demonstrates, however, serious conditions such as meningitis and brain abscess (though rare) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex febrile seizure, and physicians should remain vigilant.

### Neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with a simple febrile seizure [^1115Aha8]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

To formulate evidence-based recommendations for health care professionals regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of a simple febrile seizure in infants and young children aged 6 through 60 months, and to revise the practice guideline published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 1996, the following review was conducted.

Physicians with expertise in neurology, epilepsy, pediatrics, epidemiology, and research methodologies formed a subcommittee of the AAP Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management. This subcommittee, alongside other groups within the AAP and external organizations, reviewed the guideline. The member who had reviewed the literature for the 1996 AAP practice guidelines searched for articles published up to 2009, supplemented with articles from other committee members. Results were provided to subcommittee members for review. Interventions of direct interest included lumbar puncture, electroencephalography, blood studies, and neuroimaging. Issues were discussed until a consensus on recommendations was reached. The strength of evidence and recommendations were assessed by the committee's most experienced member in informatics and epidemiology, graded according to AAP policy.

### The Australian diagnostic criteria for contrast-induced encephalopathy [^116RjraZ]. Neuroradiology (2025). Low credibility.

Despite increasing reports of contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) in the literature and in clinical practice, standardized protocols for diagnosis are lacking. Using a modified Delphi study with Australian neurovascular clinicians, we developed a diagnostic criterion to provide a uniform framework for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency in clinical practice.

CIE is challenging to diagnose due to its symptom overlap with other neurological conditions. The proposed criteria emphasize the need to differentiate CIE from other potentially significant and time-urgent pathologies. The absolute criteria are stringent; CIE is excluded if symptoms appear more than 24 hours after contrast administration as delayed onset is not considered clinically consistent, in the opinion of the authors. CIE is also excluded if symptoms can be clearly attributed to other neurological pathologies, including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, biochemical derangement (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyponatremia), malignancy, and head trauma. These exclusions prevent incorrect CIE diagnosis in conditions that require prompt treatment.

The supporting criteria focus on both the clinical and radiological aspects of CIE. Contrast staining and cerebral edema, as well as MR signal change, represent the most common radiological findings of CIE. MR signal change has been observed across several sequences and anatomical locations but appears to most commonly be described as fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in cortical and subcortical regions. It must also be noted that a large proportion of patients do have normal neurological examinations, further complicating the diagnostic process.

Pediatric functional MRI has been used for the last two decades and is now gaining wide acceptance in the preoperative workup of children with brain tumors and medically refractory epilepsy. This review covers pediatric-specific difficulties, such as sedation and task paradigm selection according to the child's age and cognitive level. We illustrate the increasing uses of functional MRI in the depiction of cognitive function, neuropsychiatric disorders, and response to pharmacological agents. Finally, we review the uses of resting-state fMRI in the evaluation of children and in the detection of epileptogenic regions.

### Evaluation of epilepsy lesion visualisation enhancement in low-field MRI using image quality transfer: A preliminary investigation of clinical potential for applications in developing countries [^114PmaUj]. Neuroradiology (2024). High credibility.

The approach based on healthy data is more likely to work better on subtle lesions, such as focal cortical dysplasia, where there is a greater need for IQT enhancement, and worse on more evident lesions, which benefit little from IQT enhancement as suggested by studies comparing lesion detection scores at 1.5T and 3T. In the study on a limited dataset, we considered any type of epileptogenic lesion, including ischemic infarction, hypoglycaemia, and post-traumatic scarring. Many of these lesions may be evident at any field strength, which may not have allowed us to fully appreciate the IQT enhancement of subtle lesions. In a future study with a larger population, we aim to perform a focused analysis on focal cortical dysplasia. We also aim to assess the accuracy in lesion detection by comparing the number of detected lesions in LF and IQT images with the ground truth HF, which is probably more clinically relevant in LMICs than evaluating lesion definition and extension.

### Clinical reasoning: A 29-year-old woman presenting with seizures and an atypical frontal lesion [^114UZfuQ]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Intracranial pseudotumoral lesions pose a considerable diagnostic challenge, arising from various etiologies, with multiple sclerosis being one such etiology. While characteristic radiologic features often enable differentiation from neoplastic processes, in certain instances, pseudotumoral lesions can present similarly to highly malignant tumors, complicating the diagnostic process.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^115B8SMY]. Neuroradiology (2022). High credibility.

Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A major predictive factor for a good surgical outcome is the visualization and delineation of a potential epileptogenic lesion by MRI. However, these lesions are often subtle and may escape detection by conventional MRI (≤ 3 T).

We present the EpiUltraStudy protocol to address the hypothesis that the application of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI increases the rate of detection of structural lesions and functional brain aberrations in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Additionally, therapeutic gain will be assessed by testing whether increased lesion detection and tailored resections result in higher rates of seizure freedom one year after epilepsy surgery. Sixty patients will enroll in the study according to the following inclusion criteria: aged ≥ 12 years, diagnosed with drug-resistant focal epilepsy with a suspected epileptogenic focus, and negative conventional 3 T MRI during pre-surgical work-up.

All patients will be evaluated by 7 T MRI; ten patients will undergo an additional 9.4 T MRI exam. Images will be evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists and a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Clinical and UHF MRI findings will be discussed in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery conference. Demographic and epilepsy characteristics, along with postoperative seizure outcomes and histopathological evaluations, will be recorded.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^111S31fh]. Neuroradiology (2022). High credibility.

About 30–40% of patients with epilepsy are drug-resistant, with higher rates for children. Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option for 10–50% of drug-resistant patients, depending on the underlying etiology. One of the major predictive factors for a good surgical outcome, i.e. seizure freedom, is the detection of a potential epileptogenic lesion or zone on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Approximately 30% of adult and pediatric patients with focal epilepsy have no identifiable, potential epileptogenic lesion on MRI, termed "MRI-negative". Consequently, a considerable number of MRI-negative drug-resistant patients are not eligible for resective surgery, leading to a continuation of disease burden and a lower quality of life.

Recent developments in the field of non-invasive preoperative examinations, such as high-density electroencephalography (EEG), EEG-functional MRI (fMRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and ultra-high field (UHF) MRI, have improved the localization of the epileptogenic zone, leading to surgical treatment in patients who were previously not considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. The detection rate of potential epileptogenic lesions on MRI is strongly dependent on technical factors such as magnetic field strength (in tesla, T), use of phased array head coils, and image (post)processing and analyses. Currently, the clinical state-of-the-art imaging for lesion detection in epilepsy includes a 3-T MRI dedicated epilepsy protocol.

### Magnetic resonance imaging protocols for paediatric neuroradiology [^117S8by9]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Increasingly, radiologists are encouraged to have protocols for all imaging studies and to include imaging guidelines in care pathways set up by the referring clinicians. This is particularly advantageous in MRI where magnet time is limited, and a radiologist's review of each patient's images often results in additional sequences and longer scanning times without the advantage of improvement in diagnostic ability. The difficulties of imaging small children and the challenges presented to the radiologist as the brain develops are discussed. We present our protocols for imaging the brain and spine of children based on 20 years of experience in paediatric neurological MRI. The protocols are adapted to suit children under the age of 2 years, small body parts, and paediatric clinical scenarios.

### Inpatient brain MRI for new-onset seizures: Utility and cost effectiveness [^115G8NeG]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Inpatient magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of new-onset afebrile seizures can extend the hospital stay, increase costs, and may not affect acute management. The study aimed to assess the cost and impact on acute management of inpatient brain magnetic resonance imaging performed as part of new-onset seizure evaluations. A retrospective chart review of brain magnetic resonance imaging on pediatric inpatients admitted for new-onset afebrile seizures was conducted. Seventy-five patients were identified, with seventy-one (95%) staying an additional day for the magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen patients had abnormal results; however, no patient had treatment changes based on the magnetic resonance imaging results. If these magnetic resonance imaging procedures had been performed as an outpatient service, the potential savings to the hospital could have been $215,575. Thus, obtaining an inpatient brain magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of new-onset seizures did not lead to acute changes in management and added to facility costs and length of stay. Scheduling magnetic resonance imaging as an outpatient procedure could achieve cost savings without compromising care.

### Displaced gag diagnosed on MRI [^114tSkX1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old male with cerebral palsy was transferred from another hospital to the neuro-intensive care unit for a second opinion concerning seizures. Intubation had been carried out prior to the transfer. He was subsequently diagnosed with severe myoclonic activity causing secondary respiratory distress.

He was extubated 5 days after admission but re-intubated 2 days later due to reappearance of myoclonus and respiratory distress. During subsequent wake-up calls, he appeared agitated, and a mouth gag was inserted to prevent airway obstruction, preventing extubation.

Three days after re-intubation, an MRI of the cerebrum was performed, and as a coincidental finding, a foreign body with the shape of a mouth gag was revealed in the upper airway (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

- **Figure 1**: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing the displaced gag (arrow).
- **Figure 2**: Extracted gag.
- **Figure 3**: Cross-sectional view of magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating the gag (arrow).
- **Figure 4**: Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating the gag in the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx.
- **Figure 5**: Magnetic resonance imaging providing a view of the gag located in the pharynx.

The gag was uneventfully retracted with Magill forceps. The following day, the patient was successfully extubated.

A displaced — but not missed — mouth gag is potentially life-threatening. The use of any medical device should be approached cautiously. Just as instrument counts are a part of WHO's Surgical Safety Checklist, a similar approach concerning the use of medical devices in the intensive care setting could be useful to avoid patient harm.

### European recommendations on practices in pediatric neuroradiology: Consensus document from the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR), European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) and European Union of Medical Specialists Division of Neuroradiology (UEMS) [^115BUnzE]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

A wide spectrum of imaging techniques is available for pediatric neuroradiology studies, including ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conventional radiography, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The choice of the optimal imaging technique depends on several factors, such as age, degree of cooperation, clinical conditions, indications, and available facilities.

Radiation protection comprises the principles of justification and optimization. Justification means a radiologic study should be performed only when the required relevant information cannot be obtained from existing charts or studies and should result in a net benefit to the patient. Optimization ensures the lowest possible radiation dose to obtain the relevant information should be administered. Since safety issues and radioprotection concerns are of the utmost importance in children, the choice of the imaging technique should, whenever feasible, favor modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (such as US and MRI) over those that do (such as radiographs and CT). Whenever ionizing radiation is used, the ALARA principle ("as low as reasonably achievable") should always be applied.

In fetuses, newborns, and infants, and until the fontanelles are closed, US of the brain coupled with color Doppler is the first-line imaging modality (except for trauma), followed by MRI when necessary. For trauma, CT is the method of choice. For the neonatal spinal canal, US is also the first-line examination, offering not only morphological information but also real-time analysis.

### Rapid brain MRI protocols reduce head computerized tomography use in the pediatric emergency department [^115fVjj3]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols may be effective in the emergency department (ED) to evaluate nontraumatic neurologic complaints. We evaluate neuroimaging — rapid MRI (rMRI), head computerized tomography (HCT), and full MRI — use following widespread implementation of rMRI protocols in a pediatric emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care pediatric ED of encounters with neuroimaging during two 9-month periods: one prior to (control period) and one after generalized availability of four rMRI protocols (rMRI period). The primary outcome was differences in neuroimaging rates between the two periods. Secondary outcomes included ED process measures, unsuccessful imaging, and undetected pathology, with full MRI within 14 days as the reference standard.

- **Results**: There were 1052 encounters with neuroimaging during the control and 1308 during the rMRI periods. Differences in neuroimaging between periods were 27.7% for rMRI (95% CI, 24.4, 31.0), −21.5% for HCT (95% CI, −25.5, −17.5), and −6.2% for full MRI (95% CI, −9.3, −3.1). Time to imaging (182 [IQR 138–255] versus 86 [IQR 52–137] minutes) as well as ED length of stay (396 [IQR 304–484] versus 257 [IQR 196–334] minutes) was longer for rMRI versus HCT (p < 0.01). Between the control and rMRI periods, there were differences in types of neuroimaging performed for patients with altered mental status, headache, seizure, shunt dysfunction, stroke, syncope, trauma, vomiting, infection, and other neurologic complaints (p < 0.05).

### ESR essentials: Image evaluation of patients with seizures and epilepsy-practice recommendations by the European Society of Neuroradiology [^111rjrM1]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Epilepsy, a neurological disorder characterized by seizures, poses significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and management. Understanding the underlying causes and identifying precise anatomical locations of epileptogenic foci are critical for effective management strategies, particularly in drug-resistant patients. Neuroimaging techniques, particularly magnetic resonance (MR), play a pivotal role in the evaluation of epilepsy patients, offering insights into structural abnormalities, epileptogenic lesions, and functional alterations within the brain.

Diverse clinical scenarios that warrant neuroimaging in epilepsy patients, ranging from first-onset seizures to drug-resistant epilepsy, will be presented, elucidating the considerations and recommendations for imaging modalities. The dedicated MR protocol for epilepsy patients will be discussed, justifying the rationale behind sequence selection and optimization strategies, and providing clues about how to read these magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams. Finally, MR findings associated with common epileptogenic lesions, such as hippocampal sclerosis, focal cortical dysplasia, and long-term epilepsy-associated tumors, will be described.

This article reviews essential concepts, including definitions, classification, imaging indications, protocols, and neuroradiological findings, aiming to understand how neuroimaging contributes to diagnosing and managing epilepsy comprehensively. Key points: MR should be performed in adults and children with a recent diagnosis of epilepsy of unknown etiology or a first seizure.

### Neurological update: Structural and functional imaging in epilepsy surgery [^1111eQZ7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

In the context of **structural brain imaging**, computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role. In emergency settings, when a patient experiences new onset seizures, a non-contrast CT of the head is appropriate to rapidly diagnose or exclude several life-threatening conditions, such as an epidural hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage. MRI, being more time-consuming, is less suitable for these pathologies in acute scenarios. However, in cases of refractory epilepsy, CT scans can be useful to identify calcifications related to conditions like neurocysticercosis or detect bone abnormalities associated with temporal encephaloceles, which are less well characterized on MRI. Even if an emergency department CT head scan appears normal, an outpatient MRI head scan is essential to determine if there is any underlying structural lesion predisposing the patient to future seizures.

In **structural MRI**, the presurgical evaluation of refractory epilepsy patients begins with MRI due to its superior sensitivity, specificity, and higher spatial resolution compared to CT for identifying subtle structural abnormalities. MRI can acquire various sequences, critical to the optimal epilepsy surgery protocol which includes axial and coronal slices of volumetric T1-weighted sequences to enhance grey-white matter differentiation and detect cortical thickness as well as malformations of cortical development. Additionally, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences are sensitive to conditions such as hippocampal sclerosis (HS), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), tumours, inflammation, and scars. This allows for the quantification of hippocampal changes.

### Seizure-induced brain lesions: A wide spectrum of variably reversible MRI abnormalities [^113ACCgS]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

MRI abnormalities in the postictal period might represent the effect of the seizure activity rather than its structural cause.

- **Material and methods**: Retrospective review of clinical and neuroimaging charts of 26 patients diagnosed with seizure-related MR-signal changes. All patients underwent brain MRI (1.5-Tesla, standard pre- and post-contrast brain imaging, including DWI-ADC in 19 out of 26) within 7 days from a seizure and at least one follow-up MRI, showing partial or complete reversibility of the MR-signal changes. An extensive clinical work-up and follow-up, ranging from 3 months to 5 years, ruled out infection or other possible causes of brain damage. Seizure-induced brain MRI abnormalities remained a diagnosis of exclusion. The site, characteristics, reversibility of MRI changes, and association with characteristics of seizures were determined.

- **Results**: MRI showed unilateral (13 out of 26) and bilateral abnormalities, with high (24 out of 26) and low (2 out of 26) T2-signal, leptomeningeal contrast enhancement (2 out of 26), and restricted diffusion (9 out of 19). The location of abnormality was cortical/subcortical, basal ganglia, white matter, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. The hippocampus was involved in 10 out of 26 patients. Reversibility of MRI changes was complete in 15 patients, with residual gliosis or focal atrophy in 11 patients. Reversibility was noted between 15 and 150 days (average, 62 days). Partial simple and complex seizures were associated with hippocampal involvement (p = 0.015) and status epilepticus with incomplete reversibility of MRI abnormalities (p = 0.041).

- **Conclusions**: Seizure or epileptic status can indicate significant reversible or permanent brain alterations detectable via MRI.

### Rapid brain MRI protocols reduce head computerized tomography use in the pediatric emergency department [^112BBjUr]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols may be effective in the emergency department (ED) to evaluate nontraumatic neurologic complaints. We evaluate neuroimaging (rapid MRI [rMRI]), head computerized tomography [HCT], and full MRI use following widespread implementation of rMRI protocols in a pediatric ED.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care pediatric ED of encounters with neuroimaging during two 9-month periods: one prior to (control period) and one after the generalized availability of 4 rMRI protocols (rMRI period). The primary outcome was differences in neuroimaging rates between the two periods. Secondary outcomes included ED process measures, unsuccessful imaging, and undetected pathology, with full MRI within 14 days as the reference standard.

- **Results**: There were 1052 encounters with neuroimaging during the control and 1308 during the rMRI periods. Differences in neuroimaging between periods were 27.7% for rMRI (95% CI, 24.4, 31.0), -21.5% for HCT (95% CI, -25.5, -17.5), and -6.2% for full MRI (95% CI, -9.3, -3.1%). Time to imaging (182 [IQR 138–255] versus 86 [IQR 52–137] minutes) as well as ED length of stay (396 [IQR 304–484] versus 257 [IQR 196–334] minutes) was longer for rMRI versus HCT (p < 0.01). Between the control and rMRI periods, there were differences in types of neuroimaging performed for patients with altered mental status, headache, seizure, shunt dysfunction, stroke, syncope, trauma, vomiting, infection, and other neurologic complaints (p < 0.05). rMRI studies were unsuccessful in 3.6%.

### Neuroimaging of migrational disorders in pediatric epilepsy [^115zwtqQ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Seizures in children are common and represent a final pathway for a variety of brain insults. Although most children with seizures do not require imaging, when indicated, imaging plays an important role in the clinical workup. Imaging in the pediatric seizure population is reserved for a particular subset of patients depending on factors such as age of onset, symptomatology, physical examination findings, and specific electroencephalography changes, to name a few. The etiologies of seizures are extensive and include disorders of cortical migration and organization.

Cortical migration and organization disorders are multifactorial and complex and are a major cause of seizure disorders. Although magnetic resonance imaging is the most common imaging modality used to identify the seizure focus, positron emission tomographic and/or diffusion tensor imaging are beginning to provide complementary information about the involved areas. Early and accurate detection is key to better treatment and overall improved patient prognosis.

### Neonatal brain MRI and short-term outcomes after acute provoked seizures [^116XqUxC]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). High credibility.

The study investigated how diagnosis and injury location on neonatal brain MRI following the onset of acute provoked seizures was associated with short-term outcomes. A multicenter cohort of neonates with acute provoked seizures was enrolled in the Neonatal Seizure Registry. MRIs were centrally evaluated by a neuroradiologist for the location of injury and radiologic diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were determined by chart review, and multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between MRI findings and outcomes.

Among 236 newborns with MRI conducted at a median age of 4 days (IQR 3–8), 91% had abnormal MRIs. Radiologic diagnoses of intracranial hemorrhage (OR 3.2 [1.6–6.5], p < 0.001) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (OR 2.7 [1.4–5.4], p < 0.003) were associated with a high seizure burden. Radiologic signs of intracranial infection were associated with abnormal neurologic examinations at discharge (OR 3.9 [1.3–11.6], p < 0.01).

Findings on initial MRI can assist with expectant counseling on short-term outcomes following acute provoked neonatal seizures.

### Contrast-induced encephalopathy-neuroimaging findings and clinical relevance [^117QKfDR]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare encephalopathic condition that occurs following the administration of a contrast agent. Diagnosing CIE is challenging due to the heterogeneity and non-specificity of its clinical presentation. Typically, the clinical course is favorable, with most patients achieving full recovery within 48–72 hours. However, comorbidity is significant and can affect the clinical outcome. The incidence of CIE is expected to be increasing, attributed to the growing number of endovascular and diagnostic imaging procedures involving iodinated contrast.

It is crucial to consider CIE in the differential diagnosis when patients experience deterioration during or immediately after the administration of contrast, even when small amounts of non-ionic contrast agent are used. In cases where CIE is deemed the most probable cause of the clinical symptoms, it is recommended to avoid unnecessary additional contrast studies, such as angiography or perfusion CT.

### Transient postictal magnetic resonance imaging abnormality of the corpus callosum in a patient with epilepsy. Case report and review of the literature [^115iTpa2]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Transient neuroimaging abnormalities associated with seizure activity have received little attention in the literature. The authors report a focal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging abnormality of the corpus callosum in a patient following a secondary generalized seizure. A 27-year-old right-handed man presented with a history of medically refractory partial seizures since the age of 1 year. The results of an MR imaging study obtained 4 months prior to the patient undergoing video-electroencephalography monitoring were unremarkable. After the patient discontinued all antiepileptic medications, a secondary generalized seizure of right temporal origin was recorded. Five days later, repeated MR imaging revealed a nonenhancing 14 x 11-mm ovoid hyperintense lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient was asymptomatic, and his neurological and neurocognitive examinations remained unremarkable. Follow-up MR imaging 5 weeks and 1 year later demonstrated near-complete resolution of the lesion. Benign and transient abnormalities in the splenium can occur as a periictal phenomenon. A high index of suspicion and follow-up imaging may prevent further unwarranted intervention.

### Contrast-induced encephalopathy: Neuroimaging findings and clinical relevance [^1118x38x]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare encephalopathic condition occurring after the administration of a contrast agent. Diagnosing CIE is challenging due to the heterogeneity and non-specific clinical presentation. The clinical course is usually favorable, with full recovery occurring within 48–72 hours for most patients, although comorbidities are relevant and contribute to the clinical outcome. The incidence of CIE is expected to increase currently due to the rise in endovascular and diagnostic imaging procedures that utilize iodinated contrast.

It is important to consider CIE in the differential diagnosis when patients experience deterioration during or immediately after the administration of contrast agents, even when only a small amount of non-ionic contrast agent is used. If CIE is deemed the most likely cause of the clinical symptoms, it is advised to avoid unnecessary additional contrast studies, such as angiography or perfusion CT.

### Child neurology practice guidelines: past, present, and future [^114JE4hh]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines have been developed in child neurology during the last fifteen years to address important clinical questions and provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care.

- **Methods**: This review describes the guideline development process and how it has evolved to meet the needs of child neurologists.

- **Results**: Several child neurology guidelines are reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of guidelines, as well as the legal consequences of using them to determine a standard of care, are discussed. The future of guidelines and their influence on integrated support systems is also considered.

- **Conclusions**: Child neurology practice guidelines are a helpful resource for clinicians, families, and institutions as they provide evidence-based recommendations concerning the diagnosis and management of common neurological conditions affecting children. Incorporating consensus processes has allowed the expansion of clinically relevant recommendations, increasing the utility of guidelines.

### Neonatal brain MRI and short-term outcomes after acute provoked seizures [^11545cqW]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

All MRI studies were performed using local institutional protocols. The first MRI after neonatal seizure onset was centrally reviewed by a board-certified, fellowship-trained pediatric neuroradiologist with seven years of experience (YL). The first ten MRIs were also reviewed by a pediatric neuroradiologist with 40 years of experience (AJB) to establish consensus in scoring methodology.

Studies that were not of diagnostic quality, based on the degree of motion degradation, were identified and excluded. Studies were evaluated for available sequences [T1, T2, Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI), and T1 post-contrast].

In generating the primary imaging predictors, a binary scoring system (present/absent) was used to assess for any signal abnormality corresponding to injury involving the cortex and deep gray nuclei. Examples of cortical injury include reduced diffusion signifying acute ischemia, T1 hyperintensity compatible with laminar necrosis, and loss of the cortical ribbon compatible with cortical edema. Examples of deep gray injury include reduced diffusion signifying acute ischemia, susceptibility artifact compatible with hemorrhage, abnormal T1 hyperintensity or T2 hypointensity signifying evolving injury in the setting of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), and T2 hyperintensity signifying edema.

### Arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of late seizure after stroke [^114EzFd4]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive modality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used to evaluate cerebral perfusion without a contrast agent. The usefulness of ASL for diagnosis in the acute phase of late seizure after stroke was evaluated.

- **Methods**: Twelve consecutive patients diagnosed with late seizure after stroke were enrolled in this study. MRI, including ASL, was performed for each patient at the time of the emergency department visit. Eight of the patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG).

- **Results**: All patients showed hyperperfusion around the stroke lesion on ASL. Only six patients showed high signal intensity along the cerebral cortex around the stroke lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging. The patients who underwent EEG showed slow activity, but paroxysmal discharges such as spikes or sharp waves were not observed.

- **Conclusions**: ASL was able to reveal hyperperfusion and was of great diagnostic value in the peri-ictal phase of late seizure after stroke.

### Gadavist [^1168Si9b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Gadavist is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for several purposes:

- **Indications and usage**: Gadavist is used to detect and visualize areas with disrupted blood-brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity of the central nervous system in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates. It is also used to assess the presence and extent of malignant breast disease in adult patients and to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates. Additionally, Gadavist assesses myocardial perfusion (stress, rest) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

- **Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system (CNS)**: Gadavist is indicated for use with MRI in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates, to detect and visualize areas with disrupted blood-brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity of the central nervous system.

- **MRI of the breast**: Gadavist is indicated for use with MRI in adult patients to assess the presence and extent of malignant breast disease.

- **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**: Gadavist is indicated for use in MRA in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates, to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease.

- **Cardiac MRI**: Gadavist is indicated for use in cardiac MRI (CMRI) to assess myocardial perfusion (stress, rest) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.

### Emergent diagnostic testing for pediatric nonfebrile seizures [^111ieiDK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Neurology recommends laboratory studies or computed tomography (CT) for children who experience a nonfebrile seizure if anything in their history suggests a clinically significant abnormality.

- **Objective**: To ascertain if any patient or seizure characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood that laboratory studies or CT scan will yield clinically significant results.

- **Methods**: This retrospective case series reviewed 93 children with nonfebrile seizure, who were evaluated in an urban pediatric emergency department (ED) between July 2007 and June 2011.

- **Results**: Laboratory studies were performed in 87% of the study group; 7% of those tests gave clinically significant results. Computed tomographic scans were obtained in 35% of patients; 9% showed clinically significant findings. The presence of an active seizure in the ED or a first nonfebrile seizure had an 8% and 11% difference, respectively, for clinically significant laboratory abnormality. Children younger than 2 years showed a 7% difference in clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

- **Conclusion**: This study did not identify statistically significant predictors of laboratory or CT abnormalities for children with nonfebrile seizure presenting to the ED. Age less than 2 years, having an active seizure in the ED, and experiencing a first-time seizure showed a trend toward an increased yield of laboratory testing. In accordance with the American Academy of Neurology guidelines, the child's history preceding the nonfebrile seizure should guide the decision for diagnostic testing.

### Advanced neuromonitoring modalities on the horizon: Detection and management of acute brain injury in children [^116rkNZW]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced MRI techniques provide high-resolution anatomical and structural information to improve diagnostic discrimination of intracranial vascular malformations, vasculitis, and brain tumors in children. Intravenously administered contrast agents are most commonly paramagnetic gadolinium ion complexes, which shorten relaxation times of surrounding water protons. These complexes permeate the blood-brain barrier and create positive contrast enhancements (hyperintensities) in surrounding endothelial and extravascular tissue. Within the last five years, several gadolinium contrast agents have received regulatory approval for use in children of all age groups. The potential risks of gadolinium contrast administration may be offset by improved diagnostic accuracy, particularly in pediatric stroke when time-to-diagnosis is vital for the prevention of neurological injury and death, and by improved prognostication. Alternative contrast agents, including liposomes, micelles, and inorganic nanoparticles (e.g. ferumoxytol), remain an active area of study.

- **Black-blood T1-weighted vessel wall imaging (VW-MRI)**: This technique permits contrast-enhanced visualization of periarterial vessel wall structure in the anterior circulation and has been increasingly utilized in pediatric stroke. Although a degree of linear enhancement along medium- to large-sized arteries is normal in children, atypical enhancement in arteries bordered by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or hemispheric asymmetry provides localized discrimination of arteriopathies, which contribute to a improved understanding of vascular conditions.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: Executive summary of the report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers guideline panel [^116QTxYt]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The National Association of Epilepsy Centers first published the guidelines for epilepsy centers in 1990, which were last updated in 2010. Since that update, epilepsy care and the science of guideline development have advanced significantly, including the importance of incorporating a diversity of stakeholder perspectives such as those of patients and their caregivers. Currently, despite extensive published data examining the efficacy of treatments and diagnostic testing for epilepsy, there remain significant gaps in data identifying the essential services needed for a comprehensive epilepsy center and the optimal manner for their delivery.

The trustworthy consensus-based statements (TCBS) process produces unbiased, scientifically valid guidelines through a transparent process that incorporates available evidence and expert opinion. A systematic literature search returned 5,937 relevant studies from which 197 articles were retained for data extraction. A panel of 41 stakeholders with diverse expertise evaluated this evidence and drafted recommendations following the TCBS process. The panel reached consensus on 52 recommendations covering services provided by specialized epilepsy centers in both the inpatient and outpatient settings in major topic areas including epilepsy monitoring unit care, surgery, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics, and outpatient care. Recommendations were informed by the evidence review and reflect the consensus of a broad panel of expert opinions.

### Rapid brain MRI protocols reduce head computerized tomography use in the pediatric emergency department [^111yrhDP]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate, safe, non-radiating cross-sectional imaging modality. Historically, MRI use in children, particularly patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED), has been limited by the exam duration and the need for sedation in many cases. Consequently, head computed tomography (HCT) is often the default imaging modality. HCT carries the benefits of being a rapid, readily available, and generally more inexpensive neuroimaging modality.

For example, multicenter data from pediatric hospitals between the years 2009–2013 suggest that 56 patients per 1,000 encounters (ED or inpatient) get a CT, with the majority (60%) being HCTs. Additionally, HCT is preferred in cases of trauma within the context of Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. Despite these advantages, HCT carries the carcinogenic risks associated with radiation, which are particularly concerning in pediatric patients. Additionally, HCT is limited in its evaluation of posterior fossa lesions as well as findings related to ischemic stroke.

Rapid-sequence magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (rMRI) has gained acceptance as an alternative to HCT in children because of the speed of image acquisition. Previous studies highlight experiences with rMRI protocols for a single indication, including ventricular shunt malfunction, stroke, and abusive head trauma. These studies demonstrate a role for rMRI as a radiation-sparing alternative to HCT. In patients evaluated for ventricular shunt malfunction, for example, retrospective studies have suggested that rapid MRI is effective.

### When is brain MRI indicated for children with the first unprovoked seizure presenting to the pediatric emergency department? A retrospective cohort study [^114UMB7q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The decision to perform immediate brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with their first unprovoked seizure presenting to the emergency department (ED) remains a clinical challenge. We aimed to identify clinical factors associated with the detection of epileptogenic lesions and emergent neuroimaging findings on MRI to determine the imaging necessity and urgency, respectively.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients (age 0–18 years) presenting to a single institution's pediatric ED with new-onset unprovoked seizures between January 2010 and December 2023.

- **Results**: Among 222 included children, 84 (37.8%) demonstrated an epileptogenic lesion, among which 18 (21.4%) exhibited emergent neuroimaging findings. Multiple seizures at presentation (p < 0.001), prolonged seizures lasting ≥ 5 min (p < 0.001), and developmental delay (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with epileptogenic lesions. Classification of patients with one or more risk factors as the high-risk group showed a sensitivity of 94.0% and specificity of 55.1% for detecting epileptogenic lesions, and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 39.7% for emergent neuroimaging findings. In patients without any of these risk factors, only 5 of 81 patients (6.3%) had epileptogenic lesions, and none had emergent neuroimaging findings.

- **Conclusion**: Among patients with new-onset unprovoked seizures visiting the pediatric ED, those with one or more risk factors — multiple seizures, prolonged seizure duration, or developmental delay — may benefit from MRI to identify epileptogenic lesions.

### Advanced pediatric neuroimaging [^113HyvKJ]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Advanced magnetic resonance neuroimaging techniques play an important adjunct role to conventional MRI sequences for better depiction and characterization of a variety of brain disorders. In this article, we briefly review the basic principles and clinical utility of a select number of these techniques, including clinical functional MRI for presurgical planning; clinical diffusion tensor imaging and related techniques; dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging using gadolinium injection; and arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging. The article focuses on general principles of clinical MRI acquisition protocols, relevant factors affecting image quality, and a general framework for obtaining images for each of these techniques. We also present relevant advances for acquiring these types of imaging sequences in a clinical setting.

### Implementation of a 7T epilepsy task force consensus imaging protocol for routine presurgical epilepsy work-up: Effect on diagnostic yield and lesion delineation [^115PdwTo]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Hypothesis**: Our hypothesis was that the 7 T Epilepsy Task Force recommendation offers improved rates and confidence for lesion detection, as well as better focal delineation than a dedicated 3 T MRI epilepsy protocol. The null hypothesis accordingly stated that the protocol does not offer any quantifiable benefits over the clinical gold standard.

- **Cohort recruitment**: After institutional review board approval (EK 1039/2020) for this prospective study, consecutive patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy were recruited in 2020–2022 during the pre-surgical evaluation process (according to ILAE standards) at the Medical University of Vienna (MUV) according to the presented inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Department of Neurology, Department of Neurosurgery, and Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Age ≥ 12 years; informed consent by the subject, and, if applicable, their legal guardian; pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy with either suboptimal delineation of the epileptogenic lesion on 3 T MRI or MRN despite the congruency of other pre-surgical investigations (seizure semiology, ictal/interictal video-EEG, neuropsychological testing, PET imaging); and pre-surgical evaluation and/or epilepsy surgery at our centers.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Age < 12 years; weight < 30 kg; claustrophobia; pregnancy; breastfeeding; and ferromagnetic implants for the 7 T scan.

### Imaging of the epilepsies [^112WrNVX]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The imaging of epilepsy patients is challenging since epileptogenic lesions, defined as structural lesions causally related to the epilepsy syndrome, may be small and often do not change during life. Prior clinical information about the epilepsy syndrome and the semiology of the seizures is needed in order to plan the examination properly. The effort to detect an epileptogenic lesion is directed toward partial (focal) epilepsy syndromes, whereas — by definition — no lesion is identified in idiopathic epilepsies. Most patients with partial epilepsies suffer from mesial temporal lobe epilepsies. In these patients, 2- to 3-mm thick T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) fast spin echo slices along or perpendicular to the temporal lobe length axis have the highest diagnostic efficacy.

In contrast, in patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsies, perpendicular FLAIR slices through the anatomic region, from which, due to clinical and EEG criteria, the seizures are likely to originate are preferred.

- **Imaging features of common epileptogenic lesions**: Hippocampal sclerosis, long-term epilepsy-associated tumors, focal cortical dysplasias, vascular malformations, encephalitis including limbic and Rasmussen's encephalitis, and gyral scarring including ulegyria are detailed in the second section of this paper.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^115HjvBF]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

While contrast enhancement is important for increasing the signal-to-background ratio for small lesions, depicting an impaired blood-brain barrier, accentuating vessel structures, and estimating tissue perfusion, new non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques must offer reliable alternatives for these clinical questions. There are useful sequences without gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), which are introduced here.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of epilepsy at 3 tesla [^1151rMBA]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with epilepsy often have a structural cause for their seizures and may benefit from surgical resection. As recommended in the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to screen for structural abnormalities in these patients, and there is increasing evidence that 3T MRI has better sensitivity and specificity than 1.5T. This article reviews the imaging findings of many of the common diseases that can cause epilepsy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in 120 patients with intractable partial seizures: a preoperative assessment [^1159yPgm]. Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with medically intractable epilepsy and to compare different magnetic resonance (MR) sequences to establish a dedicated and shorter scan time imaging protocol of choice. One hundred and twenty patients with seizures that were refractory to medical treatment were assessed by MRI with spin-echo (SE) T1, fast spin-echo (FSE) T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), inversion recovery (IR), and contrast-enhanced T1 SE sequences.

Pathological scans were acquired in 78 patients. Hippocampal sclerosis was detected in 30 patients (25%), cerebral tumoral mass lesions in 12 patients (10%), vascular malformations in nine patients (7.5%), cortical infarcts in eight patients (6.7%), cerebral infections in four patients (4.2%), and developmental disorders in 15 patients (12.5%). The most common location of the lesions was the temporal lobe (60%).

Coronal, thin (slice thickness 4–5 mm) images have proven to be the most useful in the assessment of the hippocampus. FLAIR and IR are particularly useful in the detection of lesions abutting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces and developmental disorders, respectively, while T1 SE sequences before and after the intravenous administration of gadolinium offer great facility in identifying space-occupying lesions and infections. MRI is the most important diagnostic tool for the assessment of epileptogenic foci, thus playing the primary role in indicating the type of treatment to be applied.

### The use of susceptibility-weighted imaging for epileptic focus localization in acute-stage pediatric encephalopathy: a case report [^114FaYk8]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a novel high-spatial-resolution three-dimensional gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging technique with phase postprocessing that accentuates the paramagnetic properties of blood products. The use of susceptibility-weighted imaging for epileptic focus localization in the acute stage of encephalopathy in a child has not been documented.

- **Patients**: We report three pediatric patients with status epilepticus in the setting of fever, in whom susceptibility-weighted imaging showed transient prominence of the focal venous vasculature.

- **Results**: Conventional cranial T1- and T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted images showed no abnormalities. The prominence of the focal venous vasculature in these patients, as demonstrated by susceptibility-weighted imaging, was consistent with the epileptic focuses suggested by both clinical symptoms and electroencephalograph findings and resolved completely without neurological sequelae in all patients.

- **Conclusions**: Susceptibility-weighted imaging may facilitate assessing epileptic focus localization in the acute stage of encephalopathy in children.

### European recommendations on practices in pediatric neuroradiology: Consensus document from the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR), European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) and European Union of Medical Specialists Division of Neuroradiology (UEMS) [^115nPzc8]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice for a variety of indications from fetal life to adolescence. In newborns, both premature and term, an additional MRI may clarify equivocal US/Doppler findings. In infants, after closure of the fontanelles, MRI represents the main modality for imaging of the brain and spinal canal.

- **Indications for MRI include but are not limited to**:
	- Fetal MRI (malformations, acquired fetal damage).
	- Emergent neuroimaging in patients presenting with acute neurological illness.
	- Trauma (as a complementary modality), including suspected abusive head trauma and post-delivery brachial plexus palsy.
	- Epilepsy.
	- Stroke and vascular abnormalities.
	- Brain and spine malformations.
	- Pathologies of the peripheral nerves.
	- Genetic disorders presenting with developmental delay or autistic spectrum disorder.
	- Neurocutaneous and other genetic syndromes.
	- Infectious, inflammatory, and demyelinating diseases.
	- Metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.
	- Brain and spinal tumors.
	- Hypothalamic-pituitary, orbital, and head and neck disorders including inner ear pathologies.

Health care centers providing pediatric neuroradiology services should be equipped with state-of-the-art MR scanners. Although many initial pediatric neuroradiology exams are performed in nonspecialized centers that may not be perfectly equipped, magnets of lower field strength than 1.5 Tesla (T) should not be used for pediatric neuroimaging. Ideally, 3-T magnets should be preferred over 1.5-T scanners for brain MRI, owing to their superiority in terms of spatial and contrast resolution.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: Executive summary of the report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers Guideline Panel [^116FGcTi]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The National Association of Epilepsy Centers first published the guidelines for epilepsy centers in 1990, with the most recent update in 2010. Since then, there have been significant advancements in epilepsy care and the science of guideline development, including the integration of diverse stakeholder perspectives such as those of patients and their caregivers. Despite extensive published data on the efficacy of treatments and diagnostic testing for epilepsy, there are still notable gaps in understanding the essential services required for a comprehensive epilepsy center and the optimal methods for their delivery.

The trustworthy consensus-based statements (TCBS) process creates unbiased, scientifically valid guidelines through a transparent process that incorporates available evidence and expert opinions. A systematic literature search identified 5,937 relevant studies, from which 197 articles were retained for data extraction. A panel of 41 stakeholders with diverse expertise evaluated this evidence and drafted recommendations using the TCBS process.

The panel reached consensus on 52 recommendations covering services provided by specialized epilepsy centers in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Major topic areas include epilepsy monitoring unit care, surgery, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics, and outpatient care. These recommendations are informed by the evidence review and reflect the consensus of a broad panel of experts.

### Pediatric brain MRI, part 2: Advanced techniques [^1169KPHg]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric neuroimaging is a complex and specialized field that utilizes magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as the primary tool for diagnosis. MR protocols should be tailored to the specific indication and reviewed by the supervising radiologist in real time. Targeted advanced imaging sequences can be added to provide information regarding tissue microstructure, perfusion, metabolism, and function. In part 2 of this review, we highlight the utility of advanced imaging techniques for superior evaluation of pediatric neurologic disease. We focus on the following techniques, with clinical examples: phase-contrast imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, vessel wall imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, task-based functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy.

### Value of ultra-high field MRI in patients with suspected focal epilepsy and negative 3 T MRI (EpiUltraStudy): Protocol for a prospective, longitudinal therapeutic study [^1136sbaJ]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that ultra-high field (UHF) MRI (7 T and 9.4 T) leads to improved detection and quantification of tiny structural and functional (sub)cortical abnormalities due to a higher spatial resolution and contrast level beyond what is available at 3 T. By applying 9.4 T, we hypothesize that there will be an additional diagnostic gain compared to 7 T MRI. Additionally, this increased lesion detection of UHF MRI, and additional voxel-based morphometry postprocessing techniques of the UHF images, will guide surgical decision-making. This may lead to a more personalized type of epilepsy surgery and improved postoperative seizure outcomes, with a higher chance of becoming seizure-free in potential candidates for epilepsy surgery.

The primary objectives of this study are:

- **Estimate the detection rate**: of structural and functional brain lesions on 7 T and 9.4 T MRI in patients with drug-resistant 3 T MRI-negative focal epilepsy.

- **Assess association with improved outcomes**: Determine whether this increased detection rate is associated with improved postoperative seizure outcomes.

In this paper, we present the study protocol according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials protocol guidelines.

### Structural magnetic resonance imaging in epilepsy [^112bw482]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Because of its sensitivity and high tissue contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice for structural imaging in epilepsy. In this review, the effect of using optimized scanning protocols and the use of high field MR systems on detection sensitivity is discussed. Also, the clinical relevance of adequate imaging in patients with focal epilepsy is highlighted. The most frequently encountered MRI findings in epilepsy are reported, and their imaging characteristics depicted. Imaging focus will be on the diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis and malformations of cortical development, two major causes of medically intractable focal epilepsy.

### Ultra-high field 7T MRI in a drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy cohort: Image comparison and radiologic outcomes [^113bE1Xb]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We systematically evaluated image quality, scan tolerability, and clinical utility of 7T MRI scanning in children with focal epilepsy aged 8 years and older. Our findings suggest that 7T MRI is both feasible and well tolerated in this age group and holds significant potential for enhancing lesion detection and supporting presurgical planning in focal epilepsy cases where conventional MRI results are inconclusive.

- **Characterizing side effects**: A key factor in understanding the practical utility of 7T MRI in children is to characterize the type and frequency of its associated side effects. Previous adult studies have shown that short-term effects such as dizziness, vertigo, nausea, headache, and a metallic taste may be experienced by participants during ultra-high field scanning and that reported side effects are larger than for lower field strengths. In line with this, our pediatric study demonstrated that increased dizziness was experienced during 7T scanning in comparison with 3T scanning. However, this settled after the participant had stopped moving through the field; none of the reported side effects persisted beyond the scanning procedure, and no adverse events were observed during the scanning session.

Notably, side effects were more commonly reported among younger children, suggesting that the experience of higher field might differ based on age-related factors and developmental stages. This underscores the importance of tailoring procedures and providing adequate support and reassurance, especially for younger children.

### A wide spectrum of variably periictal MRI abnormalities induced by a single or a cluster of seizures [^114K3anc]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Although predominantly reported in patients with status epilepticus, periictal MRI abnormalities have been noted in patients experiencing a single or a cluster of seizures. Clinicians often face a dilemma concerning the features of these MRI abnormalities, as they may reflect the effects of seizure activity rather than structural causes.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of clinical and neuroimaging charts of 14 patients, diagnosed with seizure-related MR-signal changes, was conducted. These patients were from our unit is database, where approximately 300 patients diagnosed with a single or a cluster of seizures underwent brain MRI within 14 days of their seizure. An extensive clinical work-up and follow-up, ranging from 3 months to 5 years, ruled out infection or other possible causes of brain damage. The site, characteristics, reversibility of MRI changes, and their association with seizure characteristics were determined.

- **Results**: MRI revealed unilateral abnormalities in 14 patients, with hyperintensities on T2-signal (12/14), fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) (12/14), and restricted diffusion (6/8). The location of abnormalities included cortical (4/14), subcortical (6/14), thalamus (2/14), corpus callosum (1/14), and areas adjacent to an old encephaloclastic lesion (1/14). There was an almost complete topographic concordance between periictal MRI abnormalities and electroclinical findings in 10 patients, which was not consistent in 4 patients. Reversibility of MRI changes was complete in 11 patients and partially disappeared in 1 patient.

### Ultra-high field 7T MRI in a drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy cohort: Image comparison and radiologic outcomes [^116CrPcz]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

It is important to note that a comprehensive understanding of the practical utility of 7T MRI in children hinges on recognizing its associated side effects and how it is perceived during examinations. While studies in adults have consistently demonstrated that discomfort is transient and 7T scans are generally well tolerated, the experience may vary in children because of age-related factors and developmental stages. In this study, we present findings from a large prospective pediatric case series using 7T MRI with a paired 3T acquisition to investigate the relative tolerability, image quality, and clinical yield of 7T MRI in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

### Review of standard paediatric neuroradiology MRI protocols from 12 UK tertiary paediatric hospitals: Is there much variation between centres [^111uYsaR]. Clinical Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations are protocolled in tertiary paediatric neuroradiology centres around the UK for some of the more common presentations encountered in paediatric neuroradiology and to identify any variations of note.

- **Materials and methods**: All 19 UK tertiary paediatric neuroradiology centres registered with the British Society of Neuroradiologists-Paediatric Group were contacted and asked to provide a copy of their standard MRI protocols. Twelve centres responded (63%), and 10 of the more common presentations were selected. The standard acquired sequences at each participating centre were compared. Where available, the collated protocols were also compared against published guidance.

- **Results**: The basic sequences carried out by centres around the UK are similar; however, there are numerous variations overall. The only standardised protocol currently being implemented nationally in paediatric imaging is that for brain tumours. Otherwise, chosen protocols are generally dependent on the preferences and technical capabilities of individual centres. Suggested published protocols also exist for non-accidental injury (NAI), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and head and neck imaging.

- **Conclusions**: The differences in MRI protocolling depend in part on technical capabilities and in part on the experience and preferences of the paediatric neuroradiologists at each centre. For most presentations, there is no consensus on what constitutes the perfect protocol. The present results will be useful for specialist centres.

### Characteristic MRI findings in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures: Diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging [^11783CBL]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in hyperglycaemia-induced seizures and evaluate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, also discussing possible underlying mechanisms of this condition.

- **Materials and methods**: Eleven patients with hyperglycaemia-induced seizures and MRI abnormalities were retrospectively studied. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, MRI findings, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: All patients, except one, presented with focal seizures, simple or complex partial seizures, or negative motor seizures and had long-standing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The MRI abnormalities observed acutely were focal subcortical hypointensities on T2-weighted imaging and FLAIR imaging in all patients, with overlying cortical gyral T2 hyperintensities in five patients. Focal overlying cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging or contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was observed in all patients. Contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging was superior to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging for detecting characteristic cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed mildly restricted diffusion in four of five patients with cortical gyral T2 hyperintensity. In nine patients, the lesions were localized in the parietal or parieto-occipital lobes. The other two patients showed localized precentral gyral lesions. After treatment, the neurological symptoms, including the seizures, improved in all patients.

### Evaluation of suspected dementia [^1123gkaV]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for mild cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining MRI without contrast enhancement as the preferred imaging to exclude other intracranial abnormalities such as stroke, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or a treatable mass.

### Evaluation of a first seizure [^115NuwvD]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure is a common presentation in the emergency care setting, and new-onset epilepsy is the most common cause of unprovoked seizures. The patient history and physical examination should direct the type and timing of laboratory and imaging studies. No single sign, symptom, or test clearly differentiates a seizure from a non-seizure event (e.g. syncope, pseudoseizure). Electroencephalography is recommended for patients presenting with a first seizure, and neuroimaging is recommended for adults. Neuroimaging also should be performed in children with risk factors such as head trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or a history of malignancy.

Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography except when acute intracranial bleeding is suspected. The most common laboratory findings associated with a seizure are abnormal sodium and glucose levels. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal test results, and no structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Treatment with antiepileptic medications reduces the one- to two-year risk of reseizures but does not reduce the long-term risk of recurrence and does not affect remission rates. Regardless of etiology, a seizure diagnosis severely limits a patient's driving privileges, although laws vary by state.

### When should a brain MRI be performed in children with new-onset seizures? Results of a large prospective trial [^114eorT6]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). High credibility.

There is a paucity of data regarding the incidence of structural brain lesions in children with new-onset unprovoked seizures. Our aim was to determine the frequencies and types of epileptogenic lesions detected on a dedicated epilepsy protocol MR imaging according to age group, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures.

Consecutive children between 6 months and 18 years of age with new-onset unprovoked seizures were included. The frequencies and types of epileptogenic lesions were determined and then stratified according to sex, age groups, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures at presentation. Multivariate analysis was used to identify variables significantly associated with the presence of epileptogenic lesions.

One thousand children were included. An epileptogenic lesion was identified in 26%, with malformations of cortical development being the most common lesion (32%), followed by hypoxic-ischemic injury (20%) and vascular etiologies (16%). Univariate analysis showed a significant increase in the frequency of epileptogenic lesions with decreasing age, the presence of developmental delay, and the number and types of seizures at presentation. The presence of developmental delay and seizure type at presentation remained significant in a multivariate analysis.

We documented a relatively high rate of epileptogenic lesions in children with new-onset seizures, with the presence of developmental delay and specific seizure types being associated with these lesions.
