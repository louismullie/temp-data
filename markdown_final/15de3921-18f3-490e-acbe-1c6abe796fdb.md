## Question

How does the presence of CKD or CAD impact the management of chronic hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or coronary artery disease (CAD) should modify the management of chronic hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how CKD and CAD alter baseline cardiovascular risk and the pathophysiology that drives blood pressure targets. Then, I should verify the guideline-concordant blood pressure thresholds for treatment initiation and the specific targets in CKD, CAD, and combined disease. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic choices and combinations, including RAAS blockade, beta-blockers, and diuretic selection in reduced eGFR. After that, I need to consider special populations and safety, including the elderly, frailty, dialysis, and transplant. Finally, I should integrate coronary revascularization strategy nuances and synthesize a practical, individualized plan with monitoring and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the risk context, because targets and intensity hinge on it. CKD confers a 5–10 fold increase in cardiovascular risk via traditional and uremia-specific mechanisms, and CAD is common and prognostically adverse in CKD, so the combination typically places patients in a very high-risk category where more intensive BP lowering is favored if tolerated [^113YTWcm] [^1134nhXU] [^114vDhiA].

> I need to check treatment initiation thresholds next. For most adults with CKD, ESC/ESH 2024 and ESH 2023 recommend initiating pharmacologic therapy at office BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg, with consideration of treatment at ≥ 130/80 mmHg in those with established CVD, including CAD, given their very high risk profile [^117UxXSS]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance for older adults; in those ≥ 80 years, ESC/ESH retains a higher initiation threshold around 160/90 mmHg, but allows consideration of 140–159 mmHg in selected patients, which I should individualize based on frailty and tolerance [^111TiDc3].

> Now, I will examine BP targets, since this is where CKD and CAD meaningfully shift management. Contemporary guidelines converge on a target of < 130/80 mmHg for most patients with CKD and for those with CAD, provided it is tolerated and there is no symptomatic hypotension or excessive diastolic drop, with WHO 2022 and ACC/AHA 2023 endorsing this intensity for high-risk phenotypes including CKD and CAD [^1142VtCM] [^114FJRAe]. Wait, let me verify the European perspective; ESC/ESH 2024 and ESH 2023 align with < 130/80 mmHg for most CKD patients, especially with albuminuria or high CV risk, while allowing individualization in advanced CKD or those at risk of falls [^111tZe8b] [^1177p1vz]. I should double-check the VA/DoD stance; they support intensive BP management in eGFR < 60 to reduce MACE and mortality, again with individualized targets in frail or fall-prone patients [^114RA45V] [^113k4R4p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pushing lower than 120/70; I need to ensure diastolic safety. In patients with stable CAD, particularly with diabetes or chronic total occlusions, excessive diastolic lowering below about 60 mmHg may compromise coronary perfusion without added benefit, so I should titrate carefully and avoid abrupt drops, especially during PCI of CTOs [^114TyMDh] [^115dQGQz].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy and combinations. In CKD with albuminuria, RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred to reduce albuminuria and slow kidney disease progression, and dual RAAS blockade should be avoided due to harm; initial combinations commonly pair a RAAS inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker or a diuretic depending on volume status and eGFR [^117Corcw] [^11439Fg7]. For CAD, I need to ensure cardioprotective agents are prioritized; ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blockers are foundational, with beta-blockers especially important post-ACS or with LV dysfunction, and calcium channel blockers or thiazide-like diuretics added as needed for control, while avoiding excessive bradycardia or hypotension [^113rpZLc] [^114BZaic]. Let me verify diuretic choice in reduced eGFR; when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², thiazides lose potency and loop diuretics should be favored for volume management [^117Corcw].

> I will now examine special populations and safety, because tolerability can reverse the calculus of intensity. In older adults with frailty, limited life expectancy, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, less intensive BP targets are reasonable to mitigate falls, syncope, and AKI risk, and this trade-off should be explicitly documented in the care plan [^113k4R4p] [^1142VtCM]. For advanced CKD and dialysis, evidence is sparse and extrapolated; I should individualize targets, often accepting 130–139/80–89 mmHg if symptoms or intradialytic hypotension emerge, and prioritize RAAS blockade, volume control, and careful ultrafiltration adjustments rather than aggressive downward titration [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient is a kidney transplant recipient? Persistent hypertension is common and multifactorial; I should tailor regimens to immunosuppression interactions and consider transplant-specific risk enhancers, again extrapolating evidence cautiously [^116rLJPP].

> Next, I should review coronary revascularization strategy because it intersects with BP and renal risk. For stable CAD with advanced CKD, ISCHEMIA-CKD showed no reduction in death or MI with an initial invasive strategy and suggested earlier dialysis initiation in the invasive arm, supporting a conservative, medically optimized approach unless there is left main disease, unacceptable angina, or ischemic LV dysfunction [^111c2mD7] [^115go296]. Hold on, I should verify guideline direction; KDIGO 2024 suggests favoring an invasive approach in CKD when there is acute or unstable CAD, LV dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease, which I should integrate with anatomy and patient preferences [^115uwout] [^111pTSWm].

> I need to ensure comprehensive risk modification beyond BP. Statin therapy is indicated for primary and secondary prevention in CKD with ASCVD risk, with attention to drug–drug interactions and muscle toxicity in low eGFR, and antiplatelet therapy should follow CAD indications while balancing bleeding risk, which is higher in CKD [^notfound]. Let me reconsider lifestyle prescriptions; ESC 2024 and KDIGO 2021 endorse tailored physical activity, dietary sodium restriction, weight optimization, and moderation of alcohol, adapted to cardiorenal tolerance and comorbidities [^116phXpY] [^114mUJqB].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety labs, because intensive BP lowering in CKD increases risks of AKI and electrolyte disturbances. Baseline and periodic eGFR and potassium are essential on RAAS blockade, and uptitration should be slower with closer surveillance in advanced CKD; if potassium rises or eGFR falls excessively, I should reassess dose, diuretic strategy, and dietary potassium before abandoning RAAS inhibition, given its prognostic benefits [^116rreDx] [^116LFD1n]. Ambulatory or home BP monitoring improves assessment of control and nocturnal patterns, which is particularly useful in diabetes and CKD where masked or white-coat phenomena are common [^114TyMDh].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a patient with CKD and/or CAD, I will initiate or intensify therapy toward < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, using RAAS blockade plus a CCB or diuretic as needed, add a beta-blocker when CAD is present or there is LV dysfunction, avoid dual RAAS blockade, and favor loop diuretics when eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; I will de-escalate intensity for frailty, falls, or symptomatic hypotension, and I will favor conservative management for stable CAD with advanced CKD unless high-risk anatomic features or refractory symptoms are present [^1177p1vz] [^114FJRAe] [^117Corcw] [^111c2mD7].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and adjustment triggers. Reassess BP control, symptoms, orthostatics, labs, and adherence every 3–6 months, sooner after medication changes, and adjust the regimen if there is symptomatic hypotension, eGFR decline > 30% from baseline, potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, or patient-reported intolerance; if diastolic BP drifts below 60 mmHg with ischemic symptoms, I will moderate the target and reconsider agent selection to protect coronary perfusion while maintaining net clinical benefit [^114TyMDh].

---

CKD and CAD both mandate **tight BP control** (generally < 130/80 mmHg) to reduce cardiovascular events and slow CKD progression, but therapy must be individualized to avoid hypotension or ischemia [^114FJRAe] [^1177p1vz]. RAAS blockade is **first-line** in CKD with albuminuria; beta-blockers and CCBs are preferred in CAD, and combination therapy is often needed [^117Corcw] [^113rpZLc]. Monitor renal function and electrolytes closely, and adjust for reduced eGFR, drug interactions, and bleeding risk [^117Corcw] [^112jDoaE].

---

## Pathophysiological interactions

CKD and CAD share **common pathways** — endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and RAAS activation — that accelerate atherosclerosis and increase cardiovascular risk [^1134nhXU] [^116vDuun]. CKD-specific factors (anemia, mineral metabolism, volume overload) further worsen CAD outcomes [^111KGr12].

---

## Blood pressure targets

- **General target**: < 130/80 mmHg for most patients with CKD and/or CAD [^114FJRAe] [^1177p1vz].
- **Individualization**: Lower targets (< 120/80) may benefit high-risk patients if tolerated; less intensive targets are appropriate in frailty, limited life expectancy, or symptomatic hypotension [^113k4R4p] [^111PHE9U].
- **Evidence**: SPRINT and meta-analyses support intensive BP lowering for cardiovascular benefit, though kidney outcomes vary and adverse events (e.g. AKI) are more common with intensive targets [^111PHE9U] [^116LFD1n].

## Pharmacological management

### First-line antihypertensive agents

| **Drug class** | **Ckd considerations** | **Cad considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | First-line with albuminuria; reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression [^117Corcw] [^113WZ33u] | Reduce cardiovascular events; preferred post-MI or with LV dysfunction [^1147gFoE] [^113TYF5d] |
| Beta-blockers | Useful in CKD with CAD; reduce sympathetic activity and arrhythmias [^notfound] | First-line post-MI; reduce ischemia and arrhythmias [^112JdpTQ] |
| Calcium channel blockers | Effective and safe; minimal renal impact [^notfound] | Effective for angina control; vasodilate coronaries [^notfound] |
| Diuretics | Thiazides if eGFR > 30; loops if eGFR < 30 or volume overload [^117Corcw] | Useful for volume control and edema [^notfound] |
| Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists | Consider in resistant hypertension; monitor potassium [^notfound] | Reduce HF hospitalizations; use cautiously in CKD [^notfound] |

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often required to reach targets; **avoid dual RAAS blockade** because of hyperkalemia and renal injury risk [^11439Fg7] [^117Corcw].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

- **Renal function**: Monitor eGFR and electrolytes regularly; adjust therapy for changes in renal function [^117Corcw].
- **Adverse effects**: Watch for hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and drug interactions [^111PHE9U].
- **Individualization**: Adjust therapy based on tolerance, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^117Corcw].

---

## Special considerations

- **Dialysis patients**: BP targets are individualized; avoid intradialytic hypotension and volume shifts [^notfound].
- **Transplant patients**: Manage immunosuppressant interactions and monitor for rejection [^notfound].
- **Elderly patients**: Use caution with intensive targets; prioritize symptom control and quality of life [^113k4R4p].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Intensive BP control reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD and CAD, though kidney benefits are less consistent and adverse events are more frequent; **balance benefits and harms** through individualized care [^116LFD1n] [^1142VtCM].

---

CKD and CAD require **tight BP control** with individualized targets, RAAS blockade for CKD with albuminuria, and cardioprotective agents for CAD. Close monitoring and tailored therapy optimize outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

### Chronic kidney disease and coronary Artery disease: JACC state-of-the-art review [^1134nhXU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). As well as their high prevalence of traditional CAD risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, persons with CKD are also exposed to other nontraditional, uremia-related cardiovascular disease risk factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal calcium-phosphorus metabolism. CKD and end-stage kidney disease not only increase the risk of CAD, but they also modify its clinical presentation and cardinal symptoms. Management of CAD is complicated in CKD patients, due to their likelihood of comorbid conditions and potential for side effects during interventions. This summary of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Controversies Conference on CAD and CKD (including end-stage kidney disease and transplant recipients) seeks to improve understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CAD in CKD and to identify knowledge gaps, areas of controversy, and priorities for research.

### Impact of the 2014 expert panel recommendations for management of high blood pressure on contemporary cardiovascular practice: insights from the NCDR PINNACLE registry [^115EviqL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has been the predominant guideline for blood pressure management. A 2014 expert panel recommended increasing the blood pressure targets for patients age 60 years and older, as well as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel blood pressure management recommendations on patients managed in U.S. ambulatory cardiovascular practices.

Methods

Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of patients who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of patients for whom the blood pressure goals changed.

Results

Of 1,185,253 patients in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) patients were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and 112,174 (64.6%) had coronary artery disease. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

Conclusions

Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology patients with hypertension, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. If the new recommendations are implemented in clinical practice, blood pressure target achievement and cardiovascular events will need careful monitoring, because many patients for whom the target blood pressure is now more permissive are at high cardiovascular risk.

### Epidemiology and mechanisms of uremia-related cardiovascular disease [^113YTWcm]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease are at 5- to 10-fold higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than age-matched controls. Clinically, CVD in this population manifests as coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, stroke, or congestive heart failure. Beyond the traditional risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus and hypertension), uremia-specific factors that arise from accumulating toxins also contribute to the pathogenesis of CVD. In this review, we summarize the literature on the epidemiology of both traditional and uremia-related CVD and focus on postulated mechanisms of the latter. In the context of current and emerging diagnostics and therapies for CVD, we highlight what we interpret as major gaps in the medical management of this growing population that need to be addressed with targeted epidemiological and translational research. Finally, we describe the global challenges associated with the recognition and management of uremia-related CVD in developed and developing nations.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111TiDc3]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — office blood pressure treatment thresholds (Table 19) specify age-stratified systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) thresholds. For 18–65 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 140 for Hypertension, + Diabetes, + chronic kidney disease (CKD), + coronary artery disease (CAD)†, and + Stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)†, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. For 65–79 years, thresholds are the same: SBP ≥ 140 across these categories and DBP ≥ 90. For ≥ 80 years, office SBP treatment threshold (mmHg) is ≥ 160 across Hypertension, + Diabetes, + CKD, + CAD, and + Stroke/TIA, with office DBP treatment threshold (mmHg) ≥ 90. The dagger denotes: †Treatment may be considered in these very high-risk patients with high–normal SBP (i.e. SBP 130–140 mmHg).

### Medical management of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1167s4TK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of mortality among this population. In addition, chronic kidney disease is a major risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease and is widely regarded as a coronary artery disease risk equivalent. Medical therapy is the cornerstone of coronary artery disease management in the general population. However, there are few trials to guide medical therapy of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease, with most data extrapolated from clinical trials of mainly non-chronic kidney disease patients, which were not adequately powered to evaluate this subgroup. There is some evidence to suggest that the efficacy of certain therapies such as aspirin and statins is attenuated with declining estimated glomerular filtration rate, with questionable benefit among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Furthermore, chronic kidney disease and ESRD patients are at higher risk of potential side effects with therapy, which may limit their use. In this review, we summarize the available evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of medical therapy of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease and ESRD patients. We also discuss the data on new emerging therapies, including PCSK9i, SGLT2i, GLP1 receptor agonists, and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which show promise at reducing risk of cardiovascular events in the chronic kidney disease population and may offer additional treatment options. Overall, dedicated studies directly evaluating chronic kidney disease patients, particularly those with advanced chronic kidney disease and ESRD, are greatly needed to establish the optimal medical therapy for coronary artery disease and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a potent risk factor for coronary artery disease and premature death. However, the optimal strategies for revascularization versus medical management remain unclear. Charytan et al. address this knowledge gap with a well-structured individual patient meta-analysis. We discuss the implications of their findings for patients with moderate CKD and highlight the need for randomized, controlled trials on this issue in more severe CKD.

### Implications of new hypertension guidelines in the United States [^115htGAR]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association Task Force released a scientific statement in 2007 for the treatment of hypertension in the prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). These guidelines recommend more aggressive control of blood pressure (BP) among those at high risk for CAD: individuals with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure, or a 10-year Framingham risk score ≥ 10%. These individuals are advised to maintain a BP < 130/80 mm Hg. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at an increased risk of CAD using the updated task force guidelines. We used a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 participants. Participants were 24 989 adults aged 18 to 85 years. Using the old definition of hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg), 98 million (21%) Americans have hypertension. Using the updated guidelines, an additional 52 million (11%) American adults now have elevated BP requiring treatment, for a total of 150 million adults (32%). Adults with diabetes mellitus have the greatest population burden of uncontrolled BP (50.6 million), followed by adults with chronic kidney disease (43.7 million) and cardiovascular disease (43.3 million). Although individuals at a higher risk for CAD are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertension medication, they are less likely to have their BP under control. Additional efforts are needed in the treatment of elevated BP, especially among individuals with an increased risk of CAD.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115uwout]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider preferring initial management with an invasive strategy in patients with CKD presenting with acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levels of angina, LV systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease.

### Management of heart failure and coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111noe8q]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the mortality and morbidity of patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD). Heart failure and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are both highly prevalent in this population. The diagnosis of myocardial dysfunction is usually based on echocardiography. As in the general population, systolic dysfunction is treated with a combination of diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockade, and beta-receptor antagonists. Diastolic dysfunction is best managed by eliminating the cause. Non-invasive tests for coronary artery disease (CAD) may be less reliable in patients with renal disease compared with nonuremic patients. Medical therapy of IHD in this population is generally similar to that for other patient groups, but surgical revascularization appears to carry a higher risk of complications with poorer clinical outcomes. The choice of revascularization procedure (coronary artery bypass grafting versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) should be based on the specific coronary anatomy of a given patient as well as a consideration of other comorbid factors.

### Chronic kidney disease: effects on the cardiovascular system [^116vDuun]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Accelerated cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication of renal disease. Chronic kidney disease promotes hypertension and dyslipidemia, which in turn can contribute to the progression of renal failure. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of renal failure in developed countries. Together, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are major risk factors for the development of endothelial dysfunction and progression of atherosclerosis. Inflammatory mediators are often elevated and the renin-angiotensin system is frequently activated in chronic kidney disease, which likely contributes through enhanced production of reactive oxygen species to the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in chronic kidney disease. Promoters of calcification are increased and inhibitors of calcification are reduced, which favors metastatic vascular calcification, an important participant in vascular injury associated with end-stage renal disease. Accelerated atherosclerosis will then lead to increased prevalence of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Consequently, subjects with chronic renal failure are exposed to increased morbidity and mortality as a result of cardiovascular events. Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease are major considerations in the management of individuals with chronic kidney disease.

### Impact of heart failure and chronic kidney disease on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing coronary angiography: results from the Finnish kardio multicentre registry [^117NsqNe]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a cardiovascular disease (CVD) which affects over 64 million people globally and remains a major public health concern. Its prevalence is rising due to aging populations and increasing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease (CAD). HF is a key driver of hospitalizations and healthcare costs. It substantially increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including all‐cause mortality, despite improvements in treatment. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects around 10% of adults worldwide and is similarly associated with growing public health and clinical burdens. Often coexisting with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, CKD accelerates CVD progression and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and mortality. Cardiovascular complications remain the leading cause of death in CKD patients; it has been reported that 50% of deaths from CKD are linked to CVD. This highlights the need for integrated risk assessment.

In the context of CAD, both HF and CKD are prevalent comorbid conditions that independently confer an elevated risk of adverse outcomes. Several studies have shown that patients with HF undergoing invasive coronary angiography (ICA) are at increased risk for mortality, likely due to compromised cardiac function and limited physiological reserve. Similarly, impaired renal function has been associated with increased risk of post‐procedural complications and long‐term mortality among patients undergoing ICA. While the individual prognostic implications of HF and CKD in cardiac patients are well recognized, evidence on their combined impact is relatively sparse. Some studies have suggested that the coexistence of HF and CKD exerts a synergistic effect on cardiovascular risk, likely due to overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms such as neurohormonal activation, hemodynamic overload, and systemic inflammation. However, limited data are available on the interplay between HF, CKD, and all‐cause mortality in patients undergoing ICA, particularly in contemporary clinical cardiology settings.

Studying this high‐risk cohort is both clinically and scientifically justified. Patients referred for coronary angiography typically present with advanced cardiovascular risk profiles and are at elevated risk for adverse outcomes. This clinical context provides a valuable opportunity to examine the independent and combined effects of HF and CKD, particularly as the severity of underlying CAD can be objectively assessed through angiographic findings. Given the frequent coexistence of HF and CKD in this population, a better understanding of how these conditions contribute to long‐term mortality may help to inform patient management and guide future research. Using data from the ongoing multicentre Finnish coronary angiography registry — the Kardio study — we aimed to evaluate the separate and combined associations of HF and CKD with all‐cause mortality in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease [^111KGr12]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit an increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with its manifestations coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The presence of both, CVD and CKD has a major impact on the prognosis of patients. This association likely reflects the involvement of several pathophysiological mechanisms, including shared risk factors (e.g. diabetes and hypertension), as well as other factors such as inflammation, anaemia, volume overload, and the presence of uraemic toxins. Identifying and characterizing CKD is crucial for appropriate CVD risk prediction. Mitigating CVD risk in patients with CKD mandates a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiologists, nephrologists, and other health care professionals. The present State-of-the-Art Review addresses the current understanding on the pathophysiological link between CVD and CKD, clinical implications and challenges in the treatment of these patients.

Hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and cardiovascular (CV) risk — scope and implications: Not all HMOD features are included in the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), HMOD is common and often undetected, and multiple HMODs further increase CV risk; therefore, inclusion of HMOD assessment is important to help identify high-risk or very-high-risk hypertensive patients who might otherwise be misclassified, particularly with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) with albuminuria or proteinuria, or arterial stiffening.

### The scope of coronary heart disease in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112Fr295]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 13% of the U.S. population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Once renal replacement therapy became available, it became apparent that the mode of death of patients with advanced CKD was more likely than not related to cardiovascular compromise. Further observation revealed that such compromise was related to myocardial disease (related to hypertension, stiff vessels, coronary heart disease, or uremic toxins). Early on, the excess of cardiovascular events was attributed to accelerated atherosclerosis, inadequate control of blood pressure, lipids, or inflammatory cytokines, or perhaps poor glycemia control. In more recent times, outcome research has given us further information that relates even lesser degrees of renal compromise to an excess of cardiovascular events in the general population and in those with already present atherosclerotic disease. As renal function deteriorates, certain physiologic changes occur (perhaps due to hemodynamic, inflammatory, or metabolic changes) that decrease oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by virtue of anemia, make blood vessels stiffer by altering collagen or through medial calcinosis, raise the blood pressure, increase shearing stresses, or alter the constituents of atherosclerotic plaque or the balance of thrombogenesis and thrombolysis. At further levels of renal dysfunction, tangible metabolic perturbations are recognized as requiring specific therapy to reduce complications (such as for anemia and hyperparathyroidism), although outcome research to support some of our current guidelines is sorely lacking. Understanding the process by which renal dysfunction alters the prognosis of cardiac disease might lead to further methods of treatment. This review will outline the relationship of CKD to coronary heart disease with respect to the current understanding of the traditional and nontraditional risk factors, the role of various imaging modalities, and the impact of coronary revascularization on outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^116Nu5Wm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 13% of the US population. 1 Although a significant proportion of these patients progress to end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) 2 or renal transplantation, cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of mortality and accounts for 53% of all deaths with a known cause in patients on dialysis. 3 Critically, cardiovascular disease also remains the leading cause of death after renal transplantation. Appropriate management of cardiovascular disease in this very high‐risk population is of paramount importance.

Pathobiological processes that underpin the progression and severity of cardiovascular disease in CKD include accelerated atherosclerosis and continuous reduction in left ventricular (LV) function as renal function declines. 1 While on hemodialysis, these processes accelerate. Importantly, the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) also rises proportionately to the duration of hemodialysis. 4 In contrast to dialysis, renal transplantation can help prevent the progression of pathological cardiovascular processes. Renal transplantation can potentially reverse myocardial damage that is thought to result from prolonged exposure to uremic toxins and improve LV systolic function. 5, 6, 7

In this review, we provide a contemporary overview of the pre‐ and perioperative cardiovascular evaluation of patients with ESRD who are considered suitable candidates for renal transplantation. In addition, we review the evidence‐based guidelines on optimal management of cardiovascular disease in patients with advanced CKD with particular focus on coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), valvular disease, and PH. The overall aim is to identify the subset of patients who may maximally benefit from renal transplantation. Finally, we provide evidence‐based recommendations for diagnosis, management, and application in clinical practice.

### Impact of practice facilitation in primary care on chronic disease care processes and outcomes: a systematic review [^116AyV2C]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

More than 100 million individuals in the United States have been diagnosed with a chronic disease, yet chronic disease care has remained fragmented and of inconsistent quality. Improving chronic disease management has been challenging for primary care and internal medicine practitioners. Practice facilitation provides a comprehensive approach to chronic disease care. The objective is to evaluate the impact of practice facilitation on chronic disease outcomes in the primary care setting.

Methods

This systematic review examined North American studies from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (database inception to August 2017). Investigators independently extracted and assessed the quality of the data on chronic disease process and clinical outcome measures. Studies implemented practice facilitation and reported quantifiable care processes and patient outcomes for chronic disease. Each study and their evidence were assessed for risk of bias and quality according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the Grade Collaboration tool.

Results

This systematic review included 25 studies: 12 randomized control trials and 13 prospective cohort studies. Across all studies, practices and their clinicians were aware of the implementation of practice facilitation. Improvements were observed in most studies for chronic diseases including asthma, cancer (breast, cervical, and colorectal), cardiovascular disease (cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease), and type 2 diabetes. Mixed results were observed for chronic kidney disease and chronic illness care.

Discussion

Overall, the results suggest that practice facilitation may improve chronic disease care measures. Across all studies, practices were aware of practice facilitation. These findings lend support for the potential expansion of practice facilitation in primary care. Future work will need to investigate potential opportunities for practice facilitation to improve chronic disease outcomes in other health care settings (e.g., specialty and multi-specialty practices) with standardized measures.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. A clinical update from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^116Cfp1m]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, and the presence of CKD worsens outcomes of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CKD is associated with specific risk factors. Emerging evidence indicates that the pathology and manifestation of CVD differ in the presence of CKD. During a clinical update conference convened by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), an international group of experts defined the current state of knowledge and the implications for patient care in important topic areas, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden cardiac death. Although optimal strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of these complications likely should be modified in the presence of CKD, the evidence base for decision making is limited. Trials targeting CVD in patients with CKD have a large potential to improve outcomes.

Screening for asymptomatic hypertension-mediated target organ damage — despite clinically sound concerns and routine screening for asymptomatic cardiovascular disease and kidney disease by many general practitioners, there is a paucity of evidence to support this practice; future studies are needed to evaluate cost effectiveness and clinical impact of routine screening in hypertensive individuals, coronary artery calcification score carries prognostic value in hypertensive patients, and additional research should address whether CAC scores can direct initiation of antihypertensive therapy and dictate individualization of blood pressure management and goals.

### Management of coronary artery disease in end-stage renal disease [^115K6kDi]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Despite a substantial number of patients with end-stage renal disease who have coronary artery disease, the comparative effectiveness of revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention remain unclear. Innovations in the field of coronary artery revascularization and concomitant changes in the standard of practice have improved outcomes in general. However, meaningful clinical decision-making remains difficult because it requires clinicians to extrapolate evidence derived from studies in the general population to patients with kidney disease for whom there is limited information from intervention trials. In non-randomized studies, this high-risk population for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality appear to derive substantial benefits from coronary revascularization. However, specific treatment decisions are often made based upon individual circumstances and contexts that are not well captured in these studies. This article reviews the available evidence, and its limitations, for deciding between various revascularization strategies for patients with end-stage renal disease. Several considerations that arise while making such decisions are discussed.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Ud1Ri]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus — management of comorbidities in heart failure (HF) notes that patients with HF, particularly older patients, frequently have other cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV comorbidities that affect their prognosis, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, anemia/iron deficiency, sleep disorders, and chronic lung disease. The presence of multiple chronic conditions is associated with increased symptom burden, may contribute to progression of underlying disease, and often plays a role in a large proportion of hospitalizations in patients with HF. Given the complex relationships between HF and many conditions, it is challenging to outline specific recommendations, additional evidence and large-scale trial data are needed, and appropriate referral to clinicians with experience treating various comorbidities is a particularly important aspect of management. Specific management recommendations can be made in some situations; Table 15 classifies comorbidities between CV and non-CV processes and provides guidance, and 3 conditions that deserve particular mention are diabetes, viral respiratory infections, and anemia/iron deficiency. For diabetes, it is common and strongly associated with both incident HF and adverse clinical outcomes and is closely linked to hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease; treatment of patients with T2D with SGLT inhibitors improves glycemic control and also significantly reduces HF events in patients with established CV disease or CV risk factors.

### Comparative analysis of the effect of renal function on the spectrum of coronary artery disease [^115869oa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to assess the differential effect of renal impairment across the spectrum of patients with ischaemic heart disease and to study if any established risk factors may modify this risk.

Methods

A total of 2013 patients who underwent revascularization for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or invasive physiology assessment were included. Renal impairment was defined as glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. Clinical endpoints were prospectively collected, and the primary endpoint was defined as the composite endpoints of death, myocardial infarction, and unplanned revascularization.

Results

593 (30%) presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and 1362 (70%) stable patients had invasive ischaemia assessment which resulted in 37% receiving revascularization and 63% being deferred. Renal impairment was associated with increased adverse events in myocardial infarction [HR 1.77 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.74)], but not in the revascularized stable group [(HR 1.14 (95% CI 0.62 to 2.08)] or the deferred group [HR 1.31 (95% CI 0.84 to 2.03)]. There was an exponential increase in the future risk in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with severe renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate < 30) compared to a linear relationship in stable patients. Age and hypertension were the only two factors that had a differential impact across three groups (P < 0.05 for interactions), with inconsistent directional effect of hypertension between medically managed and revascularized groups.

Conclusions

The magnitude of risk of renal impairment varies according to the clinical presentation of coronary artery disease with more weighted risk in myocardial infarction compared to stable patients.

### Dialysis initiation in patients with chronic coronary disease and advanced chronic kidney disease in ISCHEMIA-CKD [^111c2mD7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background In participants with concomitant chronic coronary disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effect of treatment strategies on the timing of dialysis initiation is not well characterized. Methods and Results In ISCHEMIA-CKD (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease), 777 participants with advanced CKD and moderate or severe ischemia were randomized to either an initial invasive or conservative management strategy. Herein, we compare the proportion of randomized participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD at baseline (n = 362) who initiated dialysis and compare the time to dialysis initiation between invasive versus conservative management arms. Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, we also sought to identify the effect of invasive versus conservative chronic coronary disease management strategies on dialysis initiation. At a median follow-up of 23 months (25th-75th interquartile range, 14–32 months), dialysis was initiated in 18.9% of participants (36/190) in the invasive strategy and 16.9% of participants (29/172) in the conservative strategy (P = 0.22). The median time to dialysis initiation was 6.0 months (interquartile range, 3.0–16.0 months) in the invasive group and 18.2 months (interquartile range, 12.2–25.0 months) in the conservative group (P = 0.004), with no difference in procedural acute kidney injury rates between the groups (7.8% versus 5.4%; P = 0.26). Baseline clinical factors associated with earlier dialysis initiation were lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio [HR] associated with 5-unit decrease, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.72–2.56]; P < 0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.28–4.13]; P = 0.005), hypertension (HR, 7.97 [95% CI, 1.09–58.21]; P = 0.041), and Hispanic ethnicity (HR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.22–4.47]; P = 0.010). Conclusions In participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD in ISCHEMIA-CKD, randomization to an invasive chronic coronary disease management strategy (relative to a conservative chronic coronary disease management strategy) is associated with an accelerated time to initiation of maintenance dialysis for kidney failure.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^114HvBeK]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Next, we assessed the adults who qualified for treatment with one or more antihypertensive agents on the basis of the current guidelines and the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines but were not receiving treatment ("non-treatment"). This included all patients with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher in both guidelines. In addition, in the ACA/AHA guidelines, those with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg were also candidates for treatment if they were in one or more high risk group: age 65 years or above, a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (defined as history of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, or reported coronary heart disease), chronic kidney disease (based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 60 mL/kg/h calculated using serum creatinine and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation), diabetes (defined as hemoglobin A 1c > 6.5% or self reported history of diabetes), or an expected 10 year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of 10% or greater (defined using the pooled cohort equations). Finally, we assessed the number of patients who would be considered "under-treated", on the basis of being above the treatment targets defined in the older JNC-8 guidelines and the recent guidelines. In JNC-8, treatment thresholds for hypertension were set at below 150/90 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or above without diabetes or chronic kidney disease and below 140/90 mm Hg for all others. In the ACC/AHA guidelines, treatment targets were set at 130/80 mm Hg for all patients. We used survey analyses with patient level weights to obtain national estimates for both the US and China.

All statistical tests were two sided, and the level of significance was set at an α of 0.05. The study was reported in accordance with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations, and the corresponding checklist is included in the online supplement.

Reperfusion and revascularization for coronary heart disease — acute ischemic syndromes: Management of acute myocardial infarction is similar for patients with and without diabetes, and reperfusion therapies for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are the standard of care because major adverse cardiovascular events and deaths are reduced. Coronary artery reperfusion may use either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy; where acute PCI is readily available with expert prompt intervention (within 90 minutes of first medical contact) it provides superior results versus fibrinolysis. When acute PCI is not available, fibrinolysis should be used as the initial treatment strategy (within 12 hours of symptom onset) if contraindications do not exist, including history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head or facial trauma, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months; uncontrolled hypertension; bleeding diathesis; or aortic dissection. For acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), medical management including aspirin, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, β-blockers, and ACE inhibition are indicated, usually along with coronary angiography and PCI. Evidence to guide treatment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is sparse; despite high risk, those with CKD are less likely to receive reperfusion or other recommended therapies, but when recommended therapies have been given to people with CKD, risk of death was decreased in observational studies; data for the subset with both diabetes and CKD do not exist.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^113vsxev]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adultsprovides blood pressure (BP) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, initiation of antihypertensive treatment, and targets for BP control. Compared with recommendations from the 2014 report from the expert panel, composed of members appointed to the intended Eighth Joint National Committeeand the 2003 Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), notable differences in definitions exist (Table 1).

Table 1
BP Levels to Define Hypertension, Recommend Antihypertensive Therapy, and Provide Treatment Goals, According to the ACC/AHA Guideline, 2014 Expert Panel Report, and JNC7

First, the ACC/AHA guideline uses a lower systolic and diastolic BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg to define hypertension, compared with 140/90 mm Hg used by the previous 2014 expert panel report and JNC7. Although all 3 documents recommend the use of antihypertensive therapy in those with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, the most recent guideline also recommends therapy for individuals with a BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and either a 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 10% or high‐risk comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, heart failure [HF], diabetes, or chronic kidney disease). Based in part on data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a more aggressive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in all adults. In contrast, the 2014 expert panel report recommends a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for all except those aged > 60 years, for whom a target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended. Similarly, the JNC7 set a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for the general population, reserving a more intensive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Impact of adherence to guideline-directed prevention strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus following acute coronary syndrome: a 3-year cohort study [^113TYF5d]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to emphasize that our adherence assessment was indication‐specific, particularly for ACEi/ARB therapy. ACEi/ARB adherence should only be assessed in patients with appropriate indications, such as those with hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. In this cohort, ACEi/ARB use was associated with improved outcomes, but this relationship is context‐dependent, emphasizing the need to consider patient‐specific factors, such as blood pressure status or heart failure, when evaluating adherence. In particular, ACEi/ARB therapy has well‐documented benefits in patients with heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, reinforcing the importance of assessing adherence in these clinically relevant subgroups.

Our risk factor analysis identified several high‐risk clinical phenotypes that were associated with worse outcomes. Heart failure, elevated HbA1c levels, anemia, and reduced LVEF% were significant predictors of rehospitalization, consistent with prior studies emphasizing the prognostic value of these clinical parameters in patients with ACS. Similarly, heart failure and poor glycemic control were strongly associated with increased mortality. This suggests that risk stratification tools incorporating these variables could help identify patients requiring more intensive monitoring and management strategies. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive management strategies addressing heart failure symptoms and glycemic control to improve outcomes in this patient population.

Despite the overall improvements in adherence and outcomes, adherence to certain preventive measures, such as smoking cessation and physical activity, showed minimal change over the follow‐up period. This highlights a critical gap in current secondary prevention strategies and suggests that standard counseling approaches may be insufficient for these behavioral domains. These findings highlight the persistent challenges in modifying lifestyle behaviors, which have been documented in prior research. Our data support the need for novel approaches such as personalized counseling and behavioral therapies may be necessary to achieve meaningful improvements in these domains.

Our study primarily aimed to classify patients into adherence groups to assess the overall impact of adherence to preventive measures. However, identifying the independent contributions of each preventive measure in reducing mortality and rehospitalization could provide valuable insights for optimizing patient management. Further analyses are warranted to determine which of these measures exert the most significant influence on clinical outcomes.

### Optimal treatment strategies in patients with chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease [^111Ta1ET]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and is associated with an increase in adverse outcomes. However, the optimal treatment strategies for patients with chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease are yet to be defined.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched for studies including at least 100 patients with chronic kidney disease (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or on dialysis) and coronary artery disease treated with medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery and followed for at least 1 month and reporting outcomes. The outcome evaluated was all-cause mortality. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the outcomes with revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery) when compared with medical therapy alone. In addition, outcomes with percutaneous coronary intervention vs coronary artery bypass surgery were evaluated.

Results

The search yielded 38 nonrandomized studies that enrolled 85,731 patients. Revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery) was associated with lower long-term mortality (mean 4.0 years) when compared with medical therapy alone (relative risk [RR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.87), driven by lower mortality with percutaneous coronary intervention vs medical therapy and coronary artery bypass surgery vs medical therapy. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with a higher upfront risk of death (RR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.47–2.24) but a lower long-term risk of death (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.98) when compared with percutaneous coronary intervention.

Conclusions

In chronic kidney disease patients with coronary artery disease, the current data from nonrandomized studies indicate lower mortality with revascularization, via either coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, when compared with medical therapy. These associations should be tested in future randomized trials.

TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN CKD

Initiation of treatment

The 2023 ESH Guidelines recommend that in patients aged 18–79 years, the office threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 140 mmHg for SBP and/or 90 mmHg for DBP (CoR I, LoE A). The exception to this rule is adult patients with a history of CVD, predominantly coronary artery disease, in whom drug treatment should be initiated in the high-normal BP range (SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg) (CoR I, LoE A). Nephrologists should note that many patients with CKD are falling in the latter category. In patients ≥ 80 years old, the recommended office SBP threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 160 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A), but a lower SBP threshold of 140–159 mmHg may be considered (CoR II, LoE B).

Treatment targets

The 2023 ESH Guidelines offer a detailed discussion on the issue of the best (most protective) BP targets in patients with CKD, including those with CKD and diabetes mellitus (DM), recognizing that for more than a decade, there has been considerable debate in the scientific literature in this field. Old observational data suggested an association between BP and the risk for kidney failure, starting from a SBP level of > 120 mmHg. More recent data from China obtained in CKD patients without antihypertensive therapy followed prospectively for 5 years indicated that a BP > 130/90 mmHg was associated with a significantly increased risk of CV and kidney outcomes. However, RCT evidence to fully delineate the target BP in CKD is missing; ideally, this would be an RCT comparing different BP targets (i.e. SBP < 140 vs < 130 mmHg), including a CKD population with an appropriate mixture of kidney function levels, albuminuria levels and etiology, achieving corresponding BP levels during follow-up and being powered to investigate CV outcomes, hard kidney outcomes and mortality.

### New kidneys, old risks: cardiovascular challenges after transplantation [^116rLJPP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplantation markedly improves survival and quality of life in patients with kidney failure, yet cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality. The review underscores the urgent need for transplant-specific cardiovascular research, personalized therapeutic strategies including precision medicine, and greater inclusion of women in research. Optimizing cardiovascular outcomes in KTRs will require multidisciplinary collaboration, rigorous evidence generation, and an integrated approach to risk prediction, prevention, and treatment.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^114TyMDh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective

The available literature and results of recent clinical studies and meta-analyses suggest that the primary BP goal in patients with established coronary artery disease is below 140/90 mmHg. Control of BP < 130/80 mmHg but not < 120/70 mmHg is reasonable for hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease, whereas for those with CTO or acute coronary syndromes, an ideal BP target may be somewhat higher (< 140/90 mmHg) as recommended by the current guidelines. Caution is advised with aggressive lowering of diastolic BP to a critical threshold (< 60 mmHg) which may result in no benefits but rather harmful particularly for hypertensive patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease. Likewise, in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing PCI for CTO, any excessive decrease in BP (especially low diastolic BP) before restoring anterograde flow of a chronic totally occluded lesion should be avoided during the procedure, because it may compromise collateral perfusion and exacerbate ischemia in the presence of at least moderate stenosis of the PCDA. In contrast, lower BP targets might be appropriate in those patients at higher risk of stroke and other micro-vascular complications such as chronic kidney disease, but this issue requires further study.

Most previous studies concerning the BP management of type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease rely heavily on in-office BP measurement, however, ambulatory BP monitoring certainly improves baseline BP assessment and risk stratification after anti-hypertensive treatment. Recent guidelines strongly recommended the use of ambulatory BP recording for accurate diagnosis of hypertension and individualized BP target in the treatment of patients with hypertension. Notably, concurrent masked hypertension and blunt response to nocturnal hypotension are not uncommon in patients with T2DM, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. A large body of clinical evidence supports that BP lowering reduces macro- and micro-vascular complications in patients with T2DM. In future, it remains important to educate type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease for increasing their treatment compliance and guideline adherence and improving the control rate of BP goal. In addition, observational studies have demonstrated that there is often poor control of other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with T2DM. Thus, to achieve the greatest risk reduction for the incidence of cardiovascular disease, the ultimate goal of treatment should be to achieve target control of glucose, BP, and lipids.

### Impact of adherence to guideline-directed prevention strategies on clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus following acute coronary syndrome: a 3-year cohort study [^112JdpTQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sixth, ACEi/ARB adherence was assessed across the entire cohort. However, these therapies should only be considered in patients with appropriate clinical indications (e.g. hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease). Assessing adherence in patients without these conditions may overestimate non‐adherence and limit interpretability. Adherence to ACEi/ARB therapy should therefore be evaluated only in clinically relevant subgroups to avoid overgeneralization of the results.

Seventh, while SGLT‐2 inhibitors have shown benefits in patients with both type 2 diabetes and CAD, not all patients with diabetes have indications for these agents — particularly those without significant renal or cardiovascular complications. Classifying nonuse of SGLT‐2 inhibitors as nonadherence in such cases may overestimate true nonadherence rates.

Finally, the exclusion of beta‐blockers from the adherence scoring system should be considered a limitation. Although beta‐blockers are not specifically emphasized for diabetic patients due to a weaker association with glucose control and a potential link to new‐onset diabetes, they remain a Class I recommendation for post‐ACS management, as emphasized in current guidelines. Their exclusion may introduce bias in assessing the overall impact of guideline‐directed therapy in this population. This could affect the interpretation of adherence patterns and their relationship to outcomes, as beta‐blockers play a well‐established role in reducing cardiovascular events and mortality in post‐ACS patients.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease in chronic heart failure: should we intervene? [^113qemqg]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, which is also the most common cause of chronic heart failure (CHF). One-third of patients with CHF are reported to have significant renovascular disease. The presence of RAS confers a worse outcome in studies of hypertension and coronary disease, though data are lacking for patients with CHF. As the kidney is intricately involved in the fluid retention that occurs in CHF, an adverse effect of RAS on outcome would be expected. Presentations of RAS in CHF include flash pulmonary oedema, hypertension, worsening of CHF, and worsening renal function. RAS commonly progresses and may cause worsening of renal function in patients with CHF and previously stable renal function. A variety of investigations that can safely and accurately identify RAS in CHF are available, although none is recommended in current guidelines for the management of CHF. Treatment for RAS, whether for hypertension, for renal dysfunction, or for pulmonary oedema, is at the discretion of the physician due to the lack of adequate randomized controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy and safety of intervention. As it is not clear how RAS should be managed in CHF, screening cannot be advocated. Currently, a multicentre randomized outcome trial, which includes a cohort of patients with RAS and CHF, is in progress to provide answers in this area of uncertainty.

Risk

Participants reporting a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or angina on the questionnaire were deemed to have a history of ASCVD. Angina was determined using the Rose questionnaire criteria. The 10‐year predicted CVD risk was calculated using the Pooled Cohort risk equations for participants without a history of ASCVDand is described in Table S1. ASCVD risk was categorized into low risk if < 5%, borderline risk if 5% to < 7.5%, intermediate risk if ≥ 7.5% to < 20%, and high risk if ≥ 20%.

Covariates

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was determined by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate using the measured serum creatinine and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Patients were listed as unstaged if they reported kidney damage but were missing required laboratory data. Participants were deemed to have a CKD indication if they were Stage 3 or higher or Stage 1 or 2 with albuminuria. Albuminuria was defined as having ≥ 300 mg/g albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio.

Diabetes was determined if either participant reported or glycosylated hemoglobin was ≥ 6.5%. Smoking status was determined if the patient reported smoking or smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days. Activity level was determined by calculating reported weekly metabolic equivalents. Participants were determined to have adequate activity levels if their weekly metabolic equivalents were at least 500, equivalent to AHA's recommended 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Alcohol overuse was determined by average number of drinks per day, > 1 for women and > 2 for men. Relevant questionnaire responses obtained all other covariates.

Context

The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

Both original and review articles were found via PubMed search reporting on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

Conclusion

Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. Nephrolithiasis is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

### Impact of diabetes on outcomes in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction: insights from the atherosclerosis risk in communities study community surveillance [^114qKSaR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Over 37 million adults in the United States (≈15% of US adults) are reported to have diabetes, with an additional 8 million adults living with undiagnosed diabetes. It is a significant risk factor for macrovascular and microvascular complications including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease, among others. Despite a decline in cardiovascular mortality in the past several decades, diabetes continues to remain a key risk factor, with a 2‐ to 4‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular events and a 3‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Factors unique to diabetes increase atherosclerotic plaque formation and thrombosis, predisposing patients to AMI. Autonomic neuropathy may result in atypical symptoms, making timely diagnosis challenging and delaying treatment with evidence‐based therapies. The clinical course of AMI is frequently complicated and carries a higher mortality rate in patients with coexisting diabetes. A large proportion of this increased mortality may be attributable to the clustering of traditional risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes, as well as unique manifestations of diabetes such as multivessel coronary artery disease and diffuse lesions.

There has been a paradigm shift in the management of diabetes as well as acute coronary syndromes in the past 2 decades with the introduction of newer therapies and updated management guidelines. Consequently, evaluating the current demographic trends, clinical presentations, management practices, and outcomes of patients with diabetes who are hospitalized with AMI is warranted.

### National Kidney Foundation consensus conference on cardiovascular and kidney diseases and diabetes risk: an integrated therapeutic approach to reduce events [^117LcTnz]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in industrialized nations. Type 2 diabetes is a CVD risk factor that confers risk similar to a previous myocardial infarction in an individual who does not have diabetes. In addition, the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diabetes. Together, diabetes and hypertension account for more than two-thirds of CVD risk, and other risk factors such as dyslipidemia contribute to the remainder of CVD risk. CKD, particularly with presence of significant albuminuria, should be considered an additional cardiovascular risk factor. There is no consensus on how to assess and stratify risk for patients with kidney disease across subspecialties that commonly treat such patients. This paper summarizes the results of a consensus conference utilizing a patient case to discuss the integrated management of hypertension, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and heart failure across disciplines.

Materials and Methods

Guideline Contributors

To develop the hypertension guidelines, the WHO established 4 groups:

An internal WHO Steering Group to coordinate the guideline development process.
A Guideline Development Group (GDG), composed of a diverse group of primary care and subspecialty physicians who were hypertension experts, pharmacists, nurses, health-oriented academics, a patient representative, and policymakers to review the evidence and develop recommendations. The WHO selected the members of the GDG based on relevant expertise but also considered appropriate representation by region and sex. An independent methodologist facilitated GDG deliberations.
An External Review Group, composed of technical experts, representatives of hypertension patient groups, and ministries of health from low-resource countries, to provide peer review of the guidelines.
An independent contracted systematic review group that conducted the overview of reviews and summarized evidence.

The guidelines were developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. In brief, the WHO Steering Group, in collaboration with the Guideline Development Group, developed key questions and rated outcomes to identify those critical for the development of the guidelines. Conflicts of interest were handled in line with the current Compliance, Risk Management and Ethics policy and all members of the GDG were asked to fill in the standard WHO Declaration of Interest forms, which were reviewed. An overview of systematic reviews of the evidence were used to build summary of findings tables according to the Grading of recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. The Guideline Development Group developed recommendations, considering the certainty of the evidence, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, patient values and preferences, and feasibility.

Guideline Scope and Questions

Members of the WHO GDG developed an analytic framework that linked hypertension treatment to important health outcomes (Figure 1) in which 11 clinical questions were prioritized. The framework linked pharmacological treatments of hypertension to intermediate health outcomes and final health outcomes, as well as adverse events of testing. The GDG rated each outcome on a scale from 1 to 9 and indicated whether it considered each outcome critical (rated 7–9), important (rated 4–6) or not important (rated 1–3), for decision-making.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global health priority affecting 10%–12% of the population (over 850 million people) with the number of affected individuals projected to increase rapidly over the next few decades. The prevalence of CKD is higher in those over 60 years of age, as well as in individuals with increased body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. Having CKD has significant negative implications for both life expectancy and quality of life, especially as a core component of the increasingly recognized cardio-kidney-metabolic multimorbidity syndrome. The 2024 Report from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study using 2021 data shows that CKD is the 11th leading cause of death, with 1.53 million deaths, with a further 2.1 million cardiovascular deaths attributable to CKD. CKD is also expected to rise from the 23rd leading cause of disease burden worldwide in 2022 to the 10th by 2050. However, much of the kidney disease burden globally, and its impact on outcomes of other conditions, remains uncounted, therefore these numbers are likely conservative estimates.

The new 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD, 12 years on from the previous guideline in 2012, are a very welcome update which emphasize both the advancements in the fields and the remaining gaps to fill. The document is an impressive text at 198 pages with 937 references, with multiple associated documents including supplementary material, executive summary and takeaway message summaries.

The purpose of this article is not to summarize the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline but, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group of the European Renal Association (ERA), to highlight some of what is new and relevant, especially in the European context. Given the rapidly evolving and expanding field of treatment for CKD [for example, the FLOW trial data on Semaglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1ra), on kidney disease progression which was published after the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline], we chose to focus on the remaining Achilles' heel of the global push to improve CKD care and outcomes — the first step towards effective management of the disease — evaluation and risk assessment in people with CKD.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^114BZaic]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy of hypertension with separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill offers the potential to lower blood pressure more quickly, obtain target blood pressure, and decrease adverse effects. Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset adverse reactions from each other, such as a diuretic decreasing edema occurring secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions. Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of "compelling indications" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers. Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with increased risk of coronary disease includes a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or calcium channel blocker. The Joint National Committee guidelines recommend beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients who are postmyocardial infarction; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease; and diuretic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for recurrent stroke prevention in patients with hypertension.

2.2 Clinical Data Collection

Clinical data were systematically recorded using a standardized electronic data entry platform by cardiologists at the time of or immediately following the coronary angiography procedure. Information captured included demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and procedural details. Baseline demographic and clinical variables included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and histories of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m²). Smoking status was categorized as never, former, or current smoker, with current smoking defined as regular use of tobacco products within the month preceding hospital admission. Hypertension was defined by a prior diagnosis, active use of antihypertensive medications, or elevated blood pressure on admission (systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg). Dyslipidemia was defined as the use of lipid‐lowering medications or an LDL cholesterol level above 3.0 mmol/L. A positive family history of CAD was recorded if a first‐degree relative had a diagnosis of myocardial infarction or underwent coronary revascularization before age 55 in men or 65 in women. Data were also collected on clinical symptoms, including angina and functional status as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Electrocardiographic findings — particularly relevant for those presenting with ACS such as STEMI — were also recorded, alongside a history of myocardial infarction, previous coronary revascularization (PCI or CABG), stroke, and medication use.

HF was identified based on a clinical diagnosis recorded in the registry, as assessed by the attending physician according to prevailing clinical guidelines. CKD was similarly recorded based on clinical diagnosis of renal impairment at the time of hospital presentation (glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min). Although laboratory data were available for some patients, CKD classification was primarily derived from clinician‐documented diagnosis. In‐hospital variables, including the final diagnosis, details of coronary anatomy, treatment decisions, and complications, were documented. Decisions regarding coronary interventions and post‐procedural management were guided by the discretion of the treating cardiologist, following local standard‐of‐care practices. All clinical information was collected across seven cardiology centers participating in the KARDIO registry, a nationwide quality improvement and research initiative in Finland.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112Jcyqq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Evaluation for coronary heart disease — Cardiac ischemia is a predominant form of CVD leading to major complications and death in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and coronary artery revascularization procedures are warranted in some patients. To identify appropriate candidates, further diagnostic testing should be performed based on specific clinical indications (Table 2). The recommendations from the ADA and AHA apply to people with diabetes in general, and no guidelines have been developed for the subset of patients with diabetes and CKD; in the opinion of the Work Group, these recommendations reasonably can be extrapolated to most patients who have both diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4.

Methods

Data source and study population

Data were collected from the SPRINT study, which is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored trial. SPRINT was a randomized, controlled, multicenter open-label trial that evaluated the effects of standard (SBP target < 140 mm Hg) versus intensive (SBP target < 120 mm Hg) BP treatment among 9361 adults with hypertension (SBP of 130–180 mm Hg). Patients with diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, congestive heart failure, and advanced chronic kidney disease were excluded. In this study, patients diagnosed with CAD by a physician were randomized to either a standard or intensive group. Patients were followed up monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter until 5 years or closeout. Coronary revascularization was defined by self-report of a history of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. The detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in the SPRINT study.

Interventions and measurements

BP measurements were taken with the participants in a seated position using the same automatic device in an unattended office. The mean of three measurements was included in the analysis. During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, BP-lowering medications were adjusted to an SBP target of 135–139 mm Hg in the standard group and to less than 120 mm Hg in the intensive group.

Clinical outcomes and safety events

Composite events of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular death were defined as the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause death and the various elements of the composite primary outcome.

In this study, the following conditions were recorded as safety events: hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormality, injurious fall, acute kidney injury, and bradycardia. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as fatal events that first caused significant dysfunction and required medical intervention or hospitalization.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^1123eTwD]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout, the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis worldwide, is associated with cardiovascular and renal diseases, and is an independent predictor of premature death. The frequencies of obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemias, cardiac diseases (including coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation), stroke and peripheral arterial disease have been repeatedly shown to be increased in gout. Therefore, the screening and care of these comorbidities as well as of cardiovascular risk factors are of outmost importance in patients with gout. Comorbidities, especially CKD, and drugs prescribed for their treatment, also impact gout management. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the association of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia with the above-mentioned diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. Animal studies have also produced a mechanistic approach to the vascular toxicity of soluble urate. However, causality remains uncertain because confounders, reverse causality or common etiological factors might explain the epidemiological results. Additionally, these uncertainties remain unsolved despite recent studies using Mendelian randomisation or therapeutic approaches. Thus, large randomised placebo-controlled trials are still needed to assess the benefits of treating asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.

### Management of cardiovascular disease in patients with kidney disease [^115eanny]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The burden of cardiovascular disease is high in patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The presence of kidney dysfunction affects the cardiovascular system in multiple ways, including accelerated progression of atherosclerosis and valvular disease, the exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and the development of pericardial disease. This comorbidity results not only from the concordance of shared risk factors, but also from other issues specific to this population, such as systemic inflammation and vascular calcification. Furthermore, both the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive testing modalities, and the efficacy of several pharmacotherapeutic strategies, are diminished in this population. The exclusion of patients with severe kidney disease from many clinical trials of cardiac interventions raises various therapeutic uncertainties, and kidney disease itself is likely to alter the underlying cardiovascular physiology. In this Review, we discuss aspects of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients with kidney disease, and propose specific, evidence-based recommendations for pharmacological and surgical treatment.

Regarding AKI/AKD and CKD progression, the Work Group reviewed four observational studies; one study concluded there was no significant change in kidney function from baseline following an AKI during hospitalization, another found AKI during hospitalization was associated with CKD progression and all-cause mortality but not with MACE or heart failure, and a third noted AKI was associated with a composite of death, need for dialysis, or permanent kidney impairment within 90 days of sustaining AKI. Additionally, clinically significant contrast-associated AKI incidence was low, with no difference between patients with and without AKI requiring hospitalization between 4- and 90-days post angiography.

### Central and peripheral arterial diseases in chronic kidney disease: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^116yaTiz]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about 10% of all populations worldwide, with about 2 million people requiring dialysis. Although patients with CKD are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and events, they are often underrepresented or excluded in clinical trials, leading to important knowledge gaps about how to treat these patients. KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) convened the fourth clinical Controversies Conference on the heart, kidney and vasculature in Dublin, Ireland, in February 2020, entitled Central and Peripheral Arterial Diseases in Chronic Kidney Disease. A global panel of multidisciplinary experts from the fields of nephrology, cardiology, neurology, surgery, radiology, vascular biology, epidemiology, and health economics attended. The objective was to identify key issues related to the optimal detection, management, and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases, central aortic disease, renovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease in the setting of CKD. This report outlines the common pathophysiology of these vascular processes in the setting of CKD, describes best practices for their diagnosis and management, summarizes areas of uncertainty, addresses ongoing controversial issues, and proposes a research agenda to address key gaps in knowledge that, when addressed, could improve patient care and outcomes.

### Early changes of kidney function are a tell for heart disease risk [^115jaXvk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The estimated global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the adult population ranges from 8% to 16%. This includes people with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 60 mL/min) and normal. Global prevalence rates of CKD are rising as a result of aging in the global population, with more diabetes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. Classification by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), divides patients into glomerular filtration rate categories G1 to G5 and 3 albuminuria categories A1 to A3 (Figure). The heat map indicates not only increased renal risk but also increased cardiovascular risk. Twenty years ago, GO demonstrated the striking association between lower eGFR levels and higher risks of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization in a large community‐based population from the Kaiser Permanente Renal Registry. The rate of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD in people with increased cardiovascular risk is generally 10 fold that of progression to dialysis.

Figure
Current chronic kidney disease (CKD) nomenclature used by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is classified based on cause, GFR category (G1–G5), and albuminuria category (A1–A3): green indicates low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no CKD); yellow, moderately increased risk; orange, high risk; and red, very high risk. GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate. Reproduced from Cheung et alunder the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC‐BY‐NC‐ND) license.

The article by Choi and jacobs in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) seeks to address the importance of urine albumin levels together with the level of kidney function as a risk enhancer for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in participants of the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Disease in Young Adults) cohort, aged 27 to 41 years with no history of CVD, early in the natural history of CKD. They point out that the American Heart Association — American College of Cardiology 2018 Cholesterol Guideline uses only eGFR for the definition of CKD. Other groups, such as the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseaseand the 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice, include abnormal albuminuria with normal eGFR.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^115dQGQz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Controversies exist regarding the optimal blood pressure (BP) level that is safe and provides cardiovascular protection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coexistent coronary artery disease. Several new glucose-lowering agents have been found to lower BP as well, making the interaction between BP and T2DM even more complex.

Methods

With the reference to recent literature, this review article describes the potential mechanisms of increased risk of hypertension in T2DM and outlines the possible optimal BP levels based upon recommendations on the management of hypertension by the current guidelines, in combination with our research findings, for type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.

Results

The development of hypertension in T2DM involves multiple processes, including enhanced sympathetic output, inappropriate activation of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction induced through insulin resistance, and abnormal sodium handling by the kidney. Both AGE-RAGE axis and adipokine dysregulation activate intracellular signaling pathways, increase oxidative stress, and aggravate vascular inflammation. Pancreatic β-cell specific microRNAs are implicated in gene expression and diabetic complications. Non-pharmacological intervention with lifestyle changes improves BP control, and anti-hypertensive medications with ACEI/ARB, calcium antagonists, β-blockers, diuretics and new hypoglycemic agent SGLT2 inhibitors are effective to decrease mortality and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. For hypertensive patients with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease, control of BP < 130/80 mmHg but not < 120/70 mmHg is reasonable, whereas for those with chronic total occlusion or acute coronary syndromes, an ideal BP target may be somewhat higher (< 140/90 mmHg). Caution is advised with aggressive lowering of diastolic BP to a critical threshold (< 60 mmHg).

Conclusions

Hypertension and T2DM share certain similar aspects of pathophysiology, and BP control should be individualized to minimize adverse events and maximize benefits especially for patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease.

### Approach to stable angina in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115go296]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is one of the major risk factors for coronary artery disease. Both end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and advanced chronic kidney disease patients have atypical presentations of coronary artery disease (CAD) due to modifications in cardinal symptoms and clinical presentation. Data on evaluation and management of coronary artery or stable angina is limited in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients due to a limited number of trials. There are sparse data supporting either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft in advanced CKD patients.

Recent Findings

The ISCHEMIA-CKD trial to date is the most extensive prospective randomized study looking at advanced CKD patients study looking at advanced CKD stage 4/5 patients randomized to medical treatment alone vs. invasive strategy for moderate to severe myocardial ischemia. There was no evidence found that an initial invasive strategy compared with conservative strategy with maximal medical management resulted in reduced risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with advanced CKD and coronary artery disease with stable angina.

Summary

In this review, we will discuss the existing data on assessment and management of stable coronary artery disease/stable angina. And how this extrapolates to the application in advanced CKD patients awaiting kidney transplant.

Comparison of Baseline Characteristics in Patients With or Without CKD

The baseline clinical and demographic characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table 1. We categorized 12 118 patients by baseline eGFR as follows: (1) non‐CKD (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 7778); or (2) CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²; n = 4340). Patients without CKD were more commonly men, current smokers, had an unstable angina history, PCI history, higher level of total cholesterol, and higher usage of aspirin, while patients with CKD were older and had a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery bypass grafting history, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, atrial fibrillation, malignancy, congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease, higher level of triglyceride, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, and use of β‐blocker and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (Table 1).

### Optimal targets for blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: the debate continues [^113pNdkq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often an exclusion criterion for large randomized trials of the management of hypertension, clinical decision making for these patients has relied on a few small, specific studies and much extrapolation. Several blood pressure treatment guidelines have recently been reissued. This review explores the applicability of the revised recommendations to CKD.

Recent Findings

Many new publications are meta-analyses, guidelines and debates about guidelines. New data from trials are scant. Three revised guidelines (KDIGO, JNC8, KHA-CARI) recommend a target of less than 140/90. Most antihypertensive drugs are equally effective - but this rule may not apply to advanced CKD. Proteinuric renal disease is seen as an exception; all three guidelines set a target of 130/80 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (but not both) is preferred.

Summary

There is no shortage of new commentary and advice, but evidence strength and generalizability diminish as the kidneys fail and the impact of calcified vessels and salt and water overload increases. A risk-based approach to intervention may be no less valuable than targets. Clinical trials of individuals with advanced CKD will be needed to identify effective treatments and may see a resurgence of the role of spironolactone.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^1142VtCM]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In the GDG recommended guidelines (Figure 3), the evidence base for recommendation on target BP consisted of systematic reviews as well as a review of relevant trials. – In patients with comorbidity (CAD, DM, CKD), there is consistent benefit with lower targets (variable thresholds); however, data in these subgroups were imprecise and the evidence was less certain. Therefore, the GDG cautions against applying this evidence to lower-risk patients with raised BP or hypertension. Adverse events such as dizziness in intensive control group and ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease can shift the balance of benefits and harms in older individuals (those aged 65 years or older). Concern about lower adherence due to the need for extra patient and provider effort to reach lower targets should also be balanced against intensive control. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be moderate, with large benefits and moderate harms. The GDG made a judgement that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects at a treatment goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in all patients with hypertension without comorbidities and SBP < 130 mm Hg in high-risk patients with hypertension — those with high CVD risk, diabetes, and CKD. More evidence is required about treatment of those in the SBP 130 to 139 range who fall into one or more of the following subgroups: diabetes, CKD, heart failure, 65 years or older.

CVD risk assessment strategy for those without existing CVD can be based on age, sex, body mass index, BP, previous antihypertensive treatment, smoking, diabetes, and history of CVD.

Most patients with an average SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are at high risk for CVD and initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy is indicated. Although helpful, cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment is not mandatory before initiating antihypertensive drug treatment. CVD risk assessment is most important for guiding decisions about initiating pharmacological treatment for hypertension in those with a lower average SBP (130–139 mm Hg). In all adults with hypertension, it is important that other risk factors for CVD be identified and treated appropriately to lower total cardiovascular risk. Many CVD risk-assessment instruments are available. In the absence of a calibrated equation for the local population, the choice should depend on the resources available, and the acceptability and feasibility of the available CVD risk predicting tools. Whenever CVD risk assessment may impede the timely initiation of hypertension treatment and/or patient follow-up, it should be postponed and included as a follow-up strategy.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Kidney function does not modify the favorable quality of life changes associated with revascularization for coronary artery disease: cohort study [^111byv9X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), affects more than 1 in 10 adults, and more than 1 in 5 North Americans aged 65 years or older. 1 Coronary artery disease increases in prevalence with lower eGFR 2 and is the leading cause of mortality in patients with CKD. 3, 4 Among patients referred for coronary angiography, those with CKD have a higher prevalence of severe coronary artery disease, 5 often have significant coronary artery lesions amenable to angioplasty, 6, 7 and more frequently have high‐risk coronary anatomy, including left main or 3‐vessel coronary disease, compared to those without CKD. 8, 9, 10 These observations suggest that coronary revascularization has the potential to improve outcomes of patients with CKD, including symptoms of coronary artery disease.

Nonetheless, patients with CKD are less likely to receive invasive management of coronary artery disease. 11, 12, 13 The presence of CKD may discourage patients and clinicians from pursuing coronary revascularization because of the higher risk of complications after revascularization procedures, including prolonged mechanical ventilation, bleeding, stroke, and acute kidney injury. 14, 15 For example, 10% to 30% of patients with preexisting CKD may experience acute kidney injury after percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization, 16, 17 which may, in turn, further increase the risk of acute dialysis 18 or progression to end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring chronic renal replacement therapy. 19, 20, 21 Given the dramatic effects that these complications can have on health status, 22, 23 the potential associations between kidney function and changes in quality of life after coronary revascularization are clinically relevant to treatment decisions.

We used data from a large registry of patients referred for coronary angiography to examine the associations between coronary artery disease management strategies, kidney function, and changes in coronary artery disease symptoms and quality of life. Given the higher risk of complications associated with invasive coronary procedures in people with CKD, we hypothesized that improvement in health‐related quality‐of‐life (HR‐QOL) after percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization would be less impressive among people with lower eGFR than in those with normal kidney function.

### Clinical epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease prior to dialysis [^113GHuW4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Both in dialysis and in transplant patients, CVD remains the leading cause of death. There is accumulating evidence that the increase in CVD burden is present in patients prior to dialysis, due to both conventional risk factors as well as those specific to kidney disease. Of importance is that even in patients with mild kidney disease, the risk of cardiovascular events and death is increased relative to patients without evidence of kidney disease. The new classification system proposed by the National Kidney Foundation as part of the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) process describes the five stages of kidney disease, as well as those complications associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in particular cardiovascular risk factors and disease. Patients with kidney disease are deemed to be at highest cardiovascular risk. CVD, defined as the presence of either congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic heart disease (IHD), or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), is prevalent in cohorts with established CKD (8–40%). The prevalence of hypertension, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and LVH is high in patients with CKD (87–90%). At least 35% of patients with CKD have evidence of an ischemic event (myocardial infarction or angina) at the time of presentation to a nephrologist. The prevalence of LVH increases at each stage of CKD, reaching 75% at the time of dialysis initiation, and the modifiable risk factors for LVH include anemia and systolic blood pressure, which are also worse at each stage of kidney disease. Even under the care of nephrologists, a change in cardiac status (worsening of heart failure or anginal symptoms) occurs in 20% of patients. The presence of CVD predicts a faster decline of kidney function and the need for dialysis, after controlling for all other factors including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), age, and the presence of LVH. This article describes the new classification system for staging of CKD, defines and describes CVD in CKD, and reviews the evidence and its limitations with respect to the current understanding of CKD and CVD. Specifically, methodologic issues related to survival and referral bias limit our current understanding of the complex interaction of conventional and nonconventional kidney disease-specific risk factors. We identify the importance of well-conducted studies of patient groups with and without CVD, with and without CKD, in order to better understand the complex physiology so that treatment strategies can be appropriately applied.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^113U2eFJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical terms used in the consensus recommendation

ASCVD

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is defined somewhat differently across trials; however, all the CVOTs overall had similar inclusion criteria. These criteria generally included a history of any of the conditions mentioned hereafter: acute coronary syndrome or MI, stable or unstable angina, CAD with or without revascularization, any other arterial revascularization, peripheral artery disease, stroke assumed to be atherosclerotic in origin. The relevant conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis consisted of transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised for unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class II–III, arterial stenosis of more than 50%, symptomatic/asymptomatic CAD documented by imaging, chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Certain trials had included few patients without clinical ASCVD but required them to have a high burden of risk factors based on age and the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors.

MACE

In this document, three major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are considered as primary endpoints in the CVOTs:
3-point MACE: composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular mortality.
4-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina.
5-point MACE: 3-point MACE + hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) or unstable angina.

High risk of CVD

Patients with high risk for CVD included multiple risk factors for CV disease: men 55 years of age or older or women 60 years of age or older in addition to another traditional risk factor like hypertension, dyslipidemia (defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L]) or the use of lipid-lowering therapies, and smoking. Furthermore, microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) higher than 30 mg/g or equivalent]; high renal risk, which included (a) eGFR of 45–75 mL/min/1.73 m² and UACR higher than 200 mg/g or equivalent or (b) eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73 m² regardless of UACR. Participants with end-stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or requiring maintenance dialysis, history of CAD; stroke or peripheral vascular disease were excluded.

### Blood pressure and kidney outcomes in patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate: a nationwide observational cohort study [^116WXjNA]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for death and disability, including stroke, accelerated coronary artery disease, systemic atherosclerosis, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD and hypertension are closely associated with an overlapping and intermingled cause and effect relationship. Decline in kidney function is typically associated with rises in blood pressure (BP), and sustained elevations in BP hasten the progression of kidney function decline. BP control is essential for the care of patients with CKD regardless of the underlying cause. Older randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational data indicate that higher BP is a risk factor for progression of CKD, especially in patients with albuminuria.

More recently, the Systolic blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) investigated the effect of intensive BP control with a lower target (SBP < 120 mmHg) in people with cardiovascular risk factors but no diabetes. The results showed lower rates of the primary endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular events and death) in the intensive treatment group.

In people with CKD, two large meta-analyses and subgroup analyses from SPRINT also demonstrated lower cardiovascular event risk in those with an intensive BP treatment target. Whether a lower BP target also reduce the risk of kidney outcomes is not clear. In SPRINT, no positive effect was observed on kidney outcomes. Instead, patients randomized to the intensive treatment group had significantly higher rates of acute kidney injury.

In two previous trials including only patients with CKD, there was no significant difference in change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between the standard and more intensive BP-lowering target, except for in those with high albuminuria. However, the intensive treatment arm of these trials aimed for higher BP as compared with the more recent BP trials.

Generalizing the benefits of intensive BP targets to those with severely decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) in CKD stages 4–5 is even more difficult as these patients were excluded in the more recent trials and observational data is sparse. In a recent KDIGO controversies conference report, it was stated that specific data on BP targets in advanced stage CKD and those with severely increased proteinuria are urgently needed. Furthermore, it is also noted that very little evidence is available to guide management in older adults with nondiabetic CKD.

In our investigation, we therefore, aimed to study BP and its association with kidney outcomes in patients with nondialysis CKD stage 4–5 (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m²) and different levels of albuminuria, using a nationwide, contemporary cohort under nephrology care.

Epidemiology and general principles of chronic coronary disease (CCD) — CCD is a heterogeneous group that includes obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) with or without previous myocardial infarction (MI) or revascularization, ischemic heart disease diagnosed only by noninvasive testing, and chronic angina syndromes with varying underlying causes. In the United States, approximately 20.1 million persons live with CCD, 11.1 million Americans have chronic stable angina pectoris, and approximately one-quarter (n = 200,000) of all MIs occur among the 8.8 million persons with CCD who have had a previous MI. Despite an approximate 25% overall relative decline in death from coronary heart disease (CHD) over the past decade, CHD remains the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide and is associated with substantial individual, economic, and societal burdens. The prevalence of CCD and chronic stable angina varies by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and geographic region, and the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in both risk and outcomes is increasingly recognized. Comorbidities shape care: older age and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly coexist with CCD and raise unique considerations for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment; at the intersection with atrial fibrillation (AF), new information informs use of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and as CCD and cancer survival improve, concurrent disease more often coexists with cardio-oncology emerging to address related challenges.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering less intensive BP-lowering therapy in patients with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^112u89U7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular disease processes are highly prevalent and have major negative impacts on clinical outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. Nevertheless, optimal cardiovascular management in this population remains challenging due to the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, from which this high‐risk group continues to be excluded. Encouraging data on improvement of cardiovascular outcomes after successful renal transplantation with appropriate cardiovascular workup and management highlights the urgent need for clinical trials to investigate a wide array of unresolved clinical issues related to cardiovascular pathologies in advanced CKD.

### Management of hypertension in peripheral arterial disease: does the choice of drugs matter? [^113A4qbS]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease and death are major life-threatening problems in patients with atheromatous peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This review focuses on management of hypertension in the context of cardiovascular risk in patients with PAD. PAD is underdiagnosed and hypertension in PAD is often poorly managed. Current evidence supports a low threshold for blood pressure treatment in PAD and intensive blood pressure control to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with PAD. Optimal treatment targets should be < 140/85 mmHg, with the lower target of < 130/80 mmHg in the presence of diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease. Class-specific selection of anti-hypertensive treatments in PAD should be based on caution in relation to co-existing renovascular disease and indications and contraindications based on other significant co-morbidity. There is a pressing need for primary end-point studies targeted specifically at patients with PAD. In particular, prospective studies in PAD are needed to obtain evidence for benefits from specific blood pressure classes of treatment as well as the optimal blood pressure treatment target level. These studies should consider impact in PAD of different demographic, risk factor, and co-morbidity profiles.
