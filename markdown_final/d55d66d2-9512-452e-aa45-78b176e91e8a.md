## Question

oral antibodic treatment options for hordeolum externum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oral antibiotic treatment options for hordeolum externum, also known as an external stye. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and likely microbiology of external hordeolum. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence exists for oral antibiotics in this condition. Next, I will review indirect evidence from related ocular and dermatologic conditions to infer plausible agents if oral therapy were ever indicated. After that, I need to consider guideline-based principles for when systemic antibiotics are appropriate in localized ocular surface infections. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions where oral therapy might be considered despite limited evidence.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its usual course. Hordeolum externum is an acute focal infection of the glands of Zeis or Moll at the eyelid margin, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and it is usually self-limited with spontaneous drainage and resolution within about a week, especially with conservative measures like warm compresses and lid hygiene [^1176g2NY].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for oral antibiotics in external hordeolum specifically. I should double-check whether any randomized trials or high-quality systematic reviews support oral antibiotics for external styes. The Cochrane reviews on hordeolum focus on internal hordeolum and explicitly exclude external hordeolum, and they conclude there is no evidence for or against non-surgical interventions, including antibiotics, for internal hordeolum, let alone external styes, so there is a lack of direct evidence for oral antibiotics in external hordeolum [^115keSsj] [^112A1PJV] [^1176g2NY]. Hold on, I should verify whether any included trials even evaluated oral therapy; the acupuncture review mentions an oral antibiotic arm in one small RCT, but that study is low quality, heterogeneous, and not specific to external hordeolum, so it cannot be used to support routine oral antibiotic use for styes [^1176g2NY].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence to infer what agents might be reasonable if, hypothetically, oral therapy were ever indicated. Let me consider ocular surface and periocular microbiology and treatment patterns. Common ocular and periocular bacterial isolates include Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which guides empiric coverage when needed, though external hordeolum is classically staphylococcal [^117F2f9m]. I need to check dermatologic guidance for superficial purulent skin infections; for impetigo and ecthyma, oral agents active against S. aureus (including MRSA when suspected) such as doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP-SMX are recommended, and cephalexin is reasonable when MSSA is likely, which provides a plausible oral framework if systemic therapy were ever justified in a stye [^116b6MX7] [^115SYZbY] [^112kB2T3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm when systemic antibiotics are actually indicated in localized ocular surface disease. The general principle across ocular surface guidelines is that localized, uncomplicated eyelid margin infections are managed conservatively with warm compresses and hygiene, reserving systemic therapy for extension beyond the lid, immunocompromise, or failure of local measures, and this stewardship-aligned approach is echoed in otolaryngology guidance for acute otitis externa where systemic antibiotics are not initial therapy unless there is spread beyond the canal or specific host factors, underscoring the concept that topical or local therapy is first-line for localized superficial infections [^116Tyv8V] [^113YUrtu]. I should double-check that no ophthalmic guideline endorses routine oral antibiotics for uncomplicated external hordeolum; I do not find such recommendations, reinforcing that oral therapy is not standard for styes [^notfound].

> Let me think about the risk–benefit balance. External hordeolum is typically self-limited, and oral antibiotics carry risks including gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, C. difficile infection, and contribution to antimicrobial resistance, so routine oral antibiotics for styes expose patients to harm without proven benefit, aligning with broader antibiotic stewardship principles that discourage systemic therapy for localized, self-limited infections when local measures suffice [^1145DXKd] [^113YJ7jT].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions? I should confirm scenarios where oral therapy might be considered despite the lack of direct evidence. If there is spreading eyelid cellulitis, systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or failure of appropriate local therapy after a reasonable trial, then oral antibiotics targeting S. aureus (and MRSA if risk factors or epidemiology suggest) could be reasonable by extrapolation from SSTI guidance, with options such as doxycycline, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or cephalexin depending on local resistance and patient factors, while arranging close follow-up and escalation if no improvement [^116b6MX7] [^112kB2T3] [^111aNudS]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought macrolides might be a first-line oral option because azithromycin is sometimes used in pediatric ocular surface disease; hold on, I should verify that. The pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis literature mentions azithromycin or doxycycline as oral agents used in that distinct inflammatory disease context, but that is not evidence for routine use in external hordeolum, so I should not generalize that to styes without supportive data [^113wRHud] [^116i2RA9].

> I will now examine first-line management to ensure I am not overlooking conservative care. The cornerstone for external hordeolum is warm compresses several times daily to promote drainage, gentle lid hygiene, and observation, with reassurance about the self-limited course; procedural intervention is rarely needed unless the lesion fails to drain or becomes chronic, and there is no high-quality evidence supporting routine oral antibiotics as adjuncts in uncomplicated cases [^1176g2NY].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. There are no oral antibiotic treatment options with direct, high-quality evidence for hordeolum externum, and routine oral antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated external styes; management is conservative, with oral antibiotics reserved for complications such as cellulitis, systemic involvement, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy, in which case agents active against S. aureus (and MRSA if indicated) such as doxycycline, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or cephalexin may be considered based on SSTI principles and patient-specific factors, with close follow-up and reassessment if there is no improvement [^1176g2NY] [^115keSsj] [^112A1PJV] [^116b6MX7] [^112kB2T3].

Oral antibiotics are **not routinely recommended** for uncomplicated external hordeolum (stye) because most cases resolve spontaneously or with conservative care [^1176g2NY]. Oral antibiotics are only considered when there is **significant cellulitis**, **systemic symptoms**, or **immunocompromise** [^116Tyv8V]. If needed, first-line oral options include **amoxicillin-clavulanate** or **cephalexin** for MSSA; for MRSA risk, use doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP-SMX [^116b6MX7] [^112kB2T3]. Typical courses are 5–7 days, adjusted to clinical response. Conservative therapy with warm compresses and eyelid hygiene remains the **standard of care** [^1176g2NY].

---

## Indications for oral antibiotic therapy

Oral antibiotics are **not first-line** for uncomplicated external hordeolum; reserve them for:

- **Significant cellulitis**: Eyelid or periorbital cellulitis with spreading erythema, edema, or induration.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of complications or poor response to conservative therapy [^notfound].
- **Failure of conservative therapy**: Persistent or recurrent lesions despite warm compresses and eyelid hygiene.

---

## Recommended oral antibiotic regimens

When oral antibiotics are indicated, **select agents active against Staphylococcus aureus**, the predominant pathogen [^notfound]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - MSSA coverage <br/> - Consider if polymicrobial infection suspected [^114aDtoo] |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg PO QID for 5–7 days | MSSA coverage [^115SYZbY] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID for 5–7 days | - MRSA coverage <br/> - Penicillin allergy [^112kB2T3] |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg PO TID for 5–7 days | - MRSA coverage <br/> - Penicillin allergy [^111aNudS] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 1–2 DS tablets PO BID for 5–7 days | MRSA coverage [^111aNudS] |

---

Duration is typically **5–7 days**, tailored to clinical response.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral antibiotic use

High-quality evidence supporting routine oral antibiotics for external hordeolum is **limited** [^1176g2NY]; most cases resolve with conservative measures alone [^1176g2NY]. However, in cases with significant cellulitis or systemic involvement, oral antibiotics are reasonable to prevent complications such as orbital cellulitis or abscess formation.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management remains the **cornerstone** of treatment for uncomplicated external hordeolum:

- **Warm compresses**: Apply for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily, to promote drainage and resolution [^notfound].
- **Eyelid hygiene**: Gentle cleansing of the eyelid margin with diluted baby shampoo or commercial lid scrubs.
- **Avoidance of eye makeup**: Prevent further irritation and contamination.

---

## Potential risks and side effects of oral antibiotics

Oral antibiotics carry risks and side effects, including:

- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.
- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, and rare anaphylaxis.
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Contributing to global resistance patterns [^111z8VWp].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Particularly with clindamycin and other broad-spectrum agents [^1145DXKd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize conservative management as **first-line therapy** for uncomplicated external hordeolum [^notfound]. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases with **significant cellulitis**, systemic symptoms, or immunocompromise. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) similarly recommend topical therapy as initial management for localized infections, reserving **systemic antibiotics** for cases with extension beyond the local area or specific host factors [^112G2Tdw].

### Interventions for acute internal hordeolum [^11238Lfh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is a common, painful inflammation of the eyelid margin that is usually caused by bacterial infection. The infection affects oil glands of the eyelid and can be internal or external. In many cases, the lesion drains spontaneously and resolves untreated; however, the inflammation can spread to other ocular glands or tissues, and recurrences are common. If unresolved, acute internal hordeolum can become chronic or can develop into a chalazion. External hordeola, also known as styes, were not included in the scope of this review.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nonsurgical treatments for acute internal hordeolum compared with observation or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria for this review included randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials of participants diagnosed with acute internal hordeolum. Studies of participants with external hordeolum (stye), chronic hordeolum, or chalazion were excluded. Nonsurgical interventions of interest included the use of hot or warm compresses, lid scrubs, antibiotics, or steroids compared with observation, placebo, or other active interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the references identified by electronic searches for inclusion in this review. No relevant studies were found. The reasons for exclusion were documented.

Main Results

No trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Most of the references identified from our search reported on external hordeola or chronic internal hordeola. The few references specific to acute internal hordeolum reported mostly recommendations for treatment or were reports of interventional case series, case studies, or other types of observational study designs and were published more than 20 years ago.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any evidence for or against the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of hordeolum. Controlled clinical trials would be useful in determining which interventions are effective for the treatment of acute internal hordeolum.

### A scoping review of the oral treatment options for the management of detrusor sphincter dyssynergia [^111z476S]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Muscle relaxants also showed positive effects in the management of DSD. They have a depressant action on the activity of diverse nerve cells. Regardless of their various sites of action, they lower the external sphincter resistance. They may induce overall weakness, dizziness, fatigue and malaise. All muscle relaxants related studies were published in 1980 or earlier. Since then, because of the presence of significant side effects and better treatment alternatives, the Canadian, American and European urology guidelines do not encourage the use of muscle relaxants anymore in the treatment of DSD. However, our exhaustiveness still led us to report these results.

Nitric oxyde is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the lower urinary tract. It is naturally synthesized by parasympathetic nerve cells present across the bladder and urethra and plays a role in the relaxation of the external urethral sphincter. Only one study focused on nitric oxyde and reported headache as a side effect. As of today, it is clinically irrelevant in the treatment of DSD. Because of potential side effects and medication alternatives, the Canadian, American and European urology guidelines do not encourage the use of nitric oxyde. Once again, our exhaustiveness still led us to report these results.

A study reported favorable outcomes with the combination of a cholinergic agonist (bethanecol) and nitrofurantoin, and no side effect was reported. The latter works as an antibiotic by releasing toxic metabolites of its nitro group. It is thought that the presence of a nitro group may explain why this antibiotic reduces bladder outlet obstruction caused by DSD, which translates in an improvement of voiding functions. Only one patient was included in that study, which unfortunately precludes drawing any clinical recommendation. That information still seemed relevant to be reported, as this study aims to identify every oral medication that has been used in the treatment of DSD to date.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Acupuncture for acute hordeolum [^1176g2NY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hordeolum is an acute, purulent inflammation of the eyelid margin usually caused by obstructed orifices of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid. The condition, which affects sebaceous glands internally or externally, is common. When the meibomian gland in the tarsal plate is affected, internal hordeolum occurs, while when the glands of Zeis or Moll associated with eyelash follicles are affected, external hordeolum, or stye occurs. The onset of hordeolum is usually self limited, and may resolve in about a week with spontaneous drainage of the abscess. When the condition is severe, it can spread to adjacent glands and tissues. Recurrences are very common. As long as an internal hordeolum remains unresolved, it can develop into a chalazion or generalized eyelid cellulitis. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy aimed to treat disease by using fine needles to stimulate specific points on the body. However, it is unclear if acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for acute hordeolum.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other active treatment. We also compared the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus another treatment with that treatment alone.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), three major Chinese databases, as well as clinical trial registers all through 7 June 2016. We reviewed the reference lists from potentially eligible studies to identify additional randomised clinical trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of people diagnosed with acute internal or external hordeola. We included RCTs comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment, other active treatments, or comparing acupuncture plus another treatment versus another treatment alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 6 RCTs with a total of 531 participants from China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 18 to 28 years. Four RCTs included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum with a duration of less than seven days; one RCT included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum without specifying the duration; and one RCT included participants with recurrent acute hordeolum with a mean duration of 24 days. About 55% (291/531) of participants were women. Three RCTs included participants with either external or internal hordeolum; one RCT included participants with only external hordeolum; and two RCTs did not specify the type of hordeolum. Follow-up was no more than seven days after treatment in all included RCTs; no data were available for long-term outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low, and we judged all RCTs to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional treatments. We did not pool the data from these RCTs because the conventional treatments were not similar among trials. Two trials showed that resolution of acute hordeolum was more likely in the acupuncture group when compared with topical antibiotics (1 RCT; 32 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.70; low-certainty of evidence) or oral antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 120 participants; RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.78; low-certainty of evidence). In the third trial, little or no difference in resolution of hordeolum was observed when acupuncture was compared with topical antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 109 participants; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; low-certainty of evidence). One RCT mentioned adverse outcomes, stating that there was no adverse event associated with acupuncture. Three RCTs compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments (two RCTs used topical antibiotics and warm compresses, one RCT used topical antibiotics only) versus the conventional treatments alone. One of the three RCTs, with very low-certainty evidence, did not report the resolution of acute hordeolum; however, it reported that acute hordeolum relief might be higher when acupuncture was combined with conventional treatments than with conventional treatments alone group (60 participants; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.23). Pooled analysis of the remaining two RCTs, with low-certainty evidence, estimated resolution of acute hordeolum was slightly higher in the combined treatment group compared with the conventional treatment alone group at 7-day follow-up (210 participants; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23; I² = 0%). None of the three RCTs reported adverse outcomes. Among the included RCTs, four participants, two from the acupuncture plus conventional treatments group and two from the conventional treatments alone group, withdrew due to exacerbation of symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture with or without conventional treatments may provide short-term benefits for treating acute hordeolum when compared with conventional treatments alone. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate allocation concealment, lack of masking of the outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear randomization method, and a high or unreported number of dropouts. All RCTs were conducted in China, which may limit their generalizability to non-Chinese populations. Because no RCTs included a valid sham acupuncture control, we cannot rule out a potential expectation/placebo effect associated with acupuncture. As resolution is based on clinical observation, the outcome could be influenced by the observer's knowledge of the assigned treatment. Adverse effects of acupuncture were reported sparsely in the included RCTs, and, when reported, were rare. RCTs with better methodology, longer follow-up, and which are conducted among other populations are warranted to provide more general evidence regarding the benefit of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum.

### Bacterial etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors among patients attending eye unit of shashemene comprehensive specialized hospital, shashemene, Ethiopia [^117F2f9m]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The eye is one of the sense organs in humans which is important throughout life for daily activities. The awareness given to eye health and cleanliness is essential. Dust, high temperature, microorganisms, and other factors can lead to eye diseases which may lead to loss of sight.

Although the eye can be infected, it is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes. There is disparity in the type of bacteria that colonize the eye and other parts of the body. Although the eye is remarkably resistant to colonization and infection by microbes, it is prone to infection because the lens and vitreous are avascular and protein-rich structures; thus, ideal media for the proliferation of many pathogenic bacteria. The external part of the eye is susceptible to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections. Microorganisms can also invade and damage the internal parts of the eye, which often results in loss of vision. The source of eye infection can be exogenous or endogenous. Clinically external eye infections can be presented as conjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis, canaliculitis, dacryocystitis, external hordeolum and cellulitis. The clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation of the eyes along with pus are frequently caused by bacteria. Globally, purulent bacterial conjunctivitis is mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. The microbial etiology and drug susceptibility, as well as resistance profile may differ with geographic location.

The common way of transmission of pathogens is the contact with contaminated fingers, eyelids margins, and adjacent skin, from the nasopharynx via the nasolacrimal duct, from infected eye drops or contact lenses and more rarely from the genitals or via the bloodstream. Bacterial eye infection needs immediate treatment. Treatment of bacterial eye infections involves empirical treatment with topical ophthalmic broad-spectrum antibiotic formulations that become a prevailing practice among ophthalmologists and general practitioners. This along with the irrational use of drugs, availability of antibiotics without prescription, has led to the development of resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

There are 1.4 million blind children estimated worldwide, of whom about 320,000 live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of blindness was reported to be 1.6% and about 87.4% of the cases were due to preventable causes, bacterial infection is one of them. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of ocular and periocular infections, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and associated factors.

### A scoping review of the oral treatment options for the management of detrusor sphincter dyssynergia [^1147WgYw]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.5 Nitric Oxyde

The effects of the treatment with isosorbide dinitrate was evaluated in all patients after 15 min, and showed a significant reduction of PVR. There was also an improvement of external urethral sphincter pressure at rest and during dyssynergic contraction (Table 2). Headache, low blood pressure and increased heart rate (only for 30 min, with no clinical significance) were the main adverse effects reported (Table 3).

3.6 Cholinergic Agonist and Antibiotic

Finally, the patient who first took bethanecol for 3 years did not show improvement of urodynamics during that period. However, the addition of nitrofurantoin allowed the patient to void spontaneously and with PVR under 35 ml; that treatment was thus maintained for three additional years (Table 2). That patient did not suffer from any adverse effect (Table 3).

Step 1 includes "Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis", environmental modification, dietary education "including oral essential fatty acid supplementation", medication review, "Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)", and "Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 2 additions including "Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity", Demodex therapy with "Tea tree oil or lotilaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex", tear conservation with "Punctal occlusion" and "Moisture chamber spectacles/goggles", "Overnight treatments (such as ointment or moisture chamber devices)", "In-office, physical heating and expression of the meibomian glands (including thermal pulsation devices)", and prescription drugs to manage dry eye disease (DED) such as "Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)", "Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)", "Topical secretagogues", "Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)", "Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)", "Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)", "Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway", and "Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 3 options including "Oral secretagogues", "Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops", "Platelet-rich plasma eye drops", "Blood-based products", and therapeutic contact lenses including "Soft bandage lenses with caution" and "Rigid scleral lenses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 4 options including "Topical corticosteroid for longer duration", "Amniotic membrane grafts", "Surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery)", and "Other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation)". Notes state that "One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state", that options "are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid", that "The severity and etiology of the DED state will dictate the range and number of management options selected from one or more steps", and that prescription drug use "needs to be considered in the context of the individual patient presentation, and the relative level of evidence supporting their use for those specific indications".

Fifty-two (54%) patients had asymmetry in diagnoses and slit lamp findings. Diagnoses including blepharitis, BKC, chalazion, corneal ulcer, and marginal keratitis were not associated with worse initial or final BCVA (Table 2). Corneal stromal scarring, was associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 7.3 with 95% CI [2.1, 27.2]), but not final BCVA (OR 3.7 with 95% CI[0.8, 16.0]). In contrast, superficial keratitis was associated with worse final BCVA (OR 15.8 with 95% CI[2.1, 123.9), but not initial BCVA (OR 3.3 with 95% CI[0.4, 18.3). There was no association between erythromycin ointment or topical steroids with initial or final BCVA. Oral antibiotics were associated with worse initial BCVA (OR 3.6 with 95% CI [1.3, 11.10], but not final BCVA (OR 2.7 with 95% CI [0.8, 9.4]). The number of chalazion/hordeolum surgeries was not associated with initial or final BCVA (p = 0.87, p = 0.91).

### Personalized management of dry eye disease: beyond artificial tears [^112QSkKH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments for Dry Eye Disease: Beyond Artificial Tears

The major cause of DED for each patient should be identified and therapies should be based on individual characteristics. Depending on the severity and subtype, the presence of inflammation, and the presence of external and behavioral factors that may be contributing to DED, the management of DED may be different between individuals and even different during various stages of a patient's life. The goal of management is to restore homeostasis of the ocular surface. Indeed, the TFOS DEWS II Management and Therapy Report highlights that for DED, a step-wise treatment approach is not possible due to the complexity of the disease and the variability between patients. Furthermore, management of DED may require more than one treatment and thus patient understanding of the benefits and limitations of their treatments, as well as their expectation needs to be discussed. Behavioral changes should be encouraged, for example healthier digital screen habits. For inflammation in DED, several topical anti-inflammatory therapies exist, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and lifitegrast. These therapies have been recommended as potential treatment options for both evaporative and aqueous deficient DED. For patients with MGD, additional treatment options include warm compresses with lid massage, manual meibomian gland expression, oral omega supplements, thermal pulsation, intraductal probing, intense pulsed light, and topical antibiotics, which are aimed at improving meibomian gland expressibility. For patients with aqueous deficiency, additional possible therapies include moisture chamber eye wear and punctal plugs, which are aimed at improving retention of the aqueous tear film. Importantly, eyelid disease and inflammation may need to be treated before the insertion of punctal plugs so that infection and inflammatory mediators may first be cleared. Therapies to promote tear production include varenicline solution nasal spray, external neurostimulation, and oral pilocarpine.

Patients with DED may show a mixture of clinical features, including inflammation, MGD, and aqueous deficiency. Therefore, the most prominent clinical feature may need to be considered at the start. In addition to comorbidities, possible triggering events (eg, prior surgery, medications, and contact lens use) are factored in to identify disease characteristics and shape treatment decisions. History of previous treatments can provide guidelines for new or supplemental therapies. Notably, patients may show changes in disease characteristics over time, which may require corresponding adjustments in treatment.

Follow-up after initiating various treatments is highly recommended to confirm patients are adhering to treatments as well as ensuring improvements are occurring to the ocular surface.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^115jNXbM]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation framework — recommendations versus good practice statements (GPS) and strength: Recommendations are informed by a comprehensive search for the best available evidence and a formal process for assessing the certainty of the evidence, whereas GPS are appropriate when there is an excess of indirect evidence suggesting that their implementation will result in large and unequivocal net positive or negative consequences; recommendations are associated with a certainty of the evidence in contrast to GPS. The expert panel graded the strength of recommendations (that is, strong or conditional) and these recommendations and GPS aim to help clinicians, policy makers, and patients make decisions about antibiotic use for immunocompetent adults (most typical patients) who have the target conditions; clinicians should use informed clinical judgement to identify the appropriate course of action in situations that deviate from these recommendations and GPS.

### Ocular infection and inflammation [^1123g5wo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Managing the inflamed or infected eye in the emergency setting presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the emergency physician; the causes and prognoses range from benign, self-limited illness to organ-threatening pathology. A careful history, with attention to comorbid illnesses and time course, is paramount, as is knowledge of the complete ophthalmologic examination. Much of the organ morbidity is ameliorated with prompt therapy in the emergency department and by initiating ophthalmologic consultation. In this article, the authors discuss the diagnosis and treatment of several types of eye infection, including conjunctivitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, hordeolum and chalazion, dacryocystitis, and cellulitis.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^111ZxEmb]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Values and preferences — urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: Patients often view antibiotics as a noninvasive, inexpensive option and may be unaware of the magnitude of harms associated with antibiotic use. Clinicians often encounter patients with expectations for receiving antibiotics, and this is a common reason clinicians deviate from clinical practice guidelines recommending against antibiotic use. During the panel meeting, experts discussed that antibiotics may be considered an appropriate treatment choice owing to access-to-care issues affecting many communities; for example, if a patient is visibly in pain, upset, and unable to receive definitive, conservative dental treatment within a short time, a clinician may consider antibiotics as an option, regardless of the potential negligible benefits and likely large harms. Evidence suggests that health care providers should also consider shared decision making as a way to incorporate their patients' values into treatment planning.

### Common and alternate oral antibiotic therapies for acne vulgaris: a review [^114wfhAk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extremely common disorder affecting many adolescents and adults throughout their lifetimes. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial and is thought to involve excess sebum, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Many therapeutic options exist for treating acne, including topical benzoyl peroxide, topical and oral antibiotics, topical and oral retinoids, and oral contraceptives. Oral antibiotics have been a mainstay in the treatment of acne for decades and function by exerting an antibacterial effect by reducing the follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Systemic antibiotics also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This article reviews the English language literature on the efficacy of various systemic antibiotics for treating acne vulgaris, including second-line and less historically used medications. We discuss the tetracyclines, including subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, macrolides (notably azithromycin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as treatment options for acne vulgaris.

American Dental Association guideline — follow-up and duration of antibiotic therapy: There is little to no evidence supporting the common belief that a shortened course of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance; clinicians should reevaluate or follow up with their patient after 3 days to assess if there is resolution of systemic signs and symptoms, and if the patient's signs and symptoms begin to resolve, clinicians should instruct the patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 days; prescription medications, including antibiotics, should not be saved for later use nor shared with others, and the panel emphasizes the importance of patients' discarding antibiotics safely at local disposal centers.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

American Dental Association antibiotic guideline — Question 4 scope and evidence basis for SIP with or without SAP: The question asks, for immunocompetent adults with SIP with or without SAP, whether to recommend the use versus nonuse of oral systemic antibiotics as adjuncts to DCDT to improve health outcomes. The panel did not identify any studies specific to patients with SIP with or without SAP who have immediate access to DCDT, used the same body of evidence used for Question 3, and rated down the certainty owing to serious issues of indirectness due to differing patient populations, resulting in very low certainty. For undesirable effects, the panel used the same body of observational evidence summarized above to inform harms. For values and preferences, one additional consideration was that removing the pulp tissue by means of DCDT may alleviate symptoms, and the panel hypothesized these procedures may reduce patients' expectations for receiving antibiotics.

### Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: findings and outcomes in hispanic vs. non-hispanic patients [^113wRHud]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data including demographic information, medical and ocular history, ophthalmic diagnoses, examination findings, and BKC treatments were collected at initial presentation (baseline), 6-month, 1-year, and successive annual increments until disease clearance or final follow-up. Unilateral refractive amblyopia was defined as > 2 line interocular difference in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) due to anisometropia (hyperopic, myopic, or astigmatic). Bilateral refractive amblyopia secondary to high hyperopia (> + 3.00), high myopia (< -6.00), or high astigmatism (> + 2.00) was defined as BCVA less than 20/25 in both eyes. In addition, history of eye and eyelid surgeries (e.g. chalazion incision and drainage) was recorded. BCVA for each eye was measured with age-appropriate optotypes (e.g. LEA figures, HOTV, or Snellen) and then converted into LogMAR format. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by iCare tonometry (Icare USA, Inc, Raleigh, NC) or Tonopen (Reichert, Depew, NY). Cycloplegic refraction was performed by retinoscopy and when age-appropriate fine-tuned in the phoropter. Slit lamp findings included MGD, punctate epithelial erosions/superficial punctate keratopathy (PEE/SPK) as identified by fluorescein staining, eyelid scurf, chalazion/hordeolum, corneal infiltrates, corneal neovascularization, and corneal stromal scarring. Treatments such as eyelid hygiene (e.g. warm compresses, eyelid scrubs), erythromycin ointment, topical steroids, and oral antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin, doxycycline) were recorded.

Question 2: What should be considered for further evaluation or management in this case?
A. Computed Tomography (CT) scan
B. No additional intervention is required
C. Colonoscopy
D. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan
E. Warm compresses

Answers:

A. CT scan – Correct. PCMC is often misdiagnosed clinically due to its unusual external presentation and microscopic similarity to cutaneous metastases originating from other mucinous carcinomas, such as those affecting the breast, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lungs, ovaries, prostate, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands. Therefore, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are recommended to rule out metastasis.
B. No additional intervention is required – Incorrect. Morbidity related to PCMC is primarily associated with incomplete resection. While PCMC tends to grow slowly and have a good prognosis, cases of late recurrences and metastasis have been documented. Consequently, this is not an appropriate choice. Further assessment and definitive management, such as surgical excision or radiation therapy, are typically necessary to address the condition appropriately.
C. Colonoscopy – Incorrect. Colonoscopy is typically considered in the diagnostic workup of conditions like sebaceous carcinoma when there's a suspicion of associated Muir-Torre syndrome. However, it is not a recommended step for the evaluation and management of PCMC. Instead, immunohistochemical staining can assist in differentiating tumor types.
D. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) – Incorrect. While MRI could estimate the size, location, and depth of the tumor, CT scans are recommended and necessary for assessing potential metastasis or involvement of internal organs.
E. Warm compresses – Incorrect. Warm compresses are inappropriate for PCMC management because they are typically used for conditions involving localized heat application to alleviate pain or inflammation, such as a hordeolum or chalazion in the eye.

Definitions of certainty in the evidence and strength of recommendations — levels of certainty and user-facing implications are specified as follows: High certainty is defined as "We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect"; moderate certainty as "We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; low certainty as "Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; and very low certainty as "We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect". For implications of strong versus conditional recommendations, patients: strong — "Most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; patients: conditional — "Most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". Clinicians: strong — "Most patients should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator"; clinicians: conditional — "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". Policy makers: strong — "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations"; policy makers: conditional — "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

Question 5: Is Oral Therapy Appropriate for the Treatment of Osteomyelitis, and If So, What Are Reasonable Patient Selection Criteria for Administration?

Clear Recommendation

Based on 8 concordant RCTs comparing intravenous (IV) to oral therapy, (Figure; eFigure 3 in Supplement 2) and 9 RCTs in which oral therapy was predominantly used in both arms, we recommend oral antibiotic therapy with a drug and/or dose used in published studies as a reasonable option for osteomyelitis of any type (ie, hematogenous, prosthetic, and contiguous, the latter including vertebral and DFO) for patients who: (1) are clinically stable (hemodynamically and at the site of infection, eg, no spinal instability); (2) have adequate source control (ie, not requiring further procedural drainage and without persistent bacteremia); (3) are likely to absorb oral medications from a functioning gastrointestinal tract; (4) have an available regimen used in published osteomyelitis studies to cover likely target pathogens; and (5) have no psychosocial reasons that preclude the safe use of oral therapy. There is no required minimum duration of IV lead-in; patients may be switched to oral therapy when all the above criteria are met, even at the empirical therapy stage. Specific drug options and doses are discussed in the detailed review section (Table 3; eTables 4 and 5 in Supplement 2).

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our current findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial however was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

Acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) in children — For uncomplicated acute TTO, clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, and this is a Strong recommendation. Acute refers to otorrhea of less than 4 weeks' duration, and uncomplicated refers to TTO that is not accompanied by high fever (38.5 °C, 101.3 °F), concurrent illness requiring systemic antibiotics, or cellulitis extending beyond the external ear canal to involve the pinna or adjacent skin; this recommendation does not apply to prophylactic administration of drops at the time of tube placement or prescription of drops for immediate use after tubes. Exceptions include children with complicated otorrhea, cellulitis of adjacent skin, or concurrent bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, or those who are immunocompromised; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a high level of confidence.

Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy months after the discontinuation of systemic antibiotics, and the work group's consensus suggests that such maintenance is paramount to reducing antibiotic resistance. Other attempts to limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing recommendations, such as pulse dosing and submicrobial dosing, but no alternative dosing routines consistently appear superior to standard dosing. Limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged because of the reported associations of inflammatory bowel disease, pharyngitis, C difficile infection, and the induction of Candida vulvovaginitis. While limiting the use of systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group's consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and who may require a longer course of antibiotics even while taking topical medications.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114aDtoo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Human bite wound infections — key antibiotic choices and organism considerations — include oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6 h, with doxycycline 100 mg bid as an oral option, for which the table states "Good activity against Eikenella species, staphylococci, and anaerobes; some streptococci are resistant". The text notes involvement of "streptococci, S. aureus, and Eikenella corrodens, as well as with multiple anaerobic organisms", that "Eikenella corrodens is resistant to first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and aminoglycosides", and therefore "treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem is recommended; if there is history of hypersensitivity to β-lactams, a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin plus metronidazole, or moxifloxacin as a single agent is recommended".

### Oral and intramuscular treatment options for early postpartum endometritis in low-resource settings: a systematic review [^113gJB67]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To suggest options for oral and intramuscular antibiotic treatment of early postpartum endometritis in low-resource community settings where intravenous antibiotics are unavailable.

Data Sources

Studies were identified through MEDLINE from inception through December 2014. Search terms included [("anti-bacterial agents [MeSH]" or "anti-infective agents [MeSH]") and ("endometritis [MeSH]" or "puerperal infection [MeSH]")]. A second search using the terms [("endometritis or endomyometritis or puerperal infection) and ("antibiotics or antimicrobials or anti-bacterial agents or anti-infective agents)"] was also used. Additionally, all references from selected articles were reviewed, a hand-search of a subject matter expert library was conducted, and a search of ClinicalTrials.gov was performed.

Methods Of Study Selection

We conducted a systematic review of the literature in two phases. Phase I provides a summary of clinical cure data from prospective studies of oral and intramuscular antimicrobial regimens as well as summarizes evidence from trials of intravenous antimicrobials. Phase II is a quantitative analysis of pathogens from intrauterine postpartum endometritis samples. Based on these results, and with consideration of existing recommendations for antibiotic use during breastfeeding, we suggest oral and intramuscular antimicrobial options for the treatment of early postpartum endometritis after vaginal delivery in low-resource settings.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Reports involving oral or intramuscular antimicrobial treatment of postpartum endometritis are rare and of generally poor quality. Antimicrobial trials of postpartum endometritis treatment and intrauterine microbiology studies suggest five antimicrobial regimens may be effective: oral clindamycin plus intramuscular gentamicin, oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, intramuscular cefotetan, intramuscular meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, and oral amoxicillin in combination with oral metronidazole.

Conclusion

This review provides suggestions for oral, intramuscular, and combined antimicrobial regimens that may warrant additional study. Experimental trials should consider clinical effectiveness, safety and side effects profiles, and feasibility of community-based treatment.

### Should we extend the use of oral antibiotics in infective endocarditis? The ENDO-ORAL study [^112RcDNJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching to oral therapy has become an option for treating infective endocarditis (IE) in well selected patients. This study aimed to assess its effectiveness in real-life settings, including patients who would not have been eligible in current guidelines based on the POET trial results.

Methods

All adults treated for IE in two French tertiary centers from January 2016 to December 2023, were included in a retrospective cohort. For each participant, clinical, microbiological and therapeutic data were collected retrospectively. Patients who received at least 10 days of effective antibiotic therapy, were included and categorized based on the route of administration (exclusively intravenous or with a switch to oral therapy). POET-ineligible patients were those who were not eligible in the POET trial. Treatment failure (death, recurrence, or need for suppressive therapy, within three months following completion of the initial antibiotic course) was assessed using propensity score analysis, with oral switch as a time-dependent variable.

Results

Three hundred and thirty-three participants were included (233 in the intravenous group and 100 patients in the oral group). No significant difference in treatment failure was observed between groups after adjustment using a propensity score (HR = 0.55 in favor of oral switch, 95%CI: 0.27–1.17). The results were similar in the POET-ineligible subgroup, which accounted for 44.7% of participants. Days alive outside the hospital were significantly higher in the oral group (59 vs 47 days, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Oral switch is a suitable option beyond "classical" frontiers in the management of IE, with potential direct and indirect benefits.

### Uveal lymphoid hyperplasia: treatment with combination antibiotics and steroids [^114beNBM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Established treatments for choroidal lymphoma include systemic chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies, external beam radiation, observation, oral steroids and occasionally enucleation. While oral antibiotics have been sparsely mentioned in a handful of patients with choroidal lymphoma, there are no details on the drug or dosage used, documentation of regression by OCT, short-term and long-term response, or need for additional therapies. In our search of the literature, there were no reports dedicated to the discussion of choroidal lymphoma eyes that were exclusively managed by oral antibiotics and steroids.

Our promising results demonstrate measurable and sustained responses in this small cohort of patients with uveal lymphoid hyperplasia, without systemic recurrence over 4-year follow-up. Combination antibiotic/steroid therapy for uveal lymphoid hyperplasia, including MALT/low-grade lymphomas, may obviate the need for systemic chemotherapy/monoclonal antibody and/or external beam irradiation in select cases. Cohort expansion of this relatively rare condition would further support these findings.

American Dental Association guideline — management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis: different practice patterns within and outside the United States [^112htvuu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis with intravitreal injections

The reported incidence rates of endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents range from ~0.02% to 0.3% per injection. Because most patients are treated with a series of injections, the cumulative rate of endophthalmitis per patient is higher.

Unlike the situation with cataract surgery, in which the ESCRS conducted a RCT, there are no major RCTs evaluating alternative intravitreal injection techniques. Therefore, an expert committee published guidelines in 2004and revised these guidelines in 2014. These consensus guidelines include deferring injections in the presence of active external infection, reducing aerosolized droplets containing oral contaminants, and the use of topical povidone-iodine before injection. However, these guidelines allow for substantial variability in technique, including the setting in which the injections are performed (clinic room vs operating room) and the use of prophylactic topical antibiotics. In addition, there are many other factors that may influence endophthalmitis rates for which there is no consensus, including the use of facemasks, surgical drapes, eyelid speculums, conjunctival displacement, and location of injection site (superior vs inferior, rotating sites).

### Technique and considerations when using external fixation as a standard treatment of femoral fractures in children [^114irWKi]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Femoral fractures in children can be treated effectively and with a low complication rate by using external fixation. However, as with most treatment modalities there is a learning curve to be considered. The aim of this paper is to report "tricks" and different considerations that we have learned to be of value based on experience gained during a prospective and consecutive study of 98 femoral fractures in children aged 3–15 years. Our experience is based on the use of a unilateral fixator with the option to apply axial dynamisation. Traction prior to operation is not needed if the child is operated on within 24h. During surgery a traction table will prevent significant malrotation and facilitate reduction prior to insertion of the pins. Four 4 or 5mm pins are sufficient for adequate stability in children. Transverse skin incisions are preferable for pin insertion as the scars become smaller and the soft tissue irritation during activity is less when compared with longitudinal incisions. Unrestricted weight-bearing can be allowed. A nihilistic approach to pin site care with daily showers is as effective as more aggressive treatment with local antiseptics. Pin infections can occur but are mild and can be treated locally or with a short period of antibiotics taken orally. Pin-loosening and deep infections are very uncommon. By using external fixation, malunion, overgrowth or delayed union can almost be avoided completely. Re-fractures are rare and occur only after significant trauma. Treatment time is relatively short. No physiotherapy or further protection of the leg is necessary during or after healing.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111swohR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113tyYju]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Anogenital and oral warts — surgical and other provider treatments indicate that surgical treatments (e.g., tangential scissor excision, tangential shave excision, curettage, electrosurgery, electrocautery, infrared coagulation) can be used for external genital and anal warts (BIII), and laser surgery is an option but is usually more expensive (CIII). Intralesional interferon has been used for the treatment of genital warts, but because of cost, difficulty of administration, and potential for systemic adverse effects — such as fever, fatigue, myalgias, and leukopenia — it is not recommended for first-line treatment (CIII). Podophyllin resin may be an alternative provider-applied treatment with strict adherence to recommendations on application, but it has inconsistent potency in topical preparations and can have toxicity that may limit routine use in clinical practice. No consensus on optimal treatments of oral warts exists; treatments for anogenital warts cannot be used in the oral mucosa, and given the lack of RCTs, surgical removal is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or need to be removed for aesthetic reasons. These recommendations align with the CDC STI Treatment Guidelines.

American Dental Association guideline — For patients with SIP with or without SAP, antibiotics are not required on pathophysiologic grounds, and providers in EDs, other health care settings, or rural settings should ask patients if they have access to oral health care because lack of access may make this recommendation acceptable or feasible for implementation only if expectations for an antibiotic are addressed.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^116nBBVF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of treatment effect

We will perform statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will analyse the data using an intention‐to‐treat model as discussed above.

We will express dichotomous data as the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study and calculate Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An increase in the odds of a particular outcome will be displayed graphically in the meta‐analyses to the right of the centre line, and a decrease in the odds of an outcome will be displayed graphically to the left of the centre line.

For continuous data (e.g. length of hospital stay), if all studies report the same outcomes, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups. If similar outcomes are reported on different scales, we will calculate the standardised mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We will present 95% CIs for all outcomes.

We will use time‐to‐event data to capture the mortality rate and recurrence rate as reported by the study authors.

Unit of analysis issues

The primary analysis will be per woman randomised. If we encounter any cluster‐randomised or multi‐arm trials, we will analyse the data according to the advice set out in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For cluster‐randomised trials, we will estimate the intracluster (or intraclass) correlation coefficient (ICC), either by obtaining this information from the trial data or by using an external estimate based on a similar study. We will obtain statistical support to assist us with this process. For multi‐arm studies, our approach will be to combine groups to create a single pair‐wise comparison, and we will seek statistical support with regard to the correct approach for assessing heterogeneity in this instance, depending on the specific data.

We may also choose to summarise data that did not allow valid analysis (e.g. descriptive data) in additional tables and will exclude this from meta‐analysis.

### Hinged external fixation distraction for treatment of first metatarsophalangeal joint arthritis [^115kQd8K]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment for hallux rigidus varies from joint preservation to joint destructive procedures. The objective of the present study was to report an alternative method of treatment of hallux rigidus using hinged external fixation distraction of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and to present our surgical technique. Ten distractions were performed in 9 patients (9 female feet [90%] and 1 male foot [10%]). The mean age at surgery was 41.0 (range 20 to 64) years. All patients had stage II or III hallux rigidus on the Regnauld classification system for hallux rigidus. The patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically before and after the distraction treatment. The mean period of fixation was 16.40 (range 7 to 21) weeks. Six of the patients (60%) with distraction experienced pin tract infections that were treated with oral antibiotics. The reported mean preoperative categorical pain score in 7 patients (7 feet) was 8.2 (range 5 to 10), and the postoperative score was 0.83 (range 0 to 2; p = .001). Of the 6 patients (6 feet) who responded to the remaining portion of the survey, 4 (66.67%) were very satisfied with their results, and 2 (33.33%) were satisfied with their surgical result. None of the patients required additional surgical treatment during the mean 2.2 (range 1.2 to 3.3) years of follow-up. Hinged first metatarsophalangeal joint distraction with external fixation has been shown to be a viable treatment option for joint preservation for stage II and III hallux rigidus in the short term.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^116Z9EP4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment options and guidelines

International guidelines recommend either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) as first line treatments, but with differences regarding prescribing products individually or as combination products. The NICE guideline on acne, based on systematic review and network meta-analysis comparisons of acne treatments, acknowledged uncertainty in the evidence base and recommended the options in table 2 as first-line treatments.

Topical treatments

First-line treatments for mild or moderate acne are fixed combination topical preparations containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, as outlined in table 2. It is important that patients understand that these have a delayed onset of action (6–8 weeks) and are aware of how to avoid skin irritation when starting treatment (table 1).

Oral antibiotic treatments

The NICE guideline recommends limiting oral antibiotics to 3–6 months, while other guidelines suggest a maximum duration 3 months in order to avoid emergence of antibiotic resistance. First-line oral antibiotic recommendations are lymecycline or doxycycline. If these are not tolerated or are contraindicated, the NICE guideline recommends that trimethoprim or an oral macrolide may be considered. However, clinicians report barriers to discontinuing oral antibiotics once they have been started including patients' understandable concerns about acne relapse. Monotherapy with an oral or topical antibiotic should not be used, because there is good evidence that antimicrobial resistance is significantly reduced by coprescribing benzoyl peroxide. Consensus from clinical guidelines is that continuing topical treatments as maintenance therapy after discontinuing oral antibiotics is important in reducing the risk of relapse.

Hormonal treatments

Hormonal treatments are an alternative for women with acne. Except for co-cyprindiol, hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptives [COCs] or spironolactone) have an advantage over oral antibiotics and isotretinoin in that they can be continued for longer courses.

Combined oral contraceptives

COCs remain an option for women ('off-label' use in acne). Although inferior to oral antibiotics at 3 months, COCs are equivalent to antibiotics at reducing acne at 6 months. There is no firm evidence to support the use of any one COC over another in terms of acne.

Co-cyprindiol

Co-cyprindiol 2000/35 (cyproterone acetate 2 mg, ethinylestradiol 35 µg) is licensed as a second-line treatment for women with severe acne, but is not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns about rare, but cumulative dose-dependent, increased risk of meningioma.

### Young people's perceptions of acne and acne treatments: secondary analysis of qualitative interview data [^112KQ4K4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

'I'm not sure, to be honest. Because you don't want to make it all over the counter and have everyone taking everything under the sun, especially when it's the antibiotics that tend to work. You don't want to contribute to the already prolific antibiotic resistance that we've got'.
Some participants perceived oral antibiotics as a 'long‐term treatment' that should require more supervision from their GP. They also perceived oral treatments as 'stronger' and didn't feel that their skin was severe enough to warrant use.

'Because like when you're taking tablets – you–, I didn't feel at the time that it was necessary. Because I just thought like "it's j–, it's just on my skin. I can sort it out externally". And I didn't really want to take medication'.
'I didn't necessarily want to be on antibiotics for that long period of time without feeling that like I was, had doctor who was kind of continually aware of it and since, yes since I was initiating the check‐ups that didn't really feel like that, that way to me and I kind of feel a bit more comfortable about creams than [um] pill medication'.
Uncertainty about the effectiveness of oral antibiotics

The majority of participants felt that oral antibiotics were not an effective treatment. Participants reported that they were not effective at all or they helped initially but stopped working, which they found frustrating. Participants did not attribute this to potential antibiotic resistance.

'I went back to the doctors and they put me on lymecycline again. [um] I think that's around Christmas time and it just didn't work [um] so I was a bit frustrated about that because it had once worked really, really well'.

Antibiotic safety and patient instructions — Patients should be instructed to closely monitor symptoms and contact a dentist or primary care provider if infection worsens during therapy; clindamycin carries a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal, and patients should call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d. If a patient is already taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed; if the current antibiotic is outside the spectrum, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed considering potential contraindications, and a similar-spectrum antibiotic already started can be continued, with counseling on symptoms that may indicate lack of efficacy and adverse drug events.

### Challenges of antibiotic formulations and administration in the treatment of bloodstream infections in children under five admitted to kisantu hospital, democratic republic of Congo [^111dpppz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions and data analysis.

"Antibiotic regimen" refers in this article to a prescribed antibiotic, its dose, its duration, and its route of administration. "Initial antibiotic regimens" are defined as the first antibiotic regimens that were administered to the child after hospital admission. The local guidelines of Kisantu hospital recommend intravenous ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) for empirical treatment of children with suspected bloodstream infection. Initiation of administration of more than one antibiotic on the same day was called "combination therapy". If an additional antibiotic was added to the initial antibiotic regimen without stopping the initial regimen, this was called "association". "Targeted antibiotic treatment" was defined as the antibiotic regimen administered after availability of blood culture results. For the present study, we considered the time of blood culture positivity and communication of the Gram-stain result as the time of availability of blood culture results. This choice was made because multidrug-resistant, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella was responsible for the majority of bloodstream infections in children under age 5 in this setting (unpublished data). To limit morbidity and mortality, clinicians were recommended to switch to antibiotics that were presumed to be appropriate to treat these NTS (i.e. intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin or oral azithromycin) as soon as Gram-negative bacilli were isolated. It was presumed that NTS with pefloxacin resistance (detected by on-site disk diffusion testing) had intermediate ciprofloxacin susceptibility, as was observed during external reference testing (broth microdilution for determination of ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) from blood culture surveillance studies in Kisantu until 2017. Given the lack of access to meropenem, high-dose ciprofloxacin treatment was locally recommended for intravenous treatment of NTS with third-generation cephalosporin resistance and pefloxacin resistance. Unfortunately, a posteriori, external reference testing demonstrated full ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC values 1–2 mg/dL) in most pefloxacin resistant NTS. In retrospect, the use of ciprofloxacin to treat these NTS bloodstream infections was thus not appropriate. In this article, "tablets" refer to conventional, nondispersible tablets. "Oral suspensions" were available as powder or granules for reconstitution and rarely as readymade syrup.

### Making sense of late tissue nodules associated with hyaluronic acid injections [^112AM2r9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment Options

Treatment options in the literature have largely followed algorithms centering on success or failure of simpler and more generic treatments. These have included antibiotics either separately or in combination, anti-inflammatory steroidal and nonsteroidal oral or intralesional therapies, and removal of the filler when appropriate.

Table 3 simplifies the approach to treatment centered around each of the elements (the filler, the patient's inflammatory response, and the infective element). We will illustrate this approach utilizing the following patient examples, describing the preferred approach in each scenario.

These cases were given to the consensus group with other examples. The cases chosen below were those that the group felt most closely correlated with the classification system (Table 2).

Case Example 1

A female patient presents with a gradually increasing asymptomatic swelling under each eye. She remembers having filler placed in this position, but not for many years. When the patient is asked to smile the lumps do not disappear, but in fact seem more obvious, suggesting that these are not her own fat pads but swelling in or external to her orbicularis oculi muscle. The diagnosis is the late appearance of injected filler. In this case, we would follow the advice for management of primarily filler-related nodules (Table 3). The initial approach would favor dissolution of this product with multiple sessions of hyaluronidase alone (Figure 6).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1167az7E]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern with facial lacerations is potential communication with the oral cavity, which carries a significant bacterial load. Lacerations that are confined to the intraoral cavity (including mucous membranes, the lips, and the tongue) and do not communicate with the extraoral environment do not need antibiotics. Through-and-through lacerations have been considered at higher risk for infection, and therefore antibiotics are often suggested, although this remains controversial given the limited data. There are almost no specific data to inform antibiotic prophylaxis for scalp wounds specifically, so it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the management of other traumatic soft tissue wounds. Traumatic cartilage exposure (ear, nose) has historically been treated with prophylactic antibiotics (often fluoroquinolones) in addition to local wound care due to concern for perichondritis. Fluoroquinolones have been used because pseudomonas is a common cause of all-cause perichondritis, but most of these cases are related to piercings, and it is unclear whether the trauma population follows the same microbial pattern. Evidence to support systemic antibiotics in these injuries is lacking. Thus, as above, we think a practical approach would be to risk stratify the wound and the patient and use antibiotics only sparingly in truly high-risk situations.

Nasal packing

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of nasal packing?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in the setting of nasal packing for traumatic epistaxis given a lack of data showing benefit.

Discussion: Nasal packing material is often placed when other efforts at controlling epistaxis have failed. Packing can stay in place for an amount of time varying from a few hours to many days. Infectious concerns with nasal packing include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and toxic shock syndrome. However, multiple recent studies have found routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to be neither effective at reducing infection rates nor cost-effective given the risks and complications of antibiotics. Rates of infection associated with nasal packing are very low at baseline, and cases of toxic shock syndrome secondary to nasal packing are almost non-existent from the last decade. Due to this low infection rate, the many small studies that have attempted to study the role of empiric antibiotic prophylaxis are grossly underpowered to show any significant difference.

Answers:

A. The prognosis is good, and this condition can be managed with oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting – Incorrect. This refers to the prognosis of erysipelas, which is usually managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Importantly, hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be considered in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly.
B. The 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of this condition is 80% – Incorrect. There are 4 widely recognized types of KS; however, they differ in epidemiology and prognosis. The 5-year relative survival rate for KS, which compares people with the same type and stage of KS to people in the overall population, is 80%.
C. This condition is considered a benign disease but may recur after treatment in more than 40% of cases – Incorrect. The prognosis described here is in reference to angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Although spontaneous regression may occasionally occur, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years, with recurrence after treatment in more than 40% of cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease have been associated with higher recurrence rates.
D. Although commonly misdiagnosed, this condition has an excellent prognosis once proper endodontic therapy is performed – Incorrect. Cutaneous dental sinus tract is frequently misdiagnosed due to its rarity of occurrence and lack of associated symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, definitive treatment through oral therapy to eliminate the source of infection, whether it is through endodontic treatment or extraction, is effective and provides a cure.
E. There is an overall poor prognosis of this condition, with the 5-year survival between 10% and 50% – Correct. Angiosarcomas make up less than 1% of all sarcomas, with approximately 2 to 3 new cases per 1 million diagnoses yearly. Importantly, many angiosarcomas are highly aggressive, with a 5-year survival between 10% and 50% and a median overall survival ranging from 30 to 50 months. The clinical variability of these tumors contributes to delayed diagnosis, and that, coupled with their genetic heterogeneity, makes them difficult to treat. Surgical excision with wide margins is considered the mainstay of therapy in localized disease; however, the infiltrative and satellite foci often lead to difficulty in obtaining negative margins and frequent local recurrences. Thus, a multimodal approach, which often includes radiation, is often necessary. Our patient was treated with wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiation given positive margins. He remains without evidence of disease at 2 years.

### Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention [^115p3yyb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Following surgery, incisions are usually closed by fixing the edges together with sutures (stitches), staples, adhesives (glue) or clips. This process helps the cut edges heal together and is called 'healing by primary intention'. However, a minority of surgical wounds are not closed in this way. Where the risk of infection is high or there has been significant loss of tissue, wounds may be left open to heal by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure; this is known as 'healing by secondary intention'. There is a risk of infection in open wounds, which may impact on wound healing, and antiseptic or antibiotic treatments may be used with the aim of preventing or treating such infections. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the evidence on antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It aims to present current evidence related to the use of antiseptics and antibiotics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI).

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics for the treatment of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention.

Search Methods

In November 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with a surgical wound healing by secondary intention and assessed treatment with an antiseptic or antibiotic treatment. Studies enrolling people with skin graft donor sites were not included, neither were studies of wounds with a non-surgical origin which had subsequently undergone sharp or surgical debridement or other surgical treatments or wounds within the oral or aural cavities.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction.

Main Results

Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments. The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group. There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy when treated with Triclosan post-operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds resulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when treated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over three weeks' follow-up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants. There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacym®-treated post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes healed compared to those treated with iodine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence. This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate.

### The use of oral antibiotics in treating acne vulgaris: a new approach [^111z8VWp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Although acne is not an infectious disease, oral antibiotics have remained a mainstay of treatment over the last 40 years. The anti-inflammatory properties of oral antibiotics, particularly the tetracyclines, are efficacious in treating inflammatory acne lesions. Common prescribing practices in Dermatology exert significant selection pressure on bacteria, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic use for acne not only promotes resistance in Propionibacterium acnes, but also affects other host bacteria with pathogenic potential. This review will summarize the commonly used treatments for acne vulgaris, and how they should be combined as rational treatment. The indications for using oral antibiotics in acne will be highlighted. Strategies described in the literature to conserve the utility of oral antibiotics will be summarized. These include limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy, concomitant use of a topical non-antibiotic agent, use of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline, and the introduction of topical dapsone.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following Tooth extractions [^112HWQmf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions are dental caries and periodontal infections, and these extractions are generally done by general dental practitioners. Antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection.

Objectives

To determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the development of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 25 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 25 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 25 January 2012) and LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 25 January 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. The quality of the body of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE tool.

Main Results

This review included 18 double-blind placebo-controlled trials with a total of 2456 participants. Five trials were assessed at unclear risk of bias, thirteen at high risk, and none at low risk of bias. Compared to placebo, antibiotics probably reduce the risk of infection in patients undergoing third molar extraction(s) by approximately 70% (RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.50) P < 0.0001, 1523 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 12 people (range 10–17) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is evidence that antibiotics may reduce the risk of dry socket by 38% (RR 0.62 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.95) P = 0.03, 1429 participants, moderate quality evidence) which means that 38 people (range 24–250) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. There is also some evidence that patients who have prophylactic antibiotics may have less pain (MD -8.17 (95% CI -11.90 to -4.45) P < 0.0001, 372 participants, moderate quality evidence) overall 7 days after the extraction compared to those receiving placebo, which may be a direct result of the lower risk of infection. There is no evidence of a difference between antibiotics and placebo in the outcomes of fever (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.99), swelling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.30) or trismus (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.71) 7 days after tooth extraction. Antibiotics are associated with an increase in generally mild and transient adverse effects compared to placebo (RR 1.98 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.59) P = 0.02) which means that for every 21 people (range 8–200) who receive antibiotics, an adverse effect is likely.

Authors' Conclusions

Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, there were no trials identified which evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in this group of patients in this setting. All of the trials included in this review included healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. There is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of infection, dry socket and pain following third molar extraction and result in an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to those with concomitant illnesses or immunodeficiency, or those undergoing the extraction of teeth due to severe caries or periodontitis. However, patients at a higher risk of infection are more likely to benefit from prophylactic antibiotics, because infections in this group are likely to be more frequent, associated with complications and be more difficult to treat. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria which are resistant to treatment by currently available antibiotics, clinicians should consider carefully whether treating 12 healthy patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection is likely to do more harm than good.

### Multiple asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic minute filiform papules [^112SAeWg]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option for this condition?
A. Topical cidofovir
B. Nutritional supplementation
C. Topical alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy moisturizer
D. Oral valganciclovir
E. Oral doxycycline

Answers:

A. Topical cidofovir – Incorrect. One percent or 3% topical cidofovir is an effective treatment option for trichodysplasia spinulosa, not PIDK.
B. Nutritional supplementation – Incorrect. Nutritional supplementation would be warranted in cases of phrynoderma.
C. Topical alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy moisturizer – Correct. Due to the asymptomatic nature of PIDK lesions, treatment is optional per patient preference. Treatment includes a topical alpha-hydroxy or beta-hydroxy moisturizer, a keratolytic that alters corneocyte cohesion, leading to exfoliation of the hyperkeratosis. It has been postulated that treatments used for porokeratosis including topical vitamin D analogs, retinoids, and topical lovastatin/cholesterol could be trialed in refractory cases; 2% salicylic acid ointment was prescribed in 1 case which led to the resolution of the condition. Our patient failed to respond to topical tretinoin, 6% salicylic acid cream, and topical alpha-hydroxy moisturizer. Subsequently, she elected to monitor.
D. Oral valganciclovir – Incorrect. Oral valganciclovir would be an effective treatment option for trichodysplasia spinulosa, not PIDK.
E. Oral doxycycline – Incorrect. PIDK is not an infectious process and, thus, would not necessitate antibiotic therapy.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^115D5fTV]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic use for pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain — effects on pain and analgesic use over up to 7 days are uncertain: of 1,000 people taking antibiotics, anywhere from 49 fewer through 100 more people may experience pain (low certainty), and those taking antibiotics also may have one-half of an ibuprofen tablet less and 2 more rescue analgesic tablets than those who did not take antibiotics over 7 days (low certainty); we identified no randomized controlled trials meeting our selection criteria that reported undesirable effects.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^112e95Eo]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Management — detection and clinical suspicion are emphasized. Detection and appropriate treatment can reduce signs and symptoms of blepharitis, and in severe cases it can prevent permanent structural damage and possible vision loss. This is particularly important in children, in whom chronic blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is often unrecognized and can be more severe, and it should be suspected in a child with recurrent conjunctivitis, keratitis, neovascularization, eyelid inflammation, hordeolum, chalazia, corneal opacification, and amblyopia. The presentation can be asymmetric and is often confused with herpetic disease. Tear film break-up time using fluorescein is significantly shorter in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), even if aqueous tear production is normal, which suggests that meibomian gland secretions are important in maintaining a stable precorneal tear film.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111pzb6t]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — treatment of genital warts in adults and adolescents with HIV: Patient-applied options for uncomplicated external warts include topical imiquimod 5% cream applied at bedtime on three nonconsecutive nights per week for up to 16 weeks with wash-off 6–10 hours after application (BII), topical podophyllotoxin (e.g., podofilox 0.5% solution or 0.5% gel) applied twice a day for 3 days followed by 4 days off and repeated weekly for up to four cycles (BIII), topical sinecatechins 15% ointment applied three times a day for up to 16 weeks until warts are cleared (BIII), or topical cidofovir 1% used daily for 5 days per week for 6 weeks (CIII). Provider-applied options include cryotherapy repeated every 1–2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid cauterization using 80–90% aqueous solution repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks (BIII), intralesional cidofovir 15 mg/mL with a maximum 1 mL per session repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 3–4 treatments (CIII), and surgical excision (BIII) or laser surgery (CIII) for external or anal warts. Intralesional interferon is usually not recommended (CIII), recurrence despite treatment is high in patients with HIV, and there is no consensus on oral wart therapy; surgery is most common for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### The butterfly effect: collateral damage and impacts of antimicrobial strategies on the oral microbiome [^113YJ7jT]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond antibiotic therapies, probiotics provide promising alternatives for controlling disease and creating a habitable microenvironment for commensal bacteria, yet one that is hostile to pathogens. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when consumed in adequate amounts, either in their viable or non-viable forms, confer health benefits on the host by balancing the microbial ecosystems in the body. They are often used to restore or maintain healthy microbiota in the GI tract, at the vaginal epithelium, and within the oral cavity. Lactobacillus spp. (e.g. L. rhamnosus, L crispatus) and Bifidobacterium spp. (e.g. B. bifidum and B. longum) have been used to control microbial populations within these different ecological niches. The mounting evidence for probiotic therapy to combat oral diseases is promising, with several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicating positive outcomes in patients with oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis and halitosis –. Probiotic therapies hold many advantages over antibiotics, with one in particular being the ability to integrate probiotics into lozenges for localized targeting of the oral cavity. Studies have shown that probiotics delivered in this manner can improve gingival health, reduce plaque and enhance immunity. Although dental material science continues to develop new and innovative methods for localized delivery of antimicrobials including antibiotics, we are still a long way from creating an alternative that bypasses the systemic implications associated with such therapy.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### The prevention of infections in older adults: oral health [^1115C4fv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The oral cavity is exposed to the external environment and from a very young age is colonized by infectious agents. Under certain circumstances including poor oral hygiene, dry mouth, trauma, and the use of antibiotics, oral infections can occur. They can result in damage to the oral cavity including teeth and their support structures. Oral infections can also lead to the extension of infection into surrounding tissues and to systemic infections. Chronic oral infection is a recognized risk factor for heart disease. Older adults are at high risk for oral infections and associated complications. Tooth loss, for which infection is the most significant cause, leads to cosmetic changes and a decreased ability to masticate certain foods that can lead to malnutrition. Chronic oral infections and the manipulation of teeth and supporting structures can lead to the hematogenous spread of infection including the infection of artificial joints and endocardial implants. Good oral hygiene, the use of fluoride, regular dental care, and the appropriate use of antibiotics can all reduce oral infections and their associated complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114M75tG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### Management of mild hidradenitis suppurativa: our greatest challenge yet [^113TFvYx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, this group with clinically mild disease, the majority of patients with HS, are clearly missing out on the scientific advancements. Only a limited number of treatment options are currently available to treat these patients. Current guidelines advocate only the use of topical clindamycin or recurrent courses of oral antibiotics for mild disease. However, none of these treatment options achieves the targets that either physicians or patients desire: prolonged disease remission and prevention of disease progression. This is especially striking as preventing disease progression and the development of tunnel formation could spare patients large, impactful surgeries. In addition, frequent courses of antibiotics for a period of 30 years of active disease are highly undesirable due to bacterial resistance. Treatment of mild HS should ideally reach the aforementioned targets while having limited side‐effects, be relatively low cost, and be suitable for long‐lasting use. Potential treatment options that could meet these criteria, now or in the future, are oral metformin, definitive depilation, oral or topical retinoids, and adalimumab or other biologics. However, to date none of these has been adequately assessed in mild HS.

### The management of surgical patients in the emergency setting during COVID-19 pandemic: the WSES position paper [^111rwexR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly, under COVID-19 pandemic, patients presenting complicated appendicitis with a well-defined abscess in the right iliac fossa can be managed with percutaneous drainage, if it is available, associated with IV antibiotics. Patients with evidence of perforation may be managed with percutaneous drainage or operation based on patient condition, or if unfit for surgery. Patients who fail NOM should proceed to surgery expeditiously.

In case of diagnosis of a cute cholecystitis, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice. In particular, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is better than delayed LC. Multiple RCTs have shown early cholecystectomy to be associated to a shorter hospital stay without any significant difference in the complication rate or conversion, when compared with delayed cholecystectomy. However, the recommendation of early surgery could be challenged due to the pandemic-related restrictions. Managing the infection with IV antibiotics and analgesics in order to delay surgery should be seriously considered in such a context. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) with IV antibiotics has been advocated as an alternative to surgery in critically ill patients. PC involves the sterile placement of a tube into the gallbladder for external drainage of gallbladder contents. The procedure can be performed using US or CT scan guidance. US is the modality of choice because of the readily availability of the device, the portability of the machine, and real-time imaging during the procedure that can be performed safely at the bed side of the patient under adequate sedation and local anaesthesia.

The objectives of a PC are to decompress the gallbladder through a drainage left in place and to obtain cultures from the bile for appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Actually, the 2016 WSES guidelines did not recommend it as an alternative to LC except in the most unfit patients due to the significantly higher mortality rate. The recent CHOCHOLATE trial confirmed that finding and was interrupted due to the poor results in the PC group.

In case of diagnosis of (jejunal or colonic) acute diverticulitis (AD), the treatment of choice for uncomplicated AD is NOM with IV antibiotics, considering transition to oral antibiotics as soon as possible. Patients who present with generalized peritonitis should undergo urgent surgical treatment. In case of jejuno-ileal diverticulitis, there are no consensus and no recommendations; anyway, surgery is the preferred treatment because of high mortality and morbidity related to the severity of the disease.

### Perioral dermatitis: a review of the condition with special attention to treatment options [^113Stukx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Perioral dermatitis is a common acneiform facial eruption found in both adults and children. Its variants are periorificial and granulomatous periorificial dermatitis. The etiology of perioral dermatitis remains unknown; however, topical corticosteroid use on the face commonly precedes the manifestation of this condition. There are an overwhelming number of treatment options for perioral dermatitis, and the options in children are slightly different from those in adults for both systemic medications and topical treatment. This article provides a literature review of the various applicable treatments available based on the level and quality of the evidence by the US Preventive Service Task Force. Oral tetracycline reveals the best valid evidence. However, if the patient is less than 8 years old, then this oral therapy may not be suitable. Topical metronidazole, erythromycin, and pimecrolimus also represent effective treatment choices with good evidence. Topical corticosteroid use is common in these cases and the question of whether it is a good treatment or a cause remains unanswered. Corticosteroid cream can improve the clinical picture, but there is a risk of rebound when treatment is stopped. We propose a treatment algorithm to assist dermatologists, pediatric dermatologists, and general practitioners encountering this condition.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^1134GE3p]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association urgent dental pain and swelling guideline — methods and outcome definitions state that for dichotomous outcomes, the guideline authors calculated absolute treatment effects using the control group's baseline risk as the assumed control intervention risk and define abbreviations as "RR: risk ratio" and "RCT: Randomized controlled trial". Pain outcomes were dichotomized using a visual analog scale from 0–3, with "no pain" and "mild pain" coded as "no pain" and "moderate pain" and "severe pain" coded as "pain". In Fouad and colleagues, intraoral swelling was dichotomized using a visual analog scale from 0–4, with "no swelling", "much less swelling", and "slightly less swelling" coded as "no swelling", and "same swelling" and "more swelling" coded as "swelling". In Henry and colleagues, swelling was dichotomized using a visual analog scale from 0–3, with "no swelling" and "mild swelling" coded as "no swelling" and "moderate swelling" and "severe swelling" coded as "swelling". Reported exclusions included that in Fouad and colleagues "14 participants were excluded" and "15 participants were excluded" due to missing baseline or follow up swelling data, and for one time point "the total number of participants for the outcome of pain at 72 h was used".

### Hip fracture [^1152q72B]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between 12% and 37% of people will die in the year after a hip fracture, and 10% to 20% of survivors will move into a more dependent residence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical interventions in people with hip fracture? What are the effects of perisurgical medical interventions on surgical outcome and prevention of complications in people with hip fracture? What are the effects of rehabilitation interventions and programmes after hip fracture? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 55 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anaesthesia (general, regional); antibiotic regimens; arthroplasty; choice of implant for internal fixation; conservative treatment; co-ordinated multidisciplinary approaches for inpatient rehabilitation of older people; cyclical compression of the foot or calf; early supported discharge followed by home-based rehabilitation; extramedullary devices; fixation (external, internal); graduated elastic compression; intramedullary devices; mobilisation strategies; nerve blocks for pain control; nutritional supplementation (oral multinutrient feeds, nasogastric feeds); perioperative prophylaxis with antibiotics, with antiplatelet agents, or with heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated); preoperative traction to the injured limb; and systematic multicomponent home-based rehabilitation.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hRRH6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we found contradictory results regarding the abundance of Candida species in fungal cultures after treatment. Thamkantho et al.reported significantly more positive fungal cultures after DQC treatment than after standard treatment, although clinical cure rates were equivalent. However, the clinical implications of this finding are questionable because asymptomatic colonization with Candida should not be considered as an indication for treatment.

The standard treatment for vaginal infections depends on the underlying etiology. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Working Group of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF), as well as the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) recommend that the first-line treatment for BV should be oral or topical metronidazole or clindamycin. In uncomplicated VVC, oral or topical azoles, such as clotrimazole or fluconazole, are recommended as standard treatment.

A rapid increase in resistances to antibiotic or antifungal agents has been discovered over the last decades. This problem is especially severe in low- and middle-income countries, where the rate of multiresistant infections is expected to grow 4–7 times faster than in other regions. It has been estimated that in some countries up to 40%–60% of all infections are caused by resistant pathogens. Furthermore, over the last decades, the development of new antibiotic agents has increasingly slowed down. Owing to the increase in multiresistant pathogens and the burden of resistance to antibiotic and antifungal treatment options, a broader variety of treatment options would generally be desirable. Although the etiology of recurrent vaginal infections is not fully understood yet, resistance to antibiotics and antifungal agents is definitely a contributing factor. In addition, women with recurrent infections often need to be treated with high doses of antimycotic or antibiotic medication over long periods. Antiseptic agents could offer a possible treatment alternative, thereby controlling the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance.

### Cost-effectiveness of full-course oral levofloxacin in severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116aJf3A]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Oral levofloxacin is as efficient as sequential antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The current authors assessed whether oral levofloxacin treatment of patients with severe CAP, followed-up for 30 days, would save money. Over a 12-month period, 129 hospitalised patients with severe non-intensive care unit CAP were randomly assigned to receive either oral levofloxacin or sequential antibiotic treatment. Direct and indirect costs were compared over a 30-day period from several perspectives. CAP resolved in 71 out of 77 oral levofloxacin (92%) and in 34 out of 37 sequential antibiotic treatment patients (92%). Patients' characteristics, treatment duration, hospital length of stay and mortality were similar in both groups. Drug acquisition costs were 1.7-times smaller in oral levofloxacin patients, who were less often transferred to rehabilitation centres, but they used more physicians' visits during follow-up and their total costs were lower. As only a minority of patients was still active, inability to work and, hence, indirect costs were similar in both groups. In this study, oral levofloxacin for severe non-intensive care unit community-acquired pneumonia was equally effective as sequential antibiotic treatment, but did not lead to major costs savings except for drug acquisition costs. External factors linked with patients' characteristics and/or medical practice are likely to play a role and should be addressed.

### Antibiotics to prevent complications following Tooth extractions [^117UB5P6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The most frequent indications for tooth extractions, generally performed by general dental practitioners, are dental caries and periodontal infections. Systemic antibiotics may be prescribed to patients undergoing extractions to prevent complications due to infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.

Objectives

To determine the effect of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis on the prevention of infectious complications following tooth extractions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (to 16 April 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 16 April 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 16 April 2020), and LILACS (1982 to 16 April 2020). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing tooth extraction(s) for any indication.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment for the included studies. We contacted trial authors for further details where these were unclear. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using random-effects models. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for key outcomes as high, moderate, low, or very low, using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials that randomised approximately 3206 participants (2583 analysed) to prophylactic antibiotics or placebo. Although general dentists perform dental extractions because of severe dental caries or periodontal infection, only one of the trials evaluated the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in groups of patients affected by those clinical conditions. We assessed 16 trials as being at high risk of bias, three at low risk, and four as unclear. Compared to placebo, antibiotics may reduce the risk of postsurgical infectious complications in patients undergoing third molar extractions by approximately 66% (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1728 participants; 12 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 19 people (95% CI 15 to 34) need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one infection following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. Antibiotics may also reduce the risk of dry socket by 34% (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.97; 1882 participants; 13 studies; low-certainty evidence), which means that 46 people (95% CI 29 to 62) need to take antibiotics to prevent one case of dry socket following extraction of impacted wisdom teeth. The evidence for our other outcomes is uncertain: pain, whether measured dichotomously as presence or absence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.12; 675 participants; 3 studies) or continuously using a visual analogue scale (0-to-10-centimetre scale, where 0 is no pain) (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.07; 422 participants; 4 studies); fever (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.79; 475 participants; 4 studies); and adverse effects, which were mild and transient (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.64; 1277 participants; 8 studies) (very low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence that the timing of antibiotic administration (preoperative, postoperative, or both) was important. The included studies enrolled a subset of patients undergoing dental extractions, that is healthy people who had surgical extraction of third molars. Consequently, the results of this review may not be generalisable to all people undergoing tooth extractions.

Authors' Conclusions

The vast majority (21 out of 23) of the trials included in this review included only healthy patients undergoing extraction of impacted third molars, often performed by oral surgeons. None of the studies evaluated tooth extraction in immunocompromised patients. We found low-certainty evidence that prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the risk of infection and dry socket following third molar extraction when compared to placebo, and very low-certainty evidence of no increase in the risk of adverse effects. On average, treating 19 healthy patients with prophylactic antibiotics may stop one person from getting an infection. It is unclear whether the evidence in this review is generalisable to patients with concomitant illnesses or patients at a higher risk of infection. Due to the increasing prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic treatment, clinicians should evaluate if and when to prescribe prophylactic antibiotic therapy before a dental extraction for each patient on the basis of the patient's clinical conditions (healthy or affected by systemic pathology) and level of risk from infective complications. Immunocompromised patients, in particular, need an individualised approach in consultation with their treating medical specialist.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^116i2RA9]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis PPP — oral antibiotics for MGD and pediatric dosing — Oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful for patients with MGD whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled by eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, and doxycycline, minocycline, or tetracycline can be given daily and tapered after clinical improvement is noted. To avoid using tetracyclines in women of childbearing age and in children, oral erythromycin or azithromycin may be used, with one suggested dosing regimen for erythromycin in children being 30 to 40 mg/kg divided over 3 doses for 3 weeks, then twice daily for 4 to 6 weeks, and a pediatric dosing regimen for azithromycin of 5 mg/kg daily for 2 months shown to be helpful for clinical improvement in a small case series. However, a Cochrane systematic review reported uncertainty with respect to indications and effectiveness of both topical and systemic treatments for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children due to the lack of high-quality evidence.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^113mHoGr]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — reported penicillin allergy and alternative antibiotics: Although approximately 10% of the population self-reports having a penicillin allergy and less than 1% of the entire population is truly allergic, clinicians should proceed with nonpenicillin drug class antibiotics until further confirmation of a true penicillin allergy, and the panel suggests prescribing oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin; some antibiotics may be less effective or carry a greater risk of harming patients through allergic reactions (penicillin) or Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the prevention of CDI should be a community priority in addition to a hospital priority, and according to a United Kingdom–based study, the incidence of CDI can be reduced through the appropriate use of antibiotics.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^1177DqZM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (from HB, CO, KC, AM, JW, MB) will independently extract data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed by the authors, adapted from Chapter 5 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will pilot this form on at least two studies. We will resolve any disagreements by referral to a third review author, who will not have been one of the two initial authors involved in assessing that study. We will evenly divide the work between us (HB, CO, KC, AM, JW, MB) following the search.

We will record the following information.

Article information (author, date, language, author contact details)
Study information (duration, length of follow‐up, attrition/non‐response, sample size, study limitations, funding source)
Population (setting; region(s) and country/countries from which study participants were recruited; study eligibility criteria, including diagnostic criteria; and characteristics of participants at the beginning (or baseline) of the study (e.g. age, sex, comorbidity, socioeconomic status))
Methods (study design, setting, deviations from the study protocol, randomisation/blinding, statistical methods including how cluster randomised trials were dealt with)
Intervention (components, routes of delivery, doses, timing, frequency, intervention protocols, length of intervention, factors relevant to implementation (e.g. staff qualifications, equipment requirements), integrity of interventions (i.e. the degree to which specified procedures or components of the intervention were implemented as planned), description of co‐interventions, definition of 'control' groups (e.g. no intervention, placebo, minimally active comparator, or components of usual care))
Outcomes and time points (those collected and those reported, unit measurements and how outcome measures were defined, any aggregate measures used)
Results (impacts on outcomes and relevant subgroups, summary data, any adverse effects reported and how they were measured)
Required information for GRADE summary of findings table

Where studies have multiple publications, we will collate multiple reports of the same study, so that such studies have a single study ID with multiple references. We will correspond with study investigators for further data on methods, results, or both, as required. We will create a summary of included studies similar to Table 1.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115SYZbY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — impetigo and ecthyma therapy notes that cultures of the vesicle fluid, pus, erosions, or ulcers establish the cause and, unless cultures yield streptococci alone, antimicrobial therapy should be active against both S. aureus and streptococci. Oral penicillinase–resistant penicillin or first-generation cephalosporins are usually effective as most staphylococcal isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are methicillin susceptible, with alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients or infections with MRSA including doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice, with a macrolide or clindamycin as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Topical treatment with mupirocin or retapamulin is as effective as oral antimicrobials for impetigo, and systemic therapy is preferred for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission.

### Nonantibiotic treatments for urinary cystitis: an update [^113tME1t]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of most common infections in everyday clinical practice. Given the increase in antimicrobial therapy resistance, there has been an increased interest in nonantibiotic treatment options for common infections.

Recent Findings

A review of the recent literature including on nonantibiotic options for management of UTIs, symptoms of cystitis and prevention of recurrent UTIs.

Summary

The article provides an overview on alternative therapy to antibiotics in the treatment of cystitis and recurrent UTI prophylaxis, including alkalinization of urine, cranberry products, probiotics, NSAIDS, D-mannose, herbal medicine, methenamine hippurate, oral immunostimulants (immunotherapy), topical oestrogens, vitamins and acupuncture. The last few years of intense research has focused on an effort to find evidence to corroborate potentially efficacious non antibiotic treatments. However, alternative treatments for UTIs have not brought conclusive evidence that antibiotic usage can be replaced completely by nonantibiotic options. The reason for this is largely due to a lack of good-quality randomized controlled trials on this subject.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116b6MX7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^116ugtAX]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — systemic antibiotics compared with no systemic antibiotics for symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis in immunocompetent adults when definitive, conservative dental treatment is not available — summarizes 40 (1 RCT*) on pain and analgesic use. For pain intensity at 24 h, mean pain intensity with no systemic antibiotic was 1.35, and antibiotics yielded MD, 0.35 higher (0.21 lower - 0.91 higher). For pain experience at 24 h, RR, 1.20, (0.68 to 2.11) with an absolute effect of 100 more per 1,000 (160 fewer - 555 more). At 7 d, pain experience RR, 0.89 (0.43 to 1.83) with 49 fewer per 1,000 (257 fewer - 374 more). For medication use, mean total number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tablets) used was 9.6 with MD, 0.4 lower (4.23 lower - 3.43 higher), and mean total number of acetaminophen with codeine (tablets) used was 4.45 with MD 2.45 higher (1.23 lower - 6.13 higher).

### Current indications for surgical intervention with lateral skull base osteomyelitis [^113bnj8L]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Lateral skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), also called malignant otitis externa or necrotitizing otitis externa, is a subacute yet relentless infection of the external auditory canal and skull base most often found in elderly males and diabetics. When SBO was first described in the 1950s, the first‐line therapy was surgical intervention. Over the past few decades, a transition toward culture‐directed antibiotics has shifted the treatment paradigm of SBO toward primary medical management, with mortality rates now decreased to 10%–20% compared to 50% initially.

Today, the treatment of SBO involves multidisciplinary coordination between otolaryngology and infectious disease. Although the introduction of quinolone antibiotics has significantly decreased mortality rate, the rate of surgical intervention has not drastically changed over time. Due to the rarity of this condition, there is significant variability in practice styles between individuals and institutions, and there is no consensus on the specific indications for surgical intervention. The purpose of this best practice review was to interpret the available evidence to better define contemporary indications for surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112sLPyg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD… [^115TrYKP]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone. First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin.

First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin. Because of the risk of developing bacterial resistance when erythromycin and clindamycin are used as monotherapy, if prescribed, they should be combined with benzoyl peroxide. A topical retinoid alone is recommended primarily for comedonal acne, and for persons with mixed or inflammatory acne, it also can be used in conjunction with a topical or oral antimicrobial. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial.

Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism. ISOTRETINOIN Oral isotretinoin, which is best absorbed when taken with meals, is recommended for severe nodular acne, and is appropriate for moderate acne in which other therapies have failed or for acne that results in scarring or causes patient distress. Low doses are effective while also decreasing related adverse effects, but it should be noted that intermittent dosing is not indicated.
