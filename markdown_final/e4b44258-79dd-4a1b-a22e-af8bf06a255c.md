## Question

What is the management of diuretic-induced hypovolemia and electrolyte depletion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing diuretic-induced hypovolemia and electrolyte depletion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing hypovolemic from dilutional hyponatremia. Then, I should verify immediate stabilization priorities, including when to use hypertonic saline. Next, I will consider diuretic management and fluid resuscitation strategy, followed by electrolyte replacement protocols. After that, I need to ensure monitoring and safety thresholds to avoid overcorrection and AKI. Finally, I will address special populations, prevention, and a concise algorithm summary, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classify the syndrome correctly, because management hinges on whether the patient has hypovolemic hyponatremia from diuretics versus a dilutional or SIADH-like picture. I should review the medication list carefully for thiazides, loops, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, since thiazides and MRAs are frequent culprits for hyponatremia, whereas loops more often drive hypokalemia and prerenal azotemia without severe hyponatremia, and SGLT2 inhibitors can precipitate volume depletion even without natriuresis [^11336w5M] [^114q57DZ]. Wait, let me verify the volume status objectively because clinical exam alone is unreliable; urine sodium and chloride, fractional uric acid, and copeptin can help distinguish hypovolemia from SIADH, especially when diuretics confound urine sodium interpretation, and a low urine sodium with low urine chloride supports hypovolemia, whereas a high urine sodium with inappropriately concentrated urine suggests SIADH [^114NwZaW] [^113ejyCB] [^11336w5M]. I should double-check for coexisting causes of hyponatremia such as adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, or cerebral salt wasting, particularly in neurocritical contexts, because CSW requires volume repletion rather than fluid restriction [^112JfeM5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before stabilizing the patient. I need to check for severity and symptoms of hyponatremia because acute symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures, coma, or severe confusion mandates immediate hypertonic saline to mitigate cerebral edema; a pragmatic approach is 150 mL of 3% saline over 20 minutes, repeatable up to three times initially, with frequent sodium checks and neurologic reassessment, while remembering that overly rapid correction risks osmotic demyelination and that guidelines prioritize hemodynamic stability over sodium correction rate in unstable patients [^112LUvFE] [^112NDPcb] [^113PyTGH]. Wait, I should verify that this hypertonic strategy is reserved for severe symptomatic cases and not used routinely in mild, asymptomatic hyponatremia, where isotonic saline and cause-directed therapy suffice [^116m8pt2].

> Next, I should review diuretic management because continuing the offending agent can perpetuate volume depletion and electrolyte losses. Let me think about immediate actions: stop thiazides and MRAs promptly, and hold loop diuretics if there is hypotension, AKI, or severe electrolyte derangements; in cirrhosis with AKI or severe hyponatremia, guidelines explicitly recommend diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion with normal saline, which I should adhere to strictly [^1123M7EA] [^117LEVad] [^113PwzgE]. I need to ensure I also consider SGLT2 inhibitors as contributors to volume depletion and follow sick-day protocols to hold them during intercurrent illness, with proactive diuretic dose reduction in patients at risk of hypovolemia [^114q57DZ] [^114HHuj9] [^116BQG81].

> Now, fluid resuscitation strategy requires careful alignment with the underlying pathophysiology. For hypovolemic hyponatremia due to diuretics, isotonic saline is the cornerstone because it restores effective circulating volume and suppresses AVP, thereby promoting free water excretion and raising serum sodium; typical infusion rates of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour are reasonable, with titration to clinical response and close monitoring to avoid fluid overload [^1144sLbT] [^114LiD31]. But wait, what if the patient is hypervolemic or has heart failure? In dilutional hyponatremia, isotonic saline can worsen sodium retention; in those cases, fluid restriction and cautious diuresis are preferred, whereas in cirrhosis with severe hyponatremia, fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day is advised, and diuretics should be withheld if sodium is below 125 mmol/L or AKI is present [^114GuP3y] [^113PwzgE]. I should confirm that albumin is not routine for simple hypovolemia; its role is more specific, such as after large-volume paracentesis in cirrhosis or in HRS-AKI, so I must avoid reflex albumin use outside these indications [^112oWTSw] [^115Y3xdJ].

> I will now examine electrolyte replacement, starting with potassium, because diuretic-induced kaliuresis is common and clinically consequential. Let me verify the approach: oral potassium chloride is preferred for mild to moderate deficits, whereas IV replacement is indicated for severe hypokalemia, ECG changes, or inability to take oral medications; typical IV rates of 10–20 mmol over 1–2 hours with cardiac monitoring are reasonable, with faster regimens reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias, and I should remember that magnesium repletion often facilitates potassium correction [^113NFDQ5]. Hold on, I should verify that potassium-sparing agents like spironolactone can be strategically added in heart failure or cirrhosis to mitigate ongoing losses, but I must watch for hyperkalemia and adjust accordingly, especially in CKD or when ACEi/ARB/MRA are combined [^115cM239] [^111LC2U9].

> For sodium disorders specifically, I need to ensure I do not conflate total body sodium with serum sodium. In diuretic-induced hypovolemic hyponatremia, total body sodium is depleted despite low serum sodium, so isotonic saline treats both volume and sodium deficits; by contrast, in dilutional hyponatremia, total body sodium is high, so saline is counterproductive and fluid restriction is key [^114LiD31] [^114NEZkY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost recommended hypertonic saline broadly for hyponatremia; I should correct that and restrict hypertonic use to acute symptomatic cases, using isotonic saline for hypovolemic hyponatremia otherwise, and employing predictive formulas like Adrogue–Madias to estimate correction and avoid overcorrection, with a typical safe target of about 8 mmol in 24 hours in chronic cases [^113935jW] [^113PyTGH].

> I need to check chloride balance because thiazides and loops can cause disproportionate chloride losses leading to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, which perpetuates volume depletion and potassium wasting. Let me reconsider the replacement: potassium chloride is preferred over potassium phosphate or bicarbonate when both potassium and chloride are low, and magnesium chloride can be used if magnesium is depleted; this strategy helps correct the alkalosis and improve renal hemodynamics [^113cWwBW] [^114KiAQb]. I should double-check that low urine chloride supports chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis and can guide the need for chloride repletion alongside volume restoration [^113ejyCB].

> Monitoring and safety are critical to avoid iatrogenic harm. I should confirm a schedule: check serum sodium every 2–4 hours initially in acute symptomatic cases, then every 6–12 hours as stability improves; monitor potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, and BUN daily; track strict intake and output with daily weights; and reassess volume status frequently using vitals, orthostatics, skin turgor, JVP, lung exam, and edema, recognizing that clinical assessment alone is imperfect and that urine electrolytes can refine the picture when interpreted in context [^114NwZaW] [^115p53HZ]. Hold on, I should verify that overcorrection risk is mitigated by slowing or stopping saline if sodium rises too quickly and by administering electrolyte-free water in consultation with experts if needed, with a plan to relower sodium if the rise exceeds guideline thresholds [^113PyTGH].

> Special populations require tailored adjustments, so let me consider a few high-risk scenarios. In cirrhosis, I should avoid vaptans due to hepatotoxicity risk and prioritize diuretic withdrawal, albumin after large-volume paracentesis, and cautious fluid restriction only when hypervolemic; in heart failure, I must balance decongestion against prerenal azotemia and consider MRAs to limit potassium losses; in cancer patients, I should anticipate higher risks of volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances and adjust diuretics and RAAS blockade accordingly; in older adults, I need to be vigilant for thiazide-induced hyponatremia and falls, and in pediatrics, I should avoid aggressive diuretics in nephrotic hypovolemia and withhold ACEi/ARBs when hypovolemic [^113kBN5m] [^1123M7EA] [^115cM239] [^114DH6YD] [^115a3vrH]. I should double-check that SGLT2 inhibitors are held during acute illness and that diuretic doses are proactively reduced in patients at risk of hypovolemia to prevent complications [^114HHuj9] [^116BQG81].

> Prevention and longitudinal care are essential to reduce recurrence. I need to ensure structured follow-up with electrolyte panels within 1–2 weeks after any diuretic initiation or dose change, reinforce daily weights and symptom monitoring, and educate patients on sick-day rules to hold diuretics and SGLT2 inhibitors during vomiting, diarrhea, or poor intake; in heart failure, flexible diuretic dosing tied to weight and congestion signs can maintain euvolemia with the lowest effective dose while minimizing electrolyte losses [^114poBeZ] [^114HHuj9]. Let me verify that routine potassium and magnesium supplementation is considered when high-dose loop diuretics are necessary, and that potassium-sparing agents are leveraged to reduce the need for chronic potassium pills when appropriate [^115cM239].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I should confirm the following sequence: identify diuretic exposure and classify hyponatremia as hypovolemic versus dilutional using clinical and urine indices; stabilize with hypertonic saline only if acutely symptomatic; stop offending diuretics, especially thiazides and MRAs; resuscitate with isotonic saline for hypovolemic cases or implement fluid restriction for dilutional states; replete potassium and magnesium aggressively and correct chloride losses; monitor sodium, potassium, renal function, and volume status closely to avoid overcorrection and fluid overload; tailor therapy to special populations; and institute prevention strategies and close follow-up to sustain euvolemia and electrolyte stability [^1144sLbT] [^114LiD31] [^113PyTGH] [^1123M7EA].

---

Diuretic-induced hypovolemia and electrolyte depletion are best managed by **immediate diuretic cessation** and **isotonic saline resuscitation** to restore intravascular volume and renal perfusion, with electrolytes corrected per deficits [^114LiD31] [^1144sLbT]. Use **balanced crystalloids** when chloride is high or acidosis is present, and reserve albumin for cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome with low oncotic pressure [^112mTDH6] [^112oWTSw]. Monitor sodium, potassium, and renal function closely; avoid rapid sodium correction to prevent osmotic demyelination, and restart diuretics at lower doses only after euvolemia and electrolyte stability are achieved [^116Dh6zX] [^114QNpcg].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

- **Volume status**: Evaluate for orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucosa, decreased skin turgor, and low urine output [^114NwZaW].

- **Electrolytes**: Check serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and renal function (creatinine, BUN) at baseline and frequently during correction [^1145RSFN].

- **Urine studies**: Measure urine sodium, potassium, chloride, and osmolality to distinguish hypovolemic from euvolemic/hypervolemic hyponatremia and guide therapy [^114NwZaW] [^115p53HZ].

---

## Immediate management

### Diuretic therapy adjustments

Immediately **discontinue** the offending diuretic(s), especially thiazides and loop diuretics, to halt ongoing fluid and electrolyte losses [^1123M7EA]. Only after volume and electrolytes are stabilized should diuretics be resumed — if still indicated — at reduced doses with close monitoring [^114QNpcg].

---

### Fluid resuscitation

- **Isotonic saline**: Administer 0.9% NaCl at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour to restore extracellular volume and improve renal perfusion [^1144sLbT].

- **Balanced crystalloids**: Consider Lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte when hyperchloremic acidosis or chloride-sensitive conditions are present [^113e13U8].

- **Albumin**: Use 5% albumin selectively in cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, or when low oncotic pressure contributes to hypovolemia [^112oWTSw].

---

### Electrolyte replacement

- **Potassium**: Replace orally or intravenously based on severity; use oral KCl for mild deficits and IV KCl (10–20 mEq) for severe hypokalemia or ECG changes [^113NFDQ5].

- **Magnesium**: Correct hypomagnesemia concurrently, as it worsens potassium losses and arrhythmias [^115cM239].

- **Chloride**: Replace as KCl or NaCl to correct hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis and improve diuretic responsiveness [^114KiAQb].

---

## Advanced management strategies

### Refractory cases

For refractory cases, **vasopressin antagonists (vaptans)** may be considered in hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia when fluid restriction is ineffective or contraindicated, but they are not first-line for hypovolemic hyponatremia [^114LiD31]. If diuretic resistance persists despite correction of hypovolemia and electrolytes, **renal replacement therapy** should be considered for fluid removal and electrolyte correction [^113pJUD6].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

- **Patient education**: Teach recognition of dehydration, daily weights, and sick-day rules for holding diuretics during illness [^114poBeZ].

- **Monitoring**: Schedule regular electrolyte and renal function checks during chronic diuretic therapy [^111Sd7xR].

- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective diuretic dose and adjust based on volume status and electrolytes [^11479W3V].

---

## Potential complications of improper management

Improper management can cause **acute kidney injury** from persistent hypoperfusion or overcorrection [^115Y3xdJ]. Rapid sodium correction (> 8–12 mmol/L in 24 h) risks osmotic demyelination [^notfound]. Uncorrected potassium and magnesium deficits increase arrhythmia risk [^115cM239]. Excessive fluids can precipitate pulmonary edema, especially in heart failure or renal failure [^116GZr6X].

## Summary of management steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Stop diuretics immediately |
| 2 | Assess volume status and electrolytes |
| 3 | Start isotonic saline resuscitation |
| 4 | Replace potassium, magnesium, and chloride |
| 5 | Monitor vitals, urine output, and labs closely |

---

Effective management of diuretic-induced hypovolemia and electrolyte depletion centers on **prompt diuretic cessation**, **isotonic saline resuscitation**, and **targeted electrolyte replacement**, with close monitoring to avoid rapid sodium correction and complications.

### Fluid management in acute kidney injury [^115Y3xdJ]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Correction of intravascular hypovolemia is a key component of the prevention and management of acute kidney injury (AKI), but excessive fluid administration is associated with poor outcomes, including the development and progression of AKI. There is growing evidence that fluid administration should be individualized and take into account patient characteristics, nature of the acute illness and trajectories, and risks and benefits of fluids. Existing data support the preferential use of buffered solutions for fluid resuscitation of patients at risk of AKI who do not have hypochloremia. There is a limited role for albumin, and starches should be avoided. Fluids should only be administered until intravascular hypovolemia has been corrected and euvolemia has been achieved using the minimum amount of fluid required to achieve and maintain euvolemia. Oliguria alone should not be viewed as a trigger for fluid administration. If fluid overload occurs, fluid therapy needs to be discontinued, and fluid removal using diuretic agents or extracorporeal therapies should be considered.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and lower limb complications: the diuretic-induced hypovolemia hypothesis [^114q57DZ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with diabetes, Lin and colleagues showed a positive association between SGLT2i-induced blood pressure and weight reduction and the risk of lower limb events. These results support the potential mechanism of a volume depletion effect of SGLT2i to explain the increase risk of amputation observed with this pharmacological class. Since the first result of the CANVAS trial raised a concern regarding the risk of amputation with SGLT2i, this hypothesis emerged from studies showing a higher incidence of amputations in patients with diabetes using diuretics. Furthermore, recent data found that copeptin, a surrogate marker of hydration status was also associated with lower limb outcomes. In conclusion, this assumption of diuretic-induced hypovolemia explanation highlights the fact that medications that induce a contraction of plasma volume, both traditional and novel agents with a diuretic mode of action should be introduced cautiously in patients with diabetes at high risk of diabetic foot events.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^114LiD31]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hypervolemic hyponatraemia

A combination of fluid and salt restriction and loop diuretics, plus neurohormonal antagonism is the recommended first-line approach for hyponatraemia in the settings of heart and liver failure. Vaptans offer an attractive alternative or adjunct to loop diuretics, as they are potassium neutral and cause less neuro-hormonal activation from intravascular volume depletion compared with diuretics, and tolvaptan is an FDA-approved treatment for hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. Forty-three percent of patients recruited into the SALT RCTs of tolvaptan mentioned earlier had hypervolemic hyponatraemia, and although subgroup analyses of this group were not published separately, tolvaptan was shown to produce a significantly greater rise in pNa compared with placebo in the overall group. Several large RCTs have subsequently confirmed tolvaptan's beneficial effect on plasma sodium, weight and dyspnoea in heart failure patients, while in patients with hyponatraemia and ascites, short term tolvaptan use has been shown to normalise plasma sodium in 27–50% of patients. The routine use of tolvaptan is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis, based on the liver injury seen in higher doses used in the TEMPO trial.

Treatment of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia

Volume replacement with isotonic saline, and specific management of the underlying cause, form the approach to management of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia. Correction of hypovolaemia eliminates the stimulus for AVP secretion resulting in a rapid aquaresis which can potentially lead to overcorrection, and thus careful monitoring is required. Treatment of thiazide diuretic induced hyponatraemia requires particular caution as withdrawal of the drug combined with correction of hypovolaemia may result in a rapid aquaresis

### Intravenous fluids: should we go with the flow? [^113HDVE7]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Focus on inadequate monitoring parameters results in misleading interpretations of therapeutic interventions, and even recent randomized controlled trials used conventional static pressure-based indices as measures for haemodynamic stabilization. The authors of the S3 guidelines therefore propose that future studies on volume management must employ adequate parameters for detecting hypovolaemia, must prove targeted correction according to a management algorithm, and must avoid overdosing.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

Hypovolemia is frequent in patients with sepsis and may contribute to worse outcome. The management of these patients is impeded by the low quality of the evidence for many of the specific components of the care. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and controversies in this field and give expert statements for the management of hypovolemia in patients with sepsis including triggers and targets for fluid therapy and volumes and types of fluid to be given. Finally, we point to unanswered questions and suggest a roadmap for future research.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117CHGVN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Loop Diuretics

Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, increase urinary salt and water excretion via inhibition of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the Henle loop to reduce reabsorption of these solutes. They are listed in the European guidelines as a second-line therapy for SIAD in combination with salt tablets (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), but are not endorsed in the international expert panel recommendations. The guideline recommendation was made on the strength of several case series, though only 1 of these included patients with SIAD rather than patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, and that report from 1973 included only 5 patients.

Loop diuretics are useful in the treatment of hypervolemia; however, in the absence of volume excess, natriuresis may cause volume depletion, which stimulates AVP release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. The randomized trial discussed earlier that evaluated FR with and without furosemide and salt tablets to prevent hypovolemia in SIAD found no significant benefit to the addition of frusemide 20 to 40 mg daily compared with FR alone, but in fact observed increased rates of acute kidney injury and hypokalemia. Furosemide increases urinary potassium excretion, which can be potentiated by increased sodium in the distal nephron. Because of this recent evidence, we do not recommend loop diuretics for euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Fluid balance and acute kidney injury [^114sfsAy]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluids are widely administered to patients who have, or are at risk of, acute kidney injury (AKI). However, deleterious consequences of overzealous fluid therapy are increasingly being recognized. Salt and water overload can predispose to organ dysfunction, impaired wound healing and nosocomial infection, particularly in patients with AKI, in whom fluid challenges are frequent and excretion is impaired. In this Review article, we discuss how interstitial edema can further delay renal recovery and why conservative fluid strategies are now being advocated. Applying these strategies in critical illness is challenging. Although volume resuscitation is needed to restore cardiac output, it often leads to tissue edema, thereby contributing to ongoing organ dysfunction. Conservative strategies of fluid management mandate a switch towards neutral balance and then negative balance once hemodynamic stabilization is achieved. In patients with AKI, this strategy might require renal replacement therapy to be given earlier than when more-liberal fluid management is used. However, hypovolemia and renal hypoperfusion can occur in patients with AKI if excessive fluid removal is pursued with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy. Thus, accurate assessment of fluid status and careful definition of targets are needed at all stages to improve clinical outcomes. A conservative strategy of fluid management was recently tested and found to be effective in a large, randomized, controlled trial in patients with acute lung injury. Similar randomized, controlled studies in patients with AKI now seem justified.

Guidance statement — once AKI is diagnosed, an investigation to uncover and treat precipitating factors must be conducted swiftly, with relevant risk factors including fluid losses, bacterial infections, hemodynamic instability, and potentially nephrotoxic agents (particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); hypovolemia-induced AKI should be managed with fluid replacement therapy, correction of the cause that led to volume depletion, and diuretic withdrawal; and the differential diagnosis of AKI, HRS, and ATN is challenging and should follow the consensus criteria presented in the algorithm in Fig. 4.

### Chloride and potassium assessment is a helpful tool for differential diagnosis of thiazide-associated hyponatremia [^113ejyCB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Chloride and potassium balance in urine represents a sodium-independent marker of kidney response to diuretic-induced volume depletion. Processes going on at the level of intercalated cells are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence of a sodium-independent chloride reabsorption in response to changes in volume and metabolic status. A low urine chloride is a known sign of hypovolemia. It triggers renin release and intercalated cells activation, thus aggravating potassium depletion caused by thiazide. Therefore, we further aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of the balance between chloride and potassium in urine in the differential diagnosis of TAH. The goal of our analysis was to find an additional tool for the initial assessment of profound hyponatremia in the context of hospitalization and unreliable canonical urine indices.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^1144sLbT]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to administer IV infusion of a crystalloid solution (0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid, 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour) to restore extracellular volume in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic haemodynamics is central to the clinical management. However, considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy, nature, extent and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue oedema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences. In this Review, we discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolaemia and recurrent renal injury. Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

### Are diuretics harmful in the management of acute kidney injury? [^113tQ7DQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the role of diuretics in acute kidney injury (AKI) and their effectiveness in preventing AKI, achieving fluid balance, and decreasing progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Diuretics are associated with increased risk for AKI. The theoretical advantage of diuretic-induced preservation of renal medullary oxygenation to prevent AKI has not been proven. A higher cumulative diuretic dose during the dialysis period can cause hypotension and increase mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Data on the use of forced euvolemic diuresis to prevent AKI remains controversial. Positive fluid balance has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Post-AKI furosemide dose had a favorable effect on mortality due in part to the reduction of positive fluid balance. There are exciting experimental data suggesting that spironolactone may prevent AKI once an ischemic insult has occurred and thus prevent the progression to CKD.

Summary

Diuretics are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI, and neither shorten the duration of AKI, nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Diuretics have an important role in volume management in AKI, but they are not recommended for the prevention of AKI. There is increased emphasis on the prevention of progression of AKI to CKD.

Clinical Perspective

The pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke depends upon the complex interactions among cerebral and systemic hemodynamic parameters. Previous studies have suggested that the use of diuretics and other antihypertensive medications may reduce the risk of, reduce the severity of, and improve the outcome after stroke. However, these medications have the potential to increase the likelihood of dehydration, or more accurately, a volume contracted state (VCS) at the time of stroke, which may worsen functional outcome. A common side effect of these medications is also change in electrolytes, most notably depletion of serum potassium, which may also be associated with risk of stroke and stroke‐related death. Whether diuretics, hydration status, and potassium levels have an effect in the acute setting has not been determined.

In the acute setting, patients with ischemic stroke are commonly administered intravenous fluid under the premise that dehydration can lead to reduced cerebral perfusion and ultimately worse clinical outcome. The 2018 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke merely state that, "Hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function… " with an admission that, "There are no data to guide volume and duration of parenteral fluid delivery. Although the class of recommendation for this guideline is 1 (strong), the evidence for this merely comes from consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience. Surprisingly, data on the hydration practices and efficacy of this practice are sparse. A few studies have recently begun to look at the effect of a VCS in patients with acute stroke on poststroke outcomes. A single‐center study found that those in a VCS had worse clinical outcome at 90 days than those who were euvolemic. A recent substudy of the ENOS (Efficacy of Nitric Oxide) trial involving data from 310 participants found an unfavorable shift in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and increased death at day 90 in patients with increased urea; however, other markers of dehydration did not yield consistent findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. Briefly, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN were enrolled from 146 US sites and patients with euvolemic HN were enrolled from 79 EU sites. We excluded patients with hypovolemic HN because this disorder should respond readily and completely to treatment of volume deficits, and it therefore poses no therapeutic dilemma. We excluded patient with hypervolemic HN from the EU study centers because tolvaptan is only approved in the EU for euvolemic patients. Inclusion of hypervolemic patients treated with tolvaptan would have created a regulatory burden for the sponsor. At each site, approval was sought from the appropriate research ethics review boards as required. After informed consent, absent a waiver, investigators prospectively recorded patient data. To ascertain patients, some centers systematically reviewed hospital laboratory-generated lists of patients with HN. Others enrolled only patients referred to or managed by the investigator personally. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed. Investigators simply recorded the choices made by the physicians responsible for the patient's hospital care.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To assure that HN was clinically significant, the study required an entry [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/l. Patients were excluded if < 18 years old, hypovolemic, hypervolemic (EU only), using an investigational agent or device, or if hyperglycemic enough to interfere with assessment of [Na +] or receiving renal replacement therapy while hyponatremic. As indicated in Supplementary Table S3 online, euvolemia was defined as the absence of clinical and historical evidence of extracellular fluid volume depletion or sequestration, and the absence of edema and ascites, or on the basis of the treating physician's diagnosis of SIADH. Hypervolemia was defined as excess extracellular fluid volume manifesting as dependent edema or ascites. Although not a specified exclusion criterion originally, we subsequently decided to exclude any patient who was receiving a thiazide at the time the treating physician made a diagnosis of SIADH. It would be difficult to assure that such patients were not in fact hypovolemic, and diuretic use is generally considered to be an exclusion to the proper diagnosis of SIADH. This decision was made prior to data analysis. A complete listing of inclusion and exclusion criteria, as published previously, is provided as Supplementary Table S3 online.

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

Sweat sodium loss and EAH — Whether sweat sodium loss contributes to the development of EAH remains controversial; the direct effect of losing hypotonic sweat alone would be an increase in serum sodium, but sweat loss could contribute to hyponatremia if fluid loss produces significant volume depletion with a stimulus to AVP release or if replacement fluids are more hypotonic than the sweat losses, which may contribute to EAH in some individuals with hypovolemia from exertional activity.

Hypovolemia as a main cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized CRS patients

Although hyponatremia was shown to be multifactorial, in more than one third of hyponatremic CRS patients, there were signs of hypovolemia on admission. Hypovolemia was substantiated by a more frequent history of diarrhea, by more prescribed diuretic drug classes and by higher dosages of prescribed diuretics in the hyponatremia cohort. It remains unclear, whether or not the difference in cardiac systolic function between hyponatremic and non-hyponatremic CRS patients (Fig. 1) was due to a lesser end-diastolic left-ventricular pressure during hypovolemia. The extensive use of diuretics has been established as a leading cause for hypovolemia in CRS patients of this study. Here, the dose combinations of several diuretics appear to bear an increased risk for hypovolemia-related hyponatremia or for hyponatremia as a side effect of diuretics. In addition, the use of a diuretic combination therapy favors a rise in serum urea. Besides hypovolemia, the percentage of patients with excessive sodium excretion in 24-h collecting-urine measurements was twice as high in hyponatremic versus non-hyponatremic CRS patients. This result is in line with either renal sodium wasting or increased sodium-chloride consumption. The latter was excluded for the patients of the current study. Conversely, the use of loop diuretics as a cause for sodium depletion is highly likely, as the prescribed furosemide dosage was higher among hyponatremic CRS patients in comparison to non-hyponatremic ones. In addition to sodium depletion, loop diuretics induce a hypovolemia-triggered, appropriate AVP activation.

In case of hypervolemia-associated hyponatremia, free-water excess and/or diuretic resistance may apply as pathomechanisms for hyponatremia. Among hypervolemic CRS patients included in this study, a further differentiation based on chloremia was not performed. A diuretic resistance is possible in cases of hypochloremia due to less active chloride-sensitive kinases such as the serine/threonine kinase WNK1. However, on clinical grounds, a diuretic resistance can be assumed in all patients with new-onset hemodialysis. Comparable proportions of CRS patients with and without hyponatremia experienced new-onset hemodialysis though.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112TMH4G]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

### Fluid challenge revisited [^112mYD2U]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^11336w5M]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

UNa + > 30 mmol/l

If UNa + is > 30 mmol/l, occult diuretics and extracellular fluid status should be checked to proceed with the differentiation of likely causes of hyponatraemia (Figure 1). As diuretic increase renal Na + excretion, UNa + might be increased when it is measured within the time range that it remains active. Diuretics and mainly thiazides are a common cause of hyponatraemia in clinical practice and in patients with stroke. Thiazides were initially believed to cause hyponatraemia by inducing renal Na + loss leading to volume depletion, but they might directly induce ADH release or increase the response of the collecting renal duct. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (spironolactone and eplerenone) and amiloride are also associated with hyponatraemia. Despite the potential for causing more UNa + loss, loop diuretics rarely result in hyponatraemia as they reduce osmolality in the renal medulla limiting thus kidney's urine concentration ability. To conclude, clinicians must interpret UNa + concentrations ⩾ 30 mmol/l with caution in case of treatment with diuretics and keep in mind that patients may not be aware of being treated with diuretics or that their use may not have been recorded. Of note, a fractional urine excretion of uric acid (FE UA) ⩾ 12% may be superior to UNa + concentration to differentiate reduced effective circulating volume from SIADH as the underlying cause of hyponatraemia in case of diuretic therapy. Likewise, copeptin, which is coproduced by the enzymatic cleavage of the vasopressin prohormone, can be used as a surrogate marker for vasopressin. In that case, plasma copeptin levels have been found higher in patients with hypo- or hypervolemic hyponatremia than in patients with SIADH. Considering the fact that hypovolemia is characterized by high plasma copeptin and low UNa +, the plasma copeptin to UNa + ratio might be useful in differentiating hypovolemic hyponatraemia from SIADH. Nevertheless, its specificity has not been proved high yet. On the contrary, low plasma copeptin levels are diagnostic for hyponatremia due to polydipsia.

### Water and electrolyte homeostasis during decongestion in heart failure [^112AgzL6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In heart failure, sodium retention generally occurs out of proportion to water retention and may occur disproportionate to chloride retention, requiring excretion of other cations (i.e. potassium, magnesium, and hydrogen). Renal homeostatic mechanisms keep chloride levels in balance, making it the primary regulator of intravascular tonicity. Excess total body sodium stores and potassium depletion increase the vulnerability to dehydration, especially in the intracellular compartment. With decompensation, extracellular volume expansion with sodium and chloride overload occurs, further enhancing potassium losses. While diuretics are vital to treat fluid overload, they derange important electrolyte and water balances. Diuretic therapies in heart failure produce disproportionate electrolyte-free water excretion, further exacerbate potassium depletion, and cause chloride losses disproportionate to natriuresis. This can be mitigated by allowing liberal electrolyte-free water intake, providing aggressive potassium and chloride supplementation, and using upfront proximal diuretics to preserve the chloride balance.

### Tolvaptan (Samsca) [^113kBN5m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Liver Injury

Tolvaptan can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In placebo-controlled studies and an open-label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with ADPKD, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan, generally occurring during the first 18 months of therapy, were observed. In postmarketing experience with tolvaptan in ADPKD, acute injury resulting in liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported. Tolvaptan should not be used to treat ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for ADPKD patients [see Contraindications (4)].

Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with SAMSCA.

Limit duration of therapy with SAMSCA to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia

SAMSCA therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue SAMSCA therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with SAMSCA may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving SAMSCA should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst.

5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline

Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended.

5.5 Drug Interactions

Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP3A. Moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Do not use SAMSCA with strong inhibitors of CYP3A [see Contraindications (4)] and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^1145RSFN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^117UsEMg]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although our study cannot demonstrate causality, the effects of electrolyte disorders on different physiological functions suggest an independent effect on mortality. This puts the relevance of diuretic therapy-induced electrolyte disorders into a new light: should patients at risk of developing an electrolyte disorder from a certain diuretic be treated with a different substance? This would be an option, since risk profiles exist at least for thiazide-induced hyponatremia. A further option would be to more strongly encourage electrolyte supplementation since this appears to be beneficial. What at least seems crucial is to create awareness in physicians prescribing diuretic therapy that regular electrolyte monitoring should be performed to identify those who may develop the adverse effects of electrolyte disorders, such as an increased risk of falls or fractures.

Vasopressin antagonists are the currently newest type of diuretic medication on the market. Today, indications for vasopressin antagonists include euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. With these new diuretic agents new side effects can be expected: Due to their mechanism of action, namely an inhibition of vasopressin action, overshooting "corrections" of serum sodium could occur. Additionally, hypovolemia and its effects such as dizziness were described in studies on vasopressin antagonists.

One of the limitations of our study is that it was not practicable to obtain data on and evaluate all medications the patients were taking because of the large number of patients included. Information on other substances that may influence serum electrolytes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, was not available. We also only had information on the patient's principal diagnosis, thus excluding secondary diagnoses as potential contributory factors, such as cirrhosis of the liver. One of the strengths of the study, however, was the large number of patients included, and we therefore do not expect that these limitations had a substantial effect on our findings.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Acute care and emergency general surgery in patients with chronic liver disease: how can we optimize perioperative care? A review of the literature [^114kodmm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Postoperative issues

Much of the resuscitative and therapeutic effort initiated preoperatively, including volume resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and coagulopathy, must be continued in the postoperative period. The surgical team should also maintain a high degree of vigilance for evidence of hepatic decompensation. Hepatic failure might simply result from the inflammatory response to surgery and underlying emergency condition, but the possibility of precipitating factors (e.g. constipation, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) should always be considered.

Ascites

Large-volume ascites after abdominal surgery increases the risk of abdominal wall dehiscence and herniation. It also predisposes the patient to atelectasis, aspiration, and pneumonia. Associated fluid shifts might precipitate electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury. Management is based on sodium restriction and judicious use of diuretics, with close monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. Therapeutic paracentesis should be reserved for refractory cases and limited to symptomatic relief. A high index of suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is also required.

### Hyponatraemia in heart failure: time for new solutions? [^1167vCqU]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is very common in heart failure (HF), especially in decompensated patients. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and considered a marker of advanced disease. Recognition of hyponatraemia and its causes may help guide treatment strategy. Historically, therapy has primarily focused on water restriction, decongestion with loop diuretics in case of volume overload (dilutional hyponatraemia) and sodium repletion in case of depletion. In this review, we summarise the potential benefits of established and emerging HF therapies on sodium homeostasis, with a focus on dual vasopressin antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and hypertonic saline, and propose a potential therapeutic approach for hyponatraemia in HF.

Infusion fluids are often given to restore blood pressure (volume resuscitation), but may also be administered to replace ongoing losses, match insensible losses, correct electrolyte or acid-base disorders, or provide glucose. The development of new infusion fluids has provided clinicians with a wide range of products. Although the choice for a certain infusion fluid is often driven more by habit than by careful consideration, we believe it is useful to approach infusion fluids as drugs and consider their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. This approach not only explains why infusion fluids may cause electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, but also why they may compromise kidney function or coagulation. In this teaching case, we present a 19-year-old patient in whom severe hypernatremia developed as a result of normal saline solution infusion and explore the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of frequently used infusion fluids. We review clinical evidence to guide the selection of the optimal infusion fluid.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^115cM239]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

HRS-AKI — initial evaluation and early management prioritize etiology assignment, diuretic withdrawal, albumin fluid challenge, and careful transfusion targets. "Once the diagnosis of AKI is established, the etiology of the AKI, be it hypovolemic AKI (prerenal azotemia), ATN, or HRS-AKI, is determined". "All diuretics should be withdrawn, and lactulose dosage adjusted to reduce severity of diarrhea". A fluid challenge is specified: "A fluid challenge using albumin at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight to a maximum of 100 g should be administered". In bleeding, "Patients who have had significant blood loss should be given red blood cell transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL, although volume status must be monitored carefully, and overtransfusion should be avoided". For hypovolemia response criteria, "In hypovolemic AKI, volume replacement should be associated with a reduction in the serum creatinine to ≤ 0.3 mg/dL of the baseline level".

### Captopril [^112JsuTQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure: Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent diuretic therapy and the possibility of severe salt/volume depletion. In patients with either normal or low blood pressure, who have been vigorously treated with diuretics and who may be hyponatremic and/or hypovolemic, a starting dose of 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg three times a day may minimize the magnitude or duration of the hypotensive effect (see WARNINGS: Hypotension); for these patients, titration to the usual daily dosage can then occur within the next several days.

For most patients the usual initial daily dosage is 25 mg three times a day. After a dose of 50 mg three times a day is reached, further increases in dosage should be delayed, where possible, for at least two weeks to determine if a satisfactory response occurs. Most patients studied have had a satisfactory clinical improvement at 50 mg or 100 mg three times a day. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg of captopril tablets should not be exceeded.

Captopril should generally be used in conjunction with a diuretic and digitalis. Captopril therapy must be initiated under very close medical supervision.

### Impact of diuretic therapy-associated electrolyte disorders present on admission to the emergency department: a cross-sectional analysis [^1161X3KU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are a mainstay of therapy for a wide variety of diseases ranging from hypertension to the nephrotic syndrome. Despite this key role, the various substances used as diuretics can have serious side effects, such as volume depletion, ototoxicity as with loop diuretics, and, of course, the induction of electrolyte disorders. In an ageing population, the number of patients treated with diuretics for different indications is increasing, as is the relevance of their side effects.

Studies investigating diuretic therapy-induced electrolyte disorders have mainly focused on the effects of thiazide diuretics. In a randomized controlled trial in hypertensive patients, serum potassium levels were significantly lower in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. However, only patients who did not receive potassium supplements developed marked hypokalemia with potassium levels below 3.0 mmol/L. A more recent study on hypertensive patients found an incidence of 30% for hyponatremia in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. The same study did not find an increased risk of hospitalization or death in patients with thiazide-induced hyponatremia.

To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of diuretic use and associated electrolyte disorders have never been investigated in a large group of patients presenting to a hospital emergency room (ER). Findings from large patient series on the impact of non-thiazide diuretics on electrolyte levels are especially lacking.

Therefore, we investigated the associations between diuretics being taken and the prevalence of electrolyte disorders as well as the impact of electrolyte disorders on patient outcome.

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^111FEnrJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Although hypervolemia is always associated with some edema, the reverse is not always true, i.e. edema is not always associated with hypervolemia, particularly in acutely ill patients, especially those with sepsis or other types of intravascular inflammatory responses (e.g. pancreatitis, burns), who often have altered capillary permeability. In such patients, protein-rich fluid leaks from the intravascular to the interstitial space even when mean circulatory filling pressure is low, leading to combined hypovolemia and peripheral edema. Hypoalbuminemia, common in critically ill patients, can exacerbate such edema formation and slow its resolution. If vasoplegia coexists, then mean circulatory filling pressure can be even lower, even though absolute blood volume may not be as decreased as would be the case if tone were normal. This is the rationale for the proposed initial aggressive fluid bolus resuscitation step in the management of septic shock. Thus, in these patients one often sees functional or real hypovolemia associated with increased total body water and generalized edema. These patients often need more intravascular fluids if in shock, not fluid restriction or diuretics. However, whether aggressive fluid resuscitation or combined volume expansion and vasopressor infusion is the most efficacious initial therapy is unclear. Vasopressor infusions in vasoplegic states minimize the volume infusion requirements needed to achieve acceptable mean arterial pressure targets in volume responsive patients.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure. Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

### Are we close to the ideal intravenous fluid? [^113fy4d3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The approach to i.v. fluid therapy for hypovolaemia may significantly influence outcomes for patients who experience a systemic inflammatory response after sepsis, trauma, or major surgery. Currently, there is no single i.v. fluid agent that meets all the criteria for the ideal treatment for hypovolaemia. The physician must choose the best available agent(s) for each patient, and then decide when and how much to administer. Findings from large randomized trials suggest that some colloid-based fluids, particularly starch-based colloids, may be harmful in some situations, but it is unclear whether they should be withdrawn from use completely. Meanwhile, crystalloid fluids, such as saline 0.9% and Ringer's lactate, are more frequently used, but debate continues over which preparation is preferable. Perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear how to select the optimal dose of fluid in different patients and different clinical scenarios. There is good reason to believe that both inadequate and excessive i.v. fluid administration may lead to poor outcomes, including increased risk of infection and organ dysfunction, for hypovolaemic patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on this topic and identify some key pitfalls and some areas of agreed best practice.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Urine electrolytes in the intensive care unit: from pathophysiology to clinical practice [^115p53HZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of urine concentrations of sodium, chloride, and potassium is a widely available, rapid, and low-cost diagnostic option for the management of critically ill patients. Urine electrolytes have long been suggested in the diagnostic workup of hypovolemia, kidney injury, and acid-base and electrolyte disturbances. However, due to the wide range of normal reference values and challenges in interpretation, their use is controversial. To clarify their potential role in managing critical patients, we reviewed existing evidence on the use of urine electrolytes for diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation and assessment in critical illness. This review will describe the normal physiology of water and electrolyte excretion, summarize the use of urine electrolytes in hypovolemia, acute kidney injury, acid-base, and electrolyte disorders, and suggest some practical flowcharts for the potential use of urine electrolytes in daily critical care practice.

The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^112JfeM5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In the absence of diuretics, a clinical assessment of the volume status may aid further the differential diagnosis. Symptoms such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, dry skin mucosa and a low central venous pressure indicate depletion of circulating volume. In that case, apart from occult diuretics as previously mentioned, vomiting, primary hypoaldosteronism and renal or cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSW) would be the most usual causes of hyponatraemia (Figure 1). Severe vomiting could be a sign of increased endocranial pressure, a complication of stroke. Interestingly, metabolic alkalosis associated with vomiting represents one of the conditions in which volume depletion may not be associated with decreased UNa +, despite the activation of the renin–angiotensin system. In this clinical setting, urinary chloride excretion is low (< 10–20 mmol/l) due to increased renal re-absorption of chloride. Second, patient previously treated with corticosteroids can be complicated with primary hypoaldosteronism in the setting of acute stroke if corticosteroid therapy is interrupted abruptly. Primary hypoaldosteronism causes renal Na + loss, contracted extracellular fluid volume and hyponatraemia. Although primary adrenal insufficiency usually presents with other clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities, physicians should keep in mind that hyponatraemia can be its first and only sign. Of note, only one study has investigated its prevalence in the setting of acute ischemic stroke and shown that 18 of 58 patients (31%) had relative adrenal insufficiency. Third, renal salt wasting can also occur in patients with salt-losing nephropathies, such as tubulopathy after chemotherapy or in analgesic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease and certain pharmacological compounds inhibiting the kidney's ability to re-absorb appropriate Na + amounts. Finally, renal Na + loss has been documented in patients with intracranial disorders and mostly in those with subarachnoid bleeding. This renal salt wasting syndrome has been rather confusingly named 'cerebral' salt wasting (CSW), and brain natriuretic peptide has been implicated in its pathogenesis. Because diagnosis may be difficult, and both SIADH and secondary adrenal insufficiency are more common in this clinical setting, CSW might be overdiagnosed. In clinical practice, there are cases of hyponatremia potentially attributed to SIADH or CSW that cannot be strictly separated or both can be present. Nevertheless, CSW recognition is of major importance because its treatment requires volume resuscitation rather than water restriction, as SIADH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^113e13U8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the absence of evidence, therapies are often based on intuition, belief, common sense or gut feeling. Over the years, some treatment strategies may become dogmas that are eventually considered as state-of-the-art and not questioned any longer. This might be a reason why there are many examples of "strange" treatments in medical history that have been applied in the absence of evidence and later abandoned for good reasons. In this article, five dogmas relevant to critical care medicine are discussed and reviewed in the light of the available evidence. Dogma #1 relates to the treatment of oliguria with fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors. In this context, it should be considered that oliguria is a symptom rather than a disease. Thus, once hypovolaemia can be excluded as the underlying reason, there is no justification for giving fluids, which may do more harm than good in euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients. Similarly, there is no solid evidence for forcing diuresis by administering vasopressors and loop diuretics. Dogma #2 addresses the treatment of crush syndrome patients with aggressive fluid therapy using NaCl 0.9%. In fact, this treatment may aggravate renal injury by iatrogenic metabolic acidosis and subsequent renal hypoperfusion. Dogma #3 concerns the administration of NaCl 0.9% to patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Since these patients are usually characterised by hyperkalaemia, the potassium-free solution NaCl 0.9%, containing exclusively 154mmol/l of sodium and chloride ions each, is often considered as the fluid of choice. However, large volumes of chloride-rich solutions cause hyperchloraemic acidosis in a dose-dependent manner and induce a potassium shift to the extracellular space, thereby increasing serum potassium levels. Thus, balanced electrolyte solutions are to be preferred in this setting. Dogma #4 relates to the fact that enteral nutrition is often withheld for patients with high residual gastric volume due to the theoretical risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux, potentially resulting in aspiration pneumonitis. Despite controversial discussions, there is no clinical data supporting that residual gastric volume should be generally measured, especially not in patients without a gastro-intestinal surgery and/or motility disorders. Clinical evidence rather suggests that abandoning residual gastric volume monitoring does not increase the incidence of pneumonia, but may benefit patients by facilitating adequate enteral feeding. Finally, dogma #5 is about sedating all mechanically ventilated patients because "fighting" against the respirator may cause insufficient ventilation. This concern needs to be balanced against the unwanted consequences of sedation, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay as well as increased risk of delirium. Modern concepts based on adequate analgesia and moderate to no sedation appear to be more suitable. In conclusion, dogmas are still common in clinical practice. Since science rather than fiction should govern our actions in intensive care medicine, it is important to remain critical and challenge long established concepts, especially when the underlying evidence is weak or non-existing.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^113cWwBW]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Since common electrolyte disturbances could be encountered during diuretic therapy, it is important to monitor electrolytes levels and also to assess acid-based status. In order to avoid hypokalemia, administration of oral potassium it is easy. Measuring urinary potassium concentration and calculating the daily losses of potassium, which require replacement is a strategy that can be used to estimate daily potassium requirements. Another strategy is the use of potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. Hypomagnesemia is frequently found during diuretic therapy, magnesium replacement can be achieved either intravenously or orally, typically with 20–30 mmoL per day. Finally in some patients, chloride losses exceed sodium losses and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis develops; this is usually corrected with the administration of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride.

A recent comprehensive review have shown that torsemide and bumetanide have more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles than furosemide, and in the case of torsemide it could be more efficacious than furosemide in patients with heart failure (decreased mortality, decrease hospitalizations, and improved New York Heart Association functional classification). In AKI patients, as compared with torsemide the use of furosemide was associated with a significant improvement in urine output. Moreover, two trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide showed conflicting results.

Finally, in patients with AKI the response to furosemide may be reduced due to multiple mechanisms including a reduced tubular secretion of furosemide and blunted response of Na-K-2Cl co-transporters at the loop of Henle. This reduced response to furosemide in AKI patients often requires the use of higher doses that may increase the risk of ototoxicity, especially as the clearance of furosemide is severely reduced in AKI. High doses of furosemide may also result in myocardial dysfunction secondary to furosemide induced vasoconstriction.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^117HhZgC]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Even in high sodium-loss states, normal dietary sodium intake is almost always adequate to maintain normal plasma sodium concentration. The usual recommended daily dietary sodium intake (∼ 100 mmol/d) contains twice as much sodium as a typical dose of salt tablets (3 g daily, eg, 5×600 mg tablets = 51 mmol Na +) — and many Western diets exceed these sodium guidelines. This quantity of sodium is equivalent to just over half a teaspoon of table salt (2.85 g = 47.4 mmol), or 100 mL of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride solution (51.3 mmol). Some recommended regimens for salt tablets are even higher, 9 g per day (3×1 g, 3 times daily = 154 mmol) aiming to produce an osmotic diuresis.

The only RCT of sodium chloride tablets evaluated them in combination with FR and furosemide, in a trial of 92 patients with SIAD. The trial involved 3 open-label arms: FR alone; FR + furosemide (20–40 mg daily); and FR + furosemide + salt tablets (3 g [51 mmol] per day, 10×300 mg tablets, in divided doses). Mean baseline pNa was 125 mmol/L. This study, the highest-quality evidence to date, found no difference in time taken for serum sodium concentration to normalize in those patients prescribed salt tablets compared to FR and furosemide, or FR alone (P = .5), and found higher rates of treatment withdrawal due to adverse events (20%, vs 6% and 10% in other arms; p = 0.03), namely increased acute kidney injury (P = .07) and significant hypokalemia less than or equal to 3.0 mmol/L (P = .01). By increasing thirst, salt tablets may increase water intake and worsen hyponatremia if the amount of fluid intake exceeds that of the extra urine volume excreted via salt-mediated solute diuresis. Whether higher doses of oral sodium chloride without furosemide are effective and safe has not been subject to RCTs.

Sodium supplementation may have a role where there is suspected solute depletion from long-term diuretic therapy or a low-solute diet in tandem with SIAD. Despite their popularity, there is no compelling evidence for efficacy of salt tablets in SIAD.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Therapeutic approach in patients with dysnatraemias [^113935jW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Rapid correction of dysnatraemias is frequently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to estimate the proper volume and type of infusate required to change the serum sodium concentration predictably. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility or/and the accuracy of the Adrogue-Madias formula in managing patients with hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia.

Methods

Among the 317 patients who either on admission to our internal medicine clinic or during their hospitalization were found to have hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia, we studied 189 patients (59.6%) in whom the administration of intravenous solutions was required for the correction of dysnatraemias.

Results

Twelve hours after starting the administration of intravenous solutions the anticipated as well as the achieved serum sodium concentration were as follows: in volume depleted patients 130.2 ± 4.1 vs 131.3 ± 5.2 meq/l (n = 45; P = NS), in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) patients 127.4 ± 5.7 vs 128.9 ± 5.9 meq/l (n = 10; P = NS), in patients with diuretic-induced hyponatraemia 123.8 ± 6 vs 125.5 ± 5.6 meq/l (n = 29; P = NS), in patients with primary polydipsia 122.5 ± 0.7 vs 129 ± 1.4 meq/l (n = 2; P = 0.02), while in patients with hypernatraemia 153.6 ± 7.5 vs 156.5 ± 8.9 meq/l (n = 92; P = 0.021). Furthermore, 24 h from the initiation of the therapeutic intervention the expected and the achieved serum sodium concentrations were 130 ± 4 vs 135.6 ± 3.3 meq/l (n = 15; P = 0.002) in patients with volume depletion, 128.1 ± 4.8 vs 130 ± 4.5 meq/l (n = 15; P = NS) in patients with diuretic-induced hyponatraemia and 151.5 ± 6.4 vs 153.3 ± 8.3 meq/l (n = 67; P = NS) in patients with hypernatraemia.

Conclusions

The formula that has been proposed by Adrogue and Madias predicted with relative accuracy the changes in serum sodium concentration in almost all patients. Thus, it should be considered as a very useful tool for the management of dysnatraemias. However, special attention should be paid when this equation is used in patients with hyponatraemia due to extracellular volume depletion after euvolaemia's restoration and primary polydipsia in order to avoid rapid correction of hyponatraemia.

### Management of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115ycmPv]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Avoidance of hypovolemia and hyponatremia

Hyponatremia and hypovolemia occur frequently after SAH due to physiological changes favoring excessive natriuresis and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone elevation, and have been associated with impending DCI. Retrospective data indicate that fluid restriction, the typical treatment for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), can be deleterious and increases the risk of DCI due to aggravation of hypovolemia. Isotonic crystalloid fluid resuscitation targeting normal serum sodium values and euvolemia is presently the favored fluid management strategy for preventing DCI. The latter is notoriously difficult to assess in critically ill patients, and the readers are referred to papers dedicated to this specific subject for a more in-depth approach to the matter. Administration of fludrocortisone (between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/day) has been shown to reduce the occurrence of hyponatremia, with some indication towards DCI reduction. Anecdotal evidence indicates that correction of acute symptomatic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline (3%) infusion is usually effective.

### Torsemide (demadex) [^114QNpcg]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Hepatic Disease With Cirrhosis and
Ascites

DEMADEX should be used with caution in patients with hepatic
disease with cirrhosis and ascites, since sudden alterations of fluid and
electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. In these patients, diuresis
with DEMADEX (or any other diuretic) is best initiated in the hospital. To
prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, an aldosterone antagonist or
potassium-sparing drug should be used concomitantly with DEMADEX.

Ototoxicity

Tinnitus and hearing loss (usually
reversible) have been observed after rapid intravenous injection of other loop
diuretics and have also been observed after oral DEMADEX. It is not certain that
these events were attributable to DEMADEX. Ototoxicity has also been seen in
animal studies when very high plasma levels of torsemide were induced.

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

Patients
receiving diuretics should be observed for clinical evidence of electrolyte
imbalance, hypovolemia, or prerenal azotemia. Symptoms of these disturbances may
include one or more of the following: dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness,
lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue,
hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Excessive diuresis may
cause dehydration, blood-volume reduction, and possibly thrombosis and embolism,
especially in elderly patients. In patients who develop fluid and electrolyte
imbalances, hypovolemia, or prerenal azotemia, the observed laboratory changes
may include hyper- or hyponatremia, hyper- or hypochloremia, hyper- or
hypokalemia, acid-base abnormalities, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
If any of these occur, DEMADEX should be discontinued until the situation is
corrected; DEMADEX may be restarted at a lower dose.

### Hypertension in cancer patients and survivors: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^114DH6YD]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In individuals at high risk of volume depletion who also have proteinuria, it may be preferable to defer renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs or, in those with transient risk of volume loss, recommend a sick-day protocol to temporarily withhold these medications on days in which they have symptoms. Correspondingly, diuretic and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapies are often added, or titrated, later in the cascade of antihypertensive therapy in patients on undergoing active cancer treatment, because these patients are at higher risk for volume depletion through reduced intake of nutrients and fluids, as well as increased volume losses from diarrhea or vomiting, predisposing them to electrolyte abnormalities and acute kidney injury. If there is no further individual-level contraindication, diuretic therapy (specifically thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics) should be considered first-line therapy in patients undergoing active surveillance and in cancer survivors. Similarly, if there is no contraindication, mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy should be used in individuals with resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia.

Depending on the half-life and frequency of chemotherapy administration, some individuals may not be able to be treated with a fixed dose of antihypertensive medication. These individuals may particularly benefit from frequent home blood pressure monitoring (see the preceding section Approach to out-of-office blood pressure monitoring), including instructions on antihypertensive medication–holding parameters and appropriate supplemental dosing of antihypertensive medications for fluctuations in blood pressures related to chemotherapy administration and side effects.

Consideration of medication interactions, interfering substances, and polypharmacy

Currently, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem are avoided because they use cytochrome p450 3A4, a feature shared by many chemotherapy agents, risking potentiation of chemotherapy toxicity by inhibiting chemotherapy drug metabolism.

In some individuals undergoing active cancer treatment, the blood pressure cannot be controlled even with multiple antihypertensive agents. In this case, it is reasonable to discuss with the oncologist and the patient a trial of chemotherapy dose reduction, or a chemotherapeutic holiday period. It is also reasonable to consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of other therapeutic agents that may be contributing to high blood pressures, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and high-dose corticosteroids.

Polypharmacy is common in cancer patients. In individuals who require > 1 agent to achieve adequate blood pressure control, it is reasonable to use fixed-dose combinations of first-line agents to minimize pill burden and optimize adherence.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

### Impact of protocolized diuresis for de-resuscitation in the intensive care unit [^1146n99L]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Administration of diuretics has been shown to assist fluid management and improve clinical outcomes in the critically ill post-shock resolution. Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill.

Methods

This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance ≥ 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR − 2257 (− 5676–920) mL vs 265 (− 2283–3025) mL; p < 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated.

Conclusions

This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.

### Euvolemia – A critical target in the management of acute kidney injury [^1168dazj]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been clearly established that critically ill patients with sepsis require prompt fluid resuscitation. The optimal amount of fluid and when to taper this resuscitation is less clear. There is a growing evidence that fluid overload leads to acute kidney injury, and increased morbidity and mortality. A clinician's best intentions in resuscitating a patient can lead to too much of a good thing. Currently, there are several bedside tools to aid in determining a patient's response to a fluid challenge as well as in the assessment of the current volume status. Guidelines are not available on the exact rate of fluid overload removal and what medicinal or mechanical modality is most favorable. We discuss our experience and an examination of the literature on the problems with fluid overload, and how a patient may benefit from forced fluid removal.

### Intravenous fluid therapy in critically ill adults [^116DR42o]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous fluid therapy is one of the most common interventions in acutely ill patients. Each day, over 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) receive intravenous fluid resuscitation, and more than 30% receive fluid resuscitation during their first day in the ICU. Virtually all hospitalized patients receive intravenous fluid to maintain hydration and as diluents for drug administration. Until recently, the amount and type of fluids administered were based on a theory described over 100 years ago, much of which is inconsistent with current physiological data and emerging knowledge. Despite their widespread use, various fluids for intravenous administration have entered clinical practice without a robust evaluation of their safety and efficacy. High-quality, investigator-initiated studies have revealed that some of these fluids have unacceptable toxicity; as a result, several have been withdrawn from the market (while others, controversially, are still in use). The belief that dehydration and hypovolaemia can cause or worsen kidney and other vital organ injury has resulted in liberal approaches to fluid therapy and the view that fluid overload and tissue oedema are 'normal' during critical illness; this is quite possibly harming patients. Increasing evidence indicates that restrictive fluid strategies might improve outcomes.

### Pulmonary edema and blood volume after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a prospective observational study [^1158Q3f3]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary edema (PED) is a severe complication in patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. PED can result in severe hypoxemia and thus contribute to cerebral hypoxia in a brain that is already vulnerable to secondary injury. PED thereby increases the risk of poor outcome. Next to such well-known causes of PED as cardiac failure or inflammatory reactions in the pulmonary tissue (for example, in sepsis), PED after SAH can have a neurogenic origin. Neurogenic PED is defined as an increase in interstitial and alveolar lung fluid occurring as a direct consequence of an acute central nervous system injury.

In the pathophysiology of neurogenic PED, several mechanisms are involved. An abrupt increase in intracranial pressure or a localized ischemic insult in so-called neurogenic PED trigger zones, in the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata, leads to a massive sympathetic discharge. Severe systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction ensues, with systemic hypertension and a marked increase in pulmonary hydrostatic pressure. This is followed by a fluid shift from the pulmonary capillaries into the lung tissue. Furthermore, the cerebral insult leads to inflammatory responses in the brain, with an increase in the production of brain cytokines, which can trigger inflammatory processes outside the brain. A systemic inflammatory response is accompanied by capillary leakage and the formation of generalized and pulmonary edema. The supraphysiologic sympathetic stimulation may also provoke cardiac dysfunctions with rhythm and conduction disturbances and mechanical pump failure, which contribute to the formation of PED.

Management of PED after SAH is centered on the traditional treatment strategies for cardiac failure-induced pulmonary edema, such as a reduction in preload and afterload and the use of inotropics. A reduction in preload, by administration of diuretics and by a reduction in fluid intake, carries a risk of intravascular volume depletion. Patients after SAH already have a high risk of hypovolemia, and hypovolemia is associated with delayed cerebral ischemia and with poor outcome. The avoidance of hypovolemia by ample fluid intake and, in some cases, the induction of hypervolemia, is therefore a mainstay of treatment after SAH. To guide fluid management adequately, an accurate knowledge of volume status is required.

We assessed intravascular volume in patients after SAH and compared it between patients in whom PED did or did not develop.

### Impact on fluid balance of an optimized restrictive strategy targeting non-resuscitative fluids in intensive care patients with septic shock: a single-blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled, pilot study [^114P2crU]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimized restrictive strategy (experimental group)

A restrictive fluid protocol was applied upon inclusion on Day 1 and continued for the first 7 days of hospitalization in the ICU. Clinicians were instructed to reduce fluid intake as much as possible in terms of maintenance fluids, drug dilution and artificial nutrition. The management of resuscitative fluids, defined as fluids prescribed to optimize blood volume in the treatment of shock, was not modified by the protocol, and was left to the judgement of clinicians according to their usual monitoring strategy (cardiac ultrasound, pulse index continuous cardiac output, right heart catheterization, central venous pressure, etc.). For drug dilutions, the clinicians consulted charts (Supplementary Table S2) showing the maximum possible concentrations for the drugs most frequently used in ICU, particularly antibiotics, based on literature data. For artificial nutrition, the intravenous route was discouraged before Day 5. For enteral nutrition, the protocol provided for the use of a hypercaloric (2 kcal/ml) high protein product, with a total caloric objective of 20 kcal/kg per day in the acute phase and 30 kcal/kg per day after stabilization. Intravenous fluids other than those needed to dilute drugs and electrolytes were prohibited, and only 2 ml/hour of saline or glucose were authorized to maintain veins. A clinical pharmacist intervened daily to check adherence to the fluid restriction protocol. If the restrictive strategy induced hypovolemia and/or biological abnormalities (sodium, potassium, chloride, etc.), the treating physician could increase fluid therapy in accordance with the protocol's recommendations. The fluid restriction strategy did not involve the systematic administration of diuretics.

Standard fluid strategy (control group)

The choice of the volume of fluid intake other than resuscitative fluids was left to the physician's discretion, based on usual practices: usually between 500 and 2000 ml/day of maintenance volumes. The dilutions of drugs were those officially planned at the time of marketing approval, enteral artificial nutrition (isocaloric, high protein) was initiated as soon as possible, with the same rules for parenteral nutrition if the caloric target could not be reached with enteral nutrition.

Diuretics were authorized in both groups at the judgement of the clinicians according to the needs of the patients, but were not recommended as long as patients had high dose vasopressors.

### Hyponatremia in acute decompensated heart failure: depletion versus dilution [^114NEZkY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia frequently poses a therapeutic challenge in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Treating physicians should differentiate between depletional versus dilutional hyponatremia. The former is caused by diuretic agents, which enhance sodium excretion, often with concomitant potassium/magnesium losses. This can be treated with isotonic saline, whereas potassium/magnesium administration may be helpful if plasma concentrations are low. In contrast, as impaired water excretion, rather than sodium deficiency, is the culprit in dilutional hyponatremia, isotonic saline administration may further depress the serum sodium concentration. Because free water excretion is achieved by continuous sodium reabsorption in distal nephron segments with low water permeability, diuretic agents that impair this mechanism (e.g., thiazide-type diuretic agents and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) should be avoided, and proximally acting agents (e.g., acetazolamide and loop diuretic agents) are preferred. Vasopressin antagonists, which promote low water permeability in the collecting ducts and, hence, free water excretion, remain under investigation for dilutional hyponatremia in ADHF.

Renal replacement therapy

In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, perioperative fluid overload has been associated with worse outcomes and is a primary risk factor for multiorgan failure, including AKI. 214, 215, 216 Fluid balance can be achieved with pharmacological agents; however, in some cases, RRT should be considered to correct fluid accumulation, even in nonoliguric patients if the daily fluid balance cannot be maintained or is negative with the use of diuretics, to avoid the negative effects of prolonged fluid overload in critically ill patients (Figure 5). 217, 218, 219

Figure 5
Fluid management strategies in critical illness: the place of mechanical fluid removal. Once life‐threatening hypovolemia has been corrected (savage resuscitation), fluid overload needs to be avoided. Early mechanical fluid removal should be considered if specific indications exist. Note, the existence of an extracorporeal circuit for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation greatly reduces any added risk for renal replacement therapy, assuming this circuit is used rather than a separate line for. However, some patients will respond well to diuretics, and thus ancircuit in place is only a relative indication for earlyinitiation and only when fluid or solute management dictates. During therapy, hemodynamic and intravascular volume status should be monitored and fluid removal rate and fluid balance targets reassessed regularly, aiming for clinical stability and tolerance of fluid removal. Within this pathway, should be considered at any point if additional solute clearance is necessary.indicates fluid balance;, ultrafiltration.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^112mTDH6]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

How do we prescribe fluids?

The choice of intravenous fluid should be based on consideration of certain baseline factors, but also on elements that arise during therapy. For example, at baseline, administration of saline may be indicated in the presence of hypochloremia whereas a hypotonic fluid may be warranted in the presence of hypernatremia. Importantly, the situation may evolve with time as the fluid administered may induce metabolic changes leading to a different "best" fluid choice. Giving several liters of 0.9% saline will result in hyperchloremia, so continuing this fluid strategy is not rational.

### Volume management in continuous renal replacement therapy [^113eN7NN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Volume management is an integral component of the care of critically ill patients to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. The dynamic nature of critical illness often necessitates volume resuscitation and contributes to fluid overload particularly in the presence of altered renal function. Diuretics are commonly used as an initial therapy to increase urine output; however they have limited effectiveness due to underlying acute kidney injury and other factors contributing to diuretic resistance. Continuous renal replacement techniques (CRRT) are often required for volume management. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate assessment of fluid status, an adequate comprehension of the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals. Complications related to excessive ultrafiltration can occur and have serious consequences. A careful monitoring of fluid balance is therefore essential for all patients. This review provides an overview of the appropriate assessment and management of volume status in critically ill patients and its management with CRRT to optimize organ function and prevent complications of fluid overload.

### "Pleurex desalination" in malignancy-related ascites: a novel mechanism of hyponatremia [^113FbeC4]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pleurex catheters are a form of palliative therapy for patients, offering relief from symptomatic ascites while also affording greater independence and flexibility; however, aggressive drainage can lead to significant total body sodium losses. We describe the course of patients with "Pleurex desalination", an under-appreciated cause of hypovolemic hyponatremia, highlighting its unique pathophysiology and providing recommendations on how to manage these complex patients.

Patients and Methods

We included representative patients with "Pleurex desalination" who were evaluated and treated by the renal consult service at Brigham and Women's between 2017 and 2019.

Results

We identified 3 patients who were hospitalized with "Pleurex desalination" and had complete data on serum and urine studies, as well as treatment course. We demonstrate that patients with "Pleurex desalination" were removing up to 1 to 2L of ascitic fluid a day and were admitted with signs and symptoms of profound hypovolemia and hyponatremia. Patients worsened with administration of diuretics and salt restriction and improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation in the form of hypertonic saline, normal saline, and/or intravenous albumin.

Conclusion

"Pleurex desalination" is an under-recognized cause of hyponatremia; at-risk patients require close observation and periodic resuscitation with intravenous, volume-expanding fluids.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^111Sd7xR]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) — diuretics and fluid management states that once patients develop signs of right-sided heart failure (HF) and oedema, restricting fluid intake and using diuretics is recommended, with loop diuretics, thiazides, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists used as monotherapy or in combination according to clinical need and kidney function. Patients on diuretics should regularly monitor body weight and seek medical advice in case of weight gain; kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided due to risks of reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Clinicians should also recognize that fluid retention and oedema may be a side effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.

### Oral hydration before and after hip replacement: the notion behind every action [^112Xyb5x]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

The Surgical Perspective

Fluid balance disturbances can be classified into changes in volume (hypervolemia, euvolemia, hypovolemia), concentration (mainly hyponatremia), composition (variations of ions other than sodium), and distribution (fluid shifts). It is not uncommon to find one of them during the preoperative assessment of older subjects with uncompensated cardiovascular diseases, reduced renal function, liver disease, polydipsia, hypertriglyceridemia, excessive water consumption, or on a low-salt diet. These patients are the ones more likely to have electrolyte imbalances also after surgery. Other causes of fluid disturbances can be long-term medications, which should be considered whether to stop or replace before surgery. For instance, vigorous therapy with thiazide diuretics or loop diuretics can cause blood sodium to plummet, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists might expose to hypotension after the induction of anesthesia, potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to hyperkalemia in case of prolonged reduction of renal perfusion during surgery. Patients must have a good hydration status once positioned on the operating table. The inevitable tissue damage causes changes in fluid concentration and distribution, with inflammation and neuroendocrine activation causing sodium-containing fluids to be sequestered into the interstitial space. Being no more part of the circulatory dynamics, the isotonic fluid translocations deplete the volume of blood that, in turn, triggers the secretion of aldosterone causing oliguria. Bleeding is a relevant extra-renal loss to be considered in surgery but, during modern total hip replacement, it does not usually exceed 10% of the circulating volume because of practices that avoid undesirable hypothermia and the hemostatic effect of tranexamic acid. In theatre, the patient's wound remains open for about 60 minutes, a time that is likely not to contribute significantly to water losses from body tissues exposed to air. Despite the intraoperative bolus of glucocorticoids or the use of cryotherapy with intermittent compression after surgery, it is expected that traumas of muscles and other soft tissues would cause a certain degree of glycocalyx impairment, endothelial dysfunction, and fluid leakage, disturbing the maintenance of euvolemia and creating a certain degree of lower limb edema. The hip procedure does not directly affect the abdominal area and, therefore, it is reasonable to exclude splanchnic bed extravasation or bowel edema. Over time, the edematous muscles and tissues adjacent to the implant heal and return to 75% and 10% of normal hydration, respectively, thus supporting the movement in the correct lever arm.

### Mechanisms of action, physiological effects, and complications of hypothermia [^112A4ab8]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mild to moderate hypothermia (32–35 degrees C) is the first treatment with proven efficacy for postischemic neurological injury. In recent years important insights have been gained into the mechanisms underlying hypothermia's protective effects; in addition, physiological and pathophysiological changes associated with cooling have become better understood.

Objective

To discuss hypothermia's mechanisms of action, to review (patho)physiological changes associated with cooling, and to discuss potential side effects.

Design

Review article.

Interventions

None.

Main Results

A myriad of destructive processes unfold in injured tissue following ischemia-reperfusion. These include excitotoxicty, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, free radical production, seizure activity, blood-brain barrier disruption, blood vessel leakage, cerebral thermopooling, and numerous others. The severity of this destructive cascade determines whether injured cells will survive or die. Hypothermia can inhibit or mitigate all of these mechanisms, while stimulating protective systems such as early gene activation. Hypothermia is also effective in mitigating intracranial hypertension and reducing brain edema. Side effects include immunosuppression with increased infection risk, cold diuresis and hypovolemia, electrolyte disorders, insulin resistance, impaired drug clearance, and mild coagulopathy. Targeted interventions are required to effectively manage these side effects. Hypothermia does not decrease myocardial contractility or induce hypotension if hypovolemia is corrected, and preliminary evidence suggests that it can be safely used in patients with cardiac shock. Cardiac output will decrease due to hypothermia-induced bradycardia, but given that metabolic rate also decreases the balance between supply and demand, is usually maintained or improved. In contrast to deep hypothermia (≤ 30 degrees C), moderate hypothermia does not induce arrhythmias; indeed, the evidence suggests that arrhythmias can be prevented and/or more easily treated under hypothermic conditions.

Conclusions

Therapeutic hypothermia is a highly promising treatment, but the potential side effects need to be properly managed particularly if prolonged treatment periods are required. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, awareness of physiological changes associated with cooling, and prevention of potential side effects are all key factors for its effective clinical usage.

### Restrictive fluid management with early de-escalation versus usual care in critically ill patients (reduce trial): a feasibility randomized controlled trial [^116DCVmH]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlike the above studies, our trial implemented a fluid management protocol after initial resuscitation, once hemodynamics was stable. Both groups received approximately 4.5 L of fluid prior to randomization. Then, this protocol optimized fluid administration, minimized inadvertent fluid, and employed active de-resuscitation using diuretics and RRT if needed. We specifically targeted a neutral to negative fluid balance after initial fluid resuscitation, which should be tailored to each patient's baseline characteristics, comorbidities, illness severity, prior fluid administration, and diagnosis. At randomization, participants had received an average intravenous fluid volume exceeding 30 mL/kg, aligning with the CLASSIC and CLOVERS trials and with Surviving Sepsis Guidelines for adequate initial fluid resuscitation. The total fluid balance during our study was higher than in some prior trials. A retrospective analysis by Murphy et al. suggested that administering more than 20 mL/kg of intravenous fluids and achieving a central venous pressure higher than 8 mmHg might reduce hospital mortality. This approach should be followed by conservative late fluid management, aiming for at least 2 consecutive days of neutral or negative fluid balance in the first week after sepsis onset.

Our study reached a neutral or negative fluid balance despite similar diuretic doses between groups. Adequate initial fluid resuscitation may enhance early tissue perfusion, while subsequent fluid restriction likely prevents renal congestion and improves kidney function. Consequently, diuretic requirements to increase urine output may be lower.

We observed potential clinical benefits associated with a restrictive fluid strategy, including a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, more ventilator-free days and vasopressor-free days and reduced ICU and hospital stays. A secondary analysis of the CLOVER trial showed that in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and sepsis-induced hypotension, an early restrictive fluid management was associated with longer ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days. Similarly, Previous comparisons of liberal and conservative fluid strategies in acute lung injury patients showed that conservative fluid management improved ventilator-free days, organ-failure‒free days, and ICU-free days. One possible mechanism is that minimizing fluid overload may enhance vasopressor responsiveness and preserve organ function. However, a subgroup analysis in the RADAR-2 study found that active de-resuscitation within 24–48 h of ICU admission could increase mortality risk in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. These findings highlight the need to individualize active de-resuscitation.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^116GZr6X]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid overload is frequently found in acute kidney injury patients in critical care units. Recent studies have shown the relationship of fluid overload with adverse outcomes; hence, manage and optimization of fluid balance becomes a central component of the management of critically ill patients.

Discussion

In critically ill patients, in order to restore cardiac output, systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion an adequate fluid resuscitation is essential. Achieving an appropriate level of volume management requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology, evaluation of volume status, and selection of appropriate solution for volume repletion, and maintenance and modulation of the tissue perfusion. Numerous recent studies have established a correlation between fluid overload and mortality in critically ill patients. Fluid overload recognition and assessment requires an accurate documentation of intakes and outputs; yet, there is a wide difference in how it is evaluated, reviewed and utilized. Accurate volume status evaluation is essential for appropriate therapy since errors of volume evaluation can result in either in lack of essential treatment or unnecessary fluid administration, and both scenarios are associated with increased mortality. There are several methods to evaluate fluid status; however, most of the tests currently used are fairly inaccurate. Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative. Fluid overload refractory to medical therapy requires the application of extracorporeal therapies. In critically ill patients, fluid overload is related to increased mortality and also lead to several complications like pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, delayed wound healing, tissue breakdown, and impaired bowel function. Therefore, the evaluation of volume status is crucial in the early management of critically ill patients. Diuretics are frequently used as an initial therapy; however, due to their limited effectiveness the use of continuous renal replacement techniques are often required for fluid overload treatment. Successful fluid overload treatment depends on precise assessment of individual volume status, understanding the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals.

### Severe hyponatremia as a result of thiazide diuretic… [^116LCRTB]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Laboratory findings were significant: sodium, 100 mEq per L; potassium, 2. 4 mEq per L. Serum osmolality was reduced at 208 mOsm per kg of water, cortisol level was high at 26. 6 μg per dL; and urine was dilute with a specific gravity of
1. 010 but low urinary sodium at less than 10 mEq per L. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring and received normal saline with thiamine, folate, magnesium and potassium supplementation to cautiously correct electrolyte abnormalities. The diuretic was discontinued. During a five-day hospital stay, the patient demonstrated improved cognition and strength.

Follow-up, outpatient electrolyte monitoring revealed continued resolution of the hyponatremia. Hyponatremia associated with low plasma osmolality and decreased extracellular fluid volume can be caused by diuretic therapy and vomiting. Additional causes of hyponatremia include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism, polydipsia, and medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In the absence of other causes, this patient's profound hyponatremia is believed to be a result of diuretic therapy. Thiazide diuretics work at the site of the distal tubule by inhibiting uptake of sodium and chloride. While cases of thiazide-induced hyponatremia are well documented, this severity of hyponatremia is unusual. Antihypertensive therapy choice is a chief concern for family physicians. First-line therapy in patients who are hypertensive is frequently a diuretic or beta blocker.

1 Family physicians must be aware of the potential for thiazide diuretics to induce hyponatremia.

### The role of diuretics in the treatment of heart failure… [^115RNyx7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

TRADITIONALLY, nephrologists have focused on a defect in the salt-excreting capacity of the kidney as pivotal to edema formation in heart failure. 1 Furthermore, based on the concept of "effective central blood volume, " they have argued that the renal response is appropriate to the afferent stimuli impacting the kidney, ie, "relative hypoperfusion of the kidneys". Thus, it seems logical that the first order for therapeutic management of congestive heart failure would involve elimination of the excess salt and water contained principally in the extracellular volume. To accomplish this, pharmacologically active diuretic compounds have been employed with both substantial success and recognized imperfections. One might inquire as to the logic of causing a diureticinduced volume depletion that will cause a fall in cardiac output through a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

It would be more logical to either add an ionotropic agent that would improve cardiac performance through. Porter GA. The Role of Diuretics in the Treatment of Heart Failure. JAMA. 1980; 244: 1614–1616. doi:

### Diuretic-inducedn hyponatremia… [^116rUJ7n]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A decrement in the serunm concentration of sodium is a common complication of diuretic therapy. Usually this electrolyte disorder develops insidiously, the degree of hyponatremia is modest, the patient is asymptomatic, and it improves after cessation of treatment. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia, on the other hand, is rare but constitutes a medical emergency. The symptoms of severe hyponatremia can range from mental obtundation to deep coma, convulsions, and death. Because this clinical presentation is nonspecific, severe hyponatremia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient taking diuretics who exhibits these symptoms and signs. Studies performed in hospitalized patients show an incidence of severe hyponatremia of approximately 0. 5%. In 27% of these cases, the hyponatremia was associated with the use of diuretics.
