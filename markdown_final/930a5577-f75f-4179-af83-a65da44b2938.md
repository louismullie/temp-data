## Question

Can you explain this: 6. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure cannot be determined because TR is insufficient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when an echocardiogram reports that pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) cannot be determined because tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficient, and why that happens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard Doppler method used to estimate PASP and its assumptions. Then, I should verify what "insufficient TR" means technically and clinically. Next, I will examine why the calculation fails without a reliable TR signal and address the common misconception that absent TR implies normal pulmonary pressures. After that, I should review sources of overestimation and underestimation tied to TR characteristics, consider alternative echo clues when TR is absent, and integrate when to move to right heart catheterization per guidelines, before summarizing the key takeaways with supporting data and references [^1154adwc] [^111LL11z].

> Let me first confirm the standard method. PASP by transthoracic echocardiography is estimated from the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), calculated as 4 × (peak TR velocity)² + estimated right atrial pressure by the simplified Bernoulli equation, and in the absence of right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary valve obstruction, RVSP approximates PASP. Wait, I should verify the assumption about equivalence: RVSP equals PASP only if there is no significant pulmonary valve stenosis or RVOT obstruction; otherwise, the estimated gradient incorporates additional resistance and will not reflect true PASP. Accurate measurement also requires optimal Doppler alignment and the highest-quality TR envelope across windows to minimize angle error and signal dropout [^1154adwc] [^114AxoQK] [^112uoL9w] [^111LL11z].

> Now, what does "insufficient TR" actually mean? Hold on, I should be precise. It refers to cases where the TR Doppler spectral envelope is absent or technically inadequate for reliable peak velocity assessment, either because no measurable TR jet is present, the jet is too faint to yield a complete envelope, or image quality and suboptimal beam–jet alignment preclude accurate tracing. I need to ensure I'm not overinterpreting equivocal signals; a partial or noisy envelope is not suitable for confident velocity squared calculations, and angle error beyond modest degrees can materially depress measured velocity and bias the estimate [^111LL11z] [^114AxoQK] [^112wuZTY].

> Why can't PASP be estimated when TR is insufficient? Let me think about the equation itself. Without a reliable peak TR velocity, the Bernoulli term 4v² cannot be computed, so the RV–RA systolic gradient is indeterminate and, by extension, RVSP and PASP are indeterminate. Wait, could we substitute another jet? Sometimes pulmonary regurgitation or shunt-derived gradients can help in select circumstances, but for routine PASP estimation the validated pathway is via a measurable TR velocity, and in its absence echocardiography cannot provide a numeric PASP, which is a core limitation underscored by accuracy reviews of echo versus catheterization [^111LL11z] [^114AxoQK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that "no TR means normal". I might initially assume that absent TR suggests normal right-sided pressures; wait, let me verify if that assumption holds. A Vanderbilt cohort undergoing near-simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization found that when no tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) was reported, 47% still had pulmonary hypertension by invasive criteria, and the negative predictive value of absent TRV for excluding PH was only 53%, barely better than chance. In other words, absence of a measurable TR jet is not reassuring for normal pulmonary pressure and can coexist with significant PH, particularly in patients with comorbid cardiac disease and RV dysfunction [^116z3NxU] [^111LL11z].

> I should also review how TR characteristics can bias estimation when a jet is present. Severe TR can underestimate PASP because rapid equilibration of RV and RA systolic pressures blunts the gradient and lowers the apparent peak velocity; low-flow states or a noncompliant right atrium can have similar effects. Conversely, unrecognized RVOT or pulmonary valve stenosis can lead to systematic overestimation if one assumes RVSP equals PASP. Let me double-check: these pitfalls are well described in consensus documents and accuracy analyses, reinforcing the need for meticulous Doppler technique and cautious interpretation in severe TR or suspected outflow obstruction [^112uoL9w] [^114AxoQK] [^116FTQSu].

> Next, when TR is insufficient, I need to ensure we do not abandon the echocardiogram altogether. I should review indirect echocardiographic signs that raise or lower pretest probability of PH: septal flattening with D-shaped LV in systole, RV and RA enlargement, pulmonary artery dilation, pericardial effusion, shortened pulmonary acceleration time, and RV systolic dysfunction on TAPSE or S′. Wait a minute, TAPSE is load-dependent; still, integrated right heart size and function, along with PA dimensions and septal contour, can strengthen suspicion and help triage to invasive testing when needed, recognizing echo remains a screening tool rather than a diagnostic gold standard for PH [^112wuZTY] [^111LL11z].

> I need to integrate the clinical context next. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, edema, syncope or presyncope, and biomarkers like BNP or NT-proBNP, especially in patients with left heart disease, lung disease, connective tissue disease, or thromboembolic risk, should raise the pretest probability. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse this integrative approach; they do, recommending echo to screen and clinical features to risk-stratify, reserving definitive hemodynamics for cases with moderate-to-high suspicion or discordant data [^112wuZTY] [^111LL11z].

> When suspicion persists and TR is insufficient for PASP estimation, I should confirm the next step. Right heart catheterization is the reference standard to diagnose or exclude pulmonary hypertension, quantify cardiac output, and measure pulmonary vascular resistance. Let me check the guideline phrasing: major guidelines emphasize that echo is a screening modality and that invasive hemodynamics are indicated when echo data are inadequate or discordant with clinical findings, including explicit recommendations to proceed to catheterization in such circumstances and to use invasive assessment for precise pulmonary pressures and related indices [^111LL11z] [^114Gp8c7] [^1143LhNM] [^1154adwc].

> But wait, what if a measurable TRV is present yet borderline? I should double-check the evolving screening thresholds. With the modern hemodynamic definition of PH as mean PA pressure > 20 mm Hg, TRV cut points to screen for PH have been re-examined, with data suggesting that lower thresholds such as approximately 2.7 m/s optimize sensitivity, whereas higher thresholds improve specificity. However, if no reliable TRV is obtainable, these thresholds are moot, and the decision to proceed hinges on indirect echo signs and clinical suspicion rather than an absent or unreadable jet [^113XKEP2] [^111LL11z].

> Let me reconsider one more potential pitfall. I initially focused on nonsevere TR as the "ideal" scenario for PASP estimation; however, in severe TR, echo-derived PASP may be falsely low despite high invasive PA pressures, and such discordance has prognostic implications in TR populations. I need to ensure this caveat is clear because it prevents false reassurance when a low estimated PASP coexists with advanced right-sided disease and severe TR [^112uoL9w] [^114AxoQK].

> In summary, insufficient TR precludes PASP estimation because the validated Doppler approach fundamentally requires a measurable TR velocity to compute the RV–RA systolic gradient; without that velocity, the calculation cannot be performed. I should emphasize that absence of a measurable TRV does not exclude pulmonary hypertension, as nearly half of such patients can have PH on invasive testing and the negative predictive value of absent TRV is poor. Therefore, when TR is insufficient, clinicians should integrate indirect echocardiographic signs and the clinical context, and proceed to right heart catheterization when suspicion remains moderate to high, consistent with guideline recommendations and accuracy data, avoiding the dangerous shortcut of equating "no TR" with "normal PASP" [^116z3NxU] [^111LL11z] [^114Gp8c7] [^1154adwc].

This means the echocardiogram **could not estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)** because the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet was too weak or absent to measure [^114AxoQK]. PASP is typically **calculated from the TR jet velocity using the Bernoulli equation**, plus right atrial pressure; therefore, without a measurable TR jet, PASP cannot be determined noninvasively [^111QFmko] [^1154adwc]. This **does not rule out pulmonary hypertension**; if clinical suspicion remains, consider right heart catheterization or alternative echocardiographic indices [^116z3NxU] [^114Gp8c7] [^111LL11z].

## Clinical significance of insufficient tricuspid regurgitation

- **Normal or low right-sided pressures**: Minimal TR can indicate normal or low right-sided pressures, but this is not definitive [^115DLAQD].

- **Technical limitations**: Poor acoustic windows, suboptimal Doppler alignment, or patient factors (e.g. obesity, lung disease) can limit TR jet detection [^111LL11z].

- **Valve pathology**: Tricuspid stenosis or prosthetic valves can reduce TR jet velocity, making PASP estimation difficult.

## Alternative methods for estimating pulmonary artery systolic pressure

| **Method** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) jet | Use PR jet velocity to estimate mean/diastolic PA pressure | - PR jet often weak or absent <br/> - Less reliable for PASP |
| Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) | Shorter PAAT suggests higher PA pressures [^111LL11z] | - Indirect <br/> - Less accurate than TR-based PASP |
| Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) measurements | RVOT flow patterns can suggest elevated PA pressures [^111LL11z] | - Indirect <br/> - Less accurate than TR-based PASP |
| Right heart catheterization (RHC) | Gold standard for direct PA pressure measurement [^1143LhNM] | - Invasive <br/> - Procedural risks |

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

- **Pulmonary hypertension (PH)**: Absence of a measurable TR jet does not exclude PH; nearly half of such patients may have PH on catheterization [^116z3NxU].

- **Right heart function**: Evaluate RV size/function, right atrial size, and indirect signs of elevated PA pressure (e.g. septal flattening, dilated pulmonary arteries) [^112wuZTY].

- **Further testing**: If clinical suspicion persists, consider RHC or alternative echocardiographic indices [^114Gp8c7] [^1143LhNM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

In clinical guidelines, **ACC/AHA guidelines** advise obtaining TTE to assess TR severity and RV function and to estimate PASP [^1154adwc]; if noninvasive data are inadequate, consider invasive hemodynamics [^114Gp8c7]. ESC/ERS guidelines recommend **echocardiography** for initial PH assessment [^111LL11z], with confirmation by **RHC** when needed [^1143LhNM].

---

## Summary and clinical approach

"Unable to determine pulmonary artery systolic pressure due to insufficient TR" means the TR jet was **too weak or absent to estimate PASP noninvasively**. This **does not exclude PH** [^116z3NxU]; assess RV/RA size and function, look for indirect signs of elevated PA pressure [^1154adwc], and consider RHC or alternative indices if suspicion persists [^114Gp8c7].

### Lack of a tricuspid regurgitation Doppler signal and pulmonary hypertension by invasive measurement [^116z3NxU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, but an adequate tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) needed to calculate pulmonary artery systolic pressure is not always present. It is unknown whether the absence of a measurable TRV signifies normal pulmonary artery pressure.

- **Methods and results**: We extracted hemodynamic, TTE, and clinical data from Vanderbilt's deidentified electronic medical record for all patients referred for right heart catheterization between 1998 and 2014. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg. We examined the prevalence and clinical correlates of PH in patients without a reported TRV. We identified 1,262 patients with a TTE within 2 days of right heart catheterization. In total, 803 out of 1,262 (64%) had a reported TRV, whereas 459 (36%) had no reported TRV. Invasively confirmed PH was present in 47% of patients without a reported TRV versus 68% in those with a reported TRV (P < 0.001). Absence of a TRV yielded a negative predictive value for excluding PH of 53%. Right ventricular dysfunction, left atrial dimension, elevated body mass index, higher brain natriuretic peptide, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure were independently associated with PH among patients without a reported TRV.

- **Conclusions**: PH is present in almost half of the patients without a measurable TRV who are referred for both TTE and right heart catheterization. Clinical and echocardiographic features of left heart disease are associated with invasively confirmed PH in subjects without a reported TRV.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tricuspid regurgitation, specifically with respect to transthoracic echocardiography, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining TTE in patients with TR. This is to evaluate the presence and severity of TR, determine the etiology, measure the sizes of right-sided chambers and IVC, assess RV systolic function, estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and characterize any associated left-sided heart disease.

### Determinants of right ventricular pressure in mild hypertension [^1156kByt]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Doppler echocardiography was used to define reference values and determinants of tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity (TRV) in hypertensive patients. A TRV value greater than 2.5 m/s is the threshold usually defining abnormal right ventricular systolic pressure.

- **Design and patients**: Doppler echocardiography was performed in 320 consecutive uncomplicated hypertensive patients, without overt pulmonary or heart disease. The echocardiography included LV mass measurement, LV inflow and pulmonary venous flow analysis, LV systolic function, and TRV measurements.

- **Results**: Among 320 patients, 255 had normal TRV \(\leq\) 2.5 m/s. Compared with the normal TRV group, the elevated TRV group was older (60 versus 50 years, P < 0.0001), had higher systolic blood pressure (156 versus 151 mmHg, P = 0.02), and more frequent use of antihypertensive therapy (68% versus 51%, P = 0.02). Indexed LV mass was higher (45.4 versus 40.6 g/m\(^2.7\), P = 0.001), and pulmonary D wave peak velocity was higher (42 versus 38 cm/s, P = 0.03). In univariate analysis, age was the most predictive variable of TRV (r = 0.36). In multivariate analysis, three variables were independently related to TRV: age, LV mass, and pulmonary D wave (multiple r = 0.47).

- **Conclusion**: In mild hypertension, TRV is independently related to age, and to a lesser extent, to LV morphology and LV filling pressure. In clinical practice, age should be taken into account when interpreting TRV.

### Impaired right atrial function preceding right ventricular systolic dysfunction: Clinical utility and long-term prognostic value in pulmonary hypertension [^114CXFwf]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

A total of 106 precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) were included. Of these, four individuals were excluded due to atrial fibrillation, and six due to insufficient cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image quality. Among the included patients, 68 had pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 28 had chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The final analysis cohort comprised 36 PH patients without right ventricular systolic dysfunction (PH-nonRVSD), 60 PH patients with right ventricular systolic dysfunction (PH-RVSD), and 20 healthy controls (HCs). The interval between RHC and CMR was 6 (1–12) days.

Patients in the PH-nonRVSD group were significantly older than those in the PH-RVSD group (p = 0.005). PH-RVSD patients presented with higher brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) serum levels (p < 0.001) and a shorter 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) (p = 0.049). Among the RHC parameters, the PH-RVSD group demonstrated a significantly lower cardiac index (CI) (p = 0.004) and higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (p < 0.001) than the PH-nonRVSD group.

### Effects of morphologic left ventricular pressure on right ventricular geometry and tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries [^117D5CHX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR), which has been postulated to arise from the effect of ventricular septal position on the attachments of the tricuspid valve. This study was performed to determine the effect of left ventricular (LV) pressure on right ventricular (RV) and LV geometry and the degree of TR. Serial echocardiograms were reviewed from 30 patients with CCTGA who underwent pulmonary artery banding to train the morphologic left ventricle (n = 14) or left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement and ventricular septal defect closure in conjunction with physiologic repair (n = 16).

- **Degree of TR and LV/RV pressure ratio**: The degree of TR, the LV/RV pressure ratio, RV and LV sphericity indexes, and tricuspid valve tethering distance and coaptation length were analyzed. After pulmonary artery banding, an increase in LV systolic pressure to ≥ 2/3 systemic resulted in a decrease in TR from severe to moderate (p = 0.02). The percentage of patients with severe TR decreased from 64% to 18% (p = 0.06).

- **Sphericity indexes**: The RV sphericity index decreased (p = 0.05), and the LV sphericity index increased (p = 0.02). After left ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit placement, a decrease in LV pressure to ≤ 1/2 systemic resulted in an increase in TR from none to mild (p = 0.003).

In conclusion, these data indicate that LV pressure in patients with CCTGA affects the degree of TR and that septal shift caused by changes in LV and RV pressure is an important mechanism.

### Hemodialysis vascular access affects heart function and outcomes: Tips for choosing the right access for the individual patient [^111QFmko]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by the mean pulmonary artery pressure higher than 25 mmHg at rest or during exercise. This pressure can be measured either invasively using a Swan-Ganz catheter or estimated non-invasively by echocardiography. Symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and leg swelling. However, the vast majority of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with pulmonary hypertension are asymptomatic, with prevalence rates reaching up to 56%.

- **Estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure**: Systolic pulmonary artery pressure can be estimated in patients with at least mild tricuspid regurgitation. The pressure gradient between the right ventricle and right atrium is determined by the regurgitation velocity, using the Bernoulli equation. By adding the value of the central venous pressure — either measured in patients with a central catheter or estimated from the size and collapsibility of the inferior vena cava via ultrasound — we can determine the systolic pulmonary artery pressure.

Many factors contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, including a postcapillary component (such as arterial hypertension, left ventricular disease, aortic and mitral valvular disease), a precapillary component (such as volume overload and pulmonary embolism, which may result from thrombosed vascular access), and a hyperkinetic component (caused by arteriovenous fistula (AVF), anemia, inflammation, and volume overload per se).

### The hemodynamic basis of exercise intolerance in tricuspid regurgitation [^1126MEjH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) frequently present with exertional fatigue and dyspnea, but the hemodynamic basis for exercise limitation in people with TR remains unclear.

- **Methods and results**: Twelve subjects with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and grade ≥ 3 TR underwent high-fidelity invasive hemodynamic exercise testing with simultaneous expired gas analysis and were compared with 13 age- and sex-matched controls. At rest, TR subjects had lower pulmonary blood flow (3.6 ± 0.4 versus 5.1 ± 1.9 L/min; P = 0.01), increased right atrial pressure (12 ± 5 versus 4 ± 1 mm Hg; P = 0.0002), and higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (17 ± 5 versus 9 ± 3 mm Hg; P = 0.0001). However, LV transmural pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure-right atrial pressure), which reflects LV preload independent of right heart congestion and pericardial restraint, was similar in TR and controls (6 ± 3 versus 4 ± 2 mm Hg; P = 0.3). With exercise, TR subjects displayed lower peak VO2 (10.3 ± 2.8 versus 13.8 ± 4.2 mL/min per kg; P = 0.02), lower pulmonary blood flow (6.4 ± 1.3 versus 10.3 ± 3.3 L/min; P = 0.001), and less increase in pulmonary blood flow relative to VO2 (+4.6 ± 1.1 vs. +6.2 ± 0.7; P = 0.001). TR subjects displayed higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with exercise, but this was solely because of RA hypertension (27 ± 9 versus 8 ± 3 mm Hg; P < 0.0001), because LV transmural pressure dropped with exercise in subjects with TR (-5 ± 6 versus +3 ± 3 mm Hg; P = 0.0007), suggesting inadequate LV diastolic filling despite high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

- **Conclusions**: Impaired e

### Revatio [^112hZadk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Revatio (SUPER-1) was conducted in 277 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mmHg at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg. Patients were predominantly classified as WHO Functional Classes II-III.

Allowed background therapy included a combination of anticoagulants, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and oxygen. The use of prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and arginine supplementation was not permitted. Patients who had failed to respond to bosentan or had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45% or a left ventricular shortening fraction less than 0.2 were excluded from the study.

Patients were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 70) or Revatio at doses of 20 mg (n = 69), 40 mg (n = 67), or 80 mg (n = 71) three times a day for 12 weeks. The study participants had either primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) (63%), PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (30%), or PAH following surgical repair of left-to-right congenital heart lesions (7%). The population consisted of 25% men and 75% women with a mean age of 49 years, ranging from 18 to 81 years, and a baseline 6-minute walk distance between 100 and 450 meters (mean 343).

### Usefulness of the sum of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and right atrial pressure as a congestion index that prognosticates heart failure survival (from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness trial) [^111pgnU6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial, the use of a pulmonary artery catheter did not significantly affect advanced heart failure outcomes. However, the success of achieving the targeted hemodynamic goals of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 15 mm Hg and right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mm Hg, and the association of these goals with clinical outcomes, were not addressed. Furthermore, goals with two independent variables, PCWP and RAP, left room for uncertainties.

We assessed the ability of a single hemodynamic target to achieve a threshold sum of PCWP and RAP as a predictor of all-cause mortality, death-or-transplantation (DT), or death-or-rehospitalization (DR) at 6 months in the pulmonary artery catheter-guided treatment arm of ESCAPE (n = 206). Patients with a posttreatment PCWP + RAP of < 30 mm Hg had characteristics similar to those of the population who achieved the ESCAPE hemodynamic goals. This group experienced 8.7% mortality, 13.0% DT, and 58.7% DR at 6 months.

The contrasting cohort with PCWP + RAP of ≥ 30 mm Hg had 45.3% mortality, 54.7% DT, and 84.9% DR at 6 months, with greater relative risk (RR) of death (RR 5.76), DT (RR 4.92), and DR (RR 1.80), and a higher prevalence of jugular venous pulsation, edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites at admission and discharge.

In conclusion, PCWP + RAP of 30 mm Hg posttreatment, obtained early in the index hospitalization, may represent a simple congestion index that has prognostic value for heart failure survival and readmission rates at 6 months and as a predictor for clinical outcomes.

### Tracleer [^115jdgFD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of bosentan was evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled study involving 19 pediatric patients with PAH aged 3 to 15 years. These patients had either primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 10) or PAH related to congenital heart diseases (9 patients) and were classified by WHO as functional class II (n = 15, 79%) or class III (n = 4; 21%) at baseline. Bosentan was administered at approximately 2 mg/kg twice daily (body weight adjusted dose, corresponding to the recommended adult dose) for 12 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Half of the patients in each group were also receiving intravenous epoprostenol, and the dosage of epoprostenol remained constant throughout the study.

Hemodynamics were measured in 17 patients. The mean decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 389 dyn∙sec∙cm-5, which was comparable to the effect observed in adults. The hemodynamic improvements from baseline were consistent regardless of the co-administration of epoprostenol.

In adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension related to congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunts, a small study (N = 54) and its open-label extension (N = 37) over up to 40 weeks in patients with Eisenmenger physiology demonstrated that the effects of Tracleer on exercise and safety were similar to those seen in other trials with patients who have PAH (WHO Group 1).

- **Lack of benefit in congestive heart failure**: Tracleer is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In a pair of studies involving 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, Tracleer did not demonstrate effectiveness.

### Doppler trans-thoracic echocardiography for detection of pulmonary hypertension in adults [^111LL11z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to a substantial loss of exercise capacity. PH ultimately leads to right ventricular overload and subsequent heart failure and early death. Although early detection and treatment of PH are recommended due to the limited responsiveness to therapy at late disease stages, many patients are diagnosed at a later stage because symptoms and signs of PH are nonspecific at earlier stages. While direct pressure measurement with right-heart catheterisation is the clinical reference standard for PH, it is not routinely used due to its invasiveness and complications. Trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography is less invasive, less expensive, and widely available compared to right-heart catheterisation; therefore, echocardiography is recommended as an initial diagnostic method in guidelines. However, several studies have questioned the accuracy of noninvasively measured pulmonary artery pressure. There is substantial uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography for the diagnosis of PH.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography for detecting PH.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to August 2021. We also reviewed reference lists of articles and contacted study authors, applying no restrictions on language or type of publication.

### Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: Analysis in a large patient population [^114AxoQK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Sources of error for the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) assessment with Doppler echocardiography were discussed by Yock and Popp and commented on in subsequent studies. In our study, we documented a series of sources of error in an offline analysis of all cases, with significant overestimation or underestimation. Contrary to former assertions, characteristics of the inferior vena cava were not the main reason for inaccuracy. Instead, many pitfalls are inherent to the Doppler method. Thus, optimal settings when assessing tricuspid regurgitation velocities should be taken into account. Further pitfalls should be kept in mind: stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, the pulmonary valve, or the pulmonary trunk may lead to systematic overestimation of right ventricular systolic pressure. Severe tricuspid insufficiency may lead to underestimation as pressure gradients decrease with increasing effective regurgitant orifice area. Furthermore, since the absence of tricuspid regurgitation does not rule out pulmonary hypertension (PH), the presence of indirect signs must be observed.

- **Sources of sPAP overestimation or underestimation**: Based on our experience, the following aspects should be considered for best results:
	1. Since the angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of flow must be kept to a minimum, tricuspid regurgitation should first be detected with color Doppler from the best ultrasound view. Multiple transducer positions may be necessary.

### Effects of the sibutramine therapy on pulmonary artery pressure in obese patients [^115sM38u]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Obesity is a major global public health problem. Previous drugs, such as dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine, used for the treatment of obesity, have been withdrawn due to various cardiac side effects. Sibutramine is an anti-obesity agent. The purpose of this study was to assess cardiac valve disease and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients who used once-daily doses of sibutramine.

One hundred and six obese patients (51 men and 55 women) determined to have minimal tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on echocardiographic examination were included in the study. All patients underwent a complete physical examination, complete blood count, measurement of lipid parameters, and echocardiography, during which cardiac valves and PAP were evaluated. After a mean follow-up duration of 24 weeks, all examinations were repeated for each patient.

The drug was well tolerated by all patients during the follow-up period. A significant weight loss was recorded in all patients compared to baseline values (93.1 ± 9.6 kg vs. 85.8 ± 7.7 kg, p < 0.001). Blood pressures and heart rate of the patients increased compared to baseline measurements (systolic 122.3 ± 8.5 vs. 124 ± 10.2 mmHg, p = 0.128; diastolic 79.3 ± 4.7 vs. 80 ± 5.7 mmHg, p = 0.42; and heart rate 79.5 ± 6.5 vs. 85 ± 5.7 beats/min, p < 0.001). No echocardiographically determined aortic or mitral valve dysfunction appeared in any patients. Although PAP slightly increased after the treatment, the difference between pre- and post-treatment values was not found statistically significant (14.7 ± 1.8 vs.…).

### Right ventricular pulmonary artery coupling and mortality in cardiac intensive care unit patients [^115AAVKB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction causing RV failure is common among hospitalized patients. RV dysfunction and RV failure among critically ill patients are typically the results of pulmonary hypertension (PH), RV insults, or both, and these conditions have frequently been associated with adverse outcomes. RV function can be assessed using measures of longitudinal RV motion, such as the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annular peak systolic tissue Doppler velocity (TASV), the former potentially being more load dependent. Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, measured by Doppler echocardiography based on the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, in the absence of pulmonary valve stenosis, can identify PH, which has been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients.

- **RV-PA coupling**: The ability of the RV to compensate with preserved systolic function in the face of an increasing afterload is referred to as maintaining RV‐PA coupling. Echocardiographic measures of RV‐PA coupling involve the ratio of RV longitudinal motion (i.e. TAPSE or TASV) to the RV systolic pressure (RVSP) or PA systolic pressure. Studies evaluating the TAPSE/RVSP ratio in patients with cardiovascular disease have shown associations between lower TAPSE/RVSP ratio (reflecting worse RV‐PA coupling) and adverse outcomes. Prior studies evaluating RV‐PA coupling using the TASV/RVSP ratio have involved invasive measurements of PA systolic pressure, rather than noninvasive RVSP derived from Doppler transthoracic echocardiography.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117Xhm43]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, particularly PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil. This approach aims to improve the six-minute walk distance (6MWD) in treatment-naive patients with PAH who exhibit World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II-III symptoms and are either not candidates for, or have failed calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy.

### Risk reduction and hemodynamics with initial combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111sdnui]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

An initial oral combination of drugs is being recommended in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but the effects of this approach on risk reduction and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are not known. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that a low-risk status would be determined by the reduction of PVR in patients with PAH treated upfront with a combination of oral drugs.

- **Methods**: The study enrolled 181 treatment-naive patients with PAH (81% idiopathic) and included a follow-up right heart catheterization at 6 months (interquartile range, 144–363 days) after the initial combination of endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor drugs. Clinical evaluation and risk assessments were conducted using European guidelines and the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management scores.

- **Measurements and main results**: Initial combination therapy improved functional class and 6-minute-walk distance, and decreased PVR by an average of 35% (median, 40%). One-third of the patients had a decrease in PVR of less than 25%. This poor hemodynamic response was independently predicted by age, male sex, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac index, and at echocardiography, a right/left ventricular surface area ratio greater than 1 coupled with low tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of less than 18 mm. A low-risk status at 6 months was achieved or maintained in only 34.8% (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management score) to 43.1% (European score) of the patients. Adding criteria of poor hemodynamic response improved the prediction of a low-risk status.

### Impact of tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JbLAP]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 349 records were analyzed: 348 identified through database searching and one through references (Figure 1). After evaluating titles and abstracts, 349 records were screened, and 332 of these were excluded. Seventeen studies were analyzed as full articles (Figure 1). After excluding eight studies with reasons, we included nine studies with a total of 6,466 patients (Figure 1). The characteristics of the enrolled studies and the quality ratings are listed in Table 1.

- **Population characteristics and descriptions**: The mean age was 82.17 (± 6.73) years, and 46% of patients were male (Table 2). Hypertension was present in 83% of the population, diabetes in 33%, significant mitral regurgitation (MR) in 23%, coronary artery disease in 51%, peripheral artery disease in 24%, and atrial fibrillation (AF) in 28% (Table 2). The mean pre‐procedure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 54% (± 13%), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was 44 (± 15) mmHg, EuroSCORE was 21 (± 13), and STS was 8 (± 6). NYHA class III/IV was present in 80% of the population (Table 2).

- **Comparative groups**: The severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is divided into two comparable groups: none/trace/mild TR and moderate/severe TR. The right ventricular (RV) function is categorized as normal or abnormal. All descriptions of RV dysfunction and RV size in the included studies are shown in Supporting Information Table S1.

### Two simple echo-Doppler measurements can accurately identify pulmonary hypertension in the large majority of patients with chronic heart failure [^116xCyVz]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The assessment of pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure is of great clinical importance, not only for diagnostic purposes but also for prognostication. This study was conducted with a consecutive group of patients with chronic heart failure. These patients were evaluated for their suitability for heart transplantation:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The study aimed to explore the diagnostic accuracy of several echo Doppler parameters of pulmonary hemodynamics in predicting the presence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure (defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 35 mmHg and mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg).

- **Identification of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance**: The research assessed the ability of the same parameters to identify patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance.

- **Influence of right ventricular function**: The study also evaluated the influence of right ventricular function and the degree of tricuspid regurgitation in modifying diagnostic accuracy.

- **Methods**: Echo Doppler examination and right heart catheterization were performed consecutively within 24 hours in 86 patients. The optimal cut-off value for a series of echo Doppler parameters capable of identifying patients with pulmonary hypertension was obtained by dividing the entire sample into two groups. The optimal threshold (highest sensitivity and specificity) of the echo and Doppler parameters used to classify patients with and without pulmonary hypertension was determined in 67% of cases using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; this was the testing sample. The proportion of cases classified correctly according to the selected cut-off was computed.

### It's all about that right ventricle [^112FMX5S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Often the forgotten ventricle, the right ventricle is gaining traction as a major determinant of outcomes across a spectrum of cardiovascular disorders. There has been recent interest in the concept of right ventricle–pulmonary artery (PA) coupling, particularly on the detrimental impact to outcomes when the RV can no longer compensate for elevated afterload and right ventricle–PA uncoupling ensues, resulting in right ventricular (RV) failure. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Hatab et al. present a timely article exploring the impact and influence of RV function and RV uncoupling on outcomes in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER).

Traditionally, the right ventricle has been difficult to evaluate due to its complex geometry and contractility in longitudinal and radial dimensions. Commonly employed echocardiographic measures, such as tricuspid annular plane of systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV systolic tissue velocity (S′), and RV 2-dimensional global longitudinal strain, provide some objective measures of right ventricular function but preferentially evaluate longitudinal function to the exclusion of radial function. This can result in overestimation and false reassurance of RV function. While 3-dimensional echocardiography enables full volume measurements and calculation of RV ejection fraction, this technique has proven practically difficult in many patients with suboptimal acoustic windows and large RV size, precluding complete capture by 3-dimensional imaging.

### Intraoperative TOE guided management of newly diagnosed severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension during orthotopic liver transplantation: a case report demonstrating the importance of reversibility as a favorable prognostic factor [^11227eRG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

As per our institutional practice, anesthesia was induced using a modified rapid sequence induction with propofol 100 mg, fentanyl 500 mcg, and suxamethonium 100 mg before proceeding with invasive monitoring. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane to achieve an age-corrected mean alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.8–1.0, together with fentanyl and cisatracurium infusions titrated to a bispectral index (BIS™, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) of 40–60.

The patient had a hyperdynamic circulation with radial arterial pressures of > 160 mmHg throughout induction, with an end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) of 42 mmHg. Upon needle cannulation of the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance using a three-lumen central venous catheter kit (Arrow Medical, Kington, UK), pulsatile flow was observed. Blood gas analysis confirmed venous sampling (PO2 of 56 mmHg). Intravenous placement of the wire was confirmed on ultrasound. Transducing the central venous catheter demonstrated a peak pressure of 105 mmHg with evidence of pulsatile variation distinct from the radial arterial pressure trace.

Subsequent cannulation for PAC insertion using a 9 French sheath (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) was again associated with high systemic venous pressures and a highly pulsatile venous waveform. Systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) measured 90 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was 55 mmHg. The PAC could not be wedged, and we were therefore unable to estimate LAP and measure pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The measured cardiac index (CI) was 2.5 by PAC therm.

### Tricuspid valve academic research consortium definitions for tricuspid regurgitation and trial endpoints [^112uoL9w]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

- **Assessment of pulmonary vascular pathophysiology**: An assessment of PA pressures is essential for understanding TR pathophysiology. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with severe TR has also been associated with worse outcomes following T-TEER. Echocardiography estimates of PA systolic pressure correlate well with invasive measurements in patients with nonsevere TR, but these estimates may underestimate PA systolic pressure when rapid equilibration of RA and RV pressures occurs, which may happen in severe TR with or without a noncompliant RA.

Recent PH guidelines recommend the confirmation of PA pressures with invasive right heart catheterization. The routine assessment of invasive pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in patients with TR is even more important given the discordance that may occur in some patients with severe disease. A recent study showed that high PA pressures by invasive measurement with discordant low estimated pressures by echocardiography are associated with poor outcomes following T-TEER.

The pulmonary artery pulsatility index, defined as the ratio of PA pulse pressure to RA pressure, has emerged as a predictor of RV failure and worse survival in patients with moderate or greater TR without pulmonary hypertension. Because of the sensitivity of the RV to afterload, an index of ventricular contractility to afterload may further characterize RV function compensation to specific loading conditions. RV-PA coupling describes a hemodynamic state where mechanical stro…

### Novel scoring tool of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension for defining severity of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn [^115MDjeZ]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

The PH component of the HRF/PH score analyzed the first complete echocardiogram for the interventricular septum (IVS) position, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVsP), and presence of right ventricular dysfunction. If the echocardiogram report available in the chart did not contain all of these components, the echocardiogram was reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist (SS) on the research team to provide the missing data and validate measurements.

IVS position has been correlated to the degree of right ventricular pressures. Specifically, with increasing right ventricular pressures, the short axis geometry of the left ventricle is distorted and leads to progressive flattening of the IVS during systole. As such, the IVS position was scored from 0–3 based on its position in the parasternal short axis. TAPSE, which was measured from a standard apical 4 chamber window and graded from 0–3 based on the numerical measurement, quantifies the systolic excursion of the tricuspid annulus in the longitudinal direction of the right ventricular free wall and represents a right ventricular longitudinal function.

The RVsP was calculated and graded from 0–3 based on the peak tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and the use of the simplified Bernoulli equation: RVsP = 4(v)², where v is the peak velocity of the tricuspid valve regurgitant jet measured in meters/second. The tricuspid jet was determined either in the parasternal short axis or the apical 4 chamber — whichever image provided the most complete Doppler waveform.

### Pulsatile vascular afterload measurement improves prediction of right-sided heart dysfunction in undifferentiated and left-sided pulmonary hypertension [^115x5Gnn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Detailed phenotyping of vascular afterload has previously provided important insights into healthy and cardiovascular disease states affecting the systemic circulation. In contrast, relatively less is known about the pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary circulation receives the same blood flow from the heart with the same periodicity; however, the similarities end there. Anatomically, path lengths along vascular segments are shorter and more symmetrical, exhibit tapering at the point of bifurcation, are elliptical in cross-section, have thinner walls, and exhibit no well-developed arterioles. Functionally, the normal pulmonary vascular bed is a low-pressure, low-resistance, high-compliance system capable of accommodating large increases in blood flow with minimal elevation of mPAP or PVR. As pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops, the pulmonary vascular bed becomes a high-pressure, high-resistance, low-compliance circuit. This may be attributable to cellular proliferation, progressive vascular remodeling, vasoconstriction, deposition of thrombus in the PA, or any combination of these. Historically, it has been shown that a main contributor to the differences in RV afterload sensitivities does not reside with the right ventricle but, rather, in the nature of the PA loading systems.

- **Clinical applications**: Interest in how to quantify pulmonary vascular afterload hemodynamics and RV contractile properties, and how these combine to determine RV–PA coupling, has resurfaced in recent years, particularly with the introduction of prostacyclin and its analogs, inhaled nitric oxide, and oral therapies.

### Pulmonary vascular resistance and clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension: a retrospective cohort study [^115EW5rb]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In pulmonary hypertension subgroups, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 3.0 Wood units or more is associated with poor prognosis. However, the spectrum of PVR risk in pulmonary hypertension is not well understood. To address this area of uncertainty, we aimed to analyze the relationship between PVR and adverse clinical outcomes in pulmonary hypertension.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing right heart catheterization (RHC) in the US Veterans Affairs healthcare system (October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2016). Patients were included in the analyses if data from a complete RHC and at least one year of follow-up were available. Both inpatients and outpatients were included, but individuals with missing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure, or cardiac output were excluded. The primary outcome measure was time to all-cause mortality assessed by the Veteran Affairs vital status file. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between PVR and outcomes, and the mortality hazard ratio was validated in an RHC cohort from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (September 24, 1998, to June 1, 2016).

- **Findings**: The primary cohort (N = 40,082; 38,751 [96.7%] male; median age 66.5 years [IQR 61.1–73.5]; median follow-up 1,153 days [IQR 570–1971]) included patients with a history of heart failure (23,201 [57.9%]) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13,348 [33.3%]). We focused on patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension based on an mPAP of at least 19 mm Hg (32,725 [81.6%] of 40,082).

### Prognostic relevance of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to systolic pulmonary arterial pressure ratio and its association with exercise hemodynamics in patients with normal or mildly elevated resting pulmonary arterial pressure [^112EoFdN]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiographic tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) ratio is a noninvasive surrogate for right ventricle (RV)-pulmonary arterial (PA) coupling, commonly related to outcomes in patients with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (PH).

- **Research question**: Is RV-PA coupling of prognostic relevance in patients with suspected PH, but only normal or mildly elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), and is it associated with impaired exercise capacity and exercise hemodynamics?

- **Study design and methods**: Patients with mPAP were analyzed with a multivariate approach to identify independent predictors for clinical worsening (CW), which was defined by disease-related hospitalization, transplantation, or death. The cutoff for inclusion was 3 mm Hg/L/min.

- **Results**: The study included 237 patients (155 females; median age, 64 years; interquartile range (IQR), 54–73 years); no PH (n = 147), mild PH (n = 90), and exercise PH (EPH, n = 202). Over the 63-month observation period (IQR, 29–104 months), 36 patients died and 126 clinical worsening events occurred. The TAPSE to sPAP ratio was an age- and sex-independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.62; p = 0.014) and clinical worsening (HR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.35–0.78; p = 0.002).

### Aortic valve regurgitation: A comprehensive review [^116nCNLo]. Current Problems in Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Aortic regurgitation can be associated with a range of clinical signs and conditions. These include aortic regurgitation murmur, Gerhardt's sign, Marfan syndrome, Mayne's sign, Corrigan pulse, and the third heart sound. It may also relate to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syncope, Quincke's sign, and increased murmur volume during transient arterial occlusion.

Additional symptoms associated with the disease include hypotension, diastolic cardiac murmur, leg swelling, de Musset's sign, and Duroziez's sign. Peripheral hemodynamic signs of aortic insufficiency can appear along with clinical impressions of heart failure, a history of aortic valve surgery or intervention, and an increased popliteal-brachial gradient.

- **Conditions associated with aortic regurgitation**
- **Vascular and connective tissue disorders**: Takayasu arteritis, aortic dissection, and osteogenesis imperfecta may present alongside fatigue, Müller's sign, chest pain, and flow reversal in the descending aorta.
- **Respiratory and cardiac manifestations**: Dyspnea, rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid aortic valve, palpitations, and reactive arthritis, as well as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can occur.
- **Signs of heart irregularities**: Increased pulse pressure, ankle swelling, cardiomegaly, infective endocarditis, Austin-Flint murmur, angina pectoris, and the presence of an aortic regurgitation murmur are observed.

The disease's complexity is underscored by varied symptoms and overlaps seen in patients, with multiple murmur occurrences being noted.

### Impairment of pulmonary vascular reserve and right ventricular systolic reserve in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114U8jv2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In accordance with previous data, resting hemodynamic measurements are poorly correlated with the response to pharmacological stress. However, EM at rest was significantly correlated with ΔmPAP and ΔCO. Accordingly, Kubo et al. showed that the percentage of wall thickness was highly correlated with ∆mPAP during exercise in patients with severe emphysema. The correlation between ΔmPAP and ΔEM suggests that PA wall remodeling and buffering function impairment would be associated with the lower vascular reserve.

In the context of PAH, evidence of RV dysfunction and clinical right-sided heart failure at rest have been shown to be the most important determinants of morbidity and mortality, independently of PAP values. We used three measures of longitudinal RV shortening in an effort to characterize simple and reproducible measurements of global RV systolic function. The mean reference value of TAPSE is 23 mm (16–30), Sm 15 cm ⋅ s⁻¹ (10–19), and IVA 3.7 m ⋅ s⁻² (2.2–5.2). Among them, TAPSE, a simple and clinically useful tool to estimate RV function in PAH patients, has been shown to predict survival in PAH. Preliminary evidence suggests that a decrease in TAPSE with exercise was strongly associated with adverse clinical events in PAH patients within one year of follow-up. However, Giusca et al. suggested that tricuspid ring motion is only loosely related to RV systolic function, being highly dependent on afterload and overall motion of the heart, thus failing to reflect RV longitudinal function accurately. This may explain why TAPSE changes are more significantly related to outcomes.

### Evaluation study of congestive heart failure and pulmonary artery catheterization effectiveness: The ESCAPE trial [^116kBN3W]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have been used to guide therapy in multiple settings, but recent studies have raised concerns that PACs may lead to increased mortality in hospitalized patients.

- **Objective**: To determine whether PAC use is safe and improves clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with severe symptomatic heart failure.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) was a randomized controlled trial of 433 patients at 26 sites conducted from January 18, 2000, to November 17, 2003. Patients were assigned to receive therapy guided by clinical assessment and a PAC or clinical assessment alone. The target in both groups was the resolution of clinical congestion, with additional PAC targets of a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg and a right atrial pressure of 8 mm Hg. Medications were not specified, but inotrope use was explicitly discouraged.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary end point was days alive out of the hospital during the first 6 months, with secondary end points of exercise, quality of life, biochemical, and echocardiographic changes.

- **Results**: Severity of illness was reflected by the following values: average left ventricular ejection fraction, 19%; systolic blood pressure, 106 mm Hg; sodium level, 137 mEq/L; urea nitrogen, 35 mg/dL (12.40 mmol/L); and creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 micromol/L). Therapy in both groups led to substantial reduction in symptoms, jugular venous pressure, and edema. Use of the PAC did not sign

### Optimal tricuspid regurgitation velocity to screen for pulmonary hypertension in tertiary referral centers [^113XKEP2]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

A mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mm Hg now defines pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesize that echocardiographic thresholds must be adjusted.

- **Research question**: Should tricuspid regurgitation velocity thresholds to screen for pulmonary hypertension be revised, given the new hemodynamic definition?

- **Study design and methods**: This multicenter retrospective study included 1,608 patients who underwent both echocardiography and right heart catheterization within 4 weeks. The discovery cohort consisted of 1,081 individuals; the validation cohort included 527. Screening criteria for pulmonary hypertension were derived using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the Youden index, assuming equal cost for false-positive and false-negative classifications. A lower threshold was calculated using a predefined sensitivity of 95%.

- **Results**: In the discovery cohort, echocardiographic tricuspid regurgitation velocity demonstrated good discrimination for pulmonary hypertension: area under the curve was 88.4 (95% CI, 85.3–91.5). A 3.4-m/s threshold provided a 78% sensitivity, 87% specificity, and 6.13 positive likelihood ratio to detect pulmonary hypertension; 2.7 m/s had a 95% sensitivity and 0.12 negative likelihood ratio to exclude pulmonary hypertension. In the validation cohort, the discovery threshold of 2.7 m/s provided sensitivity and negative likelihood ratios of 80% and 0.31, respectively. Right cardiac size improved detection of pulmonary hypertension in the lower tricuspid regurgitation velocity groups.

- **Interpretation**: Our data support a lower tricuspid regurgitation velocity threshold for screening pulmonary hypertension, consistent with the new hemodynamic definition.

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116X984w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Data from this study address the controversy on the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) level required to capture clinical risk in patients referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) or echocardiography using a meta-analysis, which is the optimal research tool for determining aggregate risk across study populations. We report that mildly elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, estimated by either echocardiography or invasive catheterization, are associated with a 19% increased risk of mortality over 5 years. Despite analyzing both community-based and referral populations with varying underlying comorbidities, there was only mild statistical heterogeneity of risk across the included studies. This suggests a truly generalizable association between mild pulmonary hypertension (PH) and mortality. These data support ongoing efforts to identify optimal cutoffs for hemodynamic parameters in PH, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, to identify at-risk populations earlier.

A notable finding of this study is the consistent association between mild PH and increased mortality when PA pressure was measured by either RHC or echocardiography. Although RHC is the only test available to diagnose PH, echocardiography is the preferred screening test for at-risk patients. Guidelines recommend further evaluation of patients for PH if the tricuspid regurgitation velocity is greater than 2.9 m/s (corresponding to a pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] of approximately greater than 40 mm Hg). However, our findings demonstrate that PA pressure assessed by echocardiography, at levels considered currently to be below the range of clinical significance (tricuspid regurgitation velocity approximately greater than 2.5 m/s, PASP greater than 35 mm Hg) across both community-based and referral populations, indicates an at-risk category.

### Assessment of right ventricular adaptability to loading conditions can improve the timing of listing to transplantation in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113JfjEb]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Right ventricle (RV) performance is load-dependent, and right-sided heart failure (RHF) is the main cause of death in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Prediction of RV worsening for timely identification of patients needing transplantation (Tx) is paramount. Assessment of RV adaptability to load has proved useful in certain clinical circumstances, and this study assessed its predictive value for RHF-free and Tx-free outcomes with PAH.

- **Methods**: Between 2006 and 2012, all potential Tx candidates with PAH, without RHF at the first evaluation, were selected for follow-up (except those with congenital heart diseases). At selection and during each follow-up, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and the 6-minute walk distance were measured, and RV adaptability to load was assessed by echocardiography. Collected data were tested for the ability to predict RV stability and Tx-free survival.

- **Results**: During a 12-month to 92-month follow-up, RHF developed in 23 of 79 evaluated patients, despite similar medication and no differences in initial RV size and ejection fraction compared with patients who remained stable. However, unstable patients had an initially lower RV load-adaptation index and afterload-corrected peak global systolic longitudinal strain-rate values, as well as higher RV dyssynchrony, tricuspid regurgitation, and NT-proBNP levels (p ≤ 0.01). At certain cutoff values, these variables appeared predictive for 1-year and 3-year freedom from RHF and 3-year Tx-free survival. An RV load-adaptation index reduction of ≥ 20% showed the highest predictive value.

### Embolization treatment of right pulmonary artery agenesis with patent ductus arteriosus causing pulmonary hypertension and hemoptysis: a case report and literature review [^111nrxmV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Children with PAA may develop recurrent pulmonary infections (37%), reduced exercise tolerance (40%), pulmonary hypertension (44%), and hemoptysis (20%) as they age, or remain asymptomatic until adulthood. Physical examination may reveal chest asymmetry, abnormal breath sounds on the affected side, and a generally normal electrocardiogram. When a chest X-ray shows increased lung transparency and hypoplasia of the lung (contralateral displacement of the trachea, fewer pulmonary vascular segments), along with fine linear opacities in the peripheral lung, suspicion of PAA is high; however, it needs to be differentiated from diseases causing diffuse changes in one lung field such as bronchiectasis, hypoplastic lung, scimitar syndrome, Swyer-James syndrome, mediastinal tumor, fibrotic mediastinitis, and pulmonary venous occlusive disease.

CT three-dimensional reconstruction is an important preoperative diagnostic method; angiography is reserved for individuals requiring surgical intervention due to its invasiveness. Common methods for measuring pulmonary artery pressure include tricuspid regurgitation velocity method, pulmonary valve regurgitation method, and intracardiac shunt method. Right ventricular enlargement and thickening, as well as widening of the right ventricular outflow tract, are suggestive but lack diagnostic significance for patients with unilateral absence of a pathway in the pulmonary artery. In this case study, the patient's right subclavian artery systolic pressure was used along with catheter left-to-right shunt pressure difference for estimation.

### The jugular venous pressure revisited [^115rEVPb]. Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Increased jugular venous pressure can be caused by various factors, including myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, congestive heart failure, pulmonary valve stenosis, pericardial effusion, atrial myxoma, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, sclerosing mediastinitis, constrictive pericarditis, tricuspid valve stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and superior vena cava syndrome.

### Secondary left heart failure occurred during VA-ECMO assistance for severe residual pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy: A case report [^1151KyDX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

However, during the first attempt to discontinue CPB, the PAP increased rapidly to 63/35 (43) mmHg, with unstable hemodynamics (ABP 70/40 mmHg), and TEE suggested right heart insufficiency, accompanied by normal left ventricular function. Then, CPB was resumed immediately. After assisting for another 45 min and increasing the dosage of vasoactive drugs (norepinephrine 0.06 μg/kg/min, epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min, isoproterenol 0.05 μg/kg/min), the separation failed again, just as it did the first time. Considering that severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction are the main reasons for the failure of CPB weaning, ECMO was adopted. Consequently, 19F arterial and 22F venous cannulas were inserted into the right femoral vessels, and femoral VA-ECMO was initiated with a flow of 3.0 ~ 3.5 L/min.

On arrival at the intensive care unit, the ECMO flow rate was 3.5 L/min, and severe PH (PAP 56/25 mmHg) persisted with low ABP (70/55 mmHg). Echocardiography revealed a significant decrease in biventricular function (TAPES 4 mm, LVEF 28%, average E/E′ 15, lateral E′ 6.7 cm/s, TR velocity 4.1 m/s) on postoperative day (POD) 1, indicating the patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction during ECMO support.

The postoperative troponin-T (C-TNT) increased gradually, suggesting myocardial injuries occurred. Hence, comprehensive measures were adopted: the ECMO flow rate was reduced from 3.5 L/min to 2.5 L/min to decrease left ventricular afterload while maintaining systemic perfusion. Norepinephrine…

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^115uuSoG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

A conceptual framework helps determine whether individual cases of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) represent a prognostically relevant interventional target or merely indicate a worse prognosis in patients suffering from pulmonary hypertension.

A novel proportionality framework corrects the degree of TR severity expressed as tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area (TV EROA) for the levels of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP). It shows that patients with a TV EROA/mPAP ratio greater than 1.25 mm²/mm Hg, defining disproportionate TR, feature significantly better two-year survival rates after transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) than patients with proportionate TR (69.6% [95% CI, 64.0–75.6] versus 56.6% [95% CI, 47.5–67.5]; P = 0.005).

- **Key terms**:
	- mPAP: mean pulmonary artery pressure.
	- mPCWP: mean postcapillary wedge pressure.
	- PVR: pulmonary vascular resistance.
	- RV: right ventricular.
	- RV FAC: right ventricular fractional area change.
	- TAPSE: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.
	- TR: tricuspid regurgitation.
	- TTVI: transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention.
	- TV EROA: tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area.

### Assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance by Doppler echocardiography in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113kMTYP]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Assessment of pulmonary artery pressures, cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is crucial in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Doppler echocardiography can be used to determine PVR in patients with PAH.

- **Methods**: Forty-two patients were included, and Doppler echocardiography was performed simultaneously (n = 22) and non-simultaneously (n = 60) with right heart catheterization. The tricuspid regurgitation velocity was used to estimate pulmonary arterial peak systolic and diastolic (PADP) pressures through the Bernoulli equation. At the time of pulmonary valve opening, right ventricular pressure equals PADP. The tricuspid regurgitation velocity at the time of pulmonary valve opening was measured by superimposing the time from the QRS to the onset of pulmonary flow on the tricuspid regurgitation velocity envelope. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, and CO were assessed using standard Doppler echocardiography methods. Right heart catheterization was performed using Swan-Ganz catheters and thermodilution for CO determination.

- **Results**: The differences (mean ± SD) between catheter and simultaneous/non-simultaneous Doppler echocardiography were 0.3 ± 0.8 (p = 0.10)/-0.3 ± 1.1 (p = 0.06) liter/min for CO, 2.9 ± 5.1 (p = 0.02)/-1.2 ± 7.4 (p = 0.2) mm Hg for the transpulmonary gradient (TPG), and 0.3 ± 2.1 (p = 0.65)/0.8 ± 2.4 (p = 0.02) Wood unit for PVR. The correlation coefficients between catheter and simultaneous/non-simultaneous methods indicate the reliability of Doppler echocardiography in assessing these parameters.

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients with pulmonary hypertension: Is pulmonary artery pressure the only determinant of regurgitation severity [^115DLAQD]? Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a common cause of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR), but other factors also play a role in determining TR severity. The objectives of our study were to determine the distribution of TR severity in relation to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and to define the determinants of TR severity.

- **Methods**: The echocardiographic reports and selected echocardiographic studies of patients with echocardiographic estimation of PASP were reviewed. Patients with organic tricuspid valve (TV) disease were excluded from the analysis.

- **Results**: Among 2,139 patients, the frequency of moderate or severe TR was progressively greater in patients with higher PASP. Nevertheless, TR was only mild in a substantial proportion of patients with high PASP: mild TR in 65.4% of patients with PASP 50–69 mm Hg and in 45.6% of patients with PASP ≥ 70 mm Hg. By multivariate analysis, age, female gender, PASP (odds ratio, 2.26 per 10-mm Hg increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.95 to 2.61), pacemaker lead, right atrial (RA) and right ventricular enlargement, left atrial enlargement, and organic mitral valve disease were independently associated with greater degrees of TR. In patients with PASP ≥ 70 mm Hg, RA size, tricuspid annular diameter, and TV tethering area were greater in patients with greater degrees of TR.

- **Conclusions**: PASP is a strong determinant of TR severity, but many patients with pulmonary hypertension do not exhibit significant TR. In addition to PASP, demographic characteristics, mechanical factors, and remodeling of the right heart cavities are relevant.

### Risk factors for progression of functional tricuspid regurgitation [^115dqzZX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) progression in a contemporary population of patients referred for echocardiography. In a case-control study, we compared 100 consecutive patients with TR progression on serial echocardiograms (trivial or mild TR on the first echocardiogram and moderate or severe functional TR on a follow-up echocardiogram) with 100 patients matched for age and gender, having mild TR at baseline and no TR progression. The mean age was 72 ± 10 years, with 55% of the patients being male, and the time to TR progression was 5.3 ± 2.9 years. Less than 10% of participants had rheumatic heart disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved (≥ 50%) in 85% of the TR progression group and 74% of the control group (p = 0.06). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased from 41 ± 16 to 56 ± 18 mm Hg in the TR progression group and decreased from 44 ± 13 to 41 ± 11 mm Hg in the control group (p < 0.0001).

- **Independent risk factors**:
	- Pulmonary artery systolic pressure change during follow-up (odds ratio per 1 mm Hg 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.23, p < 0.0001).
	- Permanent atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 14.3, 95% confidence interval 4.6 to 44.2, p < 0.0001).
	- Coronary artery disease (odds ratio 5.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 22.8, p = 0.015).

All-cause mortality at three years was 20% for patients without TR progression, 42% for moderate TR, and 63% for severe TR (p < 0.0001). Progression-to-severe TR independently predicted subsequent mortality. In conclusion, in patients with a low prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, the progression of TR is a significant predictor of mortality.

### The multiple systemic artery to pulmonary artery fistulas resulting in severe irreversible pulmonary arterial hypertension in patient with previous history of pneumothorax [^117LvPQv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Echocardiography showed features of severe pulmonary hypertension: right ventricle enlargement to 44 mm (four-chamber view), with depressed function of right ventricle TAPSE 9 mm, right atrium area enlargement to 40 cm², severe tricuspid valve regurgitation (++++), increased calculated RVSP to 112 mmHg, shortened pulmonary artery acceleration time to 60 ms, and mild pericardial effusion. There was no interventricular septum defect. Trans-esophageal echocardiography did not show a defect in the atrial septum, which was confirmed later by angio-CT.

- **Angio-CT findings**: Preserved continuity of the atrial septum, high degree enlargement of right atrium and ventricle. RA: right atrium, RV: right ventricle, LA: left atrium, LV: left ventricle.

SaO₂ of blood obtained from the radial artery was reduced to 87.8%. Right heart catheterization was performed. SaO₂ levels of blood samples obtained during RHC from the vena cava superior, vena cava inferior, right atrium, pulmonary trunk, middle lobe artery of the right lung, and left pulmonary artery were respectively 64.8%, 77.4%, 73.2%, 70.2%, 69.3%, and 71.2%, which did not indicate the presence of a left-to-right shunt.

Hemodynamic measurements showed severe precapillary pulmonary hypertension, irreversible in vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm) and a combination of oral sildenafil (50 mg) and inhaled nitric oxide (80 ppm).

### Hemodynamic findings in severe tricuspid regurgitation [^116FTQSu]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) most commonly occurs in response to right ventricular (RV) dilation, with structural abnormalities in the tricuspid valve being rarer. In addition to RV size and valvular integrity, the amount of TR is influenced by RV preload and afterload, the respiratory cycle, left heart function, and atrial fibrillation.

Hemodynamic changes in right atrial (RA) pressures in severe TR include elevated mean pressures, a large systolic wave called an "s" wave, a prominent "Y" descent, and a blunted "X" descent. Additionally, RV end diastolic pressure is elevated and cardiac output is reduced, especially with exercise. "Ventricularization" of the RA pressure tracing — where the contour of the RA pressure is similar to but of lower amplitude than the contour of the RV pressure — is the most specific finding, although it is found in a minority of patients with severe TR.

In summary, alterations in the RA pressure tracing are common in patients with severe TR, but specific hemodynamic findings lack sensitivity. This may be partly due to the significant effects of RV preload, RV afterload, and RA compliance on the amount of TR.

### Raised pulmonary artery pressures measured with Doppler echocardiography in rheumatoid arthritis patients [^112koVj3]. Rheumatology (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence of echocardiographic abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension in an unselected population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

- **Method**: One hundred and forty-six RA patients, irrespective of cardiopulmonary symptoms, were evaluated clinically and through echocardiography, including measurements of pulmonary artery pressure, ECG, pulmonary function tests, and high-resolution computed tomography scanning of the thorax.

- **Results**: Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed significant cardiac disease, with 9% of patients showing a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 64%). Moreover, 4% had moderate mitral regurgitation, 4% had aortic stenosis, 3% had aortic regurgitation, and 0.7% experienced Valsalva sinus rupture. Additionally, 1% of patients had detectable pericardial effusions. It was found that 31% of the RA patients had an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 30 mmHg or more, and 21% of all RA patients had pulmonary hypertension without significant cardiac or lung disease evident on pulmonary function testing.

- **Conclusions**: A wide and frequent variety of echocardiographic cardiac abnormalities may be found in an unselected population of patients with RA. Through Doppler echocardiography, we discovered that 6% of the population had pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease and there was a higher than expected prevalence of mild primary pulmonary hypertension in patients with RA. This latter observation may be pertinent to the high incidence of cardiovascular-related deaths observed in patients with RA.

### Adcirca [^112QBs1y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Adcirca for pulmonary arterial hypertension was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, 16-week placebo-controlled study involving 405 patients. These patients had pulmonary arterial hypertension, characterized by a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≤ 15 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 3 Wood units, as measured by right heart catheterization. Background therapy included bosentan (with maintenance dosing up to 125 mg twice daily) and chronic anticoagulation. It is important to note that prostacyclin or its analogue, L-arginine, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or other chronic PAH medications were not allowed.

Subjects, who needed to be at least 12 years of age, were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: tadalafil (2.5, 10, 20, 40 mg) or placebo, in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Eligibility required a diagnosis of PAH that was either idiopathic, heritable, or related to factors such as connective tissue disease, anorexigen use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or an atrial-septal defect. It could also include PAH associated with the surgical repair of a congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt lasting at least one year (for example, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). Patients with a history of left-sided heart disease, severe renal insufficiency, or pulmonary hypertension due to conditions outside the specified inclusion criteria were excluded from the study.

### Right ventricular end-systolic remodeling index in the assessment of pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension. The European Pediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease Network (EPPVDN) [^112QFvFA]. Pediatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic determination of the right ventricular end-systolic remodeling index (RVES RI) has clinical value for the assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in adults. We aim to determine RVES RI values in pediatric PH and to correlate RVES RI data with echocardiographic variables and NYHA functional class (FC).

- **Methods**: Prospective echocardiography study in 49 children with PH. The 49 matched control subjects were chosen from 123 healthy children used to construct pediatric normal reference values. The associations with invasive hemodynamic variables were also investigated in a validation cohort of 12 PH children and matched controls.

- **Results**: RVES RI was increased in children with PH vs. healthy controls (1.45 ± 0.16 vs. 1.16 ± 0.06; p < 0.01; confirmed in the validation cohort). RVES RI was associated with invasive hemodynamic variables, i.e. the mean pulmonary artery pressure. RVES RI values increased with worsening NYHA-FC. The highest RVES RI values were observed in PH children with NYHA FC 3 (1.60 ± 0.12).

- **Conclusions**: RVES RI is a useful indicator of RV remodeling and dilation in the setting of increased RV pressure load, especially when the degree of regurgitation of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves is insufficient to numerically estimate RV systolic pressure and mPAP, due to incomplete Doppler envelopes.

### Ventavis [^114RM6NJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed. Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Ventavis should not be administered in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Discontinue if pulmonary edema is present due to pulmonary venous hypertension. Patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive to bronchospasm.

- **Risk of syncope**: Monitor vital signs while initiating Ventavis. Do not initiate Ventavis in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Syncope can also occur in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, particularly during physical exertion. The occurrence of exertional syncope may reflect a therapeutic gap or insufficient efficacy, and the need to adjust the dose or change therapy should be considered.

- **Pulmonary venous hypertension**: Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled Ventavis is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, stop treatment immediately, as this may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension.

- **Bronchospasm**: Ventavis inhalation can induce bronchospasm. Bronchospasm may be more severe or frequent in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways. Ventavis has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or acute pulmonary infections.

### Porcine model of the arterial switch operation: Implications for unique strategies in the management of hypoplastic left ventricles [^117N9TdE]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

There are no reports on the performance of the arterial switch operation (ASO) in a normal heart with normally related great vessels. The objective of this study was to determine whether the ASO could be performed in a healthy animal model. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and coronary translocation techniques were used to perform ASO in neonatal piglets, or a staged ASO with prior main pulmonary artery (PA) banding.

Primary ASO was performed in four neonatal piglets. Coronary translocation was effective, with angiograms confirming patency. Piglets could not be weaned from CPB due to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction. To improve RV function for the ASO, nine piglets had PA banding. All survived the procedure. Post-banding RV pressure increased from a mean of 20.3 ± 2.2 mmHg to 36.5 ± 7.3 mmHg (p = 0.007).

At 58 ± 1 days post-banding, piglets underwent cardiac MRIs revealing RV hypertrophy and RV pressure overload with mildly reduced RV function. Catheterization confirmed RV systolic pressures of 84.0 ± 6.7 mmHg with LV systolic pressure 83.3 ± 6.7 mmHg (p = 0.43). The remaining five PA-banded piglets underwent ASO at 51 ± 0 days post-banding. Three of five were weaned from bypass with patent coronary arteries and adequate RV function.

We were able to successfully perform an arterial switch with documented patent coronary arteries on standard anatomy great vessels in a healthy animal model. To our knowledge, this is the first time this procedure has been successfully performed. The model may have implications for studying the failing systemic RV and may support a novel approach for management.

### Valvular heart disease: Aortic regurgitation [^116hNeLc]. Circulation (2005). High credibility.

Chronic aortic regurgitation can be caused by a range of conditions. These include Takayasu arteritis, axial spondyloarthritis, thoracic aortic dissection, systemic lupus erythematosus, and aortic root dilation. Systemic hypertension, myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve, rheumatic valve disease, and degenerative aortic valve disease are also potential causes. HLA-B27-associated valvulitis, thoracic aortic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect, rheumatoid arthritis, and Whipple's disease can lead to the condition as well. Additionally, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, infective endocarditis, giant cell arteritis, and syphilitic aortitis are recognized contributors to chronic aortic regurgitation.
