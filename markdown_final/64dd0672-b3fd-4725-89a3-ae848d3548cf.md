## Question

Aspirin and pre eclampsia, summarize all studies and evidence.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary of the evidence on low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, including efficacy, timing, dose, safety, target populations, and guideline alignment, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base and how it evolved. Then, I should quantify benefits across maternal and perinatal outcomes. Next, I will examine timing and dose-response, followed by safety signals. After that, I need to review who should be treated and how guidelines frame risk stratification. Finally, I will integrate implementation considerations and synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the evidence hierarchy and anchor on the most authoritative sources, because I need to ensure the conclusions are built on the strongest data. The USPSTF 2021 recommendation and its accompanying evidence review, the 2019 Cochrane review, and the 2007 Lancet individual patient data meta-analysis form the backbone of evidence, with additional support from contemporary meta-analyses and pivotal trials like ASPRE, which collectively include tens of thousands of participants and provide consistent estimates of benefit and safety [^1164CWcH] [^116Aag2n] [^114s1KcJ] [^1118bBwb] [^113wyt9v].

> I will now examine the magnitude of benefit, and I should double-check that I'm quoting pooled estimates correctly. Across high-quality syntheses, low-dose aspirin reduces preeclampsia by about 15–20% overall, with larger effects on preterm preeclampsia when started early, and also reduces preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age infants or intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality, with absolute risk reductions that scale with baseline risk; for example, the USPSTF evidence review found pooled RRs of 0.85 for preeclampsia, 0.80 for preterm birth, 0.82 for SGA/IUGR, and 0.79 for perinatal mortality among individuals at increased risk, translating to clinically meaningful absolute risk reductions in higher-risk populations [^116Aag2n] [^1164CWcH] [^114s1KcJ].

> Wait, let me verify the timing effect because this is often underappreciated. The clearest signal for a larger relative risk reduction emerges when aspirin is initiated at or before 16 weeks' gestation, with meta-analytic estimates showing roughly a 50–60% reduction in preterm preeclampsia in this scenario, whereas initiation after 16 weeks yields smaller, more modest effects; this timing-dependent benefit is supported by mechanistic plausibility around early placentation and by multiple meta-analyses and the ASPRE trial, which specifically targeted high-risk individuals identified in the first trimester [^111phgQB] [^113u4sMG] [^111UPB1k] [^113wyt9v].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose-response question before jumping to conclusions. Most large trials and guidelines operationalize "low-dose" as 60–150 mg daily, with signals that doses at or above 100 mg, particularly 150 mg, may confer greater benefit for preterm preeclampsia when started early; however, head-to-head dose-comparison trials are limited, and while a small meta-analysis suggested superiority of 150–162 mg over 75–81 mg for preterm preeclampsia, larger pragmatic and observational comparative studies have not consistently shown differences, so the optimal dose remains an area of active investigation and guideline variation [^112VZNmv] [^116EyCmw] [^1149yXuU] [^116hEFyf] [^113YPowT].

> I need to check safety carefully, because any preventive therapy in pregnancy must have a favorable risk–benefit profile. Across randomized trials and systematic reviews, low-dose aspirin does not increase serious maternal bleeding complications, placental abruption, or fetal intracranial hemorrhage, though some analyses suggest a small, likely clinically modest increase in postpartum hemorrhage greater than 500 mL; long-term offspring developmental harms have not been demonstrated in available follow-up, supporting an overall favorable safety balance in appropriately selected patients [^1155U1UW] [^114s1KcJ] [^116Aag2n].

> Next, I should review who should actually receive aspirin, and I need to ensure I align with major guidelines. The USPSTF recommends low-dose aspirin for those with one or more high-risk factors or at least two moderate-risk factors, with high-risk including prior preeclampsia with adverse outcome, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, kidney disease, or autoimmune disease, and moderate-risk including nulliparity, obesity, family history, advanced maternal age, long interpregnancy interval, prior adverse pregnancy outcomes, or in vitro conception; ACOG and SMFM similarly endorse risk-based prophylaxis starting between 12 and 28 weeks, optimally before 16 weeks, and continuing until delivery, while some European guidelines prefer 100–150 mg nightly from 11–14 weeks in higher-risk patients [^111VHgHP] [^113BisK5] [^116hEFyf] [^112DdEso].

> But wait, what if we consider universal prophylaxis rather than risk-targeted therapy; I should weigh that carefully. Universal aspirin has been proposed due to simplicity and potential cost-effectiveness, yet modeling and implementation data suggest that risk-based strategies yield higher net benefit when harms and false positives are considered, and historical universal approaches have shown lower adherence and no clear reduction in preeclampsia; thus, current consensus favors targeted prophylaxis rather than universal use pending stronger universal-trial evidence [^116MBoFq] [^1114wmTv] [^115Aof9o].

> I should confirm practical implementation details because effectiveness depends on them. Initiation should occur after 12 weeks to mitigate theoretical first-trimester risks, with a strong preference for starting before 16 weeks when feasible; bedtime dosing is favored by some guidelines and studies for pharmacodynamic reasons, though the evidence base is mixed; duration should continue until delivery or 36–37 weeks in many guidelines, and adherence is crucial, as the magnitude of benefit tracks with compliance and early initiation [^116hEFyf] [^113YPowT] [^114zVtuA] [^113wyt9v].

> Let me reconsider areas of uncertainty so I don't overstate conclusions. The exact optimal dose within the 75–150 mg range remains unsettled, with guideline divergence and limited head-to-head trials; the incremental value of biomarker-enhanced first-trimester screening to refine who benefits most is promising but not universally adopted; and while early initiation appears to maximize benefit, the precise window before 16 weeks and whether very early initiation before 11 weeks adds value are not definitively established, warranting ongoing research and individualized judgment [^1149yXuU] [^111wkKpJ] [^112bk8tm].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that low-dose aspirin confers a modest but clinically meaningful reduction in preeclampsia and related adverse perinatal outcomes, with the most compelling benefits for preterm preeclampsia when started at or before 16 weeks' gestation; current best practice is to offer 81–150 mg daily, typically 81 mg in the U.S. context, beginning after 12 weeks and ideally before 16 weeks, continued until delivery, in patients meeting high- or multiple moderate-risk criteria, while monitoring for rare bleeding events and aligning with patient preferences and local guideline nuances [^1164CWcH] [^116Aag2n] [^113BisK5] [^116hEFyf].

---

Low-dose **aspirin** reduces the risk of **preeclampsia** by about 10–20% in high-risk pregnancies [^116Aag2n] [^114s1KcJ], with the greatest benefit when started before 16 weeks [^113u4sMG] and at doses ≥ 100 mg/day [^113u4sMG]. It also lowers preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and perinatal mortality without increasing serious maternal or neonatal bleeding [^114s1KcJ] [^116Aag2n]. Major guidelines recommend **75–162 mg/day** from 12–16 weeks until delivery for those at moderate-to-high risk; universal use is not advised due to modest benefit and potential bleeding risk [^113BisK5] [^112DdEso] [^1114wmTv]. Evidence is weaker in low-risk or general populations, and ongoing research aims to clarify optimal dose, timing, and risk stratification [^116JKGsj] [^1149yXuU].

---

## Mechanism of action

Aspirin's benefit in preeclampsia is thought to reflect its **antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects**, which counter the thromboxane-prostacyclin imbalance and endothelial dysfunction characteristic of the disease [^115Kn55a]. Low-dose aspirin **selectively inhibits platelet COX-1**, reducing thromboxane A2 and platelet aggregation while sparing endothelial prostacyclin, thereby improving uteroplacental perfusion and reducing ischemia [^113wyt9v].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting aspirin use

### Major randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses

- **PARIS collaboration (2007)**: Individual patient data meta-analysis of 32,217 women in 31 RCTs showed a 10% reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84–0.97), with greater benefit in high-risk women and when started before 20 weeks [^1118bBwb].

- **Cochrane review (2019)**: 77 trials (40,249 women) showed an 18% reduction in preeclampsia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77–0.88), with additional reductions in preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and small-for-gestational-age infants, and no excess bleeding [^114s1KcJ].

- **ASPREE trial (2017)**: 1,620 high-risk women; 150 mg aspirin started at 11–14 weeks reduced preterm preeclampsia by 62% (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20–0.72) [^113wyt9v].

- **Meta-analysis (2017)**: 45 RCTs (20,909 women) showed a dose-response and greater benefit when aspirin was started ≤ 16 weeks and at doses ≥ 100 mg/day [^111UPB1k].

### Summary of clinical benefits

| **Outcome** | **Relative risk reduction (rrr)** |
|-|-|
| Preeclampsia | 10–20% [^1118bBwb] [^114s1KcJ] |
| Preterm birth | 8–14% [^114s1KcJ] [^114ffJ9a] |
| Fetal growth restriction | 10–20% [^114s1KcJ] [^116Aag2n] |
| Perinatal mortality | 14–20% [^114s1KcJ] [^113abhPi] |

---

## Optimal timing and dosage

- **Timing**: Initiation before 16 weeks, ideally at 11–14 weeks, maximizes benefit by targeting early placental development [^112DdEso] [^111UPB1k].

- **Dosage**: 75–162 mg/day is effective; doses ≥ 100 mg/day may offer additional benefit, especially for preterm preeclampsia [^111UPB1k] [^113u4sMG].

- **Duration**: Continue until delivery or 36–37 weeks, balancing efficacy and bleeding risk [^113BisK5] [^114zVtuA].

---

## Safety profile

Low-dose aspirin is **generally safe in pregnancy**, with no significant increase in maternal or neonatal bleeding, placental abruption, or congenital anomalies in large trials and meta-analyses [^114s1KcJ] [^116Aag2n]. A small increase in postpartum hemorrhage has been observed in some studies but remains clinically acceptable given the overall benefits [^114s1KcJ].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | 81 mg/day after 12 weeks for high-risk pregnancies [^112pZit1] |
| ACOG | 81 mg/day from 12–28 weeks (ideally < 16 weeks) for moderate-to-high risk [^113BisK5] |
| WHO | 75 mg/day before 20 weeks for high-risk pregnancies [^112DdEso] |
| RCOG | 150 mg/day from 12 weeks for high-risk pregnancies [^112DdEso] |
| SOGC | 81–162 mg/day before 16 weeks for moderate-to-high risk [^114zVtuA] |

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **General population**: Evidence is weaker in low-risk women; universal aspirin is not recommended due to modest benefit and potential bleeding risk [^116MBoFq].

- **Dose optimization**: The optimal dose remains debated; higher doses may improve efficacy but require larger trials to confirm safety [^1149yXuU].

- **Implementation**: Adherence and early initiation are critical; real-world effectiveness depends on screening and timely prescribing [^114n4LwQ].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Current research focuses on **dose-comparison trials** to compare 75–81 mg vs 150–162 mg, with large trials underway in the US and LMICs [^1149yXuU]. Efforts also target refining risk stratification with biomarkers and clinical factors to personalize aspirin use [^114nSna1]. Additional studies are evaluating adherence, implementation, and equity to close evidence-to-practice gaps [^111pPRZA].

---

Low-dose aspirin **reduces preeclampsia and related adverse outcomes** in high-risk pregnancies, with the greatest benefit when started early and at doses ≥ 100 mg/day. It is safe, cost-effective, and recommended by major guidelines for moderate-to-high-risk pregnancies, but not for universal use. Ongoing research aims to optimize dose, timing, and risk stratification.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1122FNoA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: There is now good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) prevent pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their babies. A Cochrane Review identified moderate, but clinically important, reductions in the relative risks of pre-eclampsia (19%), preterm birth (7%) and perinatal mortality (16%) in women allocated antiplatelets, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, what dose of aspirin is best and when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start. Rather than undertake new trials, the best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from women enrolled in each trial. METHODS/DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis based on individual patient data. This involves the central collection, validation and re-analysis of thoroughly checked data from individual women in all the available randomised trials. The objective is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, will reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets delay the onset of pre-eclampsia or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile; when commenced during pregnancy; and/or by dose. DISCUSSION: The PARIS (Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies) Collaboration has been formed to undertake the review. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Final results should be available by 2006–7.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^1118bBwb]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of mortality and morbidity during pregnancy and childbirth. Antiplatelet agents, especially low-dose aspirin, might prevent or delay pre-eclampsia, and thereby improve outcome. Our aim was to assess the use of antiplatelet agents for the primary prevention of pre-eclampsia, and to explore which women are likely to benefit most.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 32,217 women, and their 32,819 babies, recruited to 31 randomised trials of pre-eclampsia primary prevention.

Findings

For women assigned to receive antiplatelet agents rather than control, the relative risk of developing pre-eclampsia was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.97), of delivering before 34 weeks was 0.90 (0.83–0.98), and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome was 0.90 (0.85–0.96). Antiplatelet agents had no significant effect on the risk of death of the fetus or baby, having a small for gestational age infant, or bleeding events for either the women or their babies. No particular subgroup of women was substantially more or less likely to benefit from antiplatelet agents than any other.

Interpretation

Antiplatelet agents during pregnancy are associated with moderate but consistent reductions in the relative risk of pre-eclampsia, of birth before 34 weeks' gestation, and of having a pregnancy with a serious adverse outcome.

### Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^114s1KcJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and dipyridamole, when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 March 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search in September 2019 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent were included. Studies only published in abstract format were eligible for inclusion if sufficient information was available. We would have included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials, if any had been identified in our search strategy. Quasi-random studies were excluded. Participants were pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were administration of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole), comparisons were either placebo or no antiplatelet.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For this update we incorporated individual participant data (IPD) from trials with this available, alongside aggregate data (AD) from trials where it was not, in order to enable reliable subgroup analyses and inclusion of two key new outcomes. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

Main Results

Seventy-seven trials (40,249 women, and their babies) were included, although three trials (relating to 233 women) did not contribute data to the meta-analysis. Nine of the trials contributing data were large (> 1000 women recruited), accounting for 80% of women recruited. Although the trials took place in a wide range of countries, all of the nine large trials involved only women in high-income and/or upper middle-income countries. IPD were available for 36 trials (34,514 women), including all but one of the large trials. Low-dose aspirin alone was the intervention in all the large trials, and most trials overall. Dose in the large trials was 50 mg (1 trial, 1106 women), 60 mg (5 trials, 22,322 women), 75mg (1 trial, 3697 women) 100 mg (1 trial, 3294 women) and 150 mg (1 trial, 1776 women). Most studies were either low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias; and the large trials were all low risk of bas. Antiplatelet agents versus placebo/no treatment The use of antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia by 18% (36,716 women, 60 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88; high-quality evidence), number needed to treat for one women to benefit (NNTB) 61 (95% CI 45 to 92). There was a small (9%) reduction in the RR for preterm birth < 37 weeks (35,212 women, 47 trials; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.95, high-quality evidence), NNTB 61 (95% CI 42 to 114), and a 14% reduction infetal deaths, neonatal deaths or death before hospital discharge (35,391 babies, 52 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; high-quality evidence), NNTB 197 (95% CI 115 to 681). Antiplatelet agents slightly reduced the risk of small-for-gestational age babies (35,761 babies, 50 trials; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; high-quality evidence), NNTB 146 (95% CI 90 to 386), and pregnancies with serious adverse outcome (a composite outcome including maternal death, baby death, pre-eclampsia, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 17,382 women; 13 trials, high-quality evidence), NNTB 54 (95% CI 34 to 132). Antiplatelet agents probably slightly increase postpartum haemorrhage > 500 mL (23,769 women, 19 trials; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; moderate-quality evidence due to clinical heterogeneity), and they probably marginally increase the risk of placental abruption, although for this outcome the evidence was downgraded due to a wide confidence interval including the possibility of no effect (30,775 women; 29 trials; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54; moderate-quality evidence). Data from two large trials which assessed children at aged 18 months (including results from over 5000 children), did not identify clear differences in development between the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Administering low-dose aspirin to pregnant women led to small-to-moderate benefits, including reductions in pre-eclampsia (16 fewer per 1000 women treated), preterm birth (16 fewer per 1000 treated), the baby being born small-for-gestational age (seven fewer per 1000 treated) and fetal or neonatal death (five fewer per 1000 treated). Overall, administering antiplatelet agents to 1000 women led to 20 fewer pregnancies with serious adverse outcomes. The quality of evidence for all these outcomes was high. Aspirin probably slightly increased the risk of postpartum haemorrhage of more than 500 mL, however, the quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded to moderate, due to concerns of clinical heterogeneity in measurements of blood loss. Antiplatelet agents probably marginally increase placental abruption, but the quality of the evidence was downgraded to moderate due to low event numbers and thus wide 95% CI. Overall, antiplatelet agents improved outcomes, and at these doses appear to be safe. Identifying women who are most likely to respond to low-dose aspirin would improve targeting of treatment. As almost all the women in this review were recruited to the trials after 12 weeks' gestation, it is unclear whether starting treatment before 12 weeks' would have additional benefits without any increase in adverse effects. While there was some indication that higher doses of aspirin would be more effective, further studies would be warranted to examine this.

### Prevention of pre-eclampsia with aspirin: a systematic review of guidelines and evaluation of the quality of recommendation evidence [^114Ka1uP]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence has shown significant benefits of aspirin for preventing pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to systematically review recommendations from clinical practice guidelines and other recommendation documents on aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

Ten databases were searched for statements from December 1, 2013, to January 1, 2022.

Selection Criteria

Without language restrictions, the most recent version of documents was considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted recommendations. Guideline quality was assessed using a modified AGREE-II instrument and the AGREE-REX tool.

Main Results

Out of 48 statements on the prevention of pre-eclampsia, 46 had recommendations on use of aspirin. Of them, 39 were supported by evidence from systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials. Three statements reported aspirin's significant reductions in preterm pre-eclampsia and one in perinatal death. Concerning quality, 41% of statements were rated as high quality in all domains of the AGREE-II tool, 15% were rated high quality in all domains of the AGREE-REX tool, and 11% were rated high quality in all domains on both tools.

Conclusions

While 96% of statements advocated for use of aspirin, only 9% reported a significant reduction in preterm pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Based on the AGREE tools, future statements could use methodological improvement.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^111EnQhf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite good evidence that antiplatelet agents (principally low dose aspirin) reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia and its consequences, such as preterm birth and perinatal mortality, uncertainty remains regarding whether some women (in terms of risk) benefit more than others, when in pregnancy treatment should ideally start, and whether treatment effectiveness is dependent on antiplatelet dose.

The best way to answer these questions is to utilise existing individual patient data from all women enrolled in trials that have addressed this question. This approach has been described as the 'gold standard' of systematic review methodology as it allows for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes.

The PARIS Collaboration has been formed to undertake a systematic review of all available trials, with meta-analysis based on individual patient data, to answer these important clinical questions. This will be the first individual patient data review in the perinatal field. Provision of data by the participating Collaborators commenced in 2004, and results will be ready for presentation in 2006. Following consultation and discussion with the Collaborative Group, the main publication is expected in early 2007.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112dkmP9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Methods/design

Objectives

The objective of this review is to confirm that antiplatelet agents, given during pregnancy, reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. The review will then determine the size of this effect, and whether antiplatelets reduce the severity of pre-eclampsia and/or its impact on important outcomes for women and their babies. It will also explore whether the effect of antiplatelets differs by womens' risk profile, when commenced during pregnancy, and/or by dose.

The main questions to be addressed in this review are:

- Do antiplatelet agents, primarily low dose aspirin, have clinically important benefits for women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia and their babies?

Investigation of this hypothesis will also explore whether the treatment effect differs, in a clinically meaningful way, between women with different risk factors such as those with a history of early onset pre-eclampsia, renal disease, diabetes, chronic hypertension, or autoimmune disease.

- Does the planned dose of aspirin affect outcome in terms of preventing or delaying the onset of pre-eclampsia or other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth or perinatal death?

- Do the effects of aspirin differ according to gestation at onset of treatment?

Identifying studies

The search strategy to identify potentially eligible studies will include a search of the register of trials developed and maintained by the Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group. Details of how this register is maintained are available elsewhere, but it involves extensive searching of bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and hand searching of relevant journals. Trialists will be asked if they know of any further studies. [See Additional file 1] for the list of trials potentially eligible for inclusion. In addition, all members of the Collaborative Group will be asked to notify any unpublished trials of which they are aware.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112aRfPe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Summary of systematic review of aggregate data in 2004

The updated Cochrane Review identified 51 trials with over 36,500 pregnant women evaluating antiplatelet agents, principally low dose aspirin, for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Nine of these trials included over 1000 women, and 15 involved less than 50 women. Fifty-one studies were excluded, mostly due to the non-availability of clinically relevant data. Aggregate data from the included trials demonstrated a 19% reduction (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.88) in the risk of developing pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents, rather than placebo or no antiplatelet. There was also a small (7%) reduction in the risk of pre-term birth (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.98) and a 16% reduction in the risk of the baby dying (RR 0.84 95% CI 0.74–0.96). Based on the average risk of women included in these trials, about 70 women would have to be treated to prevent one case of pre-eclampsia, and 240 to prevent one baby death.

These effects are much smaller than had initially been hoped for but, nevertheless, potentially they have considerable public health importance. The conclusion from this aggregate data review was that for most low-risk women large numbers of women would need to be treated with antiplatelets agents to prevent one episode of either pre-eclampsia or perinatal death. Whether there are specific high risk sub-groups of pregnant women for whom there might be greater benefits, remains unclear, as does the best time to initiate treatment, and at what dose. The aim is now to extend this review based on aggregate data, to utilise the available data for every individual woman in each trial to help address these remaining questions. The use of individual data for each woman will allow for more powerful and flexible analysis of both subgroups and outcomes. This review will therefore provide more specific information to guide the care of women at risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112ZrkPM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies

The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the types of study designs, participants, interventions and data completeness to be included in the review are listed below. Each potentially eligible study will be assessed independently by two members of the Secretariat, unblinded to the trial's identity. Any differences of opinion regarding the assessment of the inclusion criteria will be resolved by discussion between the two assessors. If differences cannot be resolved, a third member of the Secretariat will be asked to assess the study. If individual patient data are unavailable from an eligible trial, the trial will remain included in the review and aggregate data will be used.

a. Study design

Studies will be included in the review if they were randomised trials. Quasi-random study designs, such as those using alternate allocation, will be excluded. The level of allocation concealment within each trial will be assessed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook, and classified as either adequate, unclear or clearly inadequate. These assessments will be made together with the outcomes of thorough data checking procedures.

b. Participants

Participants will be pregnant women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Women who started treatment postpartum will be excluded, as will those who already have a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia at trial entry (defined as hypertension with new onset proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation, not due to renal disease).

c. Interventions

The interventions will be any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole), or any combination of antiplatelet agents, compared with placebo or no antiplatelet agent. This is regardless of dose, mode of administration and irrespective of whether the antiplatelet is in combination with another drug. Trials that assessed only physiological outcomes following a short duration of intended therapy will be excluded.

d. Completeness of follow-up

The main analyses will include all trials that fulfill the previous inclusion criteria, regardless of completeness of follow-up. Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the effect of the inclusion of data from trials where only small numbers of enrolled participants have available outcome data. The threshold for an acceptable level of data completeness may vary by outcome. For example, for long-term follow-up of women and children, data may be included if follow-up was less than 80% provided that substantive bias between the groups was unlikely. Other outcomes from each trial may only be included in the analysis if available for 80% or more of women.

### Clinical risk factors for pre-eclampsia determined in early pregnancy: systematic review and meta-analysis of large cohort studies [^111phgQB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a common condition of pregnancy, marked by the onset of hypertension and proteinuria. At least 75 randomized controlled trials have shown that antiplatelet agents — especially aspirin — effectively and safely prevent pre-eclampsia among women at moderate or high risk of developing the condition. Meta-analyses have shown a 53% (95% confidence interval 35% to 66%) reduction in relative risk for pre-eclampsia when aspirin is started at 12–16 weeks' gestation among high risk women. Internationally published clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that physicians and midwives use aspirin to treat women at high risk of pre-eclampsia. These guidelines suggest choosing from a list of single risk factors to identify women at high risk or from a combination of moderate risk factors, but the derivation of this partial list was neither systematic nor based on clinical risk factors that are available up to 16 weeks' gestation. Focus on those at high risk of pre-eclampsia avoids the treatment of healthy women, who gain little or no benefit from aspirin prophylaxis.

### Low-dose aspirin therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia: time to reconsider our recommendations? [^112DdEso]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiation of 81 mg of aspirin daily for women at risk of preeclampsia between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, with continuation until delivery. The World Health Organization recommends that 75 mg of aspirin should be initiated before 20 weeks of gestation for women at high risk of preeclampsia. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence quality statement on "Antenatal Assessment of Pre-eclampsia Risk" request that healthcare providers prescribe low-dose aspirin to pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia daily from 12 weeks of gestation. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends 150 mg of aspirin daily, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggest risk stratification with a dosage of 75 mg for those at moderate risk of preeclampsia and 150 mg for those at high risk of preeclampsia. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics initiative on preeclampsia recommends 150 mg of aspirin to be initiated at 11 to 14+6 week's gestation and also proposes that 2 tablets of 81 mg is an acceptable alternative. Review of the available evidence suggests that both the dosage and timing of aspirin initiation is key to its effectiveness at reducing the risk of preeclampsia. Doses of > 100 mg of aspirin daily initiated before 16 weeks' gestation seem to be most effective at reducing the risk of preeclampsia and thus dosages recommended by most major societies and organizations may not be effective. Randomized control trials examining 81 mg vs 162 mg of aspirin daily for the prevention of preeclampsia are required to assess the safety and efficacy of aspirin dosages available in the United States.

### Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^113abhPi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, low-dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), EMBASE (1994 to 2003) and we handsearched the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi-random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low-dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials for inclusion in the review and extracted data. We entered data into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Fifty-one trials involving 36,500 women are included in this review. There is a 19% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents ((43 trials, 33,439 women; relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.88); number needed to treat (NNT) 69 (51, 109)). Twenty-eight trials (31,845 women) reported preterm birth. There is a small (7%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks ((RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98); NNT 83 (50, 238)). Fetal or neonatal deaths were reported in 38 trials (34,010 women). Overall there is a 16% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96); NNT 227 (128, 909)). Small-for-gestational age babies were reported in 32 trials (24,310 women), with an 8% reduction in risk (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low-dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment is best started, and at what dose.

### Should we recommend universal aspirin for all pregnant women? [^111Tdk33]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in at-risk populations. Its role in low-risk populations is as yet unknown. Novel preeclampsia screening tests are emerging that can predict the risk of the development of preeclampsia from as early as 11 weeks of gestation. It may be more efficacious, acceptable, and cost-effective to prescribe low-dose aspirin to all pregnant women from the first trimester as opposed to performing a screening test in the first instance. There is variation in opinion: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests the use of aspirin only in women who are at risk of preeclampsia, based on patient history; the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, UK, and the US Preventative Services Task Force recommend the use of low-dose aspirin if there is 1 major or 2 moderate risk factors. This point-counterpoint discussion shall address (1) controversies regarding the real impact of low-dose aspirin; (2) controversies in the actual guidelines among the different national societies; (3) controversies regarding emerging preeclampsia screening tests in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy, and (4) points in favor of the provision of universal vs screened-positive women.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112UzxVr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Although it is known that pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder, the relationship between the placental pathology and maternal endothelial response is not fully understood. Numerous maternal factors can predispose to the disorder, such as previous pre-eclampsia, diabetes, renal disease, chronic hypertension or other risk factors. The syndrome known as pre-eclampsia may also be more than one disease, each with distinct origins, pathologic characteristics and natural history, rather than one fundamental process with varying degrees of clinical severity. Hence, the ability to assess the affect of antiplatelets on women with individual risk factors, or a series of risk factors, is of great relevance to clinicians and women. A meta-analysis based on data from individual women will enable the exploration of these hypotheses.

Randomised trials of antiplatelet agents

The effects of antiplatelet agents were first evaluated in small randomised trials, which reported striking reductions in the risk of hypertension and proteinuria. These trials were too small to provide reliable information about other more substantive outcomes, such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth. Also, there was no information about the potential hazards of antiplatelet therapy, such as a possible increased risk of bleeding for both the woman and her baby, or possible effects on infant and child development. The promising results of these early trials led to several large studies around the world. Before these could be completed, however, the use of low dose aspirin had already become relatively widespread for women considered at increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Results of the larger trials were disappointing, as they failed to confirm any statistically significant reductions in substantive outcomes. Nevertheless, the first Cochrane Review of these trials demonstrated that, when taken together, there are modest, but clinically important benefits.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112jyKJe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a multi-factorial condition. Although its aetiology remains unclear, there have been significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder. The primary lesion is thought to be deficient trophoblast invasion of the maternal spiral arteries in the second trimester, leading to underperfusion of the uteroplacental circulation and placental ischaemia. The resulting placental damage is thought to lead to release of factors into the maternal circulation, which are responsible for the maternal syndrome. Activation of platelets and the clotting system may occur early in the course of the disease, before clinical symptoms develop. Deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, with excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation, have also been demonstrated to occur in pre-eclampsia. These observations have led to the hypothesis that antiplatelet agents, low dose aspirin (< 300 mg/day) in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia or reduce its severity and the risk of adverse events.

It is further hypothesised that the effect of antiplatelets may be different if treatment is started before placental implantation is complete. If this hypothesis were correct, the greatest benefit should be seen in women who started treatment before 16 weeks gestation, with the effect attenuating with later onset of treatment. Similarly, it remains unclear as to the most appropriate dose of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in order to maximise benefits whilst minimising harms. It has been suggested that low doses of aspirin may selectively inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase pathway in platelet production but not in vessel wall endothelium thereby diminishing the synthesis of thromboxane but not of prostacycline. A higher dose may inhibit both thromboxane and prostacycline thereby neutralising the effect of the intervention. However, there is also limited evidence from randomised trials that a higher dose of aspirin may effect a greater reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^116JPHH5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Planned analyses

This section contains a summary of the planned analyses. The full, detailed analysis plan will be discussed and agreed upon by the Collaborators before any data have been analysed.

Analysis will aim to be of all women ever randomised and will be based on intention to treat. In the main analyses a two stage approach will be taken. Outcomes will be analysed in their original trial and then these separate results will be combined to give an overall measure of effect. A fixed effect model will be used and the assumption of homogeneity of treatment effects will be tested using the chi squared test. The I 2 statistic will also be used to assess consistency of results.

1. Outcomes to be analysed

The main analyses comparing the effect of antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agents will be undertaken for all outcomes listed below, for the woman and any fetus/baby. The planned sub-group and sensitivity analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes listed as follows:

a. Main outcomes

- pre-eclampsia

- pregnancy loss / neonatal death

- pre-term birth

- small for gestational age infant

- pregnancy with serious adverse outcome

b. Other outcomes

- early onset pre-eclampsia

- maternal death

- severe maternal morbidity

- antepartum haemorrhage

- placental abruption

- induction of labour

- Caesarean section delivery

- postpartum haemorrhage

- gestation at delivery

- infant admission to special care or neonatal intensive care unit

- infant required assisted ventilation

- neonatal bleeding

- infant death

2. Planned sub-group analyses

The planned sub-group analyses will be restricted to the designated main outcomes unless there are clear indications for expanding the analyses further.

a. Trial-level characteristics

The effect of antiplatelet therapy may vary across the trials in the meta-analysis because they have used different agents in different ways. To explore this further, analyses are planned whereby trials will be grouped according to the agent used and by dose. These analyses will focus on the main outcomes. Trials will be classified into subsets based on the following:

(i) type of antiplatelet(s)

Trials will be grouped by the type of antiplatelet agent (trials that used aspirin alone, trials that used other antiplatelet agents, trials that used both aspirin and other antiplatelets agents) given as the active treatment.

(ii) daily dose of aspirin

In trials that used aspirin alone, trials will be grouped by planned aspirin dose (< 75 mg, 75–149 mg, ≥ 150 mg).

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia [^1143HNZ9]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Pre-eclampsia remains one of the major obstetrical problems in less-developed countries. The causes of this condition are still unknown, thus effective primary prevention is not possible at this stage. Research in the past decade has identified some major risk factors for pre-eclampsia, and manipulation of these factors might result in a decrease in its frequency. In the early 1990s aspirin was thought to be the wonder drug in secondary prevention of pre-eclampsia. Results of large trials have shown that this is not the case: if there is an indication for using aspirin it is in the patient at a very high risk of developing severe early-onset disease. The calcium story followed a more or less similar pattern, with the difference that existing evidence shows that women with a low dietary calcium intake are likely to benefit from calcium supplementation. Proper antenatal care and timed delivery are of utmost importance in tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia. There is evidence to suggest that the intrinsic direct effect of moderate degrees of maternal hypertension is beneficial to the fetus. Severe hypertension needs treatment. If antihypertensive is indicated, there is no clear choice of a drug. Hydralazine should no longer be thought of as the primary drug, most studies show a preference for calcium channel blockers.

### Aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yB6WH]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Low-dose aspirin is used for pre-eclampsia prophylaxis during pregnancy, but a study that comprehensively investigates both maternal and perinatal outcomes from aspirin administration utilizing stratification methods is lacking. The aim of this study is to comprehensively investigate the maternal and neonatal outcomes related to aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy in relation to dose and therapy initiation by utilizing a stratification method.

Evidence Acquisition

Placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating the effect of low-dose aspirin on maternal or perinatal outcomes with sufficient raw data and published in English from inception to August 2020 were searched for from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Review articles, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts, and nonplacebo-controlled studies were excluded.

Evidence Synthesis

A total of 35 placebo-controlled randomized trials with 46,568 pregnant women were included in this meta-analysis. Aspirin prophylaxis substantially lowered the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and intrauterine growth retardation without elevated bleeding risks. Low-dose aspirin considerably enhanced neonatal birth weight but did not decrease the risk of gestational hypertension. The subgroup analysis revealed substantially reduced pre-eclampsia risk and enhanced birth weight and gestational age at delivery in women who initiated aspirin before 20 weeks of gestation (RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64, 0.90, p = 0.001). However, the effect of aspirin dose on pregnancy outcomes was insignificant and requires further evaluation.

Conclusions

Initiation of low-dose aspirin administration before 20 weeks of gestation considerably decreases the incidence of pre-eclampsia and related neonatal outcomes without increasing bleeding risk.

### WITHDRAWN: antiplatelet agents for preventing and treating pre-eclampsia [^113H4EBU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia.

Search Strategy

This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994–1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked.

Main Results

Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of aspirin or gestation at randomisation. Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0.75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, > 10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.

### Aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia: the conundrum of how, who and when [^114rmG6w]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is widely used in preventing early onset preeclampsia in women who are identified as being high risk. Although the benefit of aspirin is increasingly evident and acknowledged, there remains many unanswered questions with regards to its optimal application in pregnancy. The issues mainly centre around the relatively modest risk reduction that is observed with the use of aspirin prophylactically. We aim to explore the reasons behind the conservative rate of benefit and aim to explore factors that are likely to influence the outcomes with the use of aspirin.

### Metaanalysis vs large clinical trials: which should guide our management? [^113FAGhD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Large, randomized clinical trials have long been considered the gold standard to guide clinical care. Metaanalysis is a type of analysis in which results of a number of randomized clinical trials are combined and a summary measure of effect for a given treatment is ascertained. The clinician in practice often is faced with a dilemma regarding the type of evidence that should be used to guide clinical practice; for many clinical problems, there are both randomized controlled trials and metaanalyses available. The cases of calcium and aspirin therapy for the prevention of preeclampsia afford an opportunity to explore the benefits and limitations of each type of study to guide clinical practice. We conclude that, when available, large randomized clinical trials should be used to guide clinical practice.

b. Patient-level characteristics

One of the strengths of individual patient data reviews is that it allows us to assess eligibility and outcome using individual women's characteristics. Subgroup analyses will explore whether any particular risk factors act as effect modifiers. That is, are there any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents? These analyses will take account each individual woman's own characteristics, rather than relying on summary measures of the 'average' risk profile of all participants in an individual trial.

Analyses will be undertaken to explore whether there are any particular types of women who benefit more or less from antiplatelet agents based on the following criteria:

(i) risk factor profile for pre-eclampsia at trial entry

Women normotensive at trial entry:

- previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: previous early onset (≤ 33 weeks + 6 days gestation) pre-eclampsia or eclampsia / previous pre-eclampsia / previous gestational hypertension / no previous hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy but family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy / no previous pregnancy and no family history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

- diabetes: pre-existing diabetes at enrolment / no pre-existing diabetes at enrolment

- renal disease: pre-existing renal disease / no pre-existing renal disease

- autoimmune disease: autoimmune disease / no autoimmune disease

- multiple pregnancy: multiple pregnancy / singleton pregnancy

- maternal age: < 20 years / 20–35 years / > 35 years. Maternal age may also be analysed as a continuous variable.

- diagnostic test results: abnormal uterine artery Doppler scan / other diagnostic test abnormalities / no abnormal diagnostic test results

- previous SGA: previous small for gestational age infant / previous infant not small for gestational age / no previous infant

- primigravida: first pregnancy with no other risk factors / first pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with one or more risk factors / second or subsequent pregnancy with no risk factors

Women with hypertension at trial entry:

- hypertension: gestational hypertension / chronic hypertension

(ii) gestation at trial entry

To determine whether antiplatelet agents are differentially effective if given earlier in pregnancy and to determine the magnitude of any difference, gestational age at randomisation will be primarily analysed as a continuous variable in regression analyses. However, a subgroup analysis with women classified according to the following categories may also be performed: < 16 weeks, 16–19 completed weeks, 20–23 completed weeks, 24–27 completed weeks, ≥ 28 weeks gestation. If numbers are insufficient for any category, categories will be combined.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114Wt5DV]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Management context and aspirin effect — Interventions to manage preeclampsia, such as antihypertensive medication, early delivery, and magnesium sulfate treatment, can reduce complications and mortality; the definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the placenta, and evidence demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the risk of preeclampsia in high-risk populations.

### Pre-eclampsia in low and middle-income settings: what are the barriers to improving perinatal outcomes and evidence-based recommendations? [^111Jz7yX]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss the points that still challenge low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and strategies that have been studied to help them overcome these issues.

Methods

Narrative review addressing 20years of articles concerning pre-eclampsia morbidity and mortality in LMICs. We summarized evidence-based strategies to overcome the challenges in order to reduce the pre-eclampsia impact on perinatal outcomes.

Results

Pre-eclampsia is the first or second leading cause in the ranking of avoidable causes of maternal death, and approximately 16% of all maternal deaths are attributable to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Considering the social and economic contexts, it represents a major public health concern, and prevention and early detection of pre-eclampsia seem to be a major challenge. Reducing maternal mortality related to hypertensive disturbances depends on public policies to manage these preventable conditions. Early and continuous recognition of signs of severity related to hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and childbirth, self-monitoring of symptoms and blood pressure, as well as preventive approaches such as aspirin and calcium, and magnesium sulfate, are lifesaving procedures that have not yet reached a universal scale.

Conclusion

This review provides a vision of relevant points to support pregnant women in overcoming the constraints to healthcare access in LMICs, and strategies that can be applied in primary prenatal care units.

### Stillbirth: prevention and supportive bereavement care [^115p3JnD]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin: to reduce pre-eclampsia risk

Crandon and Isherwood's seminal 1979 paper documented the efficacy of prophylactic aspirin in reducing pre-eclampsia. Subsequent systematic reviews have synthesised large randomised controlled trials, examining the benefits, optimal timing, and dosage of aspirin given antenatally, as well as in target populations for prophylaxis.

A 2013 systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed reduced pre-eclampsia, perinatal death, and fetal growth restriction among individuals at high risk commenced on aspirin before 16 weeks. A subsequent 2017 systematic review of 45 randomised clinical trials identified increased benefits with more than 100 mg aspirin daily, without increasing adverse effects. A 2018 systematic reviewthat examined stillbirth prevention identified only one study of 24 patients who had had previous miscarriage, comparing 75 mg aspirin with placebo. This study found no benefit, and the findings were severely limited by its small size and homogenous population.

Few studies examining aspirin use in pregnancy are powered to detect stillbirth risk reduction. The ASPRE trialrandomly assigned 2971 participants at high risk of pre-eclampsia to 150 mg aspirin or placebo; the results suggested a possible lower rate of stillbirth and neonatal death among those receiving aspirin versus placebo (8 (1.0%) of 798 v 14 (1.7%) of 822, odds ratio 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.85)).

Risk stratification is undergoing debate, and international guidelines inconsistently describe target populations for prophylactic aspirin. A prospective, multicentre study compared a composite screen of maternal factors and objective investigations with current screening advised by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)guidelines, for which the results are shown in table 1. Both pre-eclampsia detection rates and false positive rates varied widely between guidelines. Given the relative safety of aspirin administration, an argument could be made for universal low dose aspirin in pregnancy.

Table 1
Comparison of screening strategies for identifying women in early pregnancy who are at risk of developing pre-eclampsia

Recent evidence suggests that aspirin might be much more effective than previously thought, with high compliance preceding 16 weeks; note, the effectiveness of aspirin on pre-eclampsia greatly reduced with decreasing compliance.

ESC/ESH 2018 — prevention of pre-eclampsia indicates that women at high or moderate-risk of pre-eclampsia should be advised to take 100–150 mg of aspirin daily from weeks 12–36. High risk of pre-eclampsia includes any of the following: hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, CKD, autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension. Moderate-risk of pre-eclampsia includes one or more of the following risk factors: first pregnancy, age ≥ 40 years, pregnancy interval of > 10 years, BMI of ≥ 35 kg/m2 at first visit, family history of pre-eclampsia, and multiple pregnancy.

### Pre-eclampsia part 2: prediction, prevention and management [^114nSna1]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

An antiangiogenic state might constitute a terminal pathway for the multiple aetiologies of pre-eclampsia, especially those resulting from placental abnormalities. The levels of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins in maternal blood change prior to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, correlate with disease severity and have prognostic value in identifying women who will develop maternal and/or perinatal complications. Potential interventions exist to ameliorate the imbalance of angiogenesis and, hence, might provide opportunities to improve maternal and/or perinatal outcomes in pre-eclampsia. Current strategies for managing pre-eclampsia consist of controlling hypertension, preventing seizures and timely delivery of the fetus. Prediction of pre-eclampsia in the first trimester is of great interest, as early administration of aspirin might reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, albeit modestly. Combinations of biomarkers typically predict pre-eclampsia better than single biomarkers; however, the encouraging initial results of biomarker studies require external validation in other populations before they can be used to facilitate intervention in patients identified as at increased risk. Angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors might also be useful in triage of symptomatic patients with suspected pre-eclampsia, differentiating pre-eclampsia from exacerbations of pre-existing medical conditions and performing risk assessment in asymptomatic women. This Review article discusses the performance of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for pre-eclampsia, current strategies for preventing and managing the condition and its long-term consequences.

11 CONSIDERATIONS FOR UNIVERSAL ASPIRIN IN PRE‐ECLAMPSIA PREVENTION

Considering the clear benefit of aspirin in reducing the risk of preterm pre‐eclampsia, its low cost, and safety profile, some investigators advocate for universal aspirin prophylaxis for pre‐eclampsia prevention. It has been suggested that this would be a more cost‐effective strategy compared to using aspirin prophylaxis in women determined to be at high risk through a process of screening, which has been considered rather complex for implementation. Nevertheless, possible benefits of a preventive strategy need to be balanced with potential harm due to hemorrhagic and other adverse events. Benefits of universal aspirin and long‐term safety of this strategy have not been adequately studied in randomized trials. Additionally, good adherence to treatment is paramount to successful prevention. Compliance is likely to be lower when aspirin is given to the whole population than when recommended to a selected high‐risk group of women counselled based on individual risk. Earlier trials in which pregnant women received aspirin on the sole basis of being pregnant or nulliparous demonstrated an increased frequency of bleeding episodes, low compliance with aspirin at only about 50%, and no reduction in the incidence of pre‐eclampsia. Analogously, universal aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in healthy older adults resulted in a significantly higher risk of major hemorrhage but did not significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Perceptions and experiences of the prevention, identification and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: a qualitative evidence synthesis [^111pPRZA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

This theory‐based analytical approach of applying the TDF to evidence synthesis has been adopted in several previous reviews, including in maternal health. We will draw on those approaches by applying the COM‐B and TDF frameworks to understand, structure, and interpret factors affecting the prevention, identification, and management of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia.

In addition to intervention efficacy, developing recommendations according to evidence‐to‐decision frameworks requires consideration of acceptability and feasibility domains. This qualitative evidence synthesis will provide a valuable evidence base to inform the development of recommendations relating to pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia in guideline updates by the WHO and other guideline organisations. In particular, the timing of this review aligns with two large trials of different dosing regimens for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia in pregnant women screened as high risk in South Africa, Ghana and Kenya, and the United States. If the trials' results are conclusive regarding the optimal dose, this review will help inform subsequent implementation efforts and an updated WHO guideline recommendation.

Our qualitative evidence synthesis will explore and identify reasons why interventions known to be effective for the prevention and treatment of pre‐eclampsia and eclampsia are not available to all women in all contexts. Maternal mortality and severe morbidity disproportionately impact women in low‐ and lower‐ middle income countries, as well as socioeconomically marginalised women in upper‐middle and high‐income countries (e.g. Black women in the United States and the UK). Even where evidence‐based guidelines are in place, gaps in knowledge translation persist, particularly in low‐resource settings. Low‐cost interventions that are known to be effective, such as low‐dose aspirin for women at high risk of developing pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia, and magnesium sulphate to prevent and treat seizures, are underutilised. Findings from this review will help inform future implementation research for these and other interventions, and the development of strategies to resolve current evidence‐to‐practice gaps.

How this review might inform or supplement what is already known in this area

There are a range of interventions known to effectively prevent and manage pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) published guidelines for the prevention and management of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia. Since then, the WHO has reviewed and updated specific recommendations regarding antihypertensive drug treatment for severe and non‐severe hypertension, when to use interventionist management versus expectant management (i.e. close monitoring without intervention unless the woman's condition changes), calcium supplementation during or before pregnancy, and antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre‐eclampsia. Implementation of these guidelines has proven challenging, especially in low‐resource settings.

Prevention of pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia

Prevention strategies include screening women to identify those at high risk of developing pre‐eclampsia/eclampsia and prescribing low‐dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or diet‐/exercise‐based measures. Calcium supplementation is also recommended for women with low dietary intake of calcium.

Primary qualitative studies have explored women's attitudes to risk screening, but no systematic review to date has synthesised this evidence. A qualitative evidence synthesis of six studies on adherence to low‐dose aspirin during pregnancy found a range of barriers to and facilitators of the initiation, implementation, and discontinuation of aspirin. All studies included in the review were from high‐income country settings, and barriers reported by women included insufficient knowledge and advice, feeling overwhelmed, lack of access to medication, feeling nauseous, and feeling tired. Facilitators included receiving consistent messaging and easy‐to‐understand information, trusting in the healthcare provider, believing in the concept of prevention, and developing strategies to remember to take the medication. The review focused on women's perspectives on adherence to aspirin but did not consider health worker or community perspectives.

A 2023 mixed‐methods systematic review of 16 studies (six of which included qualitative data) explored factors affecting the implementation of calcium supplementation for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia, finding a range of barriers and facilitators for women consuming calcium supplements and healthcare providers promoting calcium. Barriers to women taking calcium included limited knowledge about pre‐eclampsia, inadequate information about calcium, fear of adverse effects, and perceptions that taking calcium was inconvenient or over‐medicalising pregnancy. Facilitators for women taking calcium included improved knowledge through adequate information and counselling, assurance about safety, positive perception of tablet characteristics, and family support. While this review focused on women's and health workers' experiences with calcium supplementation, in practice calcium supplementation should be experienced within a comprehensive approach to pre‐eclampsia prevention, including education, screening, and aspirin prophylaxis if indicated. To date, no review has explored the package of related prevention activities in its entirety.

USPSTF implementation — pregnant persons with 1 or more high-risk factors should receive low-dose aspirin, and those with 2 or more moderate-risk factors may also benefit, but the evidence is less certain for this approach; aspirin is available in the US as 81-mg tablets and low-dose aspirin use should be initiated after 12 weeks of gestation (studies most often initiated before 20 weeks of gestation); regarding the FDA warning about nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs around 20 weeks of gestation, an exception is the use of an 81-mg dose of aspirin for certain pregnancy-related conditions under the direction of a health care clinician.

### Aspirin in pregnancy [^111xbXnV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. Aspirin has been long purported and extensively studied for prevention of preeclampsia. For this reason, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend its use in pregnancy for preeclampsia prevention in those at high risk. Yet, much controversy exists regarding optimal use in pregnancy with guidelines across global organizations varying. In this narrative review, we summarize the published literature related to the safety, optimal dose, and timing and duration of use of aspirin, as well as other indications for which aspirin has been studied in pregnancy.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, and assessed the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia and who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

Ways of overcoming these limitations by using individual patient data

- Obtaining individual patient data from previously excluded trials will allow assessment of whether these trials are eligible for inclusion, both in terms of available outcomes and methodological quality. This will potentially increase the power and scope of the analyses.

- Trial level information obtained by direct discussion with the trialists enables clarification of the definitions and measurements used. Data for measured, but previously unreported, outcomes can also often be obtained and trialists, who are part of a Collaborative group, may be able to provide missing outcome data. Furthermore, we will be able to apply common definitions across trials based on each woman's baseline and clinical data. For example, where possible, we will define pre-eclampsia based on a set of uniform criteria.

- Subgroup analyses will be performed for a number of different risk factors using individual patient's specific risk data, rather than using the aggregated risk profile of all women enrolled in a particular trial.

- By obtaining gestational age at randomisation for each individual woman, more precise patient-based analyses can be performed exploring whether gestation at treatment commencement alters the effectiveness of antiplatelets.

- Formation of a Collaborative group, is likely to lead to a more complete identification of all relevant trials, including those previously unpublished. This may help overcome the potential for publication bias. The patient-level data will also allow us to explore whether there were important differences in the characteristics of women enrolled in small and large trials.

Research needs and gaps — aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia: There are several critical evidence gaps, including the need for research on how to improve identifying persons at increased risk for preeclampsia and for comparative effectiveness trials to identify the specific aspirin protocol likely to have the greatest benefit. Further research is needed in populations that have the highest rates of preeclampsia, including Black persons, and studies are needed to more fully understand the populations most likely to benefit and what risk thresholds and factors should be used to identify eligible patient populations. Research is also needed on aspirin effectiveness for all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and to improve effective and equitable implementation of clinical guidelines for aspirin use in pregnancy.

Importance

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that poses serious maternal and infant health risks. Previous systematic reviews have established benefits of low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia and its sequelae.

Objective

To update evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on effectiveness of aspirin use in preventing preeclampsia in individuals at increased risk based on clinical risk factors or measurements associated with higher disease incidence than in the general population.

Data Sources

Studies from previous USPSTF review (2014), literature published January 2013 through May 15, 2020, in MEDLINE, PubMed (for publisher-supplied records only), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Ongoing surveillance through January 22, 2021.

Study Selection

Good- and fair-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia among individuals at increased risk; studies conducted in general populations to evaluate potential harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual article screening and risk-of-bias assessment. Study data abstracted into prespecified forms, checked for accuracy. Random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnosis of preeclampsia; adverse pregnancy health outcomes and complications including eclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and potential bleeding harms or infant/child harms from aspirin exposure.

Results

A total of 23 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (N = 26 952) were included; 18 were conducted among participants at increased preeclampsia risk. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 mg/d to 150 mg/d. Most trials enrolled majority White populations selected based on a range of risk factors. The incidence of preeclampsia among the trials of participants at increased risk ranged from 4% to 30%. Aspirin use was significantly associated with lower risk of preeclampsia (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.95]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 093]; I2 = 0%), perinatal mortality (pooled RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.96]; 11 RCTs [n = 13 860]; I2 = 0%), preterm birth (pooled RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67–0.95]; 13 RCTs [n = 13 619]; I2 = 49%), and intrauterine growth restriction (pooled RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; 16 RCTs [n = 14 385]; I2 = 41%). There were no significant associations of aspirin use with risk of postpartum hemorrhage (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.94–1.12]; 9 RCTs [n = 23 133]; I2 = 0%) and other bleeding-related harms, or with rare perinatal or longer-term harms. Absolute risk reductions for preeclampsia associated with aspirin use ranged from -1% to -6% across larger trials (n > 300) and were greater in smaller trials. For perinatal mortality, absolute risk reductions ranged from 0.5% to 1.1% in the 3 largest trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

Daily low-dose aspirin during pregnancy was associated with lower risks of serious perinatal outcomes for individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia, without evident harms.

### A nudge toward universal aspirin for preeclampsia prevention [^115Aof9o]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The July 2018 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines for aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention represent a departure from prior, more stringent guidelines and extend eligibility for aspirin prophylaxis to a large proportion of pregnant women in the United States. However, these latest guidelines are predicated on a complex, risk-factor-based screening algorithm and ignore the reality that, outside of the setting of clinical research, effective implementation of risk-factor-based approaches consistently falls short. Herein we argue for transitioning to universal aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia prevention using the concept of libertarian paternalism, knowing that altering the choice architecture from an "opt-in" to an "opt-out" system will greatly increase the number of patients who receive the advantage of this inexpensive, safe, and beneficial preventative intervention.

### The impact of aspirin combined with labetalol on coagulation function and pregnancy outcomes in pre-eclamptic pregnant women [^1114q8cH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder characterized by the development of new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation It is a progressive and unique condition that significantly affects the outcomes for both mothers and fetuses. Pre-eclampsia can be categorized into with or without severe features based on clinical manifestations and early-onset or late-onset depending on the timing of onset. The pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is believed to involve abnormalities in the uteroplacental vasculature, excessive activation of inflammatory and immune responses, endothelial cell damage, and genetic factors.

Clinical management of pre-eclampsia typically includes continue monitoring for patients without severe symptoms, while medication is administered to patients with severe symptoms. Labetalol, which belongs to the class of adrenergic receptor antagonists, has been commonly used in the past. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and increases blood volume. However, its effectiveness has shown limitations as the number of pre-eclampsia patients continues to rise. Aspirin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, possesses anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and vasodilatory properties. It has demonstrated promising results in the prevention of pre-eclampsia. To further enhance the clinical efficacy in pre-eclamptic pregnant women, our institution has adopted a treatment approach that combines aspirin with labetalol. We aim to analyze the impact of this combination therapy on coagulation function and pregnancy outcomes in order to provide insights and guidance for selecting appropriate medication regimens in clinical practice.

### Prophylactic aspirin dose and preeclampsia [^1149yXuU]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Research Implications

Ideally, large, randomized trials comparing different doses should be done to validate our conclusions. Any large trials examining different doses should include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that the risk-benefit ratio can be examined. Trials should include low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage is greatest. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently funded a large trialin low and middle income country settings comparing 75 and 150 mg of aspirin, including both preeclampsia and hemorrhage outcomes. In addition, a US-based studywas recently funded and plans to investigate the effects of different doses in a population of 10 000 women at increased risk of preeclampsia. Together with our study that included almost 14 000 women, the results from these trials will hopefully provide robust evidence on the appropriate aspirin dosage for preventing preeclampsia.

### Comparing aspirin 75 to 81 mg vs 150 to 162 mg for prevention of preterm preeclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VZNmv]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare 2 aspirin dosage regimens for the prevention of preterm preeclampsia (PE): 75 to 81 mg vs 150 to 162 mg taken daily starting in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Data Sources

A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1985 to April 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of 2 aspirin dosage regimens during pregnancy for the prevention of PE initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy. The intervention was an aspirin dosage between 150 and 162 mg daily, and the control was an aspirin dosage between 75 and 81 mg daily.

Methods

Of note, 2 reviewers independently screened all citations, selected studies, and evaluated the risk of bias. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and applied the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The corresponding authors of the included studies were contacted to validate each of the collected results. The primary outcome was the risk of preterm preeclampsia, and the secondary outcomes included term preeclampsia, any preeclampsia regardless of gestational age, and severe preeclampsia. Relative risks with their 95% confidence interval were calculated for each study and pooled for global analysis.

Results

Of note, 4 randomized controlled trials were retrieved involving 552 participants. Moreover, 2 randomized controlled trials were at unclear risk of bias, 1 trial at low risk of bias and 1 trial at high risk of bias, which did not have the information for the primary outcome. The pooled analysis demonstrated that an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg was associated with a significant reduction of preterm preeclampsia, compared with an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.79; p = 0.01; I² = 0%). There was no significant effect on the risk of term preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participants; relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–2.64; p = 0.48; I² = 64%) and all preeclampsia (4 studies; 552 participants; relative risk, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–1.05; p = 0.06; I² = 58%), but there was a reduction of severe preeclampsia (3 studies; 472 participantst; RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09–0.62; p = 0.003; I² = 0%).

Conclusion

When initiated in the first trimester of pregnancy, an aspirin dosage of 150 to 162 mg daily was associated with a lower risk of preterm PE than an aspirin dosage of 75 to 81 mg daily. However, the lack of large, high-quality studies limited the clinical scope of the current results taken alone.

### Antiplatelet agents for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its consequences: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112ALVNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical significance of pre-eclampsia

World-wide, over half a million women die each year of pregnancy related causes with 99% of these occurring in low resource countries. An estimated 10–15% of these maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

High blood pressure is common during pregnancy: approximately one in ten women will have their blood pressure recorded as above normal at some point before delivery. For women who develop raised blood pressure but have no other complications, pregnancy outcome is similar to that for women with normal blood pressure. Pre-eclampsia, a multi-system disorder of pregnancy usually associated with high blood pressure (hypertension) and proteinuria, complicates 2–8% of pregnancies. It can affect the mother's organs, leading to problems in liver, kidneys and brain, and to abnormalities of the clotting system. As the placenta is also involved, there are increased risks for the baby. The most common problems are poor fetal growth due to inadequate blood supply through the damaged placenta, and prematurity, related either to the spontaneous onset of pre-term labour or the need for an early, elective delivery.

Although the outcome for most women is good, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (the rare occurrence of seizures superimposed on the syndrome of pre-eclampsia) are major causes of maternal mortality. In low resource countries pre-eclampsia and eclampsia account for 10–15% of maternal deaths whilst in high resource countries pre-eclampsia is consistently a leading cause of maternal mortality. Perinatal mortality is also increased. There is little good quality information about morbidity for either mother or baby, but it is likely that this too is high. For example, pre-eclampsia accounts for about one fifth of antenatal admissions, two thirds of referrals to day care assessment units and a quarter of obstetric admissions to intensive care units. Pre-eclampsia is an antecedent for up to 19% of pre-term births and 12% of growth restricted babies. Also of note is the high rate of intrauterine growth restriction (20–25%) in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and the possible lifelong health effects due to prenatal programming.

Importance

Preeclampsia is one of the most serious health problems that affect pregnant persons. It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia.

Population

Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

Background

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To systematically review benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin for preventing morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2006 to June 2013); previous systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and surveillance searches for large studies (June 2013 to February 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to assess benefits among women at high preeclampsia risk and RCTs or large cohort studies of harms among women at any risk level. English-language studies of fair or good quality were included.

Data Extraction

Dual quality assessment and abstraction of studies.

Data Synthesis

Two large, multisite RCTs and 13 smaller RCTs of high-risk women (8 good-quality) were included, in addition to 6 RCTs and 2 observational studies of average-risk women to assess harms (7 good-quality). Depending on baseline risk, aspirin use was associated with absolute risk reductions of 2% to 5% for preeclampsia (relative risk [RR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.95]), 1% to 5% for intrauterine growth restriction (RR, 0.80 [CI, 0.65 to 0.99]), and 2% to 4% for preterm birth (RR, 0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). No significant perinatal or maternal harms were identified, but rare harms could not be ruled out. Evidence on long-term outcomes was sparse, but 18-month follow-up from the largest trial found no developmental harms.

Limitations

Benefits may have been overestimated due to small-study effects. Predictive intervals were not statistically significant. Future studies could shift findings toward the null.

Conclusion

Daily low-dose aspirin beginning as early as the second trimester prevented clinically important health outcomes. No harms were identified, but long-term evidence was limited.

Conclusions

In this large population-based study, we found no difference in either preeclampsia or bleeding complications when comparing 150 to 160 mg and 75 mg of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia. Large, randomized trials comparing aspirin doses must include both efficacy and safety as primary outcomes to ensure that any additional benefit of higher doses does not come at the risk of maternal bleeding.

### Do first-trimester screening algorithms for preeclampsia aligned to use of preventative therapies reduce the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wkKpJ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Traditional obstetric practice relies upon history-based assessment to screen for preeclampsia and guide preventative therapies but is hampered by low sensitivity, high false-positive rates and low treatment rates. First-trimester screening algorithms represent the most efficacious approach for risk prediction and could target early initiation of aspirin to well-defined high-risk populations. A large randomised controlled trial has demonstrated the clinical benefits of this approach, but widespread practice implementation has remained elusive.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis summarising studies linking first-trimester preeclampsia screening algorithms with the initiation of preventative therapy and examined their effect on pre-term preeclampsia rates compared with standard maternity care. Odds ratios were calculated together with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

7 studies with a total of 377,790 participants were included. Within singleton populations, early initiation of aspirin in response to a high-risk screening algorithm result reduced the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia by 39% compared with routine antenatal care (odds ratio 0.61; 95% CI: 0.52–0.70). There were significant reductions in the prevalence of preeclampsia at < 32–34 weeks, preeclampsia at any gestation and stillbirth.

Conclusion

First-trimester screening algorithms for preeclampsia aligned with early initiation of preventative therapy with aspirin reduce the prevalence of pre-term preeclampsia.

### A randomized controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia in women at high risk in China [^116U3fRy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-dose aspirin has been the most widely studied preventive drug for preeclampsia. However, guidelines differ considerably from country to country regarding the prophylactic use of aspirin for preeclampsia. There is limited evidence from large trials to determine the effect of 100 mg of aspirin for preeclampsia screening in women with high-risk pregnancies, based on maternal risk factors, and to guide the use of low-dose aspirin in preeclampsia prevention in China.

Objective

The Low-Dose Aspirin in the Prevention of Preeclampsia in China study was designed to evaluate the effect of 100 mg of aspirin in preventing preeclampsia among high-risk pregnant women screened with maternal risk factors in China, where preeclampsia is highly prevalent, and the status of low-dose aspirin supply is commonly suboptimal.

Study Design

We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial at 13 tertiary hospitals from 11 provinces in China between 2016 and 2019. We assumed that the relative reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia was at least 20%, from 20% in the control group to 16% in the aspirin group. Therefore, the targeted recruitment number was 1000 participants. Women were randomly assigned to the aspirin or control group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Statistical analyses were performed according to an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome was the incidence of preeclampsia, diagnosed along with a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation, with a previously normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg), and complicated by proteinuria. The secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the significance of difference of preeclampsia incidence between the groups for both the primary and secondary outcomes. Interaction analysis was also performed.

Results

A total of 1000 eligible women were recruited between December 2016 and March 2019, of which the final 898 patients were analyzed (464 participants in the aspirin group, 434 participants in the control group) on an intention-to-treat basis. No significant difference was found in preeclampsia incidence between the aspirin group (16.8% [78/464]) and the control group (17.1% [74/434]; relative risk, 0.986; 95% confidence interval, 0.738–1.317; p = 0.924). Likewise, adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Meanwhile, the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage between the 2 groups was similar (6.5% [30/464] in the aspirin group and 5.3% [23/434] in the control group; relative risk, 1.220; 95% confidence interval, 0.720–2.066; p = 0.459). We did not find any significant differences in preeclampsia incidence between the 2 groups in the subgroup analysis of the different risk factors.

Conclusion

A dosage of 100 mg of aspirin per day, initiated from 12 to 20 gestational weeks until 34 weeks of gestation, did not reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in pregnant women with high-risk factors in China.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors: a systematic review [^111FRPrc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with predisposing historical risk factors, such as previous history of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease.

Data Sources

Searches were conductes in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, National Research Register, SCISEARCH, AND ISI Conference Proceedings without any language restrictions, using the following medical subject headings and text words: "aspirin", "antiplatelet", "salicyl", "acetylsalicyl", "platelet aggregation inhibitors", "pre-eclamp", "preeclamp", and "hypertens*.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included all randomized trials that evaluated the effectiveness of aspirin compared with placebo or no treatment in women with predisposing historical risk factors and reported clinically relevant perinatal or maternal outcomes. Study selection, quality appraisal, and data extractions were performed independently and in duplicate. We identified 14 relevant trials, including a total of 12,416 women. Meta-analysis showed a significant benefit of aspirin therapy in reducing perinatal death (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.96) and preeclampsia (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76, 0.96). Aspirin was also associated with a reduction in rates of spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79, 0.94), and an increase of 215 g in mean birth weight (weighted mean difference 215, 95% CI 90, 341). There was no increase in the risk of placental abruption with aspirin (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79, 1.21). Funnel plot analysis indicated that publication and related biases were unlikely (Egger test, P = .84).

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk of perinatal death and preeclampsia in women with historical risk factors. Given the importance of these outcomes and the safety and low cost of aspirin, aspirin therapy should be considered in women with historical risk factors.

### Aspirin dosage for preeclampsia prophylaxis: an argument for 81-mg dosing [^1118MtL5]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Research conducted over the past few decades has shown that low-dose aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia. Consequently, numerous prominent organizations have adopted the recommendation to use low-dose aspirin during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia. However, the optimal dosage of low-dose aspirin (81mg versus 162mg) remains a subject of debate. Currently, there is insufficient high-quality data to justify the use of a higher dosage of low-dose aspirin. In this review, we review the existing evidence that supports the continued use of 81mg of aspirin over a higher dose and emphasize the need for high-quality research to alter current recommendations.

### Low-dose aspirin for prevention of adverse outcomes related to abnormal placentation [^1131Er8Y]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis of randomized studies on the use of low-dose aspirin in women at high risk of preeclampsia (PE) has demonstrated that if treatment is initiated at ≤ 16weeks' gestation, there is significant reduction in the risk of PE [relative risk (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36–0.62], fetal growth restriction (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33–0.64), preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22–0.57) and perinatal death (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19–0.92), whereas the effect of treatment after 16weeks is substantially less (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.08; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.97; and RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73–1.19, respectively). Moreover, the decrease in the risk of PE from early onset treatment seems to be related to the dose of aspirin, and a dose of > 80mg daily should be considered for optimal benefits.

### Cost-effectiveness of a randomized controlled trial comparing low-dose aspirin to placebo for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth [^1168UJ6b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In the subgroup analysis among women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth < 30 +0 weeks of gestation, we observed a high probability of aspirin being cost‐effective as compared to placebo. This may be a reflection of varying proportions of different underlying etiologies of spontaneous preterm birth across the gestational age spectrum. A better understanding and clinical recognition of pathophysiologic mechanisms, and a better understanding of the effect of aspirin is needed to target therapy based on etiology, rather than using gestational age cutoffs as a proxy.

There is an ongoing debate on universal aspirin administration during pregnancy for the prevention of preterm pre‐eclampsia. Universal aspirin use would probably improve other pregnancy outcomes related to uteroplacental insufficiency as well, that is, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and perinatal death. Recent cost‐effectiveness analyses have shown universal aspirin to be the dominant strategy over targeted aspirin use following either history‐based screening strategies or combined biomarker and ultrasound screening measures. These studies showed significant health gains of universal aspirin use, and it was cost‐saving. However, some concerns about universal aspirin that have been raised are acceptability, compliance, and the safety for mother and child. Meta‐analyses did not show increased maternal bleedings risk nor any other major harm. There may be an increased risk of rash or hives. As for the long‐term health of children with antenatal aspirin exposure, there seems to be no harm based on the available literature.

Due to the concerns about universal aspirin use, aspirin prophylaxis following risk‐based first‐trimester screening strategies for pre‐eclampsia is also being advocated. Although screening tests incur additional costs, this targeted approach is still cost‐effective compared to routine care. However, prognostic models for spontaneous preterm birth have poor performance as compared to pre‐eclampsia. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth remains challenging due to its multifactorial etiology.

Alternatively to screening tests, low‐dose aspirin administration to nulliparous women is being considered as nulliparity is an important risk factor for both pre‐eclampsia and preterm birth. The ASPIRIN trial was the first trial evaluating low‐dose aspirin compared to placebo with preterm birth as the primary outcome and showed a large reduction of preterm birth among nulliparous women in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Their cost‐effectiveness analysis showed aspirin is cost‐effective and resulted in costs of $248 per prevented preterm birth, $471 per prevented perinatal death and $15.95 per disability‐adjusted life year.

### Early administration of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of severe and mild preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RyWaw]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early administration of aspirin prevents severe and mild preeclampsia.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were performed. Studies in which women were randomized at or before 16 weeks' gestation to low-dose aspirin versus placebo or no treatment were included. The outcomes of interest were severe preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia. Pooled relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

Among 7941 citations retrieved, 352 were completely reviewed and four studies (392 women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. When compared with controls, aspirin started at ≤ 16 weeks was associated with a significant reduction in severe (relative risk: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.57) but not mild (relative risk: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.96) preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Low-dose aspirin initiated at or before 16 weeks reduces the risk of severe preeclampsia, but not mild preeclampsia.

### Prevention of preeclampsia with aspirin [^113wyt9v]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension arising after 20 weeks of gestational age with proteinuria or other signs of end-organ damage and is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, particularly when of early onset. Although a significant amount of research has been dedicated in identifying preventive measures for preeclampsia, the incidence of the condition has been relatively unchanged in the last decades. This could be attributed to the fact that the underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia is not entirely understood. There is increasing evidence suggesting that suboptimal trophoblastic invasion leads to an imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins, ultimately causing widespread inflammation and endothelial damage, increased platelet aggregation, and thrombotic events with placental infarcts. Aspirin at doses below 300 mg selectively and irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane and inhibiting inflammation and platelet aggregation. Such an effect has led to the hypothesis that aspirin could be useful for preventing preeclampsia. The first possible link between the use of aspirin and the prevention of preeclampsia was suggested by a case report published in 1978, followed by the first randomized controlled trial published in 1985. Since then, numerous randomized trials have been published, reporting the safety of the use of aspirin in pregnancy and the inconsistent effects of aspirin on the rates of preeclampsia. These inconsistencies, however, can be largely explained by a high degree of heterogeneity regarding the selection of trial participants, baseline risk of the included women, dosage of aspirin, gestational age of prophylaxis initiation, and preeclampsia definition. An individual patient data meta-analysis has indicated a modest 10% reduction in preeclampsia rates with the use of aspirin, but later meta-analyses of aggregate data have revealed a dose-response effect of aspirin on preeclampsia rates, which is maximized when the medication is initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age. Recently, the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial has revealed that aspirin at a daily dosage of 150 mg, initiated before 16 weeks of gestational age, and given at night to a high-risk population, identified by a combined first trimester screening test, reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62%. A secondary analysis of the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial data also indicated a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit by 68% compared with placebo, mainly because of a reduction in births before 32 weeks of gestational age with preeclampsia. The beneficial effect of aspirin has been found to be similar in subgroups according to different maternal characteristics, except for the presence of chronic hypertension, where no beneficial effect is evident. In addition, the effect size of aspirin has been found to be more pronounced in women with good compliance to treatment. In general, randomized trials are underpowered to investigate the treatment effect of aspirin on the rates of other placental-associated adverse outcomes such as fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. This article summarizes the evidence around aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications.

### The role of aspirin dose on the prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111UPB1k]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction are major causes of perinatal death and handicap in survivors. Randomized clinical trials have reported that the risk of preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction can be reduced by the prophylactic use of aspirin in high-risk women, but the appropriate dose of the drug to achieve this objective is not certain.

Objective

We sought to estimate the impact of aspirin dosage on the prevention of preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction.

Study Design

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of daily aspirin or placebo (or no treatment) during pregnancy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to December 2015, and study bibliographies were reviewed. Authors were contacted to obtain additional data when needed. Relative risks for preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using random-effect models. Dose-response effect was evaluated using meta-regression and reported as adjusted R 2. Analyses were stratified according to gestational age at initiation of aspirin (≤ 16 and > 16 weeks) and repeated after exclusion of studies at high risk of biases.

Results

In all, 45 randomized controlled trials included a total of 20,909 pregnant women randomized to between 50–150 mg of aspirin daily. When aspirin was initiated at ≤ 16 weeks, there was a significant reduction and a dose-response effect for the prevention of preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.75; P < .001; R 2, 44%; p = 0.036), severe preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.83; p = 0.009; R 2, 100%; p = 0.008), and fetal growth restriction (relative risk, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.70; P < .001; R 2, 100%; p = 0.044) with higher dosages of aspirin being associated with greater reduction of the 3 outcomes. Similar results were observed after the exclusion of studies at high risk of biases. When aspirin was initiated at > 16 weeks, there was a smaller reduction of preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.99; p = 0.04) without relationship with aspirin dosage (R 2, 0%; p = 0.941). Aspirin initiated at > 16 weeks was not associated with a risk reduction or a dose-response effect for severe preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.14; p = 0.28; R 2, 0%; p = 0.838) and fetal growth restriction (relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.05; p = 0.34; R 2, not available; p = 0.563).

Conclusion

Prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction using aspirin in early pregnancy is associated with a dose-response effect. Low-dose aspirin initiated at > 16 weeks' gestation has a modest or no impact on the risk of preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Women at high risk for those outcomes should be identified in early pregnancy.

### Updates on the recognition, prevention and management of hypertension in pregnancy [^1157LQLz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews with meta-analysis represent the highest level of evidence used to guide clinical practice. The defining criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia have evolved, and will likely continue to evolve. Proteinuria is sufficient but not necessary when defining preeclampsia. Hypertension without proteinuria but with severe features is diagnostic. The methods used to measure urinary protein have changed. The gold standard remains the 24-hour urine test. The efficacy of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia is a function of baseline risk. Data suggest that treating mild to moderate blood pressure has clear maternal benefits with little fetal or neonatal risk.

### Does low-dose aspirin initiated before 11 weeks' gestation reduce the rate of preeclampsia? [^112bk8tm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective Data

Preconception or early administration of low-dose aspirin might improve endometrial growth, placental vascularization, and organogenesis. Most studies have evaluated the potential benefit of preconception or early administration of low-dose aspirin in women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, women who have undergone in vitro fertilization, or women with thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndrome. These women are at an increased risk of placenta-associated complications of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction.

Study Outcomes

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of low-dose aspirin initiated at < 11 weeks' gestation on the risk of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. Secondary outcomes included preterm delivery at < 37 weeks' gestation and fetal growth restriction.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

We searched in MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from 1985 to November 2018. Entry criteria were randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of aspirin administered at < 11 weeks' gestation in preventing preeclampsia and/or hypertensive disorders in pregnancy or improving pregnancy outcomes in women with recurrent miscarriage as compared with placebo or no treatment and outcome data available or provided by authors for > 85% of the study population. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each study and pooled for global analysis as the effect measure. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the χ 2 statistics, I 2, and Tau 2. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if an I 2 was greater than 50% and either the Tau 2 was greater than zero or there was a low P value (< 0.10) in the χ 2 test for heterogeneity. Random-effects meta-analysis, weighted by the size of the studies, was performed to produce an overall summary on aspirin effect for each outcome. Sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of each individual study and by fixed-effects model was performed. Publication bias was not assessed because of the small number of included studies. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata release 14.0 (StataCorp).

Results

The entry criteria were fulfilled by 8 randomized controlled trials on a combined total of 1426 participants. Low-dose aspirin initiated at < 11 weeks' gestation was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–1.17, P = .115), gestational hypertension (relative risk, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–1.21; p = 0.121), and any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.04, P = .067). Early administration of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk of preterm delivery (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.97, P = .040) but had no impact on the risk of fetal growth restriction (relative risk, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–2.07, P = .775). Except for preterm delivery and any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, sensitivity analysis demonstrated similar observations, therefore confirming the robustness of the analysis.

Conclusion

The administration of low-dose aspirin at < 11 weeks' gestation in women at high risk does not decrease the risk of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, and fetal growth restriction. However, it might reduce the risk of preterm delivery. Larger randomized controlled trials will be required to substantiate the findings.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111VHgHP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinical risk assessment for preeclampsia and aspirin — pregnant persons: For high-risk status, recommend low-dose aspirin if the patient has ≥ 1 high-risk factor such as history of preeclampsia with an adverse outcome, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, pregestational type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome), or combinations of multiple moderate-risk factors. For moderate risk, recommend low-dose aspirin if the patient has ≥ 2 moderate-risk factors, and consider low-dose aspirin if the patient has 1 of these moderate-risk factors including nulliparity, obesity with body mass index > 30, family history of preeclampsia, Black persons (due to social rather than biological factors), lower income, age 35 years or older, personal history factors (low birth weight or small for gestational age, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, > 10-year pregnancy interval), or in vitro conception. For low risk (prior uncomplicated term delivery and absence of risk factors), do not recommend low-dose aspirin.

### When to give aspirin to prevent preeclampsia: application of Bayesian decision theory [^116MBoFq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is good evidence that first-trimester assessment of the risk for preterm preeclampsia and treatment of the high-risk group with aspirin reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia. Furthermore, there is evidence that aspirin is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal hemorrhagic complications. Against this background, there are ongoing debates whether aspirin should be recommended for all women or to a subpopulation of women predicted to be at increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Moreover, if a strategy of the prediction and prevention of preterm preeclampsia is to be used, what method should be used for the prediction, and what risk cutoff should be used to decide on who to treat?

Objective

This study aimed to compare the policies of universal treatment, stratified treatment, and no treatment with aspirin.

Study Design

Decisions about aspirin prophylaxis were considered from the perspective of the Bayesian decision theory. Using this approach, the treatment policies were evaluated for risks of preterm preeclampsia, effects of aspirin, and trade-offs between the harms and benefits of the treatment. Evidence on the risk of preterm preeclampsia was taken from the Screening programme for pre-eclampsia study, which was a first-trimester screening study for the prediction of preeclampsia. Evidence of the effect of aspirin was taken from the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial, which was a trial of aspirin vs placebo in the prevention of preterm preeclampsia. The trade-off between the benefits and harms of aspirin was specified by addressing the question, "What is the maximum number of women that should be treated to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia?" The number can be considered as an exchange rate between the harms and benefits of using aspirin to prevent preterm PE. Given the uncertainty about the harms associated with aspirin, the treatment policies were compared across a wide range of exchange rates.

Results

For exchange rates between 10 and 1000 women treated with aspirin to prevent 1 case of preterm preeclampsia, the net benefit achieved from the risk assessment and targeted treatment of women at high risk of preterm preeclampsia was higher than that from women with no treatment or women with universal treatment with aspirin.

Conclusion

Universal treatment with aspirin should be avoided. Risk-based screening should be used, and the cutoff for taking aspirin should be determined from the consideration of the trade-off between the benefits and harms and detection, false-positive, and screen-positive rates.

### Aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction [^112Xw6Gm]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

For the past decades, growing attention has been given to aspirin use during pregnancy. It favors placentation by its proangiogenic, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, low doses of aspirin are prescribed in the prevention of placenta-mediated complications, mainly preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, questions regarding its clinical application are still debated. Aspirin is effective in preventing preeclampsia in a high-risk population. Most guidelines recommend that risk stratification should rely on medical history. Nevertheless, screening performances dramatically improve if biochemical and biophysical markers are included. Concerning the appropriate timing and dose, latest studies suggest aspirin should be started before 16weeks of pregnancy and at a daily dose of 100mg or more. Further studies are needed to improve the identification of patients likely to benefit from prophylactic aspirin. Besides, the role of aspirin in the prevention of fetal growth restriction is still questioned.

Objective Data

Metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials have reported contradictory results about the effect of aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia, both in terms of the gestational age at the onset of treatment and the dose of the drug. The controversy may be resolved by a metaanalysis that includes several recently published trials and particularly the large Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-based Preeclampsia Prevention trial and by examination of whether there is a difference of the effect of aspirin on preterm vs term preeclampsia.

Study

We performed a systematic review and metaanalysis that evaluated the prophylactic effect of aspirin during pregnancy.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

We completed a literature search through PubMed, Cinhal, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library from 1985 to June 2017. Relative risks with random effect were calculated with their 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Sixteen trials that included 18,907 participants provided data for preterm and term preeclampsia. Eight of the included studies were evaluated as being of good quality, and the other 8 studies were deemed to be of poor or uncertain quality. There was high heterogeneity within studies (I 2 > 50%) for preterm and term preeclampsia, but no heterogeneity was found in the subgroup of preterm preeclampsia when the onset of treatment was ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and the daily dose of aspirin was ≥ 100 mg (I 2 = 0%). Administration of aspirin was associated with reduction in the risk of preterm preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.87), but there was no significant effect on term preeclampsia (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.21). The reduction in preterm preeclampsia was confined to the subgroup in which aspirin was initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg (relative risk, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.57). This effect was also observed in the high-quality studies. The reduction in preterm preeclampsia that was observed in the largest trial (Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-based Preeclampsia Prevention; n = 1620; relative risk, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.20–0.72) was similar to that in the 5 smaller trials in which aspirin was initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg (n = 639; relative risk, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.66).

Conclusion

Aspirin reduces the risk of preterm preeclampsia, but not term preeclampsia, and only when it is initiated at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and at a daily dose of ≥ 100 mg.

5.5.2 Medical interventions

Most studies on early prevention of placental complications have focused on pre‐eclampsia, with the results often being extrapolated to FGR due to the common pathophysiology. However, to date, other than lifestyle modifications, no medical interventions to prevent FGR have been clearly established.

Aspirin is recommended for women at increased risk of pre‐eclampsia, but there is some evidence that it may also reduce the risk of FGR 130, 131 In a recent meta‐analysis of 45 trials that included 20 909 women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, the administration of aspirin starting at less than or equal to 16 weeks of pregnancy reduced the risk of FGR by nearly half (RR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44–0.70), with higher dosages of aspirin associated with a greater reduction, favoring a dose of 100–150 mg. 132 A second individual patient data meta‐analysis also supported earlier initiation of aspirin for the prevention of FGR, with an RR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61–0.94) for women randomized before 16 weeks versus an RR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84–1.08) for women randomized at 16 weeks or beyond. 131 One randomized trial found that evening but not morning administration of aspirin is associated with reduction in the rate of pre‐eclampsia and FGR. 133 However, it should be emphasized that most of the available data on aspirin come from studies that focused on the prevention of pre‐eclampsia as the primary outcome in women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, with the prevention of FGR considered only as a secondary outcome. Furthermore, in the largest trial to date on the use of aspirin for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia (ASPRE trial), aspirin was not associated with a reduction in the risk of SGA below the 10th, 5th, or 3rd percentile. 130 However, we believe that given the safety of aspirin and the overlap in the risk factors and pathogenesis of pre‐eclampsia and FGR, it is reasonable to recommend aspirin to women at high risk of FGR, using the same regimen of aspirin used for women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia. Most international guidelines recommend 100–150 mg aspirin to prevent FGR in women at high risk. 134

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and… [^115Kn55a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Evidence Assessment The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia. Nulliparous and multiparous participants were combined in most trials. Aspirin dosages ranged from 50 to 150 mg/d, with most trials using 60 mg/d or 100 mg/d. 1 Included trials of selected participants at increased risk for preeclampsia used a variety of approaches to identify the study population. 1 The incidence of preeclampsia in the placebo groups therefore also varied considerably, but the proportion developing preeclampsia were generally 2 to 3 times higher than the average incidence in the US. The USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preterm birth among individuals at increased risk for preeclampsia who received low-dose aspirin. USPSTF found evidence of a reduction in risk for preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin use in individuals at increased risk. Maternal complications of preeclampsia rarely occurred in studies and could not be evaluated. Trials did not demonstrate evidence of harms from daily low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy. Bleeding harms were uncommon. Quiz Ref IDPreeclampsia is a complex, multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can originate from multiple causes and is thought to evolve from changes in placental development that result in placental ischemia. Poor placental perfusion may produce inflammation and oxidative stress. Preeclampsia may also develop because of overactive inflammatory responses to normal placentation.

Preexisting inflammatory conditions are also thought to trigger systemic inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. The anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenesis, and antiplatelet properties of low-dose aspirin are believed to account for its preventive effect on preeclampsia. 1.

### Aspirin discontinuation at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation in pregnancies at high risk of preterm preeclampsia… [^115niypB]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this randomized trial, incidence of preterm preeclampsia was 1. 48% in the intervention group and
1. 73% in the control group, indicating noninferiority. Meaning Aspirin discontinuation at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation is noninferior to aspirin continuation for preventing preterm preeclampsia in individuals at high risk of preeclampsia and a normal sFlt-1: PlGF ratio. Importance Aspirin reduces the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62% in pregnant individuals at high risk of preeclampsia. However, aspirin might be associated with an increased risk of peripartum bleeding, which could be mitigated by discontinuing aspirin before term and by an accurate selection of individuals at higher risk of preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. Aspirin has been proven to reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia by 62%.

6 Although the exact etiology of preeclampsia is unknown, aspirin inactivates the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, suppressing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane. The percentage of pregnant participants with available data for the primary and secondary outcomes was 96. 7%. Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. In the present study, aspirin at a dose of 150 mg was used. Because this is one of the highest doses recommended for preventing preeclampsia, discontinuing aspirin in this trial may have led to a significant reduction in severe bleeding complications. However, an association between earlier discontinuation of aspirin treatment and a reduction in rarer bleeding complications, such as placental abruption, maternal intracranial hemorrhage, postpartum hemorrhage, and/or neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, was not observed.

The most unexpected result of this study was the greater incidence of pregnancy complications at 37 weeks of gestation or more in the control group. Aspirin is believed to delay the onset of preeclampsia, thereby converting what would be, without treatment, preterm preeclampsia into term preeclampsia. 33 For this reason, it would have been reasonable to expect that the incidence of term preeclampsia was greater in the intervention group and not the opposite.

### Utility of the USPSTF for preeclampsia risk assessment and aspirin… [^116hSQpT]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Data collected included AP recommendation, presence of USPSTF-defined moderate risk factors or high risk factors, and any preeclampsia diagnosis. Effect sizes and relative risk were calculated within risk strata. Results. A total of 2438 participants received an AP recommendation. The overall preeclampsia rate was 12. 1%. The PE rates specific to USPSTF categories were 3. 0% for those at low risk,
10. 5% for those at moderate risk, and 23. 5% for those at high risk. Among individuals with 2 or more moderate risk factors but without any high risk factor, nulliparity was associated with significantly increased risk of preeclampsia, while AMA was associated with decreased risk.

Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective cohort study of 5684 singleton pregnancies, 89% of the population was assessed as having increased risk of preeclampsia by USPSTF criteria. These findings suggest that moderate risk factors in the absence of high risk factors show no or low value for estimating the risk of developing preeclampsia, leading to nonspecific recommendations of AP in the moderate risk category. If a moderate risk factor co-occurred with at least 1 other moderate risk factor, nulliparity remained significantly associated with a modestly increased risk for preeclampsia, and AMA was associated with reduced risk. This cohort study represents a large, contemporary, nationally representative observational sample in the US.

Combining the USPSTF moderate and high risk categories, 89% of the study population had at least 1 risk factor for preeclampsia, and only a minority of the population were identified by USPSTF criteria as low risk.
