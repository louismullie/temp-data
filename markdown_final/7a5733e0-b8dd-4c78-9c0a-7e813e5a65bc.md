## Question

What are possible causes of acute bilateral hand pain upon awakening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about possible causes of acute bilateral hand pain upon awakening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features that anchor the differential. Then, I should prioritize the most likely etiologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome given the nocturnal pattern. Next, I will consider inflammatory and degenerative arthritides, cervical contributions and double crush, and central sensitization mechanisms. After that, I should outline a guideline-based diagnostic strategy including clinical tools, imaging, labs, and electrodiagnostics. Finally, I will translate this into management pathways aligned with the most probable etiologies while noting areas where I need to double-check and self-correct any misattributions or overextensions of evidence.

> Let me first confirm the anchor features: the onset is acute, both hands are involved, and symptoms are worst upon awakening, which strongly suggests conditions with nocturnal exacerbation and morning predominance or stiffness. Wait, let me verify which entities classically peak at night or on waking; CTS frequently presents with nocturnal symptoms and sleep disruption, RA is defined by morning stiffness, and hand OA can manifest morning stiffness as well, sometimes prolonged, although its course is usually chronic rather than abrupt [^111tezJT] [^112GB4nX] [^116rSdTo] [^115dDyfP].

> I will now examine carpal tunnel syndrome as the lead hypothesis, especially bilateral CTS, because nocturnal symptoms and waking due to pain or paresthesia are classic, and many patients do present bilaterally. Mechanistically, wrist position during sleep increases carpal tunnel pressure, provoking median nerve ischemia and traction, which explains symptoms on awakening; this dovetails with the CTS-6 including nocturnal symptoms and the AHUEPT/AOPT criteria emphasizing relief with hand shaking on waking, a very specific bedside clue. I should confirm bilaterality rates; more than half of CTS patients report bilateral symptoms, which fits this presentation well [^111Mh7r9] [^111tezJT] [^112GB4nX] [^112Eth6G].

> Next, I should review inflammatory arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, because bilateral symmetric small joint involvement with morning stiffness is a cardinal pattern. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; RA morning stiffness typically lasts beyond 30–60 minutes and is accompanied by joint swelling and systemic features, which I need to actively check for. Early RA and even pre-arthritis arthralgia phases show a strong link between morning stiffness and subclinical inflammation, highlighting the importance of prompt serologic evaluation and early referral when suspected [^114pobUv] [^116rSdTo] [^116zp8B5].

> I need to consider hand osteoarthritis as well, even though OA usually evolves chronically; acute flares can occur after overuse and may feel worse after periods of immobility. Hmm, wait a minute — initially I attributed the pain pattern "worse with activity, better with rest" to EULAR 2019, but that description is better sourced to a narrative review on hand OA symptomatology, whereas EULAR 2019 focuses on management principles. I should correct that: use the Joint Bone Spine review for symptom patterns and rely on EULAR for treatment guidance. Also, I should confirm that prolonged morning stiffness can occur in hand OA and does not preclude the diagnosis, which recent cohort data supports [^113oZD5j] [^111cSWs9] [^115dDyfP].

> Let me consider cervical contributions and the double crush concept, because concomitant cervical radiculopathy with distal median nerve compression can amplify bilateral morning symptoms via sleep-related neck and wrist positioning. I need to check for neck pain, provocation with Spurling's, and non-median distribution symptoms; if present, that would push me to investigate both proximal and distal nerve compression and set expectations that single-site treatment may be insufficient if a second lesion exists [^112g8yCT].

> I should also review central sensitization mechanisms that can explain bilateral pain even when a focal lesion is unilateral. Evidence in CTS demonstrates bilateral widespread mechanical hyperalgesia and lowered pressure pain thresholds in both hands and even cervical segments in unilateral disease, supporting a central amplification model. This would explain why a predominantly unilateral entrapment can be perceived as bilateral morning pain, especially during nocturnal nociceptive priming and sleep fragmentation [^115TXXCs] [^115yJtB3].

> But wait, what if we are missing less common yet important conditions that cluster with morning or cold-exacerbated symptoms. I need to check for de Quervain's tenosynovitis when thumb-side pain and tendon crepitus are present, for early systemic sclerosis if Raynaud phenomenon or edematous digits are evident, and for CRPS when findings are disproportionate with bilateral cortical-sensory changes. These are less likely as primary explanations here but should be kept in mind as part of a thorough review of systems and exam, particularly if the pattern deviates from median neuropathy or inflammatory synovitis [^114Nssga] [^113kDzZb] [^1128eUMB] [^116k4XJa].

> Let me first confirm the bedside diagnostic strategy. For suspected CTS, I should combine symptom mapping, provocative maneuvers, and standardized tools. The CTS-6 incorporates nocturnal symptoms, Tinel and Phalen signs, sensory loss, and thenar changes to estimate probability, while the Katz hand diagram helps localize paresthesias to the median distribution. I need to ensure I interpret these in the context of the full exam, because mimics like cervical radiculopathy can confound these tools if used in isolation [^111tezJT] [^1167eVNJ].

> Next, I should review imaging indications. Hold on, I should verify that the ACR Appropriateness Criteria cited apply to the clinical context; they address chronic hand and wrist pain but still inform next steps when plain films are unremarkable and tendon or nerve pathology is suspected. If symptoms persist or if de Quervain's or CTS structural contributors are suspected with normal radiographs, ultrasound or MRI can define tenosynovitis or median nerve enlargement, whereas in primary CTS without red flags, imaging is often unnecessary initially [^113WseYJ] [^1117iinD] [^116PvegJ].

> I should double-check the laboratory strategy when inflammatory arthritis is on the table. If there is prolonged morning stiffness, objective swelling, warmth, or systemic features, I should order ESR, CRP, RF, and anti-CCP to stratify RA likelihood and expedite rheumatology referral, recognizing that seronegativity does not rule out early disease and that classification criteria serve as guidance rather than strict diagnostic rules [^114pobUv].

> I will now examine the role of electrodiagnostics. When the diagnosis of CTS is uncertain, when symptoms are severe or atypical, or when surgery is being considered, nerve conduction studies add value to confirm median neuropathy and to document severity and bilaterality, and they can help differentiate CTS from cervical radiculopathy and polyneuropathy in equivocal cases [^111tezJT].

> Let me synthesize likelihoods based on the waking pattern. Nocturnal awakening with pain or paresthesia, relief by hand shaking, and median-distribution symptoms point strongly toward CTS, often bilateral. If the predominant feature is prolonged morning stiffness over an hour with swollen MCP/PIP joints and systemic malaise, RA rises quickly in probability. If stiffness is brief with bony enlargement at DIP or first CMC and flares after use, hand OA becomes plausible, albeit the acute onset is less typical unless a flare is triggered by overuse. Cervical findings and symptoms outside the median territory should raise suspicion for double crush or radiculopathy, and diffuse bilateral sensitivity out of proportion to focal findings may reflect central sensitization superimposed on a peripheral driver [^112GB4nX] [^116rSdTo] [^115dDyfP] [^112g8yCT] [^115TXXCs].

> For CTS management, I need to ensure first-line, guideline-concordant steps. Nighttime neutral-position wrist orthoses are recommended for short-term symptom relief, with adjustments to wear time or MCP immobilization for refractory nocturnal symptoms. Patient education on reducing wrist flexion-extension load, modifying mouse and keyboard ergonomics, and activity adjustments is essential. Short-term superficial heat and interferential therapy can be offered for symptom relief in mild-to-moderate CTS, and short-term manual therapy directed at the cervical spine and upper extremity can be considered, while evidence is insufficient for neurodynamic mobilization. Hold on, I initially considered topical NSAIDs as first-line for CTS, but I should correct that; topical NSAIDs are recommended first-line for hand OA pain, not as disease-specific therapy for CTS, where analgesics may be used symptomatically but orthosis and activity modification are primary nonoperative strategies [^11316PSU] [^113VkpyY] [^114xLkNj] [^114V2Mzg] [^1159wJyf] [^117EFEVn] [^115Ndhm5] [^116wZybL].

> For suspected early RA, I need to ensure rapid evaluation and treatment because of the early therapeutic window. While awaiting rheumatology assessment, NSAIDs may help symptoms, but disease-modifying therapy timing is critical; the presence of morning stiffness, symmetric small joint involvement, and positive serologies should prompt expedited referral and imaging as needed for classification and baseline assessment [^116zp8B5] [^116rSdTo].

> For hand OA, I should align with EULAR and ACR recommendations. Core management includes education with symptom control as the primary goal, exercise programs to improve function and pain, topical NSAIDs as first-line with a short oral NSAID course if needed, consideration of chondroitin sulfate, and duloxetine when pain persists despite NSAIDs. Hand orthoses are specifically recommended for first CMC OA, and intra-articular corticosteroid injections are generally not recommended for hand OA overall, although they may be considered for painful interphalangeal joints on a case-by-case basis. I need to ensure I tailor this to the specific joint pattern and patient comorbidities [^115ufnwR] [^111hhLKo] [^116wZybL] [^111cSWs9] [^116upohG] [^111rSkrG] [^113AwxLq] [^116nKmm1].

> Finally, I should verify the follow-up and contingency plans. If CTS predominates clinically and improves with orthosis and ergonomics, continued conservative care is reasonable; if symptoms persist or worsen, electrodiagnostic testing and surgical referral can be considered, especially when thenar weakness or severe conduction block emerges. If inflammatory features appear at any point, I must pivot to prompt RA workup. If signs suggest cervical involvement, I should reassess the neck and consider imaging and multidisciplinary management, recognizing the double crush implications. If pain appears disproportionate with widespread sensitivity, I should address central sensitization with education and graded activity while still treating the peripheral driver [^111tezJT] [^112g8yCT] [^115TXXCs].

### Outcomes of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome treatment - a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133pwrK]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the predominant compressive neuropathy among adults worldwide. However, evidence regarding treatment alternatives and their outcomes, especially with bilateral carpus involvement, is inconclusive. To analyze the clinical and surgical outcomes of bilateral CTS treatment using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Boston questionnaire, a systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. After evaluating 129 articles from different databases, nine papers with low bias risk were included in the study. These studies were assessed for methodological quality, both in scale and degree, ensuring bias identification and independence of data extraction. Eligible articles were those in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, with no publication time limit. The outcomes assessed were the standardized mean differences (SMDs) on the symptom severity scale (SSS), functional state scale (FSS), and VAS.

In the clinical treatment group, a positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMD: 0.53), FSS (SMD: 0.47), and VAS (SMD decrease: 2.52) at the one-month follow-up. In the surgical-treatment group, a positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMDs: 1.97 for endoscopic and 1.55 for open surgery), FSS (SMDs: 1.52 for endoscopic and 1.77 for open surgery), and VAS (SMDs: 2.19 for endoscopic and 2.59 for open surgery) at the one-month follow-up. Significant improvements in VAS, SSS, and FSS were observed at the three-month follow-up. Evidence in both clinical and surgical treatments demonstrates their effectiveness, as they potentially improve symptom severity, function, and pain measures at various follow-up intervals.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: A review of the recent literature [^111Mh7r9]. The Open Orthopaedics Journal (2012). High credibility.

The following provides key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is a condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.

- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes, fibrous hypertrophy of the synovial flexor sheath, or repetitive movements of the wrist.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United States are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and potentially even outside the distribution of the median nerve.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of the patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: Carpal tunnel syndrome [^112GB4nX]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly in diagnosis, the AHUEPT/AOPT 2019 guidelines recommend diagnosing CTS in patients with four or more of the following criteria:

- **Age greater than 45 years**: This is a common age range where symptoms may appear.
- **Shaking hands relieves symptoms**: A characteristic response indicating CTS.
- **Sensory loss in the thumb**: A sign of median nerve involvement.
- **Wrist ratio index (wrist depth divided by wrist width) greater than 0.67**: A physical measurement associated with CTS.
- **CTQ-SSS score greater than 1.9**: This score assists in quantifying symptom severity related to CTS.

### The value added by electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^111tezJT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2008). High credibility.

The CTS-6, or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 6, is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of CTS, a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm.

The CTS-6 score is calculated based on six items: pain distribution, nocturnal symptoms, weakness or atrophy of the thenar eminence, Tinel's sign, Phalen's sign, and loss of two-point discrimination in the median nerve distribution. Each item is scored as either 0 or 1, with a higher total score indicating a higher likelihood of CTS.

The clinical utility of the CTS-6 is to provide a standardized, objective measure to assist in the diagnosis of CTS, which can be particularly useful in early or borderline cases. It can also be used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the CTS-6 include patients with other conditions that can mimic CTS, such as cervical radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or other types of peripheral nerve entrapment. Additionally, it may not be as accurate in patients with severe CTS.

The CTS-6 calculator is a tool designed to gauge the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome based on inputs related to symptoms and diagnostic tests. Users respond to six questions, and each positive answer contributes to a total score that reflects the possibility of having the condition. Here's how it works:

Each potential symptom or test response is considered, and the resulting score provides a measure of the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints.

Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset.

The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Double crush syndrome [^112g8yCT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Double crush syndrome is a distinct compression at two or more locations along the course of a peripheral nerve that can coexist and synergistically increase symptom intensity. In addition, dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may result from persistent pathology at another site along a peripheral nerve. Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construction that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.

### Pressure pain sensitivity topographical maps reveal bilateral hyperalgesia of the hands in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome [^115yJtB3]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess topographical pressure pain sensitivity maps of the hand in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) compared with healthy subjects.

- **Methods**: A total of 20 women with CTS (ages 32–52 years) and 20 matched healthy women (ages 32–51 years) were recruited. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured bilaterally over 30 locations on the palm of each hand by an assessor blinded to the subjects' conditions.

- **Results**: Patients exhibited lower PPTs in both hands at all measurement points compared to controls (P < 0.001 for all). Specifically, PPTs were lower at points over the proximal phalanx of the fingers and thenar eminency than at points over the distal phalanx (P < 0.001). CTS patients also showed lower PPT levels in dermatomes C6, C7, and C8 compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001 for all), with no significant differences between the dermatomes (P = 0.4). PPT was negatively correlated with both hand pain intensity and duration of symptoms (P < 0.001 for all).

- **Conclusion**: Our findings revealed bilateral generalized pressure pain hyperalgesia in unilateral CTS, as lower PPT levels were found at all points. The pressure pain hyperalgesia was not uniformly distributed; PPTs were lower at points over the proximal phalanx and thenar eminency compared to the distal phalanx. The decrease in PPT levels was associated with pain intensity and duration, supporting the role of both peripheral and central sensitization.

### Prospective, randomized evaluation of endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release in bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: an interim analysis [^116zKoVg]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Most randomized trials have shown similar results with endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) and open carpal tunnel release (OCTR); however, there are studies suggesting less postoperative pain, faster improvement in grip and pinch strength, and earlier return to work with the endoscopic technique. The goal of this study was to prospectively examine subjective and functional outcomes, satisfaction, and complications after both ECTR and OCTR in the opposite hands of the same patient, serving as their own control.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, randomized study in which patients underwent surgery for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The first carpal tunnel release was performed on the most symptomatic hand, as determined by the patient. The operative approach was randomly assigned and, approximately one month later, the alternative technique was performed on the contralateral side. Demographic data were obtained, and functional outcomes were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively, including pain score, two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, thenar strength, and overall grip strength. The carpal tunnel syndrome-functional status score and carpal tunnel syndrome-symptom severity score were recorded before surgery and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Overall satisfaction with each technique was recorded at the conclusion of the study.

- **Results**: Currently, 25 subjects have completed final visit testing. There were no differences in pain score, two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, thenar strength, or overall grip strength.

### Morning stiffness precedes the development of rheumatoid arthritis and associates with systemic and subclinical joint inflammation in arthralgia patients [^116rSdTo]. Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: In arthralgia patients, morning stiffness is a cardinal symptom to recognize patients at risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. Until now, it was unknown if morning stiffness in arthralgia patients also associates with inflammation. This study showed that in the arthralgia phase preceding arthritis development, morning stiffness already reflects systemic and subclinical joint inflammation.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: an unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^1175MxTG]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is an unusual symptom in nodular fasciitis, with only four case reports of non-intraneural nodular fasciitis presenting features of peripheral neuropathy identified. One case involved radial nerve entrapment secondary to a solitary nodular fasciitis mass in the forearm. Another case presented as axillary nerve palsy, secondary to nodular fasciitis arising in the quadrilateral space. The third case was characterized by a mass in the palm, with peripheral neuropathy affecting the digital nerve of the middle finger. The fourth case involved ulnar nerve compression induced by nodular fasciitis in the cubital tunnel. To our knowledge, we report the first case of median nerve compression induced by non-intraneural nodular fasciitis in the hand.

Nodular fasciitis is classified into three subtypes — myxoid, cellular, and fibrous — based on histological composition. The myxoid type corresponds to a younger lesion, while the fibrous composition corresponds to older lesions. There is no specific signal intensity described on MRI for nodular fasciitis. Differences in signal intensity on T2-weighted images may be attributed to variability in histological composition. Due to a lack of specificity and overlapping features with tenosynovitis, myositis, or sarcomas on MRI, a preoperative diagnosis could not be made, necessitating histopathological analysis. However, the MRI appearance may correlate with the stage of the disease. In the present study, the hyperintense appearance of the lesion on T2-weighted images may correspond to the histopathological findings of the myxoid matrix with proliferating fibroblasts.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^116zp8B5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

The rapid identification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is vital, as irreversible joint damage can occur during the early stages of the disease. The first three months following symptom onset represent a critical therapeutic window during which time drug treatment is particularly effective at controlling synovitis and limiting long-term joint damage. Recognizing this, algorithms have been developed and validated to predict the development of RA in patients with newly presenting unclassified arthritis. In addition, the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA have been developed to facilitate the early identification of patients with inflammatory arthritis requiring disease-modifying therapy. Typical features of established RA, including joint pain and swelling (with a characteristic joint distribution) and morning stiffness, are key features of these predictive algorithms and classification criteria.

Attention has progressively focused on earlier phases of RA, making it increasingly clear that a prodromal phase may exist for many patients. This phase is associated with joint pain and sometimes the presence of autoantibodies, preceding the development of clinically overt synovitis. The nature of symptoms during this earliest phase can influence how quickly patients present to professionals and are started on disease-modifying treatment. However, the full range of symptoms that characterize this phase, and the phase of early unclassified arthritis, has not been well studied.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: A synthesis of the qualitative literature [^113vS1Tg]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

In some cases, symptoms were transient (palindromic) in nature, with some patients describing intermittent episodes of intense pain. Migratory pain was also described. "The next morning I had an awful pain in my shoulder. However, eventually it went away, and during the next twelve months, I had a traveling rheumatism all around the joints".

Pain was described in a number of locations, most frequently in the feet (including the balls of the feet and toes) and hands. Symptoms in the large joints, such as shoulder, knee, elbow, and hip pain, were described less frequently. It was noted that eight studies described the onset of RA symptoms or severe aggravation of early RA during the postnatal period.

### Consecutive versus simultaneous bilateral carpal tunnel release [^1123grap]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients experience symptoms of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and require surgical release of both hands. Despite the intuitive cost savings to both the patient and the institution of simultaneous carpal tunnel release, many surgeons choose to repair one hand at a time. They operate under the assumption that the morbidity and disability following surgery, such as pain and hand incapacity, would be too great if both hands were repaired simultaneously.

We reviewed the charts of 108 patients who underwent bilateral carpal tunnel release to ascertain information on both the relative costs and morbidities of the two approaches; the mean follow-up time was 2.6 years.

- **Cost analysis**: The average number of clinic visits for the simultaneous group was 2 versus 4.5 for the consecutive group (P < 0.0001). The mean total operating room time for the simultaneous group was 48.5 minutes versus 72.5 minutes for the consecutive group (P < 0.0001). The average time off work for the simultaneous group was 3.25 weeks versus 6 weeks for the consecutive group (P = 0.08).

- **Morbidity assessment**: To evaluate morbidity, 62 patients consented to telephone interviews regarding the outcome of their surgery, 51 of whom had undergone simultaneous release. Of the 51 patients who underwent simultaneous release, 48 (94%) were satisfied with the overall results of their surgery, and 38 (75%) stated that they would undergo simultaneous release again. All 11 patients in the consecutive group were satisfied with the results of their surgery and would do it again (P = 0.21 and 0.03, respectively).

On the basis of these findings, we conclude the following: first, the

### The cross-modal interaction between pain-related and saccade-related cerebral activation: a preliminary study by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging [^1147LPyi]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Pain-related cerebral activation in functional magnetic resonance imaging shows less consistent signals that decay earlier than in conventional task-related activation. This may result from pain's top-down inhibition mediated by cognitive or hemodynamic interaction that could affect activation by other modalities. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether pain affects cerebral activation by a saccade task through such cross-modal interaction.

Six right-handed volunteers underwent whole-brain echo-planar imaging on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner while they received thermal pain stimulus at 50 degrees Celsius on the right forearm (P; n = 6), performed a visually guided saccade task (V; n = 6), and went through a simultaneous pain-plus-saccade paradigm (PV; n = 5). Averaged functional activation maps were synthesized, and signal time courses were analyzed at activation clusters. P activated the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). V activated the posterior, supplementary, frontal eye fields, and visual areas. PV enhanced the S2 activation and activated additional pain-related areas, including the bilateral premotor area, right insula, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortices. In contrast, V-related activation was attenuated in PV. We propose that pain caused cross-modal suppression of the oculomotor activity and that an oculomotor task enhanced pain-related activation by triggering attention toward pain.

Pain-related cerebral activation is enhanced by attention toward pain. It may involve top-down processes influencing the interaction between various modalities.

People with complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) watched a reflected image of their unaffected limb being touched and felt pain or paresthesia at the corresponding site on the affected limb. The authors suggest that allodynia and paresthesia can be mediated by the brain and that dysynchiria has implications for the understanding and management of CRPS1.

### The linkage between first-hand pain sensitivity and empathy for others' pain: Attention matters [^111qdtAJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Empathy is the ability to share and understand others' emotional experiences and plays an important role in social interactions. According to the "shared representations" theory, empathy for others' pain relies on the same psychological and neural representations that underlie firsthand experience of physical pain. Consistent with this theory, many neuroimaging studies have shown that vicariously witnessing pain in others activates brain areas such as the bilateral anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex, which partially overlap with those associated with firsthand experience of pain.

Beyond the evidence for the overlapping brain activations, experimentally manipulating the firsthand experience of pain can affect empathic responses to others' pain, thus providing more causal evidence for the "shared representations" theory. For example, the common prescription painkiller acetaminophen can reduce empathy for others' pain, suggesting that pharmacologically inhibiting the neural circuits necessary for experiencing one's own pain also inhibits the perception or experience of others' pain. Further, electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have shown similar modulations of self- and other-related pain processing.

### Differential effects of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in a single patient with neuropathic pain [^114vNafq]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old previously healthy man with an 11-year history of recurrent, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome presented with a 22-month history of severe neuropathic pain (NP) in his right hand. The same condition was present on the left side, although to a lesser degree.

The patient had undergone multiple decompressive surgeries — two on the left side and three on the right — during the 11 years prior to the presentation. After each operation, he experienced symptom relief lasting from 6 to 9 months, followed by gradual recurrence. His last operation on his right wrist, 30 months prior to presentation, resulted in roughly 8 months of pain relief. Further surgical intervention was not recommended upon pain recurrence. Various treatments were tried without satisfactory pain relief. The pain was eventually deemed chronic and treatment refractory.

The patient described the pain as constantly present, with intensity usually ranging between 5 and 8 on a 0–10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). The pain was located primarily distal to the wrists, in the area of median nerve innervation. Although there were both pain and sensory symptoms beyond this, both in the hand and lower forearm, he did not describe it as radiating. The pain was associated with numbness, tingling, and prickling sensations.

The most striking and clinically debilitating aspect of the patient's pain was the degree to which it was aggravated by cold, in terms of both cold allodynia and the effect of ambient temperature. He scored 22/38 on the PainDETECT questionnaire.

### What is the relationship between morning symptoms and measures of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^113dVTCx]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Little is known about the relationship between morning symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and measures of disease activity currently used to assess RA. Information available from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CAPRA-2) study was used to investigate these relationships.

- **Methods**: CAPRA-2 included 350 patients with RA who were symptomatic despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, randomized 2:1 to additional treatment with a 5-mg daily dose of delayed-release prednisone or placebo. Pearson's correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between change from baseline in symptoms (duration of morning stiffness, severity of morning stiffness, and intensity of pain on waking) and measures of disease activity (the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria [ACR20], the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28], and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index). Correlations were defined as weak (0.7).

- **Results**: There was a strong correlation between the severity of morning stiffness and the intensity of morning pain (Pearson's correlation 0.91, P < 0.001). There was a weak correlation between the duration of morning stiffness and measures of disease activity (0.24–0.28), with moderate correlations between the severity of morning stiffness or intensity of pain on waking and DAS28 or ACR20 scores (0.44–0.48). The severity of morning stiffness showed less variability and a greater effect size than did the duration of morning stiffness.

- **Conclusion**: The investigation into the correlation between morning symptoms and disease activity measures provides insights into the assessment of RA.

### Contralateral sensory and pain perception changes in patients with unilateral neuropathy [^113rfjLy]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To test whether contralateral sensory abnormalities in the clinically unaffected area of patients with unilateral neuropathic pain are due to the neuropathy or pain mechanisms, we analyzed the contralateral clinically unaffected side of patients with unilateral painful or painless neuropathy. This included peripheral nerve injury (PNI), postherpetic neuropathy (PHN), and radiculopathy, by standardized quantitative sensory testing following a validated protocol. The primary outcome was the independent contribution of the following variables on the contralateral sensory function using generalized linear regression models: pain intensity, disease duration, etiology, body area, and sensory patterns in the most painful area.

Among 424 patients (PNI n = 256, PHN n = 78, radiculopathy n = 90), contralateral sensory abnormalities were frequent in both painful (n = 383) and painless (n = 41) unilateral neuropathy. These abnormalities demonstrated sensory loss for thermal and mechanical nonpainful stimuli and both sensory loss and gain for painful test stimuli. Analysis by etiology revealed contralateral pinprick hyperalgesia in PHN and PNI. Analysis by ipsilateral sensory phenotype demonstrated mirror-image pinprick hyperalgesia in both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia phenotypes. Pain intensity, etiology, and affected body region predicted changes in only single contralateral somatosensory parameters, while disease duration had no impact on the contralateral sensory function.

Mechanisms of sensory loss seem to spread to the contralateral side in both painful and painless neuropathies.

The 13-year-old sister of patient 1 experienced pain, limitation of movement, and bilateral deformities in her hands, feet, and shoulder joints. Since infancy, she had bilateral limitation of finger movement, and at age 6, bilateral pain and deformities began in her elbows, knees, ankles, and toes. Upon physical examination, there was bilateral limited range of motion and contractures in the knees, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Hip and shoulder movements were painful. There were flexion contractures in the 3rd and 4th PIP joints of the right hand and flexion contractures in the 4th PIP joints of the left hand. Other systemic examinations were normal. No other family member had similar complaints. Radiological evaluation of patient 2 was provided in Fig. 1.

### Immediate and durable clinical improvement in the non-operated hand after contralateral surgery for patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome [^111GMmhf]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Little is known about clinical improvement in the non-operated hand after unilateral surgery for patients who present with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In this prospective study of patients with bilateral CTS, we evaluated the clinical effects on the non-operated hand following unilateral contralateral carpal tunnel surgical release.

- **Material and methods**: During a consecutive period of 22 months, 69 patients with bilateral CTS underwent unilateral open carpal tunnel release. Bilateral subjective and objective evaluations were performed pre-operatively, at days 2, 15, and 180 after surgery. Subjective evaluations, analyzed with the Student t-test, included the Boston-Levine symptom severity score and a visual analogue scale encompassing pain, nocturnal symptoms, and numbness. A telephone survey was conducted 12 months after surgery.

- **Results**: The Boston-Levine severity score of the contralateral non-operated hand decreased from 2.70 pre-operatively to 1.70 at 2 days (p < 0.001). The visual analogue pain score decreased at 2 days for 61 patients (88%), whereas the nocturnal symptoms decreased or disappeared in 63 cases (91%) and paresthesia in 52 cases (75%) (ps < 0.001). These beneficial effects were stable over time with no statistically significant change at 180 days. Overall, 58 patients (84%) observed a total resolution or significant improvement in their symptoms at 6 months. At 12 months, 100% of patients responded to a telephone survey, with 51 of them (74%) reporting minimal or no symptoms in the non-operated hand. Linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between the observed clinical outcomes.

### Extension-elicited blanching of the dorsal phalanges in systemic sclerosis: A case series [^113kDzZb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem disease that normally first manifests in the skin. Careful hand and finger examinations often offer the most valuable clues in SSc diagnosis. Initially, SSc often presents with clinically nonspecific signs such as the Raynaud phenomenon or edematous digits and therefore, can be easily overlooked. To help differentiate early pathogenic phalangeal edema that often precedes finger skin thickening from normal variants, we report the clinical sign of extension-elicited blanching of the dorsal phalanges associated with SSc. We often observe this blanching phenomenon of the dorsal phalanges in our patients with early-stage disease. However, attention to this clinical sign has been underreported and provides an additional clue toward diagnosing SSc. Here, we report four cases of newly presented SSc in one man and three women presenting with extension-elicited blanching of the dorsal phalanges.

### Enigmatic and unusual cases of upper extremity pain: Mislabeling as malingerers [^1164BKRi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity presents many possible etiologies of pain. One must be alert to conditions that typically affect other areas of the body but present in the hand and upper extremity. Adding to the complexity of diagnosis, potential secondary gains must also be considered. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential diagnosis can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments. In this article, we present four cases of unusual causes of hand and upper extremity pain.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: An unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^111nHsX4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting proliferative disorder of fibroblasts of uncertain etiology, occurring frequently in the forearm. However, nodular fasciitis in the hand inducing carpal tunnel syndrome is exceptional. There have been four cases of non-intraneural nodular fasciitis causing peripheral neuropathy reported previously. We present the case of a 38-year-old man with features of unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Decompression of the median nerve was performed, followed by excision of the lesion in a piecemeal fashion. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with nodular fasciitis. There was complete resolution of symptoms with no signs of recurrence at the end of one year after surgery.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^113mzFRG]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

- **Study design and participants**: We conducted a pragmatic, two-arm parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled trial within the National Health Service (NHS) involving 25 primary and community musculoskeletal clinics in England. The trial had the approval of the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West — Liverpool (UK; reference 13/NW/0280) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (European Clinical Trials Database, number 2013–001435–8). The full protocol has been published previously.

We recruited participants from general practices and community musculoskeletal clinics, facilitated by either their general practitioner (GP) or the treating clinician. A verbal introduction to the trial, accompanied by an information leaflet, was provided to potential participants by the GP or research clinician. Eligible patients were individuals aged 18 years or older presenting with a new episode of primary idiopathic mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome that had persisted for over 6 weeks. The clinical diagnosis was made by a GP or trained clinician, such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, and was standardized based on symptoms, clinical history, and physical tests using criteria developed as part of a consensus survey from the UK Primary Care Rheumatology Society. Mild carpal tunnel syndrome was defined as intermittent paraesthesia in the distribution of the median nerve, while moderate was characterized by constant paraesthesia and reversible numbness or pain of idiopathic nature. Participants with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome were designated.

### Spatially defined modulation of skin temperature and hand ownership of both hands in patients with unilateral complex regional pain syndrome [^112yzZnX]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical conditions, including complex regional pain syndrome, are characterized by autonomic dysfunctions (e.g. altered thermoregulation, sometimes confined to a single limb) and disrupted cortical representation of the body and the surrounding space. The presence of a disruption in spatial perception, bodily ownership, and thermoregulation in patients with complex regional pain syndrome led us to hypothesize that impaired spatial perception might result in spatial-dependent modulation of thermoregulation and bodily ownership over the affected limb.

In five experiments involving a total of 23 patients with complex regional pain syndrome of one arm and 10 healthy control subjects, we measured skin temperature of the hand with infrared thermal imaging before and after experimental periods of either 9 or 10 minutes each, during which the hand was held on one or the other side of the body midline. Tactile processing was assessed by temporal order judgements of pairs of vibrotactile stimuli, delivered one to each hand. Pain and sense of ownership over the hand were assessed by self-report scales.

Across experiments, when kept on its usual side of the body midline, the affected hand was 0.5 ± 0.3°C cooler than the healthy hand (P < 0.02 for all, a common finding in cold-type complex regional pain syndrome), and tactile stimuli delivered to the healthy hand were prioritized over those delivered to the affected hand. Simply crossing both hands over the midline resulted in warming of the affected hand (i.e. the affected hand became 0.4 ± 0.3°C warmer than when it was in the usual position).

### The relationship between regional pain with or without neuropathic symptoms and chronic widespread pain [^1156MNbU]. Pain (2019). Low credibility.

The questionnaire included a detailed assessment of the presence of musculoskeletal pain. All participants were asked, "During the past month, have you experienced any pain which has lasted at least 1 day or longer?" Respondents answering positively were asked to shade the location(s) of their pain on a four-view body manikin. Participants were then asked whether they had been aware of their pain for 3 months or longer (yes/no).

Using their responses to these questions, participants were classified as having chronic widespread pain (CWP) using the definition in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia that was operationalized by Croft et al, requiring axial (cervical spine, thoracic spine, anterior chest, or low back) pain and pain in contralateral body quadrants, above and below the waist, and on the right and left-hand sides of the body, which has been present for at least 3 months. Remaining participants were classified as having some pain (those participants reporting pain that did not satisfy the criteria for CWP) or no pain.

The data collection tool (a blank body manikin) has been shown to collect valid and reliable pain data with high between-rater reliability scoring. The original criteria for CWP defined by Croft et al. were based on the definition included in the 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia that required pain in the axial skeleton and in contralateral body quadrants. The criteria have been used in multiple population-based epidemiological studies and have face validity.

### Laser evoked responses to painful stimulation persist during sleep and predict subsequent arousals [^112JFBrm]. Pain (2008). Low credibility.

We studied behavioural responses and 32-channel brain potentials to nociceptive stimuli during all-night sleep in 12 healthy subjects, using sequences of thermal laser pulses delivered over the dorsum of the hand. Laser stimuli less than 20 dB over perception threshold had clear awakening properties, in accordance with the intrinsic threatening value of nociceptive signals. Even in cases where nociceptive stimulation did not interrupt sleep, it triggered motor responses in 11% of trials. Only four subjects reported dreams, and on morning questionnaires there was no evidence of incorporation of nociceptive stimuli into dreams.

Contrary to previous reports suggesting the absence of cortical nociceptive responses during sleep, we were able to record brain-evoked potentials to laser (LEPs) during all sleep stages. Sleep LEPs were generally attenuated, but their morphology was sleep-stage-dependent. In stage 2, the weakened initial response was often followed by a high-amplitude negative wave with typical features of a K-complex. During paradoxical sleep (PS), LEP morphology was similar to that of waking, but frontal components showed strong attenuation, consistent with the reported frontal metabolic deactivation. A late positive component (450–650 ms) was recorded in both stage 2 and PS, with significantly enhanced amplitude in trials followed by an arousal. This response appeared functionally related to the P3 wave, which in waking subjects has been associated with conscious perception and memory encoding.

### Long-term functional outcomes after bilateral total wrist arthrodesis [^1137kQCj]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To report on the long-term outcomes of bilateral total wrist arthrodeses, we conducted a review of all living patients who underwent the procedure from 1980 to 2010 within a single institution. Outcome measures included pain, scores from the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation, Michigan Hand Questionnaire, satisfaction scores, complications, and revision surgeries.

Thirteen patients (26 wrists) were treated with an average follow-up of 14 years (range, 3–28 years). The average time for contralateral wrist arthrodesis was 16 months after the initial procedure. Eleven wrists had undergone prior surgery, and eleven patients had a primary diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis. Wrists were fused from 5° flexion to 30° extension, with all but one patient's wrist fused within 10° of the contralateral wrist. There was a significant improvement in postoperative grip strength and pain levels. Postoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation, and Michigan Hand Questionnaire scores were 21, 29, and 73, respectively.

- **Factors associated with outcomes**: Increasing age, preoperative steroid usage, and concomitant shoulder or elbow disorders were linked to worse outcomes.
- **Patient satisfaction and functionality**: Twelve patients (93%) were satisfied and would repeat the surgery, with nine returning to full-time work. The major functional limitation was turning a doorknob or tight jar lid.
- **Additional surgeries**: Seven patients underwent additional surgery, including five revision arthrodeses and two plate removals. Revision surgeries were more common in patients with prior surgeries.

### Prolonged morning stiffness is common in hand OA and does not preclude a diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis [^115dDyfP]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Low credibility.

Prolonged morning stiffness (> 60 minutes) is traditionally associated with inflammatory arthritis but has poor discriminative ability. There is limited knowledge about morning stiffness in patients with hand osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to investigate morning stiffness in patients with hand OA.

Patients with primary hand OA, according to their treating rheumatologist in the Hand OSTeoArthritis in Secondary care (HOSTAS) cohort, were studied. The severity of morning stiffness was assessed using the Australian/Canadian hand OA index (AUSCAN), and both the presence and duration of morning stiffness were evaluated with a standardized questionnaire. The association of patient and disease characteristics with prolonged morning stiffness (> 60 minutes) was analyzed using logistic regression.

In total, 519 out of 538 patients had data available regarding the duration of morning stiffness; 89 (17%) of these patients experienced prolonged morning stiffness. The severity of stiffness was categorized as mild in 158 of 525 (30%), intermediate in 194 (37%), severe in 97 (18%), and extreme in 19 (4%) patients. Patients with prolonged morning stiffness reported experiencing more pain, worse physical function, and reduced mental and physical quality of life. They also had a more severe radiographic disease, although this association did not reach statistical significance.

Prolonged and severe morning stiffness are frequently found in patients with hand OA. Those reporting these symptoms experience more pain and a lower quality of life compared to those who do not report such symptoms.

### Motor control impairment of the contralateral wrist in patients with unilateral chronic wrist pain [^113JMM11]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The assessment of the quality of fine motor control in patients with unilateral chronic wrist pain seldom focuses on the possibility that control of movements is effector-independent at the cerebral level. This mechanism may be involved in an impairment of motor function in the unaffected wrist. We studied the possible motor impairment in the unaffected wrist in patients with chronic wrist pain.

- **Design**: Eighteen patients with chronic wrist pain in their dominant hand and 20 healthy controls performed, using their nondominant hand, back-and-forth, left-to-right stroke patterns with a pen on a digital writing tablet connected to a computer. Fluency of movement, defined as the number of zero-crossings of the acceleration curve (pZC), average stroke size, and average velocity were calculated.

- **Results**: The controls moved significantly more fluently than the patients (pZC, 0.26 ± 0.07 for controls and 0.46 ± 0.20 for patients; P < 0.001), suggesting that long-term afferent disturbances may compromise cerebral motor control mechanisms.

- **Conclusions**: This result is in accordance with the view that chronic pain complaints may be maintained by persistently abnormal cerebral motor control. This finding opens a new perspective on the understanding and treatment of chronic wrist pain.

### Development of hand phenotypes and changes in hand pain and problems over time in older people [^116HNnfN]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

There have been limited studies on predictors of the long-term course of hand pain and problems. A previous study involving adults over 18 years old, who consulted with hand and wrist problems, found that factors such as female gender, long symptom duration at presentation, and certain psychosocial factors predicted a poorer outcome at 12 months, similar to the findings in this study. More broadly, a systematic review identified that female gender, age, occupation, pain levels, and personal opinions about hand pain have been shown to be cross-sectionally associated with the severity of hand function limitation and hand pain. These findings are similar to the factors we identified in this study. While previous state membership was, in most cases, the strongest predictor of state, in addition to the factors listed above, we also found sleep problems, presence of nodes, and bilateral hand pain to be strong predictors of having a more severe hand problem at long-term (6-year) follow-up.

- **Implications**: This exploratory work has defined phenotypes of hand problems, based on self-reported answers to brief pain and functional items. In addition, it provides evidence that there is movement between some phenotypes. Individuals presenting with pain and no functional issues were less likely to get worse over time (and some will improve). However, there was less likelihood of improvement into less severe phenotypes once a member of the "severely affected" phenotype. While this study was exploratory, we have found some evidence that clinicians, particularly those based in primary care, should consider these findings in their practice.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: an unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^113p4ZXH]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) cases are usually idiopathic and bilateral. A literature review showed that the majority of unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome cases were caused by space-occupying lesions (SOLs). In a study by Nakamichi et al, out of 20 patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, SOLs were found in 7 patients, while none of the 89 patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome had SOLs. In a study by Chen et al. of 23 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome associated with space-occupying lesions, only 3 patients were found to have bilateral involvement. The present case report showed unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome induced by nodular fasciitis.

Nodular fasciitis is a rare, benign, self-limiting fibrous tumor that usually presents as a painless, rapidly growing subcutaneous mass. It is most commonly diagnosed in young, middle-aged adults in their third to fourth decade. It affects both men and women equally. The forearm (27%–29%) is the most common site, followed by the back or chest wall (15%–18%), the upper arm (12%), and rarely the hand (0%–2%). It has been reported in almost all other tissues, with the notable exception of the visceral organs. The most common presentation is a painless growing or stable mass. The presence of tingling, numbness, or weakness suggests either intraneural origin or nerve compression by non-intraneural nodular fasciitis. Eight cases of intraneural nodular fasciitis have been reported, involving two ulnar nerves, two sciatic nerves, one obturator nerve, two median nerves, and one radial nerve.

### Associations between pain sensitization and measures of physical function in people with hand osteoarthritis: Results from the Nor-Hand study [^117DbySN]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Low credibility.

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) causes substantial disability and suffering, and pain relief is usually limited with currently available treatment. Pain is the primary symptom of OA, often accompanied by impaired physical function. OA in the lower extremities is a leading cause of functional limitations among elderly people, mainly because of pain. However, the specific mechanisms for how pain may affect physical function are not known. Worsening of knee pain predicts deterioration of physical functioning in people with knee OA, and low physical functioning is 50% more common in people with bilateral knee pain compared with people with unilateral pain. Elderly people with symptomatic hand OA have weaker grip strength and more difficulty in carrying a bundle, handling small objects, and writing compared with elderly people without symptomatic hand OA. Hand pain is also associated with self-reported functional limitations and reduced grip strength in people with hand OA.

In recent years, research has focused on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms involved in OA-related pain, including the role of pain sensitization. Neuroplastic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system, such as pain sensitization, may manifest as local and widespread hyperalgesia, allodynia, enlargement of receptive fields, and chronicity of pain. Greater pain sensitization is associated with higher pain severity in people with knee and hand OA, and people with OA often have greater pain sensitization than healthy controls. Some previous knee OA studies have also suggested that pain sensitization contributes to the disability.

### Simultaneous bilateral or unilateral carpal tunnel release? A prospective cohort study of early outcomes and limitations [^112Eth6G]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Over 60% of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome present with symptoms and findings of nerve compression in both hands. Our goal was to compare patient-rated difficulties in performing activities of daily living in the early postoperative period between those undergoing bilateral carpal tunnel release and those undergoing unilateral carpal tunnel release.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing bilateral carpal tunnel release (n = 47) or unilateral carpal tunnel release (n = 41). Patient function and disease severity were measured by an abbreviated form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire at baseline, at postoperative visit 1 at a mean time (and standard deviation) of 10 ± 3 days, and at postoperative visit 2 at a mean time (and standard deviation) of 30 ± 6 days. Patients rated their difficulty in completing fifteen activities of daily living each day for the first postoperative week and reported the factors that influenced their choice of surgery.

- **Results**: There was no difference in baseline function or disease severity between the two groups with regard to QuickDASH and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. Patients in both groups improved after carpal tunnel release, with no difference between groups either at postoperative visit 1 for QuickDASH (p = 0.97) and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (p = 0.86) or at postoperative visit 2 for QuickDASH (p = 0.43) and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: An unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^117Jce5s]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting proliferative disorder of fibroblasts of uncertain aetiology, which occurs frequently in the forearm. Nodular fasciitis in the hand inducing carpal tunnel syndrome is exceptional. Four cases of non-intraneural nodular fasciitis causing peripheral neuropathy have been reported previously. We present the case of a 38-year-old man with features of unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Decompression of the median nerve was performed subsequently, along with excision of the lesion in a piecemeal fashion. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with nodular fasciitis. There was complete resolution of symptoms and no sign of recurrence at the end of one year after surgery.

### Familial limb pain and migraine: 8-year follow-up of four generations [^11512pRi]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Limb pain was described by patients as throbbing, stabbing, or as a dull, heavy pain or ache in the limb. No patient experienced allodynia. While limb pain remained lateralized during a single episode, in five of seven patients, it varied in laterality between episodes. Severity ranged from Visual Analogue Scale 2–8/10. There was no relationship between the severity or laterality of limb pain and the headache. All patients experienced episodes of limb pain closely related to headaches, occurring before (3/8), during (2/8), before or during (2/8), or after or during (1/8) headache.

Limb pain episodes always occurred with headaches in three patients (IV2, III2, and II1). In another three patients (IV1, IV3, and III1), half of the limb pain episodes were accompanied by headaches. In one patient (IV4), 20% of limb pain episodes occurred with headache. The proportion of headache attacks accompanied by limb pain varied throughout the period of observation. Overall, it was estimated that four patients (IV3, IV4, III1, and II1) frequently had headaches without limb pain, two patients (IV1 and IV2) mostly had headaches with limb pain, and one patient (III2) always had limb pain with headaches.

Limb pain occurred concurrently with aura in four patients, before the headache in three patients (IV2, IV3, and IV4), and during the headache in one patient (III2). In one patient (IV1), limb pain followed the aura and preceded the headache. There was no aura with limb pain in two patients (III1 and II1). Limb pain was ipsilateral to lateralized aura in patients IV1 and III2. In all attacks, limb pain was accompanied by aura.

### Cortical integration of bilateral nociceptive signals: When more is less [^116y6jgK]. Pain (2019). Low credibility.

Integration of nociceptive information is essential to produce adapted responses, promoting body integrity and survival. However, how the brain integrates nociceptive inputs from different body areas remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the cortical integration of bilateral nociceptive inputs evoked by laser heat stimuli. Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 females, 8 males; age: 25.5 ± 4.3) were recruited to participate in one session during which painful laser stimuli were applied to their hands with two Nd:YAP laser systems.

Electroencephalographic activity was recorded to measure laser-evoked potentials and event-related spectral perturbations. Twenty nociceptive stimuli were applied in each of the four counterbalanced conditions:

- **Right hand**
- **Left hand**
- **Both hands with attention to the right**
- **Both hands with attention to the left**:

Compared with unilateral conditions, the N2 and P2 peak amplitude, as well as gamma oscillation power, were decreased in bilateral conditions (P < 0.1). In contrast, pain was not significantly different in any condition (P > 0.05). These findings indicate that although more nociceptive inputs reach the brain with multiple nociceptive stimuli, their sensory representation is decreased while pain perception remains unchanged. These interactions between cerebral processing of nociceptive information from different body regions could support coordinated behavioral responses when pain originates from multiple sources.

### Bilateral somatosensory cortex disinhibition in complex regional pain syndrome type I [^116k4XJa]. Neurology (2011). High credibility.

In a previous study, we found bilateral disinhibition in the motor cortex of patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), suggesting a complex dysfunction of central motor-sensory circuits. The aim of our present study was to assess possible bilateral excitability changes in the somatosensory system of patients with CRPS.

- **Methods**: We measured paired-pulse suppression of somatosensory evoked potentials in 21 patients with unilateral CRPS I involving the hand. Eleven patients with upper limb pain of non-neuropathic origin and 21 healthy subjects served as controls. Innocuous paired-pulse stimulation of the median nerve was either performed at the affected and the unaffected hand or at the dominant hand of healthy controls, respectively.

- **Results**: We found a significant reduction of paired-pulse suppression in both sides of patients with CRPS, compared with control patients and healthy subjects.

- **Conclusion**: These findings resemble our findings in the motor system and strongly support the hypothesis of a bilateral complex impairment of central motor-sensory circuits in CRPS I.

### Bilateral widespread mechanical pain sensitivity in carpal tunnel syndrome: Evidence of central processing in unilateral neuropathy [^115TXXCs]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether bilateral widespread pressure hypersensitivity exists in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. A total of 20 females with carpal tunnel syndrome (aged 22–60 years) and 20 healthy matched females (aged 21–60 years) were recruited. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed bilaterally over median, ulnar, and radial nerve trunks, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, the carpal tunnel, and the tibialis anterior muscle in a blinded design.

The results showed that pressure pain threshold levels were significantly decreased bilaterally over the median, ulnar, and radial nerve trunks, the carpal tunnel, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, and the tibialis anterior muscle in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as compared to healthy controls (all, P < 0.001). Pressure pain threshold was negatively correlated to both hand pain intensity and duration of symptoms (all, P < 0.001).

Our findings revealed bilateral widespread pressure hypersensitivity in subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome, which suggests that widespread central sensitization is involved in patients with unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The generalized decrease in pressure pain thresholds associated with pain intensity and duration of symptoms supports a role of the peripheral drive to initiate and maintain central sensitization. Nevertheless, both central and peripheral sensitization mechanisms are probably involved at the same time in carpal tunnel syndrome.

### A novel mutation in the proteoglycan 4 gene causing CACP syndrome: Two sisters report [^115NLQaT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

A 15-year-old Azerbaijani female presented to our pediatric rheumatology department with bilateral swelling, pain, and limited movement of the elbows, wrists, fingers, knees, and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, as well as bilateral hip joint pain. Limitation of bilateral finger movements started when she was 7 months old; at that time, her family didn't notice any significant swelling. Swelling and pain in the elbows, knees, ankles, and toes began when she was 5 years old. She is the first child of healthy first-degree consanguineous parents and has a 13-year-old sister with similar joint complaints. The patient has a multi-year history of hospitalizations due to joint complaints. During this period, the patient was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Upon physical examination, there was swelling, movement limitation, and contractures of both knees, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, and ankles. There was flexion limitation of the 3rd and 4th right proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and flexion contracture of the 3rd and 4th PIP joints of the right hand and 4th PIP joint of the left hand. The patient also exhibited bilateral overlapping toe deformity and bilateral axillary region squamous rashes. Other systemic examinations were normal. Radiological evaluation of patient 1 is depicted in Figure 1.

- **Radiological evaluation of Patient 1**: Figure 1A depicts narrowing of the wrist joint spaces with periarticular loss of bone density. Contractures were observed in the distal interphalangeal joints. Subchondral cysts were observed in the distal epiphysis of both radius and ulna.

### Unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome: An unusual presentation of nodular fasciitis [^117U3ByF]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A healthy 38-year-old man presented with occasional pain in his right wrist and tingling sensations in his right thumb, index, and middle finger for a duration of 6 weeks. The symptoms had an insidious onset and progressed gradually over this period, prompting the patient to seek medical attention. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, multiple joint pain, or morning stiffness. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable.

Physical examination revealed mild, diffuse fullness over the volar aspect of the wrist. Mild tenderness was observed upon deep palpation, but there was no local rise in temperature. Resisted active finger flexion elicited pain over the wrist. Tinel's sign was positive for the median nerve, and Phalen's test was also positive. The range of motion at the wrist was comparable to that of the left wrist. Neurological examination showed no hypoesthesia or motor weakness.

### Clinical course of the non-operated hand in patients with bilateral idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome [^117TJTer]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who have undergone unilateral carpal tunnel surgery often inquire about the prognosis for the non-operated hand. This study examines the effects of unilateral carpal tunnel surgery on the clinical course of the non-operated hand in cases of bilateral idiopathic CTS.

In this prospective study, only patients with bilateral idiopathic CTS who had unilateral carpal tunnel surgery were included. A total of sixty-six patients, all women with a mean age of 47 years and a mean duration of symptoms of 4 years, were included. Forty-six surgeries were performed on right hands, and twenty surgeries were performed on left hands. Forty-eight (73%) patients were housewives. Their non-operated hands were evaluated both before and six months after the unilateral surgery. Evaluations included subjective symptoms and objective findings. Statistical analysis was conducted using paired t-tests and chi-square tests.

The results indicated no statistically significant differences in the means of the symptom severity score, functional status score, or power and pinch grip strength before and six months after surgery in the non-operated hands. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were found regarding the percentages of Tinel's sign, Phalen test, and electrophysiological changes before and after the surgery in the non-operated hands. Throughout the study, 57 (86%) of the patients underwent or intended to undergo surgery for their opposite hands.

### Bilateral pressure pain hypersensitivity over the hand as potential sign of sensitization mechanisms in individuals with thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis [^117RXQwd]. Pain Medicine (2013). High credibility.

To investigate whether bilateral deep tissue pressure hyperalgesia exists in individuals with unilateral thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA), a total of 32 patients with CMC OA (29 females and 3 males, aged 69–90 years) and 32 healthy matched controls (29 females and 3 males, aged 70–90 years) were recruited. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were bilaterally assessed over the first CMC joint, the hamate bone, and the lateral epicondyle in a blinded design. Mixed models analyses of variance were conducted to determine the differences in pressure pain sensitivity between groups and sides.

The results showed that PPTs were significantly decreased over the first CMC joint (F = 6.551, P = 0.012) and the hamate bone (F = 9.783, P = 0.002), but not over the lateral epicondyle (F = 2.712, P = 0.102), in patients with thumb CMC OA compared with healthy controls. Patients with unilateral thumb CMC OA exhibited bilateral pressure pain hyperalgesia in both hands compared with healthy individuals. PPTs were not significantly associated with the intensity of pain (all, P > 0.05).

This study revealed bilateral localized pressure pain hypersensitivity over the hand in individuals with unilateral thumb CMC OA, suggesting spinal cord sensitization mechanisms in this population. Future studies should analyze the presence of widespread pressure pain sensitivity in patients with thumb CMC OA to further determine the presence of central sensitization mechanisms.

### Painful hand and moving finger treated by wearing a glove [^113b72nj]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report a patient with unilateral painful hand and moving finger in whom tactile stimulation interrupted both the movement and the pain. This effect suggests a gating mechanism at a segmental level. The difference between afferent and efferent pathway levels and the delay of several months between trauma and occurrence of symptoms support a central mechanism, most probably involving sensorimotor reorganization at a segmental level.

### Hand dominance shift during sleep in sexsomnia: A clue to pathophysiology [^1172khuS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine whether awake handedness in sexsomnia is retained during sleep to uncover potential clues about the underlying neurophysiologic mechanisms.

- **Methods**: Participants' and observers' self-reported handedness during sexsomnia events.

- **Results**:
	- **Case 1**: A 22-year-old right-handed (RH) female with an 8-year history of nocturnal sleep-related masturbatory behavior (SMB) involving the left hand (LH) exclusively.
	- **Case 2**: A 30-year-old ambidextrous male with SMB involving both hands, but most prominently the LH.
	- **Case 3**: A 33-year-old RH female with exclusively LH SMB in the setting of acute multiple sclerosis exacerbation with cervical spinal cord and brainstem involvement.
	- **Case 4**: A 44-year-old RH male with bilateral dream enactment behavior and LH-predominant SMB noted by the bed partner.
	- **Case 5**: A 59-year-old RH female with a history of multiple system atrophy and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder developed a new SMB, noted by the bed partner involving exclusively the LH.
	- **Case 6**: A 37-year-old RH male with inappropriate sexual behaviors involving the nondominant LH without retention of memory for the events.
	- **Case 7**: A 17-year-old RH male with polysomnographic evidence of genital manipulation using both hands but predominantly involving the nondominant hand.

- **Conclusions**: We speculate that sexsomnias originate from central pattern generators in the brainstem and spinal cord, as opposed to the cerebral cortex. The lack of involvement of cerebral motor control is further substantiated by amnesia for sexsomnia events.

### Raynaud's phenomenon [^1128eUMB]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm of the fingers and toes, typically precipitated by exposure to cold. While mild Raynaud's is common and not usually indicative of clinically significant disability, its onset can be startling and uncomfortable for patients. The well-recognized association with systemic rheumatic conditions often leads to aggressive assessments for underlying diseases.

Advances in vascular physiology have illuminated the role of the endothelium and endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's. This review covers clinical aspects of the disorder, new insights regarding pathophysiology, and potential new therapeutics based on disease mechanisms, including prostacyclin analogues, serotonin antagonists, and calcitonin gene-related peptides.
