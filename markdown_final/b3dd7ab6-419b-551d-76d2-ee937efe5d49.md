## Question

functional neurologic disorder treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about functional neurological disorder (FND) treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic foundation and how it shapes treatment. Then, I should verify the overarching treatment principles and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine core interventions by modality, including psychotherapy, physiotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and neuromodulation. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings, and finally, I should appraise the evidence quality, identify gaps, and translate this into practical, stepped care recommendations with outcome measurement guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation because treatment hinges on it. FND is now a rule-in diagnosis based on positive clinical signs and patterns of inconsistency, not a diagnosis of exclusion, which legitimizes symptoms and enables early, appropriate treatment rather than endless testing that can cause harm and delay recovery [^e52b7c0b] [^46623288] [^eb4523a1]. Hold on, I should verify the prognostic implication: untreated FND carries substantial disability and chronicity, reinforcing the need for timely intervention once the diagnosis is established [^2b863b6c].

> Next, I should review the overarching treatment principles. A biopsychosocial formulation is essential, and multidisciplinary care is consistently recommended, with neurologists often coordinating care and delivering the diagnostic explanation that itself can be therapeutic [^e52b7c0b] [^ea741b4f]. Wait, let me verify the role of communication: clear, neuroscience-informed explanations that validate symptoms, address illness beliefs, and set expectations improve engagement and outcomes, and should be delivered early and consistently across the team [^9e53f776] [^409d92be].

> I will now examine psychotherapy, starting with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT shows consistent benefit for functional seizures and mixed presentations, with medium effect sizes across symptom, function, and quality-of-life domains; benefits are stronger when embedded in multidisciplinary care and when addressing avoidance, illness beliefs, and symptom-focused attention [^23c1680d] [^bd7ea911]. Hold on, I should verify durability: while many trials are short-term, sustained gains are reported in several studies, though more long-term RCTs are needed [^bd7ea911].

> Let me consider psychodynamic psychotherapy as well. Evidence suggests benefits comparable to CBT in some studies, but the evidence base is smaller and less controlled, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing; nonetheless, it remains a reasonable option, particularly when trauma-related dynamics or alexithymia are prominent [^bd7ea911] [^23c1680d]. But wait, what if the patient prefers a brief, formulation-based approach? Shared Individual Formulation Therapy (SIFT) shows preliminary sustained improvements in quality of life and acceptability, supporting individualized, trans-theoretical models in select patients [^303d69d8].

> Next, I should review physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. Specialist physiotherapy that uses distraction, motor retraining, and normalization of movement can improve function and reduce symptom severity; a recent phase 3 RCT did not show a significant advantage over treatment-as-usual on the primary SF-36 physical functioning endpoint at 12 months, yet secondary outcomes and patient-reported motor improvement favored specialist physiotherapy, and both arms were safe and valued by patients [^3320c2e2]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the RCT proved superiority on the primary outcome; I should correct that and emphasize the nuanced findings and the need for refined protocols and triage [^3320c2e2].

> I need to check the evidence for multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Combining physiotherapy with psychotherapy yields clinically meaningful improvements in physical quality of life and symptom burden in functional movement disorders, with gains driven by mobility and pain domains; this supports coordinated, concurrent rehabilitation rather than sequential silos [^d7527b8a]. Let me verify real-world data: an 8-week outpatient multidisciplinary program showed improvements in function and quality of life, though controlled comparisons are needed to isolate active components and sustain gains [^d38ba08a].

> Now, neuromodulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) shows preliminary promise for functional motor symptoms, with small studies and case series suggesting improvements in strength or function, but heterogeneity in protocols and small samples preclude definitive recommendations; larger, sham-controlled trials are needed before routine use [^0170154e] [^aa9b26fe]. Hold on, I should verify adjunctive strategies: single-pulse TMS used as a primer immediately followed by specialist physiotherapy has been reported to accelerate improvement in functional weakness, but this remains early-stage and requires replication [^e3657956].

> Let me consider pharmacotherapy. There are no medications with proven direct benefit for core FND symptoms; sertraline failed to reduce functional seizure frequency versus placebo in a randomized trial, though CBT with or without sertraline was effective, suggesting psychiatric comorbidity treatment is the rational target rather than the functional symptom itself [^e34774c5] [^8e03f2a2]. I should double-check the practical implication: treat comorbid depression, anxiety, PTSD, and pain syndromes on their own merits, and avoid implying that medications will fix FND directly, to prevent nocebo effects and misattribution [^e34774c5].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In pediatrics, recovery rates are higher, with about 70% seizure remission in treated children, and multidisciplinary, school-involved care is standard; however, access and workforce limitations persist, especially in the US, necessitating telehealth and regional capacity building [^630b5b98] [^1e80f35c]. For severe, chronic FND, inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation can produce global improvements even after years of symptoms, with patient confidence in treatment predicting better outcomes; this supports selective use of intensive programs when outpatient care is insufficient [^6feab946] [^5ba45a3c]. In acute settings, early recognition, avoidance of iatrogenic harm, and clear referral pathways improve prognosis and reduce unnecessary testing and stigma [^59258cf0] [^20348a6e].

> I should confirm the role of diagnostic explanation alone. Providing a clear, positive diagnosis with education can reduce symptom frequency or severity in a meaningful subset, particularly in functional seizures, but it is rarely sufficient for durable recovery; thus, explanation should be paired with active treatment and follow-up to consolidate gains [^16259c8f] [^9e53f776]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while explanation helps, chronicity and disability still warrant structured rehabilitation or psychotherapy rather than watchful waiting alone [^16259c8f].

> Next, I should review emerging and adjunctive modalities. Hypnosis and suggestion-based interventions show high short-term response rates in uncontrolled series, but heterogeneity and quality limits preclude firm recommendations; they may be considered selectively in experienced hands [^c1e5d2dc]. Virtual reality is theoretically compelling for agency and attention retraining, with early frameworks and pilot work underway, but evidence is nascent and not yet practice-changing [^597c7b7b] [^ebe4bf99]. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is being explored for functional seizures based on mechanistic plausibility, but this remains investigational and should not be offered outside trials [^e243e090].

> I need to ensure we address outcome measurement and evidence quality. Heterogeneity in outcomes and instruments limits comparability; core domains should include symptoms, function/quality of life, and resource use, with greater emphasis on patient-reported measures given the disconnect between objective tests and lived experience in FND [^40cb87c5] [^2f73adfb]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: while CBT and multidisciplinary rehabilitation have the most consistent support, many studies are small, uncontrolled, or short-term; nonetheless, converging data and recent RCTs justify recommending these as first-line, with physiotherapy tailored to motor phenotypes and psychotherapy prioritized for seizures and mixed presentations [^23c1680d] [^d7527b8a].

> Finally, I should translate this into a practical, stepped care approach. For mild or recent-onset symptoms, start with diagnostic explanation, education, and basic self-management; if no improvement in 4–6 weeks, escalate to targeted physiotherapy for motor symptoms or CBT-based psychotherapy for seizures or mixed presentations; for severe, chronic, or complex cases, use coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation; throughout, address comorbidities, maintain consistent messaging across the team, and embed follow-up to prevent relapse and reinforce agency [^e52b7c0b] [^019810a7] [^409d92be]. I should double-check that this aligns with consensus: yes, multiple high-quality reviews endorse early, positive diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and stepped intensity matched to severity and chronicity, which operationalizes the evidence base into accessible clinical pathways [^e52b7c0b] [^9a68561b] [^1821e264].

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is best managed with a **multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach** that combines education, psychotherapy, and physical rehabilitation, tailored to symptom phenotype and patient needs [^e52b7c0b] [^23c1680d]. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is **first-line for functional seizures** and has moderate benefits across symptoms and function, while physiotherapy is **first-line for motor symptoms** and improves mobility and strength [^23c1680d] [^3320c2e2]. Early, clear diagnosis and explanation improve acceptance and outcomes; medications are not first-line for FND itself but may treat comorbidities [^16259c8f] [^e34774c5]. Neuromodulation (e.g. TMS) is promising but still investigational; virtual reality and psychedelic-assisted therapy are under study [^0170154e] [^597c7b7b] [^e243e090]. Prognosis varies: about 50% improve meaningfully, but chronicity and comorbidities reduce response; early intervention improves outcomes [^5a42a1cb] [^03d53a46].

## Core principles of treatment

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists collaborate to address physical, psychological, and social drivers [^ea741b4f] [^9a68561b].

- **Biopsychosocial model**: Treatment targets biological vulnerabilities, psychological factors, and social context to reduce symptoms and disability [^630b5b98] [^eb4523a1].

- **Patient education**: Early, clear explanation of FND as a genuine, reversible brain network disorder improves acceptance and engagement [^9e53f776] [^16259c8f].

---

## Evidence-based treatments

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) | Functional seizures, mixed FND | High | - Reduces seizure frequency <br/> - Improves function and quality of life <br/> - Medium effect sizes [^23c1680d] [^bd7ea911] |
| Psychodynamic psychotherapy | Mixed FND | Moderate | Comparable benefits to CBT; fewer high-quality RCTs [^bd7ea911] [^23c1680d] |
| Specialist physiotherapy | Motor FND (weakness, gait, tremor) | High | - Improves mobility <br/> - Strength <br/> - And function <br/> - Benefits sustained at 6–12 months [^3320c2e2] [^d7527b8a] |
| Multidisciplinary rehabilitation | Severe, chronic, or complex FND | Moderate | - Global improvement in symptoms <br/> - Function <br/> - And quality of life [^6feab946] [^d7527b8a] |
| Occupational therapy | Functional impairment, daily living | Moderate | Improves participation, self-management, and coping [^018ef089] [^0a60ecf2] |
| Speech therapy | Functional speech, swallowing, cognitive-communication | Moderate | Improves communication and swallowing function [^0a60ecf2] |

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

- **Neuromodulation**: Repetitive TMS shows preliminary promise for motor FND, but larger RCTs are needed [^0170154e] [^aa9b26fe].

- **Virtual reality (VR)**: Theoretically aligned with FND mechanisms; early research explores VR-based rehabilitation and agency training [^597c7b7b] [^ebe4bf99].

- **Psychedelic-assisted therapy**: Under investigation for functional seizures, with mechanistic rationale but no clinical trials yet [^e243e090].

---

## Factors influencing treatment outcomes

- **Symptom chronicity**: Longer duration modestly reduces motor and physical HRQoL gains, but meaningful improvement is still achievable [^03d53a46] [^5a42a1cb].

- **Comorbidities**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and chronic pain are common and worsen outcomes; addressing them is essential [^40cb87c5] [^14ace13e].

- **Patient engagement**: Belief in the diagnosis and active participation predict better outcomes [^6feab946] [^c452dedf].

- **Healthcare system factors**: Delays, misdiagnosis, and limited access to specialist care worsen prognosis [^df314578] [^530320bb].

---

## Prognosis

Untreated FND often leads to chronic disability; with treatment, about 50% improve meaningfully, though recovery may be partial and relapses occur [^2b863b6c] [^630b5b98]. Functional seizures have a **30–50% remission rate** with therapy, while motor symptoms show more variable outcomes; pediatric patients have higher recovery rates than adults [^630b5b98] [^5a42a1cb].

---

## Current limitations and future directions

- **Limited access**: Specialist services are scarce, especially in rural and underserved areas [^d164493b] [^530320bb].

- **Stigma and misdiagnosis**: Persistent misconceptions delay care and worsen outcomes [^df314578] [^e0e0d53d].

- **Need for standardization**: Consistent outcome measures and care pathways are lacking [^2f73adfb] [^1821e264].

- **Research gaps**: Larger, longitudinal RCTs are needed to refine interventions and identify predictors of response [^23c1680d] [^0170154e].

---

Functional neurological disorder is **treatable** with a multidisciplinary, biopsychosocial approach; **CBT and physiotherapy are foundational**, with emerging roles for neuromodulation and digital therapeutics. Early, accurate diagnosis and patient-centered care optimize outcomes, and ongoing research is essential to close evidence gaps and improve access.

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a common and disabling condition seen by nearly every clinician in nearly every clinical setting. There are multiple subtypes with seizure and motor/movement being the most common. There is high health care utilization and costs, and many patients have a chronic course and remain disabled. It is clear from research over the past two decades that abnormalities in brain network activity are implicated in the pathophysiology of FND. Diagnosis requires positive criteria and knowing how to obtain a good history and avoid common pitfalls. There are evidence-based treatments and expert consensus recommendations. A multidisciplinary team knowledgeable about the disorder is important for the best outcomes but there is much more work to be done. This review will focus on the practical aspects of diagnosing and managing FND.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations [^2f73adfb]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to identify existing outcome measures for functional neurological disorder (FND), to inform the development of recommendations and to guide future research on FND outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify existing FND-specific outcome measures and the most common measurement domains and measures in previous treatment studies. Searches of Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were conducted between January 1965 and June 2019. The findings were discussed during two international meetings of the FND-Core Outcome Measures group.

Results

Five FND-specific measures were identified — three clinician-rated and two patient-rated — but their measurement properties have not been rigorously evaluated. No single measure was identified for use across the range of FND symptoms in adults. Across randomised controlled trials (k = 40) and observational treatment studies (k = 40), outcome measures most often assessed core FND symptom change. Other domains measured commonly were additional physical and psychological symptoms, life impact (ie, quality of life, disability and general functioning) and health economics/cost–utility (eg, healthcare resource use and quality-adjusted life years).

Conclusions

There are few well-validated FND-specific outcome measures. Thus, at present, we recommend that existing outcome measures, known to be reliable, valid and responsive in FND or closely related populations, are used to capture key outcome domains. Increased consistency in outcome measurement will facilitate comparison of treatment effects across FND symptom types and treatment modalities. Future work needs to more rigorously validate outcome measures used in this population.

### Current concepts in diagnosis and treatment of functional neurological disorders [^46623288]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes.

Observations

Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited.

Conclusions and Relevance

Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.

### Treatment of functional neurological disorder: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^23c1680d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is among the most common reasons for neurology outpatient referrals, characterized by disabling motor, sensory, speech, and dissociative symptoms. It poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, often requiring multidisciplinary management and a biopsychosocial framework.

Objective

To perform an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating treatment efficacy across different FND subtypes, stratifying by intervention type, outcome direction, and quality of evidence.

Methods

We systematically screened and analyzed 17 reviews encompassing psychological therapies, physiotherapy, neuromodulation, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and pharmacological approaches. Studies were assessed for effect direction, GRADE certainty, and risk of bias across 10 methodological domains.

Results

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) demonstrated consistent benefit for PNES and mixed presentations, particularly when delivered within multidisciplinary frameworks. Physiotherapy showed moderate improvements in functional motor symptoms, while neuromodulation yielded promising but inconsistent results. Hypnosis and suggestion-based treatments provided subjective benefit in select cases, whereas pharmacological interventions were largely used adjunctively to manage psychiatric comorbidities. Risk of bias and heterogeneity in outcome measures limited direct comparisons, and the overall methodological quality varied across studies.

Conclusion

FND management appears to benefit most from tailored, multimodal approaches. While CBT and physiotherapy remain foundational, the overall quality of evidence remains moderate at best, highlighting a need for standardized outcome measures and rigorous trial designs to strengthen future practice guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of functional neurological disorder [^e52b7c0b]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, is now a rule-in diagnosis with available treatments. This represents a major step toward destigmatizing the disorder, which was often doubted and deemed untreatable. FND is prevalent, generally affecting young and middle aged adults, and can cause severe disability in some individuals. An early diagnosis, with subsequent access to evidence based rehabilitative and/or psychological treatments, can promote recovery-albeit not all patients respond to currently available treatments. This review presents the latest advances in the use of validated rule-in examination signs to guide diagnosis, and the range of therapeutic approaches available to care for patients with FND. The article focuses on the two most frequently identified subtypes of FND: motor (weakness and/or movement disorders) and seizure type symptoms. Twenty two studies on motor and 27 studies on seizure type symptoms report high specificities of clinical signs (64–100%), and individual signs are reviewed. Rehabilitative interventions (physical and occupational therapy) are treatments of choice for functional motor symptoms, while psychotherapy is an emerging evidence based treatment across FND subtypes. The literature to date highlights heterogeneity in responses to treatment, underscoring that more research is needed to individualize treatments and develop novel interventions.

### Pilot neurobehavioral therapy for functional neurological… [^2c9e947b]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Pilot Neurobehavioral Therapy for Functional Neurological Disorder ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The goal of this pilot randomized clinical trial is to learn if Neurobehavioral Therapy works to treat motor functional neurological disorder. The main questions it aims to answer are:

- Does NBT lower mFND symptoms.
- Does NBT lower common co-occurring symptoms and improve functioning. Researchers will compare NBT to standard medical care. Participants will be randomized to receive either:

- 12 weekly sessions of NBT, along with their SMC,
- or continue receiving their SMC as provided by their treating clinicians.
- all participants. regardless of group assignment, will complete a total of five in-clinic visits at the following time points: Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 8 Months and 12 Months for self-report surveys to assess functional status, quality of life and mFND symptoms.

The study aims to enroll 40 participants at Rhode Island Hospital. 20 participants with Motor Functional Neurological Disorder will be randomized to Neurobehavioral Therapy and 20 participants with mFND to Standard Medical Care. Those randomized to neurobehavioral therapy will be asked to complete treatment sessions over the course of 12 to 18 weeks. Those in the standard medical care arm will continue to receive their routine care with their clinicians. Aim 2: Examine the preliminary effectiveness of manualized NBT in improving health-related quality of life and reducing the severity and disability of mFNDs, as measured by the SF-36 and PMDRS/S-FMDRS, respectively. Hypothesis 2: NBT will show improvements in SF-36 scores and reductions in PMDRS scores. We will evaluate this by conducting a preliminary examination of the manualized NBT intervention, with a focus on interpreting effect sizes.

We will also gather key statistics needed to inform a fully powered clinical trial, such as the standard deviation and pre-post correlation of the SF-36 and PMDRS. Behavioral: Neuro-behavioral Therapy Other: Standard Medical Care

### Occupational therapy consensus recommendations for functional neurological disorder [^018ef089]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

People with functional neurological disorder (FND) are commonly seen by occupational therapists; however, there are limited descriptions in the literature about the type of interventions that are likely to be helpful. This document aims to address this issue by providing consensus recommendations for occupational therapy assessment and intervention.

Methods

The recommendations were developed in four stages. Stage 1: an invitation was sent to occupational therapists with expertise in FND in different countries to complete two surveys exploring their opinions regarding best practice for assessment and interventions for FND. Stage 2: a face-to-face meeting of multidisciplinary clinical experts in FND discussed and debated the data from stage 1, aiming to achieve consensus on each issue. Stage 3: recommendations based on the meeting were drafted. Stage 4: successive drafts of recommendations were circulated among the multidisciplinary group until consensus was achieved.

Results

We recommend that occupational therapy treatment for FND is based on a biopsychosocial aetiological framework. Education, rehabilitation within functional activity and the use of taught self-management strategies are central to occupational therapy intervention for FND. Several aspects of occupational therapy for FND are distinct from therapy for other neurological conditions. Examples to illustrate the recommendations are included within this document.

Conclusions

Occupational therapists have an integral role in the multidisciplinary management of people with FND. This document forms a starting point for research aiming to develop evidence-based occupational therapy interventions for people with FND.

### Functional syndromes in the pediatric population and their rehabilitation management: chronic pain syndrome and functional neurologic disorder [^ec20fe68]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic pain and functional neurologic disorders are frequently encountered causes of pediatric morbidity and disability. These medical conditions are complex, with multifactorial etiologies and presentations. Both have been found to benefit from biopsychosocial approaches in addition to common pharmacologic interventions. The diagnosis and exclusion of other processes is vital to quickly identify appropriate treatment plans. A multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, therapists, psychologists, and caseworkers must work in conjunction with the family and patient to minimize disability and distress caused by these disorders, with the ultimate goal to increase day-to-day functionality for the patient.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^6f9750f8]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is one of the most common neurological disorders seen from childhood to the elderly, in almost all clinical settings, and by clinicians from different disciplines, especially neurologists. The last two decades have seen an improved understanding of this disorder that has brought a renewed clinical approach guided by increasingly available evidence. These advances allow clinicians to more comfortably diagnose and manage patients with FND in their pursuit of recovery. This article summarizes practical management highlights to guide clinicians who come across individuals with FND in their clinical practice.

FND is currently defined as a "clinical syndrome with genuinely experienced neurological symptoms which are distressing or impairing, and show dysfunction of the nervous system with variability in performance within a task or between tasks". FND is associated with high and rising healthcare utilization and costs, similar to other complex neurological disorders but with marked lag in research funding comparatively. In addition, there are a growing number of studies showing high rate of disability and distress with FND diagnosis as well as elevated morbidity and mortality especially in the seizure subtype, functional/dissociative seizures (F/DS), also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. This is particularly concerning since FND is a challenging condition to recognize, diagnose, and treat. These challenges have led to the increased costs but suboptimal outcomes. In 2013, the DSM 5 update required FND (recognized within the DSM 5 manual as "conversion disorder" or "functional neurological symptom disorder") be diagnosed using positive "rule in" criteria, abandoning longstanding practice of ruling out all other possible causes, and helping to make some progress with the recognition of the disorder. There is a new dawn for FND with a rapidly growing interest in research into understanding how this disorder happens, educating clinicians and the public to how common it is, and in searching for new evidence-based treatments that can help the myriads of patients who suffer from it. This current perspective will provide a brief background and then focus on practical management of this common, distressing and debilitating disorder.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^ed86054c]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of persistent and disabling neurological symptoms. These symptoms are varied and include abnormal control of movement, episodes of altered awareness resembling epileptic seizures and abnormal sensation and are often comorbid with chronic pain, fatigue and cognitive symptoms. There is increasing evidence for the role of neurologists in both the assessment and management of FND. The aim of this review is to discuss strategies for the management of FND by focusing on the diagnostic discussion and general principles, as well as specific treatment strategies for various FND symptoms, highlighting the role of the neurologist and proposing a structure for an interdisciplinary FND service.

### You' ve made the diagnosis of functional neurological disorder: now what? [^53c5a17e]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with functional neurological disorders (FND)/conversiondisorder commonly present to outpatient clinics. FND is now a 'rule in' diagnosis based on neurological examination findings and semiological features. While neurologists may be more comfortable diagnosing patients with FND, there is only limited guidance as to how to conduct follow-up outpatient visits. Using clinical vignettes, we provide practical suggestions that may help guide clinical encounters including how to: (1) explore illness beliefs openly; (2) enquire longitudinally about predisposing vulnerabilities, acute precipitants and perpetuating factors that may be further elucidated over time; (3) facilitate psychotherapy engagement by actively listening for potentially unhelpful or maladaptive patterns of thoughts, behaviours, fears or psychosocial stressors that can be reflected back to the patient and (4) enquire about the fidelity of individual treatments and educate other providers who may be less familiar with FND. These suggestions, while important to individualise, provide a blueprint for follow-up FND clinical care.

### Psychotherapy for functional neurological (conversion) disorder: a case bridging mind, brain, and body [^0081b7f5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Functional neurologic (conversion) disorder (FND) is a core neuropsychiatric condition directly at the intersection of psychiatry and neurology. Over the past several decades, renewed interest in FND has been catalyzed by use of a "rule-in" diagnostic approach leveraging positive clinical signs specific for the diagnosis. In parallel, advances have occurred in identifying mechanisms, etiologic factors, and evidence-based treatments for this population. While "one size fits all" formulations of the "conversion" of psychological distress into physical symptoms are no longer widely accepted, emotion processing and related psychological constructs (eg, alexithymia, dissociation, threat avoidance) remain central to the conceptual understanding of FND. Furthermore, the biopsychosocial model (foundational to psychiatry) is the prevailing model through which to guide longitudinal treatment, with psychotherapy as an emerging first line intervention for FND. Nonetheless, there is a striking dearth of psychotherapists and mental health providers more broadly that feel well versed in the clinical assessment and management of patients with FND. In this article, we seek to address this gap by presenting the psychotherapy treatment narrative of a woman experiencing paroxysmal functional speech and gait disorder symptoms who had a positive clinical outcome. Our goal with this case presentation and related discussion is to increase the proficiency of psychotherapists in providing treatment to patients with FND.

### Functional neurological disorder: new subtypes and shared mechanisms [^eb4523a1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder is common in neurological practice. A new approach to the positive diagnosis of this disorder focuses on recognisable patterns of genuinely experienced symptoms and signs that show variability within the same task and between different tasks over time. Psychological stressors are common risk factors for functional neurological disorder, but are often absent. Four entities-functional seizures, functional movement disorders, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and functional cognitive disorder-show similarities in aetiology and pathophysiology and are variants of a disorder at the interface between neurology and psychiatry. All four entities have distinctive features and can be diagnosed with the support of clinical neurophysiological studies and other biomarkers. The pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder includes overactivity of the limbic system, the development of an internal symptom model as part of a predictive coding framework, and dysfunction of brain networks that gives movement the sense of voluntariness. Evidence supports tailored multidisciplinary treatment that can involve physical and psychological therapy approaches.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^d164493b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The management of FND requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach tailored to the individual needs of patients. Although in Australia significant progress has been made in understanding and treating the condition, barriers such as limited access to specialist care, particularly in regional areas, continue to hamper the delivery of adequate care for most patients. Enhancing professional education, increasing public awareness and improving access to multidisciplinary services for all Australians are essential steps to ensure that all individuals with FND receive timely and effective treatment. With continued research and collaboration, it is likely the management for patients with FND will be improved, offering hope for better outcomes and quality of life.

### Economic cost of functional neurologic disorders: a systematic review [^e0d121cb]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Functional neurologic disorder (FND) represents genuine involuntary neurologic symptoms and signs including seizures, weakness, and sensory disturbance, which have characteristic clinical features, and represent a problem of voluntary control and perception despite normal basic structure of the nervous system. The historical view of FND as a diagnosis of exclusion can lead to unnecessary health care resource utilization and high direct and indirect economic costs. A systematic review was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to assess these economic costs and to assess for any cost-effective treatments.

Methods

We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database of the University of York) for original, primary research publications between inception of the databases and April 8, 2022. A hand search of conference abstracts was also conducted. Key search terms included "functional neurologic disorder", "conversion disorder", and "functional seizures". Reviews, case reports, case series, and qualitative studies were excluded. We performed a descriptive and qualitative thematic analysis of the resulting studies.

Results

The search resulted in a total of 3,244 studies. Sixteen studies were included after screening and exclusion of duplicates. These included the following: cost-of-illness (COI) studies that were conducted alongside cohort studies without intervention and those that included a comparator group, for example, another neurologic disorder (n = 4); COI studies that were conducted alongside cohort studies without intervention and those that did not include a comparator group (n = 4); economic evaluations of interventions that were either pre-post cohort studies (n = 6) or randomized controlled trials (n = 2). Of these, 5 studies assessed active interventions, and 3 studies assessed costs before and after a definitive diagnosis of FND. Studies showed an excess annual cost associated with FND (range $4,964–$86,722 2021 US dollars), which consisted of both direct and large indirect costs. Studies showed promise that interventions, including provision of a definitive diagnosis, could reduce this cost (range 9%–90.7%). No cost-effective treatments were identified. Study comparison was limited by study design and location heterogeneity.

Discussion

FND is associated with a significant use of health care resources, resulting in economic costs to both the patient and the taxpayer and intangible losses. Interventions, including accurate diagnosis, seem to offer an avenue toward reducing these costs.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^e25aac3e]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Neurologist role

Recommendations

The neurological assessment can be seen as the first step in FND treatment, not just a prelude to diagnosis.
Effective explanation of a diagnosis of FND can alter key beliefs and is an opportunity to teach some preliminary self-management strategies that patients can implement immediately.
Neurologists have a role in triaging to different types of evidence-based treatment.

The neurological assessment serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The primary goal is to establish the diagnosis, which should be followed by a clear explanation of FND as this can significantly improve patient outcomes. While not dwelling on the possibility of other causes, it should directly address any specific patient concerns that the symptoms might be due to another cause (eg, a brain tumour or multiple sclerosis). Addressing these concerns early and assertively usually prevents the need for further investigations as a means of reassuring the patient.

Neurologists can recommend multidisciplinary approaches to help patients manage their symptoms before seeing other health professionals, for example, basic physiotherapy or psychology techniques. These interventions can activate the process of educating and empowering patients to take ownership of their treatment plan and hopefully see improved symptom management.

Physiotherapist role

Recommendations

Physiotherapy management should include facilitating normal movement, retraining normal movement, addressing secondary changes and education (including role of physiotherapy, activity pacing and long-term self-management of symptoms).

Physiotherapy can be effective for managing functional movement disorders in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The subjective assessment should aim to understand the patient's symptoms, including biopsychosocial triggers and symptom patterns over the day; gauge the patient's acceptance and understanding of their FND diagnosis; and serve as an opportunity to jointly set management goals. The focus of the objective assessment should be on activity performance and functional ability, such as mobility, rather than on impairment measures. This approach may reveal positive signs that aid consolidating the diagnosis of FND. In selecting objective measures, the effect of attention on symptoms should be borne in mind, and measures of function rather than specific movement should be preferred.

Movement retraining as treatment should be goal-oriented and focused on facilitating self-management. Distraction techniques are recommended in movement retraining for FND. These techniques involve engaging patients in competing movements, weight-bearing activities or purposeful limb use. Distraction should be used to provide an alternative sensorimotor experience rather than attempting to deceive the patient. Management also includes providing education about FND, energy conservation, pain management, caregiver and family education and developing a relapse prevention plan.

### Exploring therapeutic interventions for functional neurological disorders: a comprehensive scoping review [^2a068d80]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional Neurological Disorders (FNDs) are characterized by the symptoms experienced by the individuals but also by how they express personal experiences and concerns related to the clinical condition. Access to care programs for functional neurological symptoms appears challenging and may entail circular, self-perpetuating healthcare pathways. Given the challenging and misleading interpretations around FND, in advocating for care pathways beyond medical therapies, we designed a scoping review to map recently suggested practices and interventions. We identified 31 relevant papers published between January 2018 and December 2022. Most of the literature was gathered from the US and UK healthcare experiences, with documented interventions provided by multi-professional teams or stand-alone psychotherapists. We found different care pathways addressing either motor or non-motor manifestations. Persons with Functional Motor Disorder are more likely to be referred to physical therapy first, while Persons suffering from Non-Epileptic Seizures are to mental health services. A narrow focus was given to minor components of multimodal approaches (e.g. social workers, and occupational therapists). High heterogeneity was found between assessment instruments as well, reflecting different perspectives in selecting treatment outcomes (e.g., reduction of non-epileptic events, psychological functioning, motor symptoms). Among healthcare professionals, neurologists and (neuro)psychiatrists are typically engaged in formulating and delivering diagnoses, while treatment is often administered by physiotherapists and/or psychologists. In the context of FNDs, the complex etiopathological nature of the condition, including comorbidities, suggests the recommendation of multidisciplinary treatments adopting a stepped care model progressing from standard to higher level individualized modules may better suit individual complexities.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^b6a27df0]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future directions

Over the last two decades, there has been a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of FND and more treatment options have been developed. This represents a new era for this previously neglected diagnosis suffered by many patients who often feel misunderstood and stigmatized. Unfortunately, harmful treatment of patients with FND is not completely eradicated. However, these recent developments allow clinicians to more confidently interact with patients with empathy, compassion and non-judgmentally.

It is now recognized that certain practices are counterproductive in the management of patients with FND. For example, telling patients that they do 'not suffer from a neurological disorder' and that their problem is 'beyond the neurologist's area of expertise', or that the problem is in 'their heads', implying that symptoms are imagined or willfully fabricated, will likely delay diagnosis acceptance and treatment engagement. The new available evidence and growing resources allow clinicians suspecting FND to, at a minimum, help patients connect with a clinician who can either facilitate further confirmation of the diagnosis and/or help patients navigate access to therapeutic interventions.

There is still much to learn about FND. While cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying FND are better understood, we have limited knowledge about genetic or epigenetic vulnerabilities or neurohumoral biomarkers and how these may be shared (or not) with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinicians versed in existing effective treatments for FND are difficult to find, so these therapies need to be more widely disseminated. Additionally, not all patients will respond to the currently available therapies, and more creative approaches need to be developed or modified for chronic or treatment-resistant FND. There are new treatment modalities on the horizon that may provide new hope or could enhance existing therapies. Brain stimulation, virtual reality-based therapies, psychedelics are some examples.

The new Functional Neurological Disorder Society is an international professional organization that offers a multidisciplinary forum for those interested in learning more about FND. It offers educational webinars, courses and conferences and has active working groups across disciplines and different aspects of the disorder. The society particularly welcomes trainees and early career professionals.

Education on FND during the initial formative years of training can be the most valuable investment to further legitimize and help us further understand this disorder which can severely affect many peoples' lives. While efforts to improve training in FND are underway, there is a long path to achieve tangible improvements.

### Hypnosis and suggestion as interventions for functional neurological disorder: a systematic review [^c1e5d2dc]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Functional neurological disorder (FND) involves the presence of neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by neurological disease. FND has long been linked to hypnosis and suggestion, both of which have been used as treatments. Given ongoing interest, this review examined evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis and suggestion as treatment interventions for FND.

Method

A systematic search of bibliographic databases was conducted to identify group studies published over the last hundred years. No restrictions were placed on study design, language, or clinical setting. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and rated study quality.

Results

The search identified 35 studies, including 5 randomised controlled trials, 2 non-randomised trials, and 28 pre-post studies. Of 1584 patients receiving either intervention, 1379 (87%) showed significant improvements, including many who demonstrated resolution of their symptoms in the short-term. Given the heterogeneity of interventions and limitations in study quality overall, more formal quantitative synthesis was not possible.

Conclusions

The findings highlight longstanding and ongoing interest in using hypnosis and suggestion as interventions for FND. While the findings appear promising, limitations in the evidence base, reflecting limitations in FND research more broadly, prevent definitive recommendations. Further research seems warranted given these supportive findings.

### Functional neurological disorders: the neurological assessment as treatment [^07bd3b46]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The neurologist's role in patients with functional disorders has traditionally been limited to making the diagnosis, excluding a 'disease' and pronouncing the symptoms to be 'non-organic' or 'psychogenic'. In this article, I argue that there are multiple opportunities during routine assessment of a patient with a functional disorder for the neurologist to take the lead with treatment. These opportunities occur throughout history taking, during the examination and, with greatest potential for treatment, at the end of the consultation. Elements of the neurologist's discussion that may be most useful include (a) emphasis that symptoms are genuine, common and potentially reversible; (b) explanation of the positive nature of the diagnosis (ie, not a diagnosis of exclusion); (c) simple advice about distraction techniques, self-help techniques and sources of information; (d) referral on to appropriate physiotherapy and/or psychological services; and (e) offering outpatient review. I also discuss how new diagnostic criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 and changes proposed for International Classification of Diseases may facilitate changes that allow neurologists to bring their management of patients with functional disorders in line with other multidisciplinary neurological disorders in the outpatient clinic.

### Why functional neurological disorder is not feigning or malingering [^4982ec89]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is one of the commonest reasons that people seek help from a neurologist and is for many people a lifelong cause of disability and impaired quality of life. Although the evidence base regarding FND pathophysiology, treatment and service development has grown substantially in recent years, a persistent ambivalence remains amongst health professionals and others as to the veracity of symptom reporting in those with FND and whether the symptoms are not, in the end, just the same as feigned symptoms or malingering. Here, we provide our perspective on the range of evidence available, which in our view provides a clear separation between FND and feigning and malingering. We hope this will provide a further important step forward in the clinical and academic approach to people with FND, leading to improved attitudes, knowledge, treatments, care pathways and outcomes.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^16259c8f]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic explanation and these basic management steps can often be an effective treatment. They can also prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful further investigations and treatments. A systematic review exploring the impact of receiving a diagnosis of functional seizures found that approximately half of patients had a reduction or cessation of attacks, although considerable heterogeneity exists between studies. However, diagnostic explanation alone frequently does not yield resolution of symptoms. In a systematic review assessing the prognosis of functional motor symptoms, a majority of included studies (20 of 24) found that greater than one-third of patients had ongoing symptoms at follow-up, with the severity being the same or worse. Thus, for many people with FND it is necessary to consider symptom-specific management strategies and to arrange follow-up, which allows for the monitoring of symptoms, the ability to review old notes and test results and the opportunity for further diagnostic explanation and discussion.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^908d1689]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of persistent and disabling neurological symptoms. These symptoms are varied and include abnormal control of movement (e.g. weakness, tremor, dystonic posturing), episodes of altered awareness resembling epileptic seizures (functional/dissociative seizures) and abnormal sensation. Fatigue, pain and cognitive difficulties are common additional symptoms. In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis placed on the role of neurologists in the management of FND. This replaces a traditional neurological approach of excluding a neurological disease process and either discharging the patient or referring to a psychiatrist. Instead, an extended role for neurologists can include a specific expertise in the diagnosis of FND, diagnostic explanation, treatment and follow-up, often acting as coordinator for a multidisciplinary team-based approach to management. There may be comorbid psychiatric disorders present, and thus a coordinated effort between a neurologist and psychiatrist is important for both assessment and management on a case by case basis. It is, therefore, important for neurologists to understand the emerging evidence for various therapeutic options for this heterogenous group of patients. The purpose of this review is to discuss strategies for management of FND, highlighting the role of the neurologist, and proposing a structure for an interdisciplinary FND service.

### Neuromodulation for the treatment of functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder: a systematic review [^0170154e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder are complex neuropsychiatric conditions that have been linked to circuit-based dysfunction of brain networks. Neuromodulation is a novel therapeutic strategy capable of modulating relevant brain networks, making it a promising potential candidate for the treatment of these patient populations. We conducted a systematic review of Medline, Embase and PsycINFO up to 4 March 2021. Trials investigating neuromodulation devices for the treatment of functional neurological disorder or somatic symptom disorder were selected. Extracted variables included study design, demographic and clinical characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, neurostimulation protocols, clinical outcome measures and results. 404 studies were identified with 12 meeting inclusion criteria. 221 patients were treated in the included studies with mean study sample size of 18 (4–70). Five studies were randomised clinical trials. Functional motor symptoms (six weakness, four movement disorders) were the most studied subpopulations. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was the most frequently used device (10 studies), followed by electroconvulsive therapy (one study) and direct-current stimulation (one study). Treatment protocols varied in intended therapeutic mechanism(s): eight studies aimed to modulate underlying network dysfunction, five aimed to demonstrate movement (one also leveraged the former) and three boosted their primary mechanism with enhanced suggestion/expectation. All but one study reported positive results; however, methodological/outcome heterogeneity, mixed study quality and small sample sizes precluded quantitative meta-analysis. Neuromodulation, particularly TMS for the treatment of functional motor symptoms, shows preliminary promise in a growing line of research. Larger, sham-controlled studies are needed to further establish efficacy and better understand therapeutic mechanisms.

### Treatment outcomes in the inpatient management of severe functional neurological disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^5ba45a3c]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterised by disruption of motor, sensory or cognitive functions, in patterns that are not consistent with recognised structural disease (or damage) of the nervous system. FND is common, and symptoms cause disability comparable to that associated with other severe neurological diseases. In severe FND, patients can become restricted to a bed or wheelchair and reliant on care. Globally, there is limited availability of specialist treatment for patients with FND. Published outcomes of inpatient treatment of severe FND are sparse and are predominantly observational studies of small clinical cohorts, such that there is limited evidence to support inpatient, multidisciplinary intervention in chronic, severe FND.

This study aims to extend knowledge regarding the treatment of severe FND by describing the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients consecutively admitted to a specialist unit offering multidisciplinary rehabilitation informed by a biopsychosocial treatment model. We also examine whether data collected at time of admission had predictive value in terms of eventual treatment outcomes.

### Treatment outcomes in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the influence of symptom chronicity [^03d53a46]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of neurological disability with symptoms spanning motor, sensory and cognitive domains. While effective treatments exist, the impact of symptom chronicity on treatment outcomes is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether longer symptom duration influences treatment outcomes across FND phenotypes: functional movement disorders, functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) and mixed presentations.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and grey literature were systematically searched till 29 June 2024. Studies were included if they involved adult FND participants undergoing any intervention and evaluated symptom change, function and health-related quality of life (HrQoL). Studies were excluded with < 10 participants, missing symptom duration data or irrelevant outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses used random effects models, subgroup analyses and univariate meta-regression to examine associations with symptom chronicity.

Results

63 studies met inclusion criteria; 27 studies (885 participants) were meta-analysed. Longer symptom duration modestly reduced improvements in motor symptoms (-3.24 points/year, scale: 0–100) and physical HrQoL (-1.2 points/year, scale: 0–100). Global improvements (mean Clinical Global Impression-Change 2.43, 95%CI: 2.28 to 2.59, scale: 1–7) and mental HrQoL gains (mean Short Form-Mental Component Summary +5.04 points, 95%CI: 1.67 to 8.41) were observed irrespective of chronicity. FDS frequency reduced after psychotherapy in eight of nine studies, even with prolonged symptoms.

Conclusions

Symptom chronicity modestly reduced motor and physical HrQoL improvements, but did not negate meaningful gains across a range of outcomes. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for better outcomes, but remain beneficial in chronic stages.

### Iatrogenic harm in functional neurological disorder [^df314578]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is continuing to gain increasing recognition globally as a valid and potentially treatable disorder. Iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND is significant, however, and has been around for centuries. Despite advances in our understanding around the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of FND, many aspects of such harm continue to persist. Avoidance of iatrogenic harm has been highlighted by clinicians as one of the most important therapeutic considerations in FND; however, the sources and range of potential harms, or indeed ways to mitigate them, have not previously been summarized. Using a combination of clinical and research experience and scoping review methodology, this review aims to describe the main sources of iatrogenic harm towards patients with FND, including harm from misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and treatment, direct harm from professional interactions, other stigma-related harms, harm related to diagnostic overshadowing and over-diagnosis of FND. We also describe some potential ways to address and prevent such harms, such as ways to reduce misdiagnosis with a focus on rule in signs, optimizing teaching and communication, ensuring parity of FND with other medical conditions and continued integration of patient and professional organizations.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^9a68561b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) can present significant management challenges due to its sometimes-complex presentation and the historical stigma attached to this diagnosis. Recent advances have improved understanding and management of FND, emphasising the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach to management. The prognosis of FND varies but evidence-based treatments offer the potential of remission to many people for whom FND might otherwise cause long-term disability, and meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement for many more. Despite this, limited and inequitable access to treatment means that many people with FND in Australia continue to experience treatable disability due to the condition. Diagnosis: FND should be diagnosed based on positive signs rather than exclusion. This includes identifying inconsistencies and incongruencies in symptoms that differentiate them from other neurological conditions. Communication: The diagnosis of FND should be communicated to patients promptly and clearly upon diagnosis of the condition. Information provided should include the name of the condition, the basis on which the diagnosis has been made, key principles that can aid self-management, and shared planning of next steps in treatment or accessing treatment. Multidisciplinary Management: Across healthcare service models, treatment should involve a multidisciplinary team to address the multifaceted, and sometimes complex symptoms of FND. Role of General Practitioners (GPs): GPs are integral in the long-term management of FND, providing continuity of care, patient support and education, and facilitating access to specialist services. An informed GP can provide the patient with confidence and agency to be pro-active in their symptoms.

### Treatment outcomes in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the influence of symptom chronicity [^2b863b6c]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is the second most diagnosed condition in outpatient general neurology clinics, and most frequently diagnosed in hospital neurology consultations between specialties. The condition encompasses disorders of movement, sensation and cognition ranging from seizure-like events, paralysis, dystonia, tremor, paraesthesia, blindness to dizziness, which can profoundly impact the well-being and social participation of afflicted individuals and their caregivers.

There has been rapid growth in FND treatments in recent decades. Treatment could involve clinical psychology, physiotherapy or multidisciplinary care, though many other treatments have been described. The efficacy of FND treatments is posited to stem from modifying symptom-focussed attention to return normal 'automatic' functionand addressing contributory illness beliefs for maintaining symptom remission.

FND prognosis is highly variable with substantial proportions of people achieving symptomatic remission or improvement after treatment, while a subgroup has refractory symptoms. A systematic review exploring the natural history of the condition based on considerably heterogeneous, small, single-centre studies reported unfavourable prognosis for patients with functional motor weakness without treatment. Approximately one-third of untreated FND patients have refractory symptoms at three years. The level of disability and impact on quality of life caused by functional motor symptoms was comparable to people with Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative condition. Similarly, a review evaluating the prognosis of dissociative seizures without treatment reported that fewer than four in 10 patients would achieve seizure remission in five years.

### Decade of progress in motor functional neurological disorder: continuing the momentum [^eeaac5d9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a prevalent, disabling and costly condition at the neurology-psychiatry intersection. After being marginalised in the late 20th century, there has been renewed interest in this field. In this article, we review advances that have occurred over the past decade (2011–2020) across diagnosis, mechanisms, aetiologies, treatments and stigma in patients with motor FND (mFND, that is, functional movement disorder and functional limb weakness). In each content area, we also discuss the implications of recent advances and suggest future directions that will help continue the momentum of the past decade. In diagnosis, a major advance has been the emphasis on rule-in physical signs that are specific for hyperkinetic and hypokinetic functional motor symptoms. Mechanistically, greater importance has been given to determining 'how' functional neurological symptoms develop, highlighting roles for misdirected attention, expectation and self-agency, as well as abnormal influences of emotion/threat processing brain areas on motor control circuits. Aetiologically, while roles for adverse life experiences remain of interest in mFND, there is recognition of other aetiologic contributors, and efforts are needed to investigate links between aetiological factors and mechanisms. This decade has seen the first randomised controlled trials for physiotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and psychotherapy performed in the field, with consensus recommendations for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and outcome measures also published. Across patients, clinicians, healthcare systems and society, stigma remains a major concern. While challenges persist, a patient-centred integrated clinical neuroscience approach is primed to carry forward the momentum of the past decade into the future.

### Qualitative systematic review on the lived experience of functional neurological disorder [^ce20eaf9]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common neuropsychiatric condition, with a long history of name changes and stigmatisation. Historically, the aetiology of the disorder has been unclear. There were several ideas within medicine and psychology to explain the possible causes for the development of this complex condition. Significant advances have been made in understanding FND's neurobiopsychological mechanisms in recent years. Current understanding of FND emphasises abnormalities in predictive processing and the interaction between attention, emotional processing, agency and interoception.FND symptoms include motor weakness, movement disorders, loss of other sensory functions and non-epileptic seizures. Symptoms are involuntary, and the severity can vary from slight somatic concerns to severe chronic functional impairment.FND is now diagnosed through positive clinical signs via specific neurological examinations, representing a shift from historical approaches that viewed it as a diagnosis of exclusion.

At times a complicating factor for reaching diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment is that some clinicians and practitioners still lack resources, information, support and understanding of this disorder. Investigating possible specific causes of symptoms is time consuming and expensive and can be similarly frustrating for patients, carers and doctors. Successful diagnoses and treatment are also made difficult as the historical names of the disorder, such as hysteria and conversion disorder, can be perceived as stigmatising.

Recent research has moved beyond traditional diagnostic frameworks to embrace a more integrated understanding of FND. However, by investigating patients' lived experiences, including relational experiences, possible traumas and losses, and their stories of the development of the disorder, we can potentially gain more insight and further our biopsychosocial understanding of FND. This qualitative systematic literature review uses thematic analysis to address the question, 'What is the subjective life experience of adult patients living with FND?'

### Systematic review of psychotherapy for adults with functional neurological disorder [^bd7ea911]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and disabling disorder that is often considered difficult to treat, particularly in adults. Psychological therapies are often recommended for FND. Outcome research on psychological therapies for FND has grown in recent years but has not been systematically evaluated since 2005. This study aims to build on that by systematically reviewing the evidence-base for individual outpatient cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic psychotherapies for FND. Medical databases were systematically searched for prospective studies of individual outpatient psychotherapy for FND with at least five adult participants. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using a standardised assessment tool. Results were synthesised, and effect sizes calculated for illustrative purposes. The search strategy identified 131 relevant studies, of which 19 were eligible for inclusion: 12 examining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 7 investigating psychodynamic therapy (PDT). Eleven were pre-post studies and eight were randomised controlled trials. Most studies recruited a single symptom-based subtype rather than all presentations of FND. Effect sizes, where calculable, showed generally medium-sized benefits for physical symptoms, mental health, well-being, function and resource use for both CBT and PDT. Outcomes were broadly comparable across the two therapy types, although a lack of high-quality controlled trials of PDT is a significant limitation, as is the lack of long-term follow-up data in the majority of identified CBT trials. In conclusion, both CBT and PDT appear to potentially offer some benefit for FND, although better quality studies are needed.

### Provider perspectives of barriers to delivering care for pediatric functional neurological disorder: a thematic analysis [^45b10857]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a multinetwork brain disorder existing at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. FND often takes significant time to receive diagnosis and treatment. Given these delays, the purpose of the present study was to identify barriers to FND care from the provider perspective.

Methods

The Functional Neurological Disorder Society Pediatric Special Interest Group asked pediatric FND providers to specify barriers to FND treatment in their center in the United States. Two authors conducted thematic analyses to extract themes between respondents' qualitative responses.

Results

Our analysis found that the US health care system is not adequately designed to provide timely and sufficient treatment for pediatric FND. Four subthemes emerged. First, providers identified limited access to health care professionals (HCPs) with specialized expertise in pediatric FND. The second delineated the lack of HCP education and competence in FND. Third, providers indicated the challenge of coordinating care and establishing bidirectional communication with their colleagues. Finally, providers identified financial support, including insurance coverage, as a barrier.

Conclusions

The present study highlights barriers to care for pediatric patients with FND from the provider perspective in the United States. These barriers existed regardless of geography, treatment type, discipline, or specialty highlighting opportunities to intervene. By improving provider education, general practitioners may gain increased confidence in quickly delivering an FND diagnosis; this could also allow additional providers to become experts in treating FND, thus decreasing delays to initiating care. Additionally, advocacy for increased insurance coverage may also help to eliminate treatment-related disparities for pediatric FND.

Difficulties will be especially magnified if the neurologist making the original FND diagnosis did so in a way that failed to validate the patient's symptoms or provide onward treatment. Whereas in the past, missing a diagnosis of MS could have been said not to have led to a change in prognosis, that is no longer the case with newer disease modifying agents.

The implications of misdiagnosis of MS in patients who have FNDs include unnecessary treatment of MS and its accompanying side-effects and risks, delay to diagnosis and treatment of FND, and psychological harm as a result of misdiagnosis. In one study, 31% of patients misdiagnosed with MS experienced unnecessary morbidity as a result of misdiagnosis, most commonly due to unnecessary immunomodulatory therapy and treatment side-effects. Traditionally, neurologists may have considered that accidentally diagnosing MS in someone with FND was less harmful because of a lack of established treatment options for FND. However, the scientific landscape around FND has changed considerably in the last 10 years. Patients with FND erroneously diagnosed with MS miss out on increasingly evidence-based treatment for their functional symptoms. For example, a randomized controlled trial of specialized physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms found that 72% of patient had improvements in mobility sustained at 6 month follow-up compared to 18% in a control arm having non-specialized physiotherapy.

The increase in evidence-based treatment for FND is encouraging. Yet, given how common the disorder is encountered in clinical practice, use of these approaches in community settings remains rare. Spreading use of evidence-based interventions for FND will require a collaborative training effort so that these therapies can be used outside of a few FND specialized centers or clinics.

Role of biological therapies

Currently, there is no convincing evidence that pharmacological treatment reduces FND symptoms specifically. There is only one double-blind placebo-controlled study of sertraline in F/DS, which showed that sertraline was not superior to placebo at reducing seizure frequency. The study was probably under-powered given that the active drug group showed a reduction in FDS at treatment end while the placebo group showed an increase, however, this difference was not enough for a statistical difference. Other data comes from open-label design studies or isolated case reports. Data from a related diagnostic category, somatic symptom disorder, seems to indicate benefit from antidepressant medications. Clinicians ought to be clear what their intended outcome is when prescribing any medication for FND, whether the target is a comorbid psychiatric symptom or a comorbid physical symptom, such as pain, and be upfront that direct impact on FND symptoms is generally not expected from pharmacological interventions. Although there is lack of current evidence for psychopharmacological treatments, occasionally patients may experience symptomatic improvement of their FND symptoms, likely through relief of underlying psychiatric underlying mechanisms.

Both placebo and nocebo responses are common in functional disorders, and therefore a reported history of clinical benefit from medications should be interpreted taking these concepts into consideration and not as an indication of a direct therapeutic drug effect on the functional neurological symptom or as a signal that the diagnosis of FND should be re-considered. Similarly, introduction of a medication should be slow and at low doses to minimize any negative effects in this particularly susceptible population. Experience of negative side effects may, in fact, precipitate new or worsening functional symptoms and such possible outcome needs to be considered before any drug initiation.

Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation offer future promise as biological therapies that may be incorporated in the treatment toolkit in FND. To date, evidence of their efficacy remains limited and based on studies of small sample size and variable design using different stimulation protocols and outcome measures.

### Functional neurological disorder in Europe: regional differences in education and health policy [^530320bb]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of neurological disability. Despite recent advances in pathophysiological understanding and treatments, application of this knowledge to clinical practice is variable and limited.

Objective

Our aim was to provide an expert overview of the state of affairs of FND practice across Europe, focusing on education and training, access to specialized care, reimbursement and disability policies, and academic and patient-led representation of people with FND.

Methods

We conducted a survey across Europe, featuring one expert per country. We asked experts to compare training and services for people with FND to those provided to people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Results

Responses from 25 countries revealed that only five included FND as a mandatory part of neurological training, while teaching about MS was uniformly included. FND was part of final neurology examinations in 3/17 countries, unlike MS that was included in all 17. Seventeen countries reported neurologists with an interest in FND but the estimated mean ratio of FND-interested neurologists to MS neurologists was 1:20. FND coding varied, with psychiatric coding for FND impacting treatment access and disability benefits in the majority of countries. Twenty countries reported services refusing to see FND patients. Eight countries reported an FND special interest group or network; 11 reported patient-led organizations.

Conclusions

FND is largely a marginal topic within European neurology training and there is limited access to specialized care and disability benefits for people with FND across Europe. We discuss how this issue can be addressed at an academic, healthcare and patient organization level.

Section 3: treatment and management

Most patients with FND benefit from treatment. For symptoms that are mild and of recent onset, a short period of observation to allow for the spontaneous remission of symptoms after initial diagnosis and explanation is sometimes appropriate. Patients who do not improve over this period, or who have severe or long-standing symptoms, usually require structured interventions. Treatment should be initiated by the diagnosing specialist and will ideally be supported by GPs and allied health professionals.

GP role

Recommendations

GPs should be informed about the diagnosis of FND and equipped with strategies to support ongoing patient management.
The GP–patient relationship is pivotal as a means of providing care in the longer term. GPs should have access to specialist advice and be given the opportunity for continuing professional development in the management of FND.

Long-term management often requires sustained involvement from GPs who play a vital role in patient care. Access to necessary support for both the GP and the patient with FND is often hindered by limited availability of public services and the financial burden of private care. The patient journey can be isolating, often requiring patients to become their own healthcare advocate, stay informed about new research and treatments and educate clinicians with limited FND knowledge. A supportive and proactive GP can significantly improve the patient journey, and other specialists should not underestimate the value of such therapeutic relationships. GPs should be included in multidisciplinary teams and provided with opportunities for ongoing professional development.

Finding a knowledgeable and sympathetic GP can sometimes be challenging due to a myriad of factors. Patients living in regional and rural areas may have additional challenges due to difficulties in attracting and retaining GPs. In these cases, telehealth consultations with GPs who are more experienced in FND may provide a viable solution.

Consensus recommendations

Section 1: background on FND

Recommendations

Understanding the prevalence of stigma against people with FND is important in relating to patients with the condition. A positive environment in which patients are supported and have the opportunity to ask questions and understand their condition is a prerequisite to engagement in treatment.
Education about FND symptoms, diagnosis and management within a multidisciplinary context enables the best possible care for patients with a challenging and complex disorder.

Terminology

FND has been known by various names. The term 'functional' is preferred for its acceptability among patients, and positioning FND at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Patients with FND often experience scepticism and dismissal from healthcare providers, leading to a demoralising experience. Simply informing patients of their condition's name can be profoundly empowering. Communicating this offers reassurance in the context of a challenging condition. It is important to recognise that FND is not voluntary and is not factitious disorder (feigning symptoms) or malingering. Such misconceptions unfortunately persist among some healthcare professionals and contribute to the stigma that people with FND frequently experience.

Symptoms in FND

FND can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including dissociative attacks (also called functional seizures/dissociative seizures), gait problems, weakness, tremor, sensory disturbances, cognitive symptoms and swallow and communication difficulties. Patients often experience multiple symptoms simultaneously. Most symptoms tend to vary in intensity in proportion to symptom-focussed attention and to effort applied to overcoming them. Symptoms of FND frequently cause significant disability and often coexist with psychological comorbidities.

The most common symptom groups are:

Dissociative attacks: Involve altered movements, sensations and states of consciousness, which may resemble epileptic seizures.
Functional movement disorders: Abnormal movements or postures affecting body parts, presenting as tremors, dystonia, myoclonus, tics, spasms, gait disorders or weakness.
Sensory disorders: Often overlooked but can be significant symptoms impacting daily life, such as sensory illusions and visual symptoms.
Cognitive symptoms: Includes both specific, effort-dependent cognitive symptoms which predominantly affect memory, known as functional cognitive disorder (FCD), plus the near-universal symptom of 'brain-fog'.
Pain and fatigue: Frequently occur alongside other symptoms of FND, although in the absence of other functional symptoms, they are not regarded as FND.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^63eb34af]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Many patients with FND may present with chronic and disabling symptoms and chronicity has been suggested as a negative prognostic factor in FND. Clinicians need to consider these factors when crafting a treatment plan and set realistic expectations more focused on regaining function and reducing distress than on complete symptom remission. Liaising with patients' long-term community clinicians can be particularly beneficial to maximize recovery in the patient's own setting. Secondary gain must always be considered when outlining a treatment plan. Pending disability claims or litigation based on the functional symptom can create a conflict with a proposed treatment aimed at improving the symptom. In such circumstances, we recommend pausing either treatment or the claim process until either the claim is finalized or treatment is completed, respectively. For patients already receiving disability benefits, a clear conversation on treatment expectations and how it may affect (or not) existing benefits can pave the way to a more realistic outcome. When not yet disabled, accommodations, a slow and gradual return-to-work or return-to-school plan, or a time-limited leave are preferable than an indefinite leave.

### Recognising and managing functional neurological disorder in the acute healthcare setting [^20348a6e]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex and heterogenous condition characterised by abnormal neurological symptoms that are linked to structural and functional alterations in widely distributed brain networks. For many patients with FND, the emergency department (ED) is the first point of contact with the healthcare system. This review seeks to provide up-to-date FND diagnostic criteria to ED providers, with a focus on common FND subtypes. Furthermore, we summarise the appropriate management course for these patients. Proper recognition and management of FND at the time of initial presentation in the acute care setting has the potential to improve patient prognosis and reduce overall costs to the healthcare system.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^ea741b4f]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

It is now accepted that treatment for FND requires involvement of multiple disciplines. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by a neurologist and/or neuropsychiatrist, and treatment is delivered by a combination of disciplines that, depending on each case, may include mental health professionals (of different training background) and rehabilitation professionals (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, cognitive rehabilitation specialists). It is recommended to have other medical professionals involved in the patient's care as well as family, loved ones and community supports (work, school) understand the diagnosis and reinforce treatment participation. Clinicians involved in the patient's care but unfamiliar with FND should be introduced to the concept of FND and offered educational opportunities to learn more about it. Usually the patient's primary care physician (PCP) or the clinician who diagnosed FND should ensure that treatment engagement occurs and help correct any issues that may interfere with treatment participation. Family members skeptical about the diagnosis should openly review their doubts with the team, so that there is an opportunity for them to learn about FND, rather than to create doubt and limit treatment engagement and recovery. This coordination of care should occur with the patient's agreement and their active participation. Working together as a team to reinforce and not contradict the diagnosis and create a biopsychosocial formulation from an in-depth interview that includes targets for treatment based on psychiatric comorbidities, risk factors, personality functioning, cognitive abilities, and coping mechanisms, some of which may need to be addressed as maladaptive is essential.

Practical clinical considerations

Evidence-based treatments may not be readily available to all clinicians. Therefore, professionals who diagnose FND are challenged by limited treatment resources. Also, patient-related factors that signal readiness for treatment, mentioned in the section above (III a), need to be considered when developing an initial treatment plan.

Stepped care approaches recommend initial brief psychoeducational interventions, mostly delivered by neurologists, and to only progress to a full treatment course (of psychological or rehabilitation therapy or some combination thereof) if the psychoeducational treatments are not beneficial. Most treatment programs are outpatient-based and delivered over a time-limited period with once to three times per week encounters. In instances where it is logistically possible and clinically indicated, multidisciplinary intensive outpatient or inpatient short-term programs may be considered for those more symptomatic and disabled patients unable to benefit from a regular outpatient-based treatment. Addressing interfering comorbid conditions that limit engagement in treatment (active substance use, acute psychosis, acute suicidality, debilitating pain) needs to be prioritized and, if indicated, treatment for FND should be delayed until these conditions are better controlled.

Professionals who offer a different explanation for a functional neurological symptom (i.e. bringing suspicion that a well-documented F/DS "may be" epileptic) and who, at the same time, have a trusting connection with a patient, may do so many times with good intentions. In such circumstances, we recommend educating these professionals and ideally incorporating them into the treatment team to help reinforce the correct diagnosis to increase the likelihood of a good outcome.

There are many times when a definitive diagnosis of FND cannot be firmly established. For example, a description of a seizure semiology suggestive of F/DS but never witnessed or observed on a home video or captured during EEG, would only render a "possible" diagnosis of F/DS; or a described gait impairment may raise suspicion for functional etiology but the diagnosis may not be corroborated without eliciting the gait during a neurological exam or observing it on video. In such circumstances, if further diagnosis confirmation seems unfeasible and would inappropriately delay treatment, clinicians must be honest what their degree of confidence in the diagnosis is and offer treatment recommendations based on the 'presumed' diagnosis. Such approaches toward presumed diagnoses are in fact rather common in medical practice.

### Functional neurological disorder and placebo and nocebo effects: shared mechanisms [^7f3c7c6f]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterized by neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a structural neurological cause. Among the different aetiological models that have been proposed for FND, of note is the Bayesian predictive coding model, which posits that perception relies on top-down cortical predictions (priors) to infer the source of incoming sensory information. This model can also apply to non-pathological experiences, such as placebo and nocebo effects, wherein sensory information is shaped by prior expectations and learning. To date, most studies of the relationship between placebo and nocebo effects and FND have focused on the use of placebos for diagnosis and treatment of FND. Here, we propose that this relationship might go beyond diagnosis and therapy. We develop a framework in which shared cognitive, personality and neuroanatomical factors justify the consideration of a deeper link between FND and placebo and nocebo effects. This new perspective might offer guidance for clarification of the pathogenesis of FND and for the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

### Virtual reality in functional neurological disorder: a theoretical framework and research agenda for use in the real world [^597c7b7b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common and disabling condition at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry. Despite remarkable progress over recent decades, the mechanisms of FND are still poorly understood and there are limited diagnostic tools and effective treatments. One potentially promising treatment modality for FND is virtual reality (VR), which has been increasingly applied to a broad range of conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders. FND has unique features, many of which suggest the particular relevance for, and potential efficacy of, VR in both better understanding and managing the disorder. In this review, we describe how VR might be leveraged in the treatment and diagnosis of FND (with a primary focus on motor FND and persistent perceptual-postural dizziness given their prominence in the literature), as well as the elucidation of neurocognitive mechanisms and symptom phenomenology. First, we review what has been published to date on the applications of VR in FND and related neuropsychiatric disorders. We then discuss the hypothesised mechanism(s) underlying FND, focusing on the features that are most relevant to VR applications. Finally, we discuss the potential of VR in (1) advancing mechanistic understanding, focusing specifically on sense of agency, attention and suggestibility, (2) overcoming diagnostic challenges and (3) developing novel treatment modalities. This review aims to develop a theoretical foundation and research agenda for the use of VR in FND that might be applicable or adaptable to other related disorders.

### Pain and functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^14ace13e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is characterised by neurological symptoms, such as seizures and abnormal movements. Despite its significance to patients, the clinical features of chronic pain in people with FND, and of FND in people with chronic pain, have not been comprehensively studied.

Methods

We systematically reviewed PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO for studies of chronic pain in adults with FND and FND in patients with chronic pain. We described the proportions of patients reporting pain, pain rating and timing, pain-related diagnoses and responsiveness to treatment. We performed random effects meta-analyses of the proportions of patients with FND who reported pain or were diagnosed with pain-related disorders.

Results

Seven hundred and fifteen articles were screened and 64 were included in the analysis. Eight case–control studies of 3476 patients described pain symptoms in a higher proportion of patients with FND than controls with other neurological disorders. A random effects model of 30 cohorts found that an estimated 55% (95% CI 46% to 64%) of 4272 patients with FND reported pain. Random effects models estimated diagnoses of complex regional pain syndrome in 22% (95% CI 6% to 39%) of patients, irritable bowel syndrome in 16% (95% CI 9% to 24%) and fibromyalgia in 10% (95% CI 8% to 13%). Five studies of FND diagnoses among 361 patients with chronic pain were identified. Most interventions for FND did not ameliorate pain, even when other symptoms improved.

Conclusions

Pain symptoms and pain-related diagnoses are common in FND. Classification systems and treatments should routinely consider pain as a comorbidity in patients with FND.

### Functional neurological disorder in Europe: regional differences in education and health policy [^d6dec0ab]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of neurological disability and significant healthcare‐related expenditure, comparable to those of other chronic neurological disorders with similar symptoms.

FND has heterogeneous presentations including motor and sensory symptoms, seizures, cognitive symptoms and dizziness, that are characterized by the presence of one or more patterns of deficits consistent predominantly with dysfunction of the nervous system and variability (inconsistency) in performance within and between tasks.

Over the last decade, advances in FND research have led to a novel conceptualization of the disorder, new diagnostic principles and new treatment pathways. FND is increasingly acknowledged as a complex condition requiring an interdisciplinary (neurology/psychiatry/therapies) approach. The modern approach to FND recognizes the key role of neurologists not only in diagnosing FND but also in the initial management. Importantly, the diagnosis of FND should be based on the presence of positive signs, many of them phenotype‐specific. Promising evidence has accumulated for the efficacy of physiotherapy, psychotherapy or both in the management of FND, for most patients. However, despite these advances and that FND is a potentially treatable condition, there seem to be numerous barriers for people with FND to access early diagnosis and adequate treatment.

Several national and international surveys of neurologists from different countries regarding their knowledge and current practice in FND have confirmed that they still lack confidence in establishing the diagnosis and treating patients with FND. In a recent survey among French junior specialists, nearly half of them reported no instruction on FND; only a small fraction was familiar with the Hoover's sign, and the majority felt inadequately trained and informed about FND. In the United States, half of the neurology residents surveyed reported no instruction on treatment of functional seizures, 54% received no training on the utilization of interdisciplinary teams and 13% had no training on functional seizures whatsoever. These omissions in training have consequences. Delayed diagnosis and intervention can result in worse prognosis associated with disease chronicity, prolonged patient suffering and unnecessary medical consultations. According to an Italian study, an average diagnostic delay of 6.6 years correlates with high healthcare utilization costs and poor prognosis.

### Internet-based self-help randomized trial for motor functional neurologic disorder (SHIFT) [^7f0067f7]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether self-rated health of patients with motor functional neurologic disorder (FND) can be improved by unguided Internet-based self-help and education.

Methods

In this nonblinded randomized controlled trial, patients were allocated 1:1 unbiased to an unguided education and self-help website in addition to usual care or usual care only. Patients over 17 years of age with a functional motor symptom that caused distress or disability were included. The primary outcome was self-rated health on the Clinical Global Improvement scale at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were severity of motor symptoms, other physical and psychiatric symptoms, physical functioning, quality of life, work and social adjustment, illness beliefs, and satisfaction with care.

Results

A total of 186 patients were randomized, with a follow-up rate of 87% at 6 months. There was no difference in improvement of self-rated health at 3 months (44% vs 40%, p = 0.899) or 6 months (42% vs 43%, p = 0.435). Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups, with a threshold of p < 0.01. Satisfaction was high, with 86% of patients recommending the website to other patients.

Conclusion

We found no significant effect of the intervention added to usual care on self-rated health or secondary outcome measures, despite high patient satisfaction with the intervention. These results suggest that online education and nonguided self-help could be valuable additions to stepped care for motor FND, but are not effective treatments as interventions in their own right.

Clinicaltrialsgov Identifier

NCT02589886.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with motor FND, online education and self-help intervention does not significantly improve self-rated health.

### Qualitative systematic review on the lived experience of functional neurological disorder [^3df605f0]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a complex disorder, recently attracting much research into aetiology and treatment. However, there is limited research on the patient's lived experience. This paper addresses this gap to ask: 'What is the subjective life experience of adult patients living with FND?'

Methods

From 1980 to 2020, Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, CINAHL and Embase were searched for English language qualitative adult research. The disciplines used general medicine, psychiatry, physiotherapy, nursing, neurology, psychosomatic medicine and occupational therapy. The qualitative literature search included book chapters, theses, fellowship reports and conference articles as well as peer-reviewed scientific journals. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool was used to assess 33 papers, with eight papers included in the final synthesis. Nine additional papers, suggested during review, were evaluated but excluded from synthesis, though incorporated elsewhere in the paper. Two authors used an integrative immersion approach to identify the literature's main themes using line-by-line and top-down methods.

Results

Eight main themes were identified: lost, body-mind dualism, preceding stressful events, relatedness, stigma, the battle or fight, the burden and losses of the illness and trust versus mistrust. From these emerged a central overarching theme of relationally regulated selves, which posits the essence of the lived experience of FND as responding to stressful experiences within a relational, regulatory context.

Conclusions

The prevalent themes give valuable insight into the lived experience of FND and the impact of stressors, past and present, and the relational environment in the development of and recovery from the disorder. Further research is needed to support the formulation of the patient experience and cocreated recovery pathways.

### Routine outcomes and evaluation of an 8-week outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitative therapy program for functional neurological disorder [^d38ba08a]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to genuinely experienced neurological symptoms that cause significant distress or disruption, without evidence of an underlying neurological, psychiatric or other medical explanation. FND has an estimated incidence of 4–12 per 100,000 population per year, with women representing 60–75% of the FND population. Functional symptoms are amongst the most common presentations in neurology outpatient settings, at approximately 15–16% of patients seen. FND can include multiple symptom domains, the core of which relate to motor function, weakness or paralysis, sensory disturbances, and episodes of altered awareness. Broader spectrum physical symptoms are common, as are accompanying psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and dissociative symptoms.

Individuals with FND tend to display high levels of disability and significant impairment in daily functioning. FND can also be challenging to diagnose, as the symptoms can mimic those of other neurological disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease; multiple investigations are often required. Individuals with FND, therefore, may undergo various medical procedures and wait a significant time prior to diagnosis, with a reported diagnostic delay in functional seizures (FS) of around seven years. The economic costs of healthcare resource use in FND are significant and comparable to other major neurological disorders. However, at present, widely agreed etiological explanations remain elusive, and there is no clear consensus on the most effective treatment approach.

### The current state of pediatric functional neurological disorder treatment in the United States [^1e80f35c]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are common but grossly under-researched. This survey study aims to define the current landscape of pediatric FND treatment in the United States, identifying treatment programs, care team composition, treatment approaches, and aftercare management.

Methods

The Functional Neurological Disorder Society (FNDS) Pediatric Special Interest Group (SIG), a diverse set of clinician and caregiver stakeholders, collected information on available treatment programs in the United States via survey. Current programs were identified through the FNDS Pediatric SIG and FND Hope's provider registry.

Results

Thirty-nine care team members from 24 health care centers yielded 31 unique FND treatment settings. Centers existed in 16 states, concentrated in the Midwest and Southern regions. Outpatient settings (62%) were more prevalent than inpatient. A psychologist (PhD/PsyD) was the most common clinician (52%) with dedicated time to treat FNDs. Most settings accepted ages six to 21 (55%) and treated all FND symptoms (77%). A spectrum of treatment approaches was endorsed with the most common being cognitive behavioral therapy (77%) and personalized approaches (58%). A biopsychosocial approach was evident, with most settings reporting active involvement with school (97%) and caregivers (94%). Most settings (74%) encouraged treatment re-engagement when needed with no strict time limits. All respondents provided aftercare recommendations or referrals.

Conclusions

Pediatric FND treatment is available across the United States, but there is high variability in care team membership, treatment approach, and aftercare management. Future research is necessary to develop effective and sustainable treatment to improve access for this population.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations [^40cb87c5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND or conversion disorder) is defined by motor and sensory symptoms (eg, tremor, dystonia, limb weakness, numbness and seizures) that demonstrate clinical features incompatible with other neurological/medical diagnoses and that are associated with significant distress and functional impairment. Until recently, there were few controlled treatment trials and little research effort into outcome measurement in FND. However, there has been a marked increase in the number and quality of intervention studies, so it is now critical to optimise outcome measures for this population, to facilitate comparison of the effectiveness and efficacy of different treatment modalities for specific FND symptoms.

FND has features that make decisions regarding outcome measurement particularly complex. These include heterogeneity and variability of symptoms and the marked influence of attention, beliefs and expectations. Discrepancy between objective measures and patients' subjective experiences of symptoms can also be a prominent feature. These aspects of FND potentially make objective 'snapshot' measures (eg, clinician-rated scales and objective performance tests) less reliable and valid. They also suggest that patient-rated outcomes may be particularly meaningful in this population.

A wide range of additional physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal and urological problems) are common in people with FND, typically associated with reduced quality of life and greater disability. More generally, elevated physical symptom burden is associated with significant disability, role impairments and high healthcare use. Many individuals with FND report significant psychological symptoms/comorbidity (eg, anxiety, depression and dissociation), potentially unhelpful coping behaviours and illness beliefs, and altered emotional processing, which are associated with symptom severity, poorer outcomes and diminished quality of life. These factors, therefore, may be particularly relevant to psychosocial outcomes in FND.

There is clearly a wide range of outcome domains relevant to FND, and a key challenge is to determine which are most important to capture. In evidence-based medicine, there has been an increasing emphasis on consistency in outcome measurement and the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET,) initiative facilitates the development of core outcome measure sets across a range of physical and mental health disorders. The COMET collaboration recommends five key outcome domains, including core physiological/clinical symptoms, life impact (ie, quality of life, functioning or participation and subjective health perception), resource use (health and social), adverse events and mortality. Another initiative, supported by the National Institutes of Health, involves development of 'common data elements', which currently includes core measures for neurological disorders.

Nine additional papers, suggested during review, were evaluated but excluded from synthesis, though incorporated elsewhere in the paper. Two authors used an integrative immersion approach to identify the literature's main themes using line-by-line and top-down methods.

Results

Eight main themes were identified: lost, body–mind dualism, preceding stressful events, relatedness, stigma, the battle or fight, the burden and losses of the illness and trust versus mistrust. From these emerged a central overarching theme of relationally regulated selves, which posits the essence of the lived experience of FND as responding to stressful experiences within a relational, regulatory context.

Conclusions

The prevalent themes give valuable insight into the lived experience of FND and the impact of stressors, past and present, and the relational environment in the development of and recovery from the disorder. Further research is needed to support the formulation of the patient experience and cocreated recovery pathways.

FND and the NDIS

Accessing support for people with FND from the NDIS presents challenges due to the condition's variable nature and uncertain prognosis, particularly surrounding access criteria where a person's impairment needs to be deemed permanent. This scheme is unique to Australia. A second concern is that the change from rehabilitative treatment to disability support can contribute to the perpetuation of symptoms. Furthermore, NDIS decision-makers lack medical expertise and have limited knowledge of FND. Successful funding applications typically require specialist reviews and comprehensive multidisciplinary documentation.

While FND is not an acknowledged condition by the NDIS, funding may be accessible for chronic, refractory cases where there is significant psychosocial disability. The DSM-5-TR (Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision) criteria classify the condition as persistent if symptoms are occurring for 6 months or more. Collaboration within the multidisciplinary team is crucial, with documentation detailing that evidence-based treatment has finished and has not led to a substantial improvement in the person's functional capacity. Documenting subjective and objective measures over multiple time points can be used to demonstrate a long-term and permanent pattern of disability impacting on the person's functional capacity, ability to work, study or participate in social life.

### Functional gait disorders: a sign-based approach [^3ce078b2]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional gait disorders are both common and disabling. Depending on the clinical setting, 2%–20% of patients referred to movement disorders outpatient clinics have a functional movement disorder, and 40% of these patients have gait abnormalities without a structural lesion. It is important to timely recognize the features of a functional gait as approximately 12% of patients across all neurologic disease categories have a functional overlay. However, many clinicians find these functional gait disorders difficult to diagnose. They are often seen together with other functional movement disorders, although pure functional gait disorders occur in approximately 6%–8.5% of patients with functional neurologic disorders. When present together with other functional signs, proper recognition of a functional gait pattern is often very helpful in establishing the functional nature of the overall presentation, particularly when this is less obvious from the other neurologic signs.

For several reasons, the term functional gait disorder is preferred over psychogenic gait disorder. First, psychological distress is not always evident, and functional gait disorders are often diagnosed in the absence of obvious precipitating stressors. Indeed, psychological stressors are now considered only as risk factors and not as essential causative triggers. Second, because acceptance of the diagnosis is essential for successful treatment, the more descriptive term functional gait disorders is preferred over psychogenic gait disorder, which has a negative connotation for many patients. For these reasons, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM-V) now uses the term Functional Neurological Symptom Disorders instead of Psychogenic Neurological Disorders. Moreover, the DSM-V diagnosis no longer relies on the presence of obvious psychological stressors. Importantly, functional neurologic symptoms (including functional gait disorders) are not thought to be produced intentionally and are therefore distinct from malingering and factitious disorder.

Several reviews have described the clinical phenomenology and treatment of functional movement disorders, but these only touched briefly on the spectrum and diagnosis of functional gait disorders. In this video-illustrated review, we describe a practical sign-based approach to functional gait disorders, aiming to improve the diagnostic process in daily clinical practice.

Future directions

It would be beneficial to conduct further studies into the efficacy of outpatient MDT treatment for FND in controlled trials, with our initial findings serving as a positive indication of prospective findings. Further studies with different designs are also warranted to assess which components of the program led to which gains. Despite being unable to discount the influence of extraneous factors and possible selection biases, these initial findings offer ecological validity as they reflect outcomes of an intervention provided in a naturalistic setting, offering insights into potential real-world benefits to patients. Inclusion of an additional follow-up session, i.e. at 6 or 12 months, would allow us to assess whether improvements were sustained in the long-term.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^1821e264]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and setting up FND care pathways

FND is a heterogenous disorder, which requires careful assessment, open and holistic discussion of diagnosis and individualized therapy. As evidence emerges for various treatment options, it becomes more necessary to develop a strategy to allow patients to appropriately access the healthcare system. A stepped care model has been proposed in Scotland, outlining when patients may be managed by general practitioners and when patients should be referred to general neurology, specialized therapists or subspecialist neurologists, thus allowing for the most appropriate usage of limited resources. Currently, specialist FND clinics are rare in most healthcare systems, but hopefully will become more common, improving access for complex patients requiring interdisciplinary care.

Evidence for how best to structure an FND clinic is lacking in the literature, but it seems reasonable to consider a model similar to that of other complex-care clinics, emphasizing an interdisciplinary approach, with each involved discipline offering their own expertise in patient care (Fig. 1). Necessary elements include a thorough initial assessment, a robust triage system for referral to appropriate treatment (physical therapies, psychiatry, clinical psychology, day patient or inpatient rehabilitation) and follow-up. In one example of a clinic structure for functional movement disorders, patients attend a half-day clinic where they are assessed by a movement disorders specialist, psychologist, physical therapist and social worker, who then together discuss a plan for treatment with the patient. Such a service can only work, however, if general neurologists, primary care physicians and community rehabilitation services continue to manage and follow a proportion of people with FND, in particular those with milder symptoms and those with chronic symptoms despite treatment, who are unlikely to improve in the long term.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^91121b89]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based treatment

The current evidence primarily favors the use of psychological and rehabilitative therapies for the treatment of FND. Which therapy or combination of therapies are offered will not only depend on the phenotypic presentation (i.e. F/DS is usually addressed through skills-based psychotherapy while a functional gait is initially addressed with physical therapy), but also on prior response to treatment (if any) and patient's ability to meaningfully engage.

Psychological therapies remain the most studied form of treatment in FND. Previous meta-analyses show that both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based and psychodynamic approaches provide medium-sized benefits for physical (functional neurological) symptoms, mental health, well-being, functioning and resource use. While the outcomes are comparable between these two main psychotherapy modalities, psychodynamic trials lacked controlled studies.

Many manualized psychotherapy approaches have been investigated in FND, some of which have been published. These include CBT, mindfulness-based psychotherapy, prolonged exposure, and multi-modality neurobehavior therapy. One explanatory model in these treatment modalities is that F/DS represent a dissociative reaction to hyperarousal, which occurs in the context of certain psychological characteristics (avoidance tendencies, somatization, emotion dysregulation) that inform symptom development. In the case of CBT and related approaches, the goal of the intervention is to gradually expose patients to their feared or avoided emotion or activities and to change their thinking style regarding symptoms or associated phenomena. Specific treatment protocols offer variations on this theme. Manualized psychotherapies are time-limited (usually 12–15 sessions) and most offer a certain degree of flexibility to adapt to the patient's specific clinical background. Other psychotherapy approaches such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), hypnotherapy, group psychotherapy have been explored and documented to be beneficial.

### Treatment outcomes in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the influence of symptom chronicity [^5a42a1cb]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Implications of this review for approaching FND treatment

This review clarifies the influence of symptom chronicity on FND treatment outcomes, with practical implications for clinical care. When counselling patients regarding treatment expectations, clinicians may consider symptom duration when discussing prognosis, but it should not be regarded as determinative of treatment responsiveness. Positive global impressions of change and improvements in mental HrQoL were attainable even in chronic cases, challenging a long-held view that chronic FND patients are inherently treatment-resistant. Gains in motor recovery and physical function were modestly moderated by symptom duration, and clinicians can use this information to frame prognosis in a realistic but hopeful manner.

The findings of this review may have implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of FND. While this is speculative, treatment responsiveness even in chronic cases may reflect an underlying plasticity for functional reorganisation of networks governing attention, expectation and interoception. Rehabilitative interventions, particularly physiotherapy and CBT, may be recalibrating maladaptive attentional and perceptual processes and encouraging self-agency.

These results lead to two complementary conclusions. First, they highlight the urgency of a timely diagnosis and treatment as there is a mild reduction in treatment effectiveness with increasing symptom chronicity. Second, it is encouraging that offering treatment to people with extended symptom durations still yields clinically meaningful improvements across a range of outcomes, cautioning against therapeutic nihilism. There is a need for greater resource and treatment availability to harness the greater likelihood of favourable outcomes earlier in the disease course. The relatively small reduction in treatment effectiveness over time, however, is arguably insufficient to favour treatment of people with symptoms of more recent onset over those with more chronic symptoms. Overall, more treatment is needed, rather than treatment emphasis on select patient subgroups, as many can still benefit from intervention after experiencing symptoms for a long time.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^c452dedf]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Troubleshooting common multidisciplinary challenges

Not all patients with FND benefit from allied health support to optimise their function. Effective therapy is usually contingent on a clear diagnosis, patient receptiveness to the diagnosis, and willingness to participate in therapy.

Assistive devices are generally not recommended during the acute phase of rehabilitation due to the risk of reinforcing symptoms, but these considerations should be balanced against patient safety, as injuries from falls do occur in people with FND. When necessary, such devices should be considered short-term solutions, with plans to progress from their use with treatment.

Diagnosing and managing FND typically requires multidisciplinary collaboration. All health professionals involved can observe target symptoms, report positive signs and engage the multidisciplinary team in assessment and management. In acute settings, this includes paramedics, triage nurses and emergency department (ED) staff. FND patients may come with a history of clinical disbelief. ED staff have a significant role to play, not only in assessing physical symptoms, but in assuring the patient that they believe what they are saying about their illness. This positive approach can be life-changing for the patient, giving them the best chance of early improvement.

In community settings, collaboration with GPs, physiotherapists and other allied health professionals is crucial for comprehensive care. Even without a definitive diagnosis, applying FND treatment approaches can be beneficial for people where FND is a leading differential diagnosis for their symptoms.

Effective communication and patient education on symptom management enhance treatment acceptance and engagement. Multidisciplinary team meetings are helpful for addressing arising concerns and care planning. Collaboration with experienced therapists and professional societies offers additional support and training. Discharge from multidisciplinary services should focus on self-management, with clear information on resources, goals and follow-up plans. Ensuring patients are equipped with self-management skills is essential, as relapses are common.

### Treatment outcomes in the inpatient management of severe functional neurological disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^6feab946]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a heterogeneous condition; severe forms can be disabling. Multidisciplinary treatment and rehabilitation are recommended for severe FND, but there remains a lack of evidence for its efficacy and lack of understanding of the predictors and components of recovery.

Methods

We report clinical outcome data for an inpatient cohort with severe FND. Clinical Global Impression Improvement with treatment is the primary outcome measure. Admission and discharge measures (Euroqol quality of life measures, Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire (Revised) and Functional Mobility Scale) are reported as secondary outcomes.

Results

We describe an FND cohort (n = 52) with chronic illness (mean symptom duration 9.7 years). At admission, there were clinically relevant levels of depression, anxiety and depersonalisation derealisation. At the time of discharge, most (43/52) patients' global condition had improved. Measures of mobility, depression and quality of life also significantly improved while at discharge, symptoms were experienced as more understandable and less distressing than at admission. An admission measure of patient confidence in treatment was predictive of eventual clinical outcome.

Conclusions

The most frequent outcome of inpatient rehabilitation is global improvement, even when symptoms are chronic and severe, reflected in measurable changes in both physical and psychological functioning. Significant levels of depersonalisation derealisation seen in this patient group suggest that routine enquiry into such experiences could help personalise FND treatment approaches. Patient confidence in treatment is key in determining clinical outcomes.

### The vicious cycle of functional neurological disorders: a synthesis of healthcare professionals' views on working with patients with functional neurological disorder [^e0e0d53d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this review was to synthesise studies which address the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards patients with functional neurological disorder (FND).

Methods

An interpretive systematised review was conducted. Seven databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsychINFO, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health, and Scopus). Qualitative studies and those using survey methods were included. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used to identify concepts from the data and to synthesise the results.

Results

The views of 2769 HCPs were represented in 11 included articles. The overarching theme across the articles was uncertainty: about making the diagnosis of FND, about professional roles, and about optimum management. Fear was also a common theme: of saying the wrong thing, of offending patients, or of breaking the therapeutic relationship.

Conclusions

If all HCPs felt uncertain about how to manage patients with FND and avoided them by passing them on to another discipline, then a "vicious cycle" is formed in which patients are passed from one professional to another but without receiving clear, honest information, or effective treatment. HCPs would benefit from increased training on FND and clear clinical pathways to alleviate feelings of uncertainty. Implications for rehabilitationEvidence-based or, at the very least, consensus-based multi-disciplinary care pathways for the assessment and treatment of patients with functional neurological disorder are required to improve equitability of services. Training packages for healthcare professionals need to be developed, evaluated and implemented in order to improve confidence of making and explaining the diagnosis and to reduce stigma of functional neurological disorders. Improved input for patients with functional neurological disorder is likely to occur if healthcare professionals are open, honest and use effective communication skills, both with their patients and fellow healthcare professionals.

Prognosis

Untreated, the prognosis of FND is often poor, but it can be significantly improved with treatment. People with dissociative attacks achieve remission in 30%–50% of cases. In children, recovery rates are higher, with approximately 70% achieving seizure remission. Unfortunately, the lack of funding for treatment and skilled providers to deliver it means that the majority of people in Australia with FND are currently unable to access adequate evidence-based treatment.

Section 2: assessment and diagnosis

Recommendations

The diagnosis of FND should rely on positive signs demonstrating fluctuation of symptoms with changes in symptom-focussed attention and/or effort to overcome the symptoms, incongruence with key features of non-functional diseases or both.
FND is a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. If positive features of FND are present on assessment, the diagnosis can be made with confidence and may not require further investigations.
Generally, a diagnosis of FND should be made by a neurologist, ideally with specific interest in this area.

In making a formulation of any given FND presentation for the purposes of treatment, a broad person-centred approach based on a biopsychosocial model is essential to understand the complexity and individual variability of FND. Several interacting biological, psychological and social factors can influence vulnerabilities, triggers and perpetuating factors that contribute to FND as outlined in table 1.

Table 1
The biopsychosocial model with potential factors that may contribute to FND (adapted from Nielsen et al)

Assessment

Clinicians should base the diagnosis of FND on positive signs demonstrating fluctuation of symptoms with changes in symptom-focussed attention or effort to overcome the symptoms, incongruence with key features of non-functional diseases, or both. Examples include:

Physical signs demonstrating inconsistency between impaired voluntary movement and intact automatic movement, for example, Hoover's sign in functional lower limb weakness or entrainment in functional tremor.
Attacks with an appearance typical for a dissociative attack which have no EEG correlation.
Memory difficulties which are much worse on direct testing of memory than when (automatically) recalling details in conversation.

Diagnostic approach

Neurologists, particularly those with relevant expertise, are ideally positioned to diagnose FND, although other specialists can also accurately diagnose the disorder. Misdiagnosis is rare when handled by skilled professionals, but it should be noted that FND can frequently coexist with non-functional disorders, and structural conditions often trigger FND. Clinicians should remain alert to features that would suggest a second, admixed, diagnosis (eg, epilepsy and dissociative attacks).

### Antidepressants for the treatment of depression in neurological disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^4c52fce8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high prevalence of depression in people with neurological disorders, no previous study has sought to summarise existing evidence on the use of antidepressants in this population. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to determine whether antidepressants are more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression in neurological disorders, and whether any benefit is associated with improvement in function.

Methods

Embase, Pubmed, Psycinfo and Cochrane trial registers were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of antidepressant and placebo in the treatment of depression in adults with a neurological disorder.

Findings

20 RCTs were included in the review, including patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, epilepsy and stroke. Outcomes were analysed at four time points: 4–5 weeks, 6–8 weeks, 9–18 weeks and > 18 weeks. The primary outcome was response to treatment at 6–8 weeks. The evidence favoured the use of antidepressants over placebo at all time points although pooled results were not statistically significant at all time points. At 6–8 weeks, antidepressant treatment was associated with a greater than twofold odds of remission (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.54 to 3.23; number needed to treat = 7). Fewer data were available for quality of life, and functional and cognitive outcomes, and there was little evidence of improvement with antidepressant treatment.

Interpretation

Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression in patients with neurological disorders but the evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants in improving quality of life, and functional and cognitive outcomes is inconclusive.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^9e53f776]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Management

From explanation of diagnosis to engagement in treatment

Communication is the most common procedure in medicine and the skill that is critical for explaining what is happening for the patient to understand. If poorly delivered, patients are likely to seek more consultations or feel further stigmatized by the health system and not seek treatment.

As soon as there is reasonable suspicion of an FND diagnosis based on history and exam, this should be mentioned to patients. This early approach can prevent the news of the diagnosis from becoming an unwelcome surprise later and allows patients and loved ones to become accustomed to the usually unfamiliar concept of FND.

Existing communication protocols in FND, most developed specifically for functional/dissociative seizures (F/DS), review specific points that should be shared with patients when the diagnosis is explained for the first time. Adding a neuroscience-informed explanation of FND, that takes into account psychological risk factors can assist clinicians in the diagnosis delivery and may help dispense clinicians with the dichotomy of neurobiological and psychological processes. Many patients resist psychological explanations and may feel blamed if only a psychological explanation is provided for their diagnosis. It is important to tell patients what their diagnosis is, and not what it is not. Table 3 lists elements to be considered when delivering a diagnosis of FND, with a sample script for functional weakness.

Table 3
Elements to be covered during initial communication of diagnosis of FND with sample script for functional weakness in right lower extremity.

Beyond the content of the discussion, an empathic and caring attitude which uses a trauma-informed care approach is of critical importance in fostering a positive therapeutic relationship. Eliciting concerns about the clinician's explanation of diagnosis so that patients can ask questions for improved understanding is helpful. Patients may not agree with the diagnosis which signals a greater likelihood of them not following the recommended treatment, so allowing them time to come back and rediscuss with other supports is helpful as this is a process that can take time and should not be rushed. In addition to explaining the disorder to the patient, there is often a need to educate others who are involved in helping the patient, including family supports, primary care providers, therapists, other specialists, or roommates.

### Economic cost of functional neurologic disorders: a systematic review [^9ed36074]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

These costs carry a burden to patients, clinicians, and health care systems and to the economy. Indeed, patients with FND have been found to be more likely to not be working for health reasons and more likely to be receiving disability-related state financial benefits than people with other neurologic disorders.

Various treatments such as physiotherapyor cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)can lead to improvement of these symptoms and QoL. Of importance, an intervention of simply providing the patient with an accurate diagnosis, and thus explanation of their symptoms, can also improve mood and QoLand decrease health care resource utilization.

The costs of FND (and other medical conditions) can be believed of as direct and indirect costs. Direct costs represent resources used for health care (e.g. cost of investigations or the time spent on assessment by a doctor), while indirect costs represent productivity losses arising from morbidity-related sickness absence (e.g. loss of employment, benefits, or the cost of childcare while hospitalized). Direct and indirect costs together constitute the economic burden of FND, which can be quantified through cost-of-illness (COI) studies. A COI study can use a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Bottom-up methods estimate costs based on data from records (or observed usage) at the service provider level, whereas top-down approaches use administrative registers of costs.

Other studies of health care utilization focus on economic evaluation (EE). There are different types of EEs: cost-minimization analyses address the question of whether an intervention would result in lower health care costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses combine costs and clinical parameters, such as gained life years or recovered cases, to assess whether the intervention is cost-effective. Cost-utility analyses use quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as their measure of effectiveness. QALYs attempt to quantify the impact of the patient's condition on the quality and quantity of life lived. Typically, cost-effectiveness analyses use the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is a measure of the additional cost per unit of health gained. Whereas COI presents information only on the economic burden of a disease, EE can assist decision makers to decide toward which interventions to prioritize resources.

Given the reportedly high burden FND places on patients and society, we aimed to systematically review the health economic literature on FND. Our objectives were as follows:
to investigate the direct and indirect costs of FNDs and
to investigate whether any interventions to treat FNDs are cost-effective.

Neurodegenerative diseases impact more than 6 million Americans, and current predictions estimate the rates of neurodegenerative diseases will double in the next 30 years. These diseases are progressive with increasing loss of brain function throughout their course. Overtime, those suffering from neurodegenerative diseases will lose their ability to work and function efficiently in society. Families and society are burdened with skyrocketing costs to provide care for those who are unable to perform activities of daily living. There is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies to both reduce the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and to delay the progression of the disease.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^8e03f2a2]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In terms of pharmacologic therapy, there are no specific medications shown to be effective in treating functional seizures. Instead, it is recommended to assess for and treat co-existing psychiatric disorders on an individual basis, as well as to discontinue antiepileptic therapy in patients without comorbid epilepsy. Specifically, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders have been reported at high rates in patients with functional seizures and should be treated if present. One randomized clinical trial demonstrated a significant reduction of functional seizure frequency for patients treated with both CBT and sertraline (59%), as well as with CBT alone (51%), while sertraline alone did not significantly reduce seizure frequency (27%). Worth noting is that the CBT only group reported a greater improvement of secondary outcomes (quality of life, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, impulsivity and psychosocial functioning) as compared to CBT plus sertraline, perhaps owing to medication adverse effects in a somatically-focused population of patients.

### Can repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increase muscle strength in functional neurological paresis? A proof-of-principle study [^aa9b26fe]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Therapeutic options are limited in functional neurological paresis disorder. Earlier intervention studies did not control for a placebo effect, hampering assessment of effectivity. A proof-of-principle investigation was conducted into the therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), using a single-blind two-period placebo-controlled cross-over design.

Methods

Eleven patients received active 15 Hz rTMS over the contralateral motor cortex (hand area), in two periods of 5 days, for 30 min once a day at 80% of resting motor threshold, with a train length of 2 s and an intertrain interval of 4 s. Eight of these eleven patients were also included in the placebo treatment condition. Primary outcome measure was change in muscle strength as measured by dynamometry after treatment. Secondary outcome measure was the subjective change in muscle strength after treatment.

Results

In patients who received both treatments, active rTMS induced a significantly larger median increase in objectively measured muscle strength (24%) compared to placebo rTMS (6%; P < 0.04). Subjective ratings showed no difference due to treatment, i.e. patients did not perceive these objectively measured motor improvements (P = 0.40).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that rTMS by itself can potentially improve muscle weakness in functional neurological paresis disorder. Whereas patients' muscle strength increased as measured with dynamometry, patients did not report increased functioning of the affected hand, subjectively. The results may indicate that decreased muscle strength is not the core symptom and that rTMS should be added to behavioral approaches in functional neurological paresis.

### Specialist physiotherapy for functional motor disorder in england and scotland (physio4FMD): a pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial [^3320c2e2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Functional motor disorder-the motor variant of functional neurological disorder-is a disabling condition that is commonly associated with poor health outcomes. Pathophysiological models have inspired new treatment approaches such as specialist physiotherapy, although evidence from large randomised controlled trials is absent. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of a specialist physiotherapy intervention for functional motor disorder compared with treatment as usual.

Methods

In this pragmatic, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 11 hospitals in England and Scotland, adults with a clinically definite diagnosis of functional motor disorder, diagnosed by a neurologist, were included. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by site) using a remote web-based application to either specialist physiotherapy (a protocolised intervention of nine sessions plus follow-up) or treatment as usual (referral to local community neurological physiotherapy). Individuals working on data collection and analysis were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the physical functioning domain of the 36-item short form health questionnaire (SF36) at 12 months after randomisation. The primary analysis followed a modified intention-to-treat principle, using a complete case approach; participants who were unable to receive their randomised treatment due to the suspension of health-care services during the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded from the primary analysis. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN56136713, and is completed.

Findings

Recruitment occurred between Oct 19, 2018, and March 11, 2020, pausing during the COVID-19 lockdown, and resuming from Aug 3, 2021, to Jan 31, 2022. Of 355 participants who were enrolled, 179 were randomly assigned to specialist physiotherapy and 176 to treatment as usual. 89 participants were excluded from the primary analysis due to COVID-19 interruption to treatment (27 were assigned to specialist physiotherapy and 62 to treatment as usual). After accounting for withdrawals (n = 11) and loss to follow-up (n = 14), the primary analysis included data from 241 participants (138 [91%] assigned specialist physiotherapy and 103 [90%] assigned treatment as usual). Physical functioning, as assessed by SF36, did not differ significantly between groups (adjusted mean difference 3·5, 95% CI -2·3 to 9·3; p = 0·23). There were no serious adverse events related to the trial interventions. 35 serious adverse events were recorded in the specialist physiotherapy group by 24 participants (17·0%), and 24 serious adverse events were recorded in the treatment as usual group by 18 participants (17·0%); one death occurred in the specialist physiotherapy group (cause of death was recorded as suicide). All were considered unrelated to specialist physiotherapy.

Interpretation

Although more participants who were assigned specialist physiotherapy self-rated their motor symptoms as improved and had better scores on subjective measures of mental health, the intervention did not result in better self-reported physical functioning at 12 months. Both the specialist and community neurological physiotherapy appeared to be a safe and a valued treatment for selected patients with functional motor disorder. Future research should continue to refine interventions for people with functional motor disorder and develop evidence-based methods to guide treatment triage decisions.

### A therapy-led, multidisciplinary programme for treatment-resistant functional fixed dystonia [^604b1fd9]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) describes various neurological symptoms that are not explained by an organic aetiology. The condition has a poor prognosis. Despite this, there is sparse research that informs clinical interventions for FND, particularly when treating functional fixed dystonia. Our article has outlined an intervention for a patient with a treatment-resistant functional fixed dystonia that was informed by a biopsychosocial model, which aimed to rehabilitate the patient's functional motor symptoms. This led to favourable outcomes including restoring full range of movement in the patient's right foot and improvements in routine outcome measurement scores. The patient also described the programme as life-changing and was able to re-engage in meaningful and purposeful activities.

### Opinion, knowledge, and clinical experience with functional neurological disorders among Italian neurologists: results from an online survey [^3539250c]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurologists need to understand the evidence on emerging therapeutic options for this complex disorder. A multidisciplinary approach is now widely recommended, in which neurologists, psychotherapist, psychiatrists and physiotherapists are needed to improve patient care. As in our previous study involving general practitioners, physiotherapy was rated lower than other management strategies. Physiotherapy remains underrecognized as a valuable approach to FND not only among general practitioners but also among neurologists. Recent evidence suggests that physiotherapy is useful for patients with functional motor disorders, which is one of the most common phenotypes of FND. Moreover, psychiatric intervention needs to be taken into account. Recent studies suggest that psychological and psychiatric interventions should be regarded as pivotal, given the evidence that the beneficial effects of other treatments, like physiotherapy, might be lost in the long term. Our findings indicate that a better understanding of how different therapeutic options work for FND is needed to improve care for patients with the condition. A purely pharmacological approach was considered to be of limited efficacy for treating FND and medication prescription was rarely the first intervention.

Another observation is that in their first intervention the respondents would order diagnostic or imaging studies to exclude neurological damage. This is in line with previous studies, in which neurological investigations (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging) were frequently requested for a diagnosis of FND. Such investigations often produce negative results in FND patients and do not aid greatly in diagnosis. Differently, ad hoc neurological examination will usually catch positive clinical signs typical of FND. Professional education in this area could improve confidence about diagnosis, thus reducing unnecessary ordering of additional investigations.

As reported in a more recent study involving neurologists with expertise in movement disorders, when asked about their role in patient management, the majority of respondents selected more than one option, suggesting that they take an active role in caring for their patients. According to recent recommendations on diagnosis, the majority of neurologists believe they have a multifaceted role: to establish a diagnosis, to suggest appropriate treatment, and to accompany their patients on the therapeutic pathway in collaboration with other health professionals (e.g. psychotherapists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists). The respondents stated that they preferred a multidisciplinary approach to the disorder and that they had a role in the diagnosis and management of the disorder.

### Pain and functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cbe2cd6a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important that effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatment approaches are identified for patients with FND. Clinical trials for people with FND could include treatments and outcomes focused on pain and other comorbidities, rather than focusing entirely on conventional FND symptoms. This could also involve validation of pain scoring tools in order to standardise their use. In particular, further evidence is needed to establish the effectiveness of specialised interdisciplinary pain programmes for patients with FND.

More generally, there is a lack of high-quality literature on the role of multidisciplinary care for patients with pain and FND. In addition to studies which described the pain characteristics of patients with FND, we identified a small number of papers from 1986 to 2003 which quantified diagnoses of FND and non-dermatomal sensory abnormalities in specialised pain clinics. A recent study from our own group, which was published after our search was conducted, described FND diagnoses in 17% of 190 patients attending a regional chronic pain service and undiagnosed neurological symptoms in a further 6%. In addition, patients with comorbid FND were more likely to have a chronic primary pain disorder, such as fibromyalgia. These data suggest there is a significant overlap between the FND and chronic pain populations and indicate a potential role for the integration of pain management techniques and services in the treatment of certain patients with FND.

### Physiotherapy and CBT for functional movement disorders… [^d7527b8a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Results show that multidisciplinary treatment effectively improves symptoms and physical aspects of the quality of life of patients with functional movement disorders against nondirected psychological support and education; this improvement seems to be driven by changes in mobility and pain domains. Importance Functional movement disorders are frequent and disabling neurological disorders with a substantial socioeconomic impact. Few randomized studies have analyzed the effectiveness of combined physiotherapy and psychotherapy in patients' quality of life. Conclusions and Relevance Results show that multidisciplinary treatment effectively improves FMD symptoms and physical aspects of patients' quality of life. Further studies must be performed to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of this approach in FMD. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05634486.

these advances, psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and specialized physiotherapy have been explored for patients with FND, showing positive results in certain groups of patients. 10–18 Despite the relative relevance of psychological therapies, their effectiveness has been scarcely explored systematically so far, and relevant methodological limitations characterize the studies carried out.
19. Additionally, it has been pointed out that specialized physiotherapy could significantly improve FMD symptoms. 20 Cohort studies11, 21–23 and a randomized feasibility have demonstrated the beneficial effects of short physiotherapy programs. Finally, different longitudinal cohort studies15, 18, 24, 25 have shown the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach combining therapies for different phenotypes of FMD.

This rater-blinded randomized clinical trial showed that multidisciplinary treatment for FMD improved physical aspects of the quality of life of patients with an FMD compared with a control intervention. During the follow-up visits, patients included in the active-treatment group had a significant improvement in SF-36 PCS score, and they specifically experienced a significant change in pain and their perception of change in health status compared with the previous year. Interestingly, a randomized feasibility study showed that specialized physiotherapy for FMD significantly improved SF-36 PCS score, physical function, and social function in FMD compared with standard physiotherapy, but a nonsignificant improvement was shown for pain and general health.

22 These discrepancies could be related to some differential aspects of our selected cohorts and approaches.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a primer for rapid improvement in functional neurological disorder: a case series [^e3657956]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional weakness is a common phenotype of functional neurological disorder (FND). Without treatment, the prognosis is variable, and approximately half report their symptoms are the same or worse after 14 years.

The use of electrical stimulation for functional motor disorders has a long history, with several hypothesised mechanisms. Contemporary models of FND posit alterations in multiple brain networks, which may be responsive to neuromodulatory techniques. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is the most frequently used neuromodulatory technique, but it is unclear whether TMS interacts with biological and/or psychological mechanisms that cause FND. Several studies and case reports have used single-pulse TMS to elicit movement and provide an enhanced placebo effect in people with functional weakness. However, strong conclusions cannot be drawn due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous study designs. No prior studies have clearly described the content and timing of physiotherapy relative to TMS. We report the first three patients to experience a novel treatment approach that uses single-pulse TMS as a primer for immediate specialist physiotherapy.

2: Enabling good teamwork and cross-pollination

In our opinion, there are two aspects of multidisciplinary treatment of FND that have a particularly large impact on outcomes: one is consistent language across the whole treating team (down to the exact terminology used) and another is team member's sound knowledge about the other team member's roles and approaches. This allows the referring doctor to effectively facilitate a referral and manage patient expectations. Such an approach is particularly important when referring patients to psychiatry or psychology for treatment given the stigma and reluctance to seeing mental health professionals that still often exist. There is consistent evidence of higher rates of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and trauma in patients with FND, and for many, these issues need to be addressed for optimal treatment of functional symptoms. Moreover, there is growing evidence of the effectiveness of psychological treatments, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy, for treating functional symptoms themselves. In the sections 'Psychiatric treatment of FND: case studies', 'psychological therapy for non-psychologists' and 'physiotherapy for non-physiotherapists' of the Masterclass, all health professionals involved in the care of FND patients can learn about what is involved in treatment (ie, the approach and basic strategies used). This understanding connects health professionals, gives them more confidence when referring and can also help them to reinforce strategies the patient was taught by other therapists (such as pacing or grounding techniques).

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^0a60ecf2]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Occupational therapist role

Recommendations

Occupational therapists can assist patients with FND manage difficulties in day-to-day function and improve participation.

Occupational therapists play a crucial role in the multidisciplinary and biopsychosocial care of individuals with FND based on their expertise in both physical and mental health and their focus on function and participation.

Occupational therapy for FND emphasises re-engagement in daily activities with interventions including motor retraining and desensitisation, energy conservation, graded activity resumption, sensory modulation, vocational rehabilitation, psychosocial intervention and education to support self-management. Engaging patients and their families in problem solving and developing strategies to enhance function is essential.

Speech pathologist role

Recommendations

Speech pathologists are uniquely qualified to assess speech, voice, language, cognitive-communication and swallowing disorders. This allows for a major contribution to the diagnosis and effective treatment of these functional symptoms in patients with FND.

Speech pathologists have a critical role in diagnosing and managing FND when functional speech, voice, language, cognitive communication, swallowing and cough are significant symptoms. They are adept at identifying the functional nature of these symptoms and explaining the diagnosis to the patient. As with other symptoms of FND, functional communication, swallowing and cough disorders may exhibit inconsistencies over time, across different tasks and with distraction. While speech pathologists can sometimes manage these symptoms independently, involving a multidisciplinary team is recommended if progress is limited or if additional symptoms are present, ensuring comprehensive care and improved patient outcomes.

### Functional neurological disorder in the emergency department [^59258cf0]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We provide a narrative review of functional neurological disorder (FND, or conversion disorder) for the emergency department (ED). Diagnosis of FND has shifted from a "rule-out" disorder to one now based on the recognition of positive clinical signs, allowing the ED physician to make a suspected or likely diagnosis of FND. PubMed, Google Scholar, academic books, and a hand search through review article references were used to conduct a literature review. We review clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls for the most common functional neurologic presentations to the ED, including functional limb weakness, functional (nonepileptic) seizures, and functional movement disorders. We provide practical advice for discussing FND as a possible diagnosis and suggestions for initial steps in workup and management plans.

### Nocebo hypothesis cognitive behavioral therapy for functional neurological symptom disorder (motor type): a pilot randomized controlled trial [^40d3129e]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent reviewfurther highlighted the similarities between nocebo effects and FNSD, including the significance of prior learning, negative health beliefs and expectations as driving factors, and the operation on an implicit, subconscious level for both phenomena.

The central goal of this study was to evaluate an interdisciplinary therapy, Nocebo Hypothesis Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (NH‐CBT), which transparently shares the concept of the nocebo effect with people with FNSD, in order to provide a rationale for subsequent physical therapy (with embedded psychological strategies) that directly addresses illness beliefs. This is the primary target for the therapeutic input, as it is assumed that a subconscious belief that people with FNSD have about neurological (or other) damage or disease is the main pathological mechanism.NH‐CBT shares key components with traditional CBT (eg, psychoeducation, behavioral experiments), but is unique within that discipline in that it primarily attempts to challenge the person's (subconscious) belief that they are neurologically damaged or diseased via the visceral lived experience of physical movement, as opposed to predominantly using talking therapy.

A retrospective case series investigating NH‐CBTdemonstrated that 93% of the episodes of care resulted in apparent full remission of functional symptoms. On the basis of those positive preliminary findings, the protocol for this phase IIb pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was developed to test the following hypotheses,:
The treatment with NH‐CBT is associated with a greater improvement in physical functioning and secondary outcomes in people with motor FNSD, in comparison with an active control intervention.
These improvements can be maintained up to 8 weeks after the end of the intervention.
NH‐CBT is an acceptable intervention for people with motor FNSD, with satisfactory therapeutic alliance and none/minimal negative effects of therapy.

### Opinion, knowledge, and clinical experience with functional neurological disorders among Italian neurologists: results from an online survey [^f22e6764]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorders (FND) are disabling medical conditions commonly seen in neurological practice. Neurologists play an essential role in managing FND, from establishing a diagnosis to coordination of multidisciplinary team-based treatment for patients. With this study, we investigated the knowledge and the clinical experience of Italian neurologists in managing patients with FND.

Methods

Members of the Italian Society of Neurology were invited via e-mail to participate in this ad hoc online survey; 492 questionnaires were returned completed.

Results

The term "Functional neurological disorders" in reference to FND was used more frequently than other psychological (e.g. psychogenic or conversion), or descriptive terms (e.g. non-organic or stress-related). When speaking with patients, the respondents stated that they preferred explaining symptoms based on abnormal functioning of the nervous system than discussing mental illness and that they would refer their patient to a psychologist rather than to a psychiatrist. Few considered that physiotherapy and psychiatric interventions are useful approaches to treating FND. Some believed that patients simulate their symptoms.

Conclusions

Overall, the responses suggest that knowledge about scientific advances in FND is somewhat sparse. A psychiatric-centered view of FND opens the way to an approach in which neurobiological and psychological aspects constitute essential factors of the condition. In this context, professional education could improve understanding of FND and optimize patient management.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^8011589e]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Obtaining the history

Approach to the patient with FND should follow the same rules for diagnosing any medical disorder. The history should begin with a nonjudgmental mindset that everyone experiences functional symptoms and to consider a broad differential from the start to best help every patient. Many patients with FND have been told of other diagnostic "possibilities" which are remembered as definitive (ie, hemiplegic migraine, transient ischemic attack) from neurologists or emergency department clinicians leaving FND off the differential for someone else to bring up. Alternatively, patients may feel a lack of concern from well-meaning clinicians when presented with "good news, all tests returned normal" implying no disease and offering no follow up. Putting effort into listening to the patient's concerns and beliefs about their symptoms helps identify readiness for treatment. Due to the high rate of traumatic experiences reported in all people, especially those with FND, using communication that fosters trust and reduces harm has been shown to impact patient engagement and improve outcomes. Trauma-informed care principles should be incorporated in interactions with all patients. These include making patients feel safe, having choice in their care decisions, collaborating with the clinician, developing trust, and feeling that they are empowered in their own care. A detailed review of symptoms may uncover migraine or other chronic pain disorder, cognitive complaints such as 'brain fog', fatigue, and other neurological symptoms commonly experienced by patients with FND that may need to be addressed before treatment which requires active participation to be helpful. Identifying the possibility of a functional cognitive disorder, a common mimic of Alzheimer's Disease, should be considered in those presenting mainly with memory/cognitive decline of abrupt onset, at young age and with shorter duration of symptoms. Comorbid sleep disorders and psychiatric comorbidities are also elevated and should be carefully screened for. Many but not all patients identify a precipitating injury or incident and describe a sudden and maximal onset of symptoms right at the start. For paroxysmal FND such as seizure or syncope, some patients report recognizing vulnerable states or triggers that also can be helpful for future intervention. Many patients with FND do not report experiencing "stress" and do not appreciate when the clinician assumes psychiatric disorder or "stress" as the cause. There are many potential pitfalls to avoid in diagnosing FND.

### Exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy in the treatment of functional seizures: a review of underlying mechanisms and associated brain networks [^e243e090]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional seizures (FS), the most common subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), cause serious neurological disability and significantly impact quality of life. Characterized by episodic disturbances of functioning that resemble epileptic seizures, FS coincide with multiple comorbidities and are treated poorly by existing approaches. Novel treatment approaches are sorely needed. Notably, mounting evidence supports the safety and efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) for several psychiatric conditions, motivating investigations into whether this efficacy also extends to neurological disorders. Here, we synthesize past empirical findings and frameworks to construct a biopsychosocial mechanistic argument for the potential of PAT as a treatment for FS. In doing so, we highlight FS as a well-defined cohort to further understand the large-scale neural mechanisms underpinning PAT. Our synthesis is guided by a complexity science perspective which we contend can afford unique mechanistic insight into both FS and PAT, as well as help bridge these two domains. We also leverage this perspective to propose a novel analytic roadmap to identify markers of FS diagnostic specificity and treatment success. This endeavor continues the effort to bridge clinical neurology with psychedelic medicine and helps pave the way for a new field of psychedelic neurology.

### Comprehensive systematic review update summary: disorders of consciousness: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology; the American congress of rehabilitation medicine; and the national institute on disability, independent living, and rehabilitation research [^263a9787]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Disorders of consciousness — AAN systematic review update assessed diagnosis, natural history, prognosis, and treatment for conditions lasting at least 28 days and synthesized evidence using the AAN evidence-based classification system and a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. The review reports that the natural history of recovery from prolonged VS/UWS is better in traumatic than nontraumatic cases, and that minimally conscious state (MCS) confers better prognosis for functional recovery than VS/UWS. It further states that amantadine probably hastens functional recovery for patients with MCS or VS/UWS caused by traumatic brain injury over 4 weeks of treatment.

### Shared individual formulation therapy (SIFT): an open-label trial of a new therapy accommodating patient heterogeneity in functional neurological disorder [^303d69d8]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a complex neuropsychiatric condition with a multifactorial aetiology. The heterogeneity of patients with FND is rarely considered in psychotherapy trials, which may contribute to variable outcomes. Shared Individual Formulation Therapy (SIFT) is a new, brief (four session) psychotherapy that aims to accommodate heterogeneity by providing a personalised, trans-theoretical formulation of the person's difficulties and accompanying management plan.

Methods

An open-label, prospective trial of outpatient SIFT for adults with FND was conducted, using health-related quality of life (SF-12) as the principal outcome measure, with secondary measures of mental health, dissociation, health care use and attitude to the FND diagnosis. Measures were collected at baseline, end of treatment and 6- and 12-month follow-ups.

Results

Twenty-nine participants with various FND symptoms enrolled. Twenty-four completed all four sessions and 25 completed follow-up measures at 12 months. SF-12 scores improved significantly at end of treatment and were sustained throughout follow-up with moderate effect sizes (0.39–0.47; all p < 0.001). Most secondary outcomes also improved significantly at all time points. The intervention was highly acceptable and tolerable to patients and perceived as beneficial.

Conclusion

This trial provides preliminary evidence for initial and sustained benefit from SIFT for adults with FND. Further study is needed to validate these findings.

### Virtual reality in functional neurological disorder: a theoretical framework and research agenda for use in the real world [^ebe4bf99]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Treatment

Current treatment options for FND broadly consist of physiotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and psychotherapy, as well as more novel methods currently under research such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Future research should aim to provide additional evidence on current treatment options, deepening understanding of the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects, and developing new and symptom-specific treatments. We propose several ways in which VR interventions may serve as a promising treatment modality for FND.

VR as a therapeutic approach for FND

VR could function as an adjunct to existing treatment modalities, such as physiotherapy and rehabilitation.VR-based rehabilitation has been effectively implemented in other neurological disorders, leading to practical benefits such as cost-effectiveness and accessibility.VR may in fact expand the domain of rehabilitative interventions, creating training situations that are impracticable in real life. Furthermore, VR may augment existing hypnotic interventions for FND, potentially increasing their efficacy and accessibility. Therefore, VR may contribute to evidence supporting hypnotic interventions in FND, as current evidence remains limited.

The use of VR in combination with brain–computer interface (BCI) technology has demonstrated motor and other rehabilitation potential in stroke and spinal cord injury due to BCI's capacity for motor imagery-linked functional electrical stimulation of an affected limb (to trigger real movement) as well as the use of motor imagery rehearsal to move an avatar in VR. Similar combined approaches have yet to be studied in FND and may merit exploration.
