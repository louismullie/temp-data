## Question

What are the contraindications for cardiazem

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications for Cardizem (diltiazem). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which formulations are being discussed and whether the question is about absolute versus relative contraindications. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled absolute contraindications across oral and intravenous formulations. Next, I will review formulation-specific IV-only contraindications, especially Wolff-Parkinson-White and ventricular tachycardia. After that, I should consider major relative contraindications and cautions from high-quality guidelines, particularly heart failure and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable list and double-check for any nuances I might miss along the way.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions. Cardizem refers to diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker available in immediate-release oral, extended-release oral, and intravenous formulations; absolute contraindications are those in which the drug should not be used under any circumstance, whereas relative contraindications require caution and individualized risk–benefit assessment, often depending on severity or comorbidities.

> I will now examine the FDA-labeled absolute contraindications that apply across oral formulations. Wait, let me verify the canonical list: sick sinus syndrome without a functioning ventricular pacemaker, second- or third-degree AV block without a functioning ventricular pacemaker, hypotension with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hypersensitivity to diltiazem or any formulation component, and acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary congestion documented on chest radiograph at admission; these are consistently listed in multiple FDA sources and should be treated as absolute for oral diltiazem [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] [^e04723d5] [^7183d184] [^767aa21a].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific absolute contraindications for intravenous diltiazem. The IV labeling adds several absolute contraindications not found in oral labeling: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome with atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular tachycardia, severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock, and coadministration with intravenous beta-blockers; I initially thought "severe hypotension" might be redundant with the oral label, but wait, the oral label specifies SBP less than 90 mmHg, whereas the IV label explicitly names cardiogenic shock and warns against IV beta-blocker coadministration, which are distinct and stricter IV-only constraints [^a3a91144] [^f50d0d50] [^72b32ccc].

> Next, I should review major relative contraindications and cautions that, while not absolute, materially change use. Let me consider heart failure first: diltiazem is a negative inotrope and is generally avoided in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; ACC/AHA guidance advises against nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in HFrEF, and the AHA scientific statement lists diltiazem as a drug that may cause or exacerbate heart failure, so I need to ensure I flag this as a strong relative contraindication in HFrEF unless a compelling indication exists and alternatives are unsuitable [^61597cb9] [^e9223fa1] [^0b0a9e85].

> I should double-check conduction disease and bradycardia cautions. Even outside of absolute block, diltiazem slows AV nodal conduction and can worsen bradycardia; coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, or other negative chronotropes increases the risk of severe bradycardia or high-grade AV block, so I need to emphasize careful ECG monitoring and dose adjustment when combining agents, and avoid IV diltiazem with IV beta-blockers outright [^cd90544a] [^807b19df] [^f50d0d50].

> But wait, what about pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter. I initially almost conflated this with "wide-complex tachycardia", but I should confirm the distinction: diltiazem is contraindicated in AF/AFL with accessory bypass tract (WPW/LGL) because it may accelerate ventricular response via the accessory pathway and precipitate ventricular fibrillation; this is an absolute contraindication for IV diltiazem and a strong avoidance for oral diltiazem in acute pre-excited AF/AFL, whereas distinguishing SVT from VT before giving diltiazem is essential to avoid hemodynamic collapse in ventricular tachycardia [^a3a91144] [^f50d0d50] [^772efc22].

> I need to ensure I capture drug–drug interaction pitfalls. Diltiazem is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and interacts with statins such as simvastatin and lovastatin, necessitating dose limits to mitigate myopathy risk; it also interacts with direct oral anticoagulants, often prompting dose reductions when coadministered; and in cancer therapy, cardio-oncology guidance advises avoiding diltiazem for hypertension due to interaction concerns, so I should flag these as important relative contraindications or dose-modification scenarios rather than absolutes [^13313cb9] [^992096f1] [^89108af2].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable list. Absolute contraindications include: sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hypersensitivity to diltiazem, acute MI with pulmonary edema on admission, and for IV diltiazem specifically: WPW/LGL with AF/AFL, ventricular tachycardia, severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock, and coadministration with IV beta-blockers; major relative contraindications or strong cautions include HFrEF, decompensated heart failure, significant baseline bradycardia or conduction disease, and coadministration with other negative chronotropes or interacting drugs, with careful monitoring if used at all [^6bd1847b] [^a3a91144] [^61597cb9] [^cd90544a].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implications. Before initiating diltiazem, I need to check blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, ECG for conduction disease, and review medications for interacting agents; in acute settings, if the rhythm is uncertain or the patient is unstable, I should avoid diltiazem and prioritize synchronized cardioversion or alternative therapies per ACLS and SVT guidelines, reserving diltiazem for hemodynamically stable narrow-complex tachycardias without pre-excitation or heart failure decompensation [^772efc22] [^651f87e6] [^020ca1a4].

---

Cardizem (diltiazem) is **absolutely contraindicated** in patients with sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block, or hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) unless a functioning pacemaker is present [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c]. It is also contraindicated in acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema, hypersensitivity to diltiazem, and in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation or flutter due to risk of rapid ventricular response and ventricular fibrillation [^a3a91144] [^c901b061]. Use caution in heart failure, hepatic impairment, and when coadministered with beta-blockers or other negative chronotropes because of additive effects on AV conduction and contractility [^9233356b] [^cd90544a].

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are conditions in which diltiazem **should not be used under any circumstances**:

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Sick sinus syndrome without a functioning ventricular pacemaker | Risk of severe bradycardia or asystole due to impaired sinus node function [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] |
| Second- or third-degree AV block without a functioning ventricular pacemaker | Risk of high-grade AV block and bradycardia due to impaired AV conduction [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] |
| Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) | Further reduction in blood pressure may cause shock or organ hypoperfusion [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] |
| Acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary edema | Negative inotropic effects can worsen heart failure and pulmonary congestion [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] |
| Hypersensitivity to diltiazem or any formulation component | Risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis [^6bd1847b] [^c188dd8c] |
| Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with atrial fibrillation or flutter | Risk of rapid ventricular response and ventricular fibrillation due to accessory pathway conduction [^a3a91144] [^c901b061] |

## Relative contraindications and precautions

Relative contraindications are conditions in which diltiazem may be used with **caution and close monitoring**:

- **Heart failure**: Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and may worsen heart failure, especially in patients with reduced ejection fraction [^889b31c7] [^0b0a9e85].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Diltiazem is metabolized by the liver; impaired hepatic function increases drug levels and toxicity risk [^9233356b].
- **Concomitant beta-blockers or other negative chronotropes**: Additive effects on AV conduction and contractility increase risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension [^cd90544a] [^807b19df].
- **Renal impairment**: Use caution, particularly with extended-release formulations, due to altered pharmacokinetics [^9233356b].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Greater sensitivity to hypotension and bradycardia; start at lower doses and titrate slowly [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Use only if clearly needed, weighing maternal benefit against fetal risk; diltiazem crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.
- **Drug interactions**: Diltiazem is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and interacts with many drugs, including statins, benzodiazepines, and antiarrhythmics; monitor closely and adjust doses as needed [^13313cb9] [^807b19df].

---

## Summary of contraindications

| **Absolute contraindications** | **Relative contraindications** |
|-|-|
| Sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker | Heart failure |
| Second- or third-degree AV block without pacemaker | Hepatic impairment |
| Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) | Concomitant beta-blockers |
| Acute MI with pulmonary edema | Renal impairment |
| Hypersensitivity to diltiazem | Elderly patients |
| Wolff-Parkinson-White with AF/ flutter | Pregnancy/lactation |

---

Cardizem is **contraindicated** in patients with significant conduction disease, hypotension, acute MI with pulmonary edema, hypersensitivity, and WPW with AF/ flutter. Use caution in heart failure, hepatic or renal impairment, and with interacting drugs.

1.1 Hypertension

CARDIZEM LA is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

CARDIZEM LA may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

Intravenous diltiazem or verapamil can be effective for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT and have been shown to terminate SVT in 64% to 98% of patients; a slow infusion of either drug up to 20 minutes may lessen the potential for hypotension, and these drugs should be used only in hemodynamically stable patients, not in tachycardia due to VT or pre-excited AF and not in suspected acute heart failure. Intravenous beta blockers are reasonable for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT (Class IIa, C-LD).

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) — contraindications and precautions: Although rare, potential complications associated with TEE may include esophageal perforation, esophageal injury, hematoma, laryngeal palsy, dysphagia, dental injury, or death, and there is insufficient literature to assess whether there are contraindications for the use of TEE. Both the consultants and ASA members are equivocal regarding whether there are no absolute contraindications other than previous esophagectomy or esophagogastrectomy; those who do not agree do agree that esophageal stricture, tracheoesophageal fistula, postsophageal surgery, and esophageal trauma should be absolute contraindications, while both groups disagree that Barrett esophagus, hiatal hernia, large descending aortic aneurysm, and unilateral vocal cord paralysis should be absolute contraindications. The ASA members disagree and the consultants are equivocal that dysphagia is an absolute contraindication to TEE. Recommendations state that TEE may be used for patients with oral, esophageal, or gastric disease, if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk, provided the appropriate precautions are applied, which may include considering other imaging modalities, obtaining a gastroenterology consultation, using a smaller probe, limiting the examination, avoiding unnecessary probe manipulation, and using the most experienced operator.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^651f87e6]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

AHA 2025 Adult Advanced Life Support — acute rate control strategy selection in atrial fibrillation/flutter: Nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists and β-adrenergic blockers are reported as effective for rate control, and systematic reviews show that IV diltiazem improves heart rate control when compared to IV metoprolol. Amiodarone is effective for rate control without preexcitation when there are contraindications to these agents, whereas digoxin is less commonly used in the acute setting because of the slow onset of effect. In an observational study, optimal amiodarone dosing for heart rate control was examined in 80 critically ill patients, most with cardiogenic shock or sepsis. In atrial fibrillation or flutter with concomitant preexcitation after AV nodal blocking agents, cardioversion is recommended as the most appropriate management. Because of negative inotropic effects, nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists may further decompensate patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and symptomatic heart failure, though patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may tolerate them better; β-blockers can be safe in cardiomyopathy but harmful in decompensated patients. Limited evidence suggests that intravenous diltiazem may cause increased risk of decompensation compared to intravenous β-adrenergic blockers, and multiple studies have demonstrated β-adrenergic blockers are safe for use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release) [^27446ec6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosages must be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with 60 to 120 mg twice daily. Maximum antihypertensive effect is usually observed by 14 days of chronic therapy; therefore, dosage adjustments should be scheduled accordingly. Although individual patients may respond to lower doses, the usual optimum dosage range in clinical trials was 240 to 360 mg/day.

Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release Capsules have an additive antihypertensive effect when used with other antihypertensive agents. Therefore, the dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when adding one to the other. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS regarding use with beta-blockers.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^f7911132]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. (5.2)
Second-or third-degree AV block. (5.3)
Heart failure. (5.4)
Hypotension. (5.5)

5.1 Tachycardia and Hypotension in patients with AF/AFL and accessory bypass tract

Diltiazem may cause ventricular fibrillation if given to patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. Distinguish atrial fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block) from pre-excited atrial fibrillation prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Hemodynamic Deterioration in Patients with Wide Complex Tachycardia

Diltiazem may cause hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. Distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 AV Block

Diltiazem prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness that may cause second- or third-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Concomitant use of diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac conduction may result in additive effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If high-degree AV block occurs in sinus rhythm, discontinue diltiazem and institute appropriate supportive measures [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Heart Failure

Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and can cause decreased systolic function and heart failure. Do not initiate in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. If heart failure develops during diltiazem treatment, discontinue treatment and treat heart failure appropriately.

5.5 Hypotension

Diltiazem can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with low blood pressure at baseline and those on concomitant medications that decrease blood pressure, intravascular volume, or myocardial contractility are at increased risk for hypotension.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^61597cb9]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) — ongoing pharmacologic management when ablation is not chosen: For patients without pre-excitation on their resting ECG, oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil "are indicated", with observational data noting effectiveness in "approximately 50% of patients without pre-excitation". In patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have AVRT and/or pre-excited AF and are not candidates for or decline ablation, oral flecainide or propafenone "is reasonable", with these drugs "effective in approximately 85% to 90% of patients", and with adverse effects where "Side effects occur in up to 60% of patients, and approximately 20% discontinue the medications because of adverse effects". For those not undergoing ablation, oral sotalol or dofetilide "may be reasonable", with initiation precautions that "inpatient monitoring with serial ECGs is generally performed". If others are ineffective or contraindicated, oral amiodarone "may be considered" for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) — initial medical management is achieved with anti-impulse therapy using a combination of intravenous beta blockers and vasodilators to reduce both heart rate and blood pressure (BP) to decrease aortic wall stress, with small studies emphasizing reduction of heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and systolic BP (SBP) to < 120 mm Hg. Intravenous beta blockers have been the mainstay of acute medical treatment, with reports emphasizing the importance of continuing this therapy at the time of hospital discharge to improve clinical outcomes; caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia), and for intolerance to beta blockers, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia. Pain related to AAS can trigger a rise in heart rate and BP, so treating pain can help control the patient's BP and heart rate; intravenous opiates are particularly efficacious, whereas intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac may not be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension as well as adverse renal effects.

### Implantable defibrillators in primary prevention of genetic arrhythmias. A shocking choice? [^3554a01f]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Indications and contraindications, either relative or absolute, to implant a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator. All patients with an indication to implantable cardioverter defibrillatorimplantation may be eligible to subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, if there is no need for pacing. Accordingly, a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator is contraindicated in patients requiring pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronization therapy or antitachycardia pacing. Also, a transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be prudentially preferred in some patients with a greater probability of developing the need for pacing over follow-up. subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator is particularly indicated in young patients who have a greater chance to experience lead failures requiring surgical revision and/or extraction because of their many decades of life expectancy. The implantation of a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator is particularly justified in young patients affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or channelopathies, in whom polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, typically unresponsive to anti-tachycardia pacing, are the predominant arrhythmic events that trigger shock therapy. In these patients eligibility may be limited by T-wave oversensing with R- and T-wave double-counting, leading to inappropriate shocks. Suitability of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be improved by means of proper pre-implantationtesting, device programming (single-zone vs. dual-zone programming), and the use of electronic sensing filter such as the SMART pass filter. *There are significant limitations for the use of subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator for long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The main ones are the inability to provide pacing, the lack of flexibility to increase the delay to shock, the limited number of therapies available in case of electrical storms. Examples of conditions associated with a greater probability of developing future indications to pacing include: first degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block with PR interval > 300 ms; bi-/tri-fascicular block; left bundle branch block with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; the need of β-blocker therapy in patients with the tendency to sinus bradycardia; and heart disease at high risk of sinus node dysfunction or AV block (e.g. cardiac sarcoidosis, laminopathies). ATP, anti-tachycardia pacing; BS, Brugada syndrome; CRT, cardiac resynchronization therapy; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

### Is it safe to use class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with coronary artery disease and / or cardiomyopathy? [^27e7e386]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are a key treatment option for effective rhythm control in several common arrhythmias. Here, we review the relevant background on Class 1C AADs, these drugs' indications and contraindications, and potential safe ways to use them. The safety profile of 1C AADs, and related restrictions on their use, has been largely based on the decades-old CAST trial, but more recent evidence may favor re-evaluating previously excluded populations. This review examines opportunities to reconsider certain patient populations that have previously been excluded from the use of 1C AADs. This reconsideration is made feasible due to advances in cardiac reperfusion, medical therapies for heart failure, and cardiac imaging.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — acute treatment includes: Acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended in ACHD patients who have AF or atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically unstable. Intravenous diltiazem or esmolol (with extra caution used for either agent, observing for the development of hypotension) is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically stable. Intravenous adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT. Intravenous ibutilide or procainamide can be effective for acute treatment in ACHD patients and atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. Atrial pacing can be effective for acute treatment in ACHD patients and SVT who are hemodynamically stable and anticoagulated as per current guidelines for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. Elective synchronized cardioversion can be useful for acute termination of AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients when acute pharmacological therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Oral dofetilide or sotalol may be reasonable for acute treatment in ACHD patients and AT and/or atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable.

### Verapamil in infants: an exaggerated fear? [^eb117051]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The use of intravenous verapamil for tachyarrhythmia in infants is widely considered contraindicated due to the perceived risk of hemodynamic collapse after administration. This article reviews the relatively limited evidence that led to this well-known contraindication and highlights the interesting process by which medical practice may evolve in the absence of persuasive science.

### Pharmacotherapy for behavioural manifestations in frontotemporal dementia: an expert consensus from the European reference network for rare neurological diseases (ERN-RND) [^07f27301]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the WS for contraindicated treatments, amitriptyline was the most contraindicated in three symptoms including verbal aggression (WS = 1), physical aggression (WS = 0.9) and apathy (WS = 0.5). Bupropion was the most selected as contraindicated in seven behavioural symptoms: obsessive delusions and motor unrest (WS = 0.9 each), impulsivity and self‐harm (WS = 0.8 each), sexual disinhibition (WS = 0.7), self‐injury (WS = 0.6) and nightly unrest (WS = 0.5). Oxazepam was the most contraindicated for rigidity of thought (WS = 0.6), perseverative somatic complaints (WS = 0.6) and loss of empathy (WS = 0.4). Olanzapine was the most contraindicated for hyperphagia (WS = 0.8). These results showed that there is no clear consensus between the 21 physicians concerning the contraindicated treatments, which is probably influenced by individual clinical experiences, patient profiles and varying interpretations of contraindications for specific behavioural symptoms.

Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)
Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension
A history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block [see Contraindications (4)]

Treatment-Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of MAYZENT treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, if not contraindicated, ECG testing and first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4) and Contraindications (4)].
Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, MAYZENT is not recommended in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of MAYZENT in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with MAYZENT is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate, such as ivabradine and digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during MAYZENT initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing MAYZENT treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, MAYZENT can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 50 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 50 bpm. Treatment with MAYZENT can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after MAYZENT has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with MAYZENT should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Mavacamten for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: rationale for clinically guided dose titration to optimize individual response [^b7e75c95]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology recommend consideration of mavacamten in addition to a beta‐blocker (or, if this is not possible, with verapamil or diltiazem) to improve symptoms in adult patients with resting or provoked LVOT obstruction (Class IIa, level of evidence A). The guidelines also recommend consideration of mavacamten as monotherapy in symptomatic patients with LVOT gradients who are intolerant or have contraindications to beta blockers, verapamil or diltiazem, or disopyramide (Class IIa, level of evidence B). However, in the absence of evidence from clinical studies that directly compare mavacamten versus existing therapies, guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology currently recommend the use of beta‐blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as first‐line therapies for symptom management, and the addition of disopyramide in refractory cases (Class I, level of evidence B). The 2024 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines provide similar recommendations for the use of cardiac myosin inhibitors (such as mavacamten) as a treatment in adult patients with obstructive HCM who have persistent symptoms despite therapy with beta‐blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Limited placebo‐controlled data support the off‐label use of beta‐blocker and calcium channel blocker agents for treatment of HCM, which were developed for other conditions and not specifically for HCM, provide variable symptomatic relief, and do not target the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Mavacamten is the first pharmacological therapy with the potential to modify the underlying pathophysiology of HCM, as demonstrated in preclinical models.

### Beta-blockers for cardiac CT: a primer for the radiologist [^f2997642]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe a protocol for the administration of beta-blockers for cardiac CT. A low and regular heart rate is necessary for optimal visualization of the coronary arteries on CT and can be achieved by the administration of medications.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers can be safely given, orally or IV, to most patients to lower the heart rate for cardiac CT. A protocol can be implemented and patients can be screened for certain contraindications to allow successful administration of these medications by radiologists.

### Diltiazem hci [^807b19df]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Anesthetics

The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.

Benzodiazepines

Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and Cmax by 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam.

Beta-blockers

Intravenous diltiazem has been administered to patients on chronic oral beta-blocker therapy. The combination of the two drugs was generally well tolerated without serious adverse effects. If intravenous diltiazem is administered to patients receiving chronic oral beta-blocker therapy, the possibility for bradycardia, AV block, and/or depression of contractility should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Oral administration of diltiazem with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%. In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem.

### Treatment and risk in heart failure: gaps in evidence or quality? [^994e0ed1]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although the absolute benefits of an intervention are proportional to patients' underlying risk, studies in heart failure have noted a paradoxical inverse relationship between treatment and risk. The extent to which this reflects higher rates of contraindications in patients with higher risk or larger gaps in care quality has not been explored.

Methods and Results

We studied 18 307 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction surviving hospitalization between January 2005 and June 2007 from 194 hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Heart Failure. Patients were categorized according to their estimated risk for in-hospital mortality using a validated risk score. The proportions of patients with documented contraindications to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers as well as the use of these medications among patients without contraindications at hospital discharge was determined across levels of risk. For each therapy, the proportion of patients with contraindications was significantly higher with increasing patient risk (P < 0.001 for each). Even after excluding those with contraindications, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers was significantly lower with increasing risk (P < 0.001 for each).

Conclusions

The use of evidence-based therapies is lower in patients with heart failure at higher risk of mortality both because of higher rates of contraindications to therapy and lower rates of use among eligible patients. Optimizing heart failure outcomes will require both the expansion of the evidence base for treating the highest-risk patients as well as the development of effective strategies to assure that eligible high-risk patients receive all appropriate therapies.

### Side effects of and contraindications for whole-body electro-myo-stimulation: a viewpoint [^122f61fa]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

​Other side effects of WB-EMS

Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen uptake were investigated in 68 healthy subjects, randomised to physical exercise combined with or without WB-EMS. After a 6-week training period, the findings did not differ between both groups. In 117 advanced cancer patients, red and white cell count, serum creatinine, albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration did not differ between patients randomised to WB-EMS and controls.

​Contraindications for WB-EMS

WB-EMS is contraindicated in patients with implanted electronic devices such as pacemakers, implanted defibrillators, neuro-stimulators or pain pumps because of potential electrical interference. There are various diseases or conditions mentioned as exclusion criteria, as listed in table 4. Some contraindications are contradictory: malignancy or heart failure is listed as contraindications, whereas other studies concentrated on patients with these diseases. Surprisingly, prior rhabdomyolysis, a history of muscle cramps and potential causes for rhabdomyolysis (as listed in tables 2 and 3) are not mentioned as contraindication.

Table 4
Disorders, listed as exclusion criteria for patients in WB-EMS trials

We did not detect any reports about complications of WB-EMS associated with the disorders mentioned in table 4. Thus, it remains unclear on which data and considerations these contraindications were based.

Many patients with heart failure receive electronic devices to protect against sudden cardiac death or to improve systolic function.WB-EMS is feasible in patients with heart failure. Thus, it should be investigated, if implanted electronic devices and cardiac diseases are indeed contraindications for WB-EMS.

​Precautions for WB-EMS

Regulations and guidelines regarding WB-EMS were found only for Germany and Israel.

The German guideline recommends that before the first training session, a history of possible contraindications must be taken. WB-EMS must be advised and accompanied by a trained WB-EMS-coach. Additionally, fluids should be consumed before and after training. After initial WB-EMS, the stimulation level should be successively increased. The guideline generally advises against private use of WB-EMS without support of a qualified and licensed trainer. It is not indicated, however, where the list of contraindications is available, who should take the history and what is a 'licensed' trainer.

In Israel, the Ministry of Health issued regulations. All WB-EMS devices have to be registered either as medical device or as device for physical training. The operator has to be a qualified fitness gym coach with a training of at least 30 hours.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^d7feb4c2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### Rates of potentially inappropriate dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants and associations with geriatric conditions among older patients with atrial fibrillation: the SAGE-AF study [^992096f1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Determining Appropriateness of DOAC Dose

We used the guidelines from FDA‐approved package inserts 6, 7, 8, 9 and the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) practical guide on the use of non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants 23 for each drug with respect to absolute contraindications (ie, creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min and not on dialysis, presence of a mechanical heart valve, documented allergy to respective DOAC, active pathological bleeding), age, renal function, and weight to create an algorithm to evaluate the appropriateness of DOAC dosing. Creatinine clearance was calculated for each patient from the serum creatinine within 24 months of enrollment based on the Cockcroft‐Gault equation using ideal body weight. 24

We created a comprehensive list of potentially interacting drugs based on EHRA recommendations 23 and the FDA‐reviewed package inserts 6, 7, 8, 9 for each DOAC. Briefly, all participants who had an absolute contraindication were deemed to be overdosed (Figure 1). If there were no absolute contraindications, the algorithm evaluated dose appropriateness based on age, renal function and body weight (for apixaban), renal function alone (for rivaroxaban and edoxaban), or renal function plus dronedarone use (for dabigatran). If the participant was correctly dosed by these parameters, we checked for drug‐drug interactions. Participants in whom the drug was contraindicated based on drug‐drug interactions were classified as either overdosed or underdosed based on whether the drug interaction caused an increase or decrease in serum levels of the DOAC. For example, ketoconazole causes a rise in serum levels of all DOACs; hence, concomitant use of ketoconazole and a DOAC was classified as an overdose. On the other hand, for participants taking concomitant diltiazem, reduced strength dose was deemed to be the "appropriate dose" if they also had a secondary indication (age, renal function, or body weight) for dose reduction. For the sake of uniformity, all yellow recommendations by the EHRA guidelines (consider dose reduction or different DOAC if ≥ 2 "yellow" factors are present) were considered as a requirement for dose reduction. Where there were discrepancies between the EHRA recommendations and the DOAC package insert, we used the EHRA recommendations as the gold standard for determining dose appropriateness. The exception to this rule was the EHRA recommendation to consider dose reduction for concomitant use of antiplatelet agents and HAS‐BLED score > 3, which were not included in the algorithm.

### Diltiazem to treat sinus tachycardia in critically ill patients: a four-year experience [^1bd4e3ca]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether an intravenous infusion of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem was effective and safe in treating sinus tachycardia in critically ill adult patients with contraindications to beta-blockers or in whom beta-blockers were ineffective.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

University medical center.

Patients

The records of 171 surgical intensive care unit patients with sinus tachycardia treated with intravenous diltiazem were evaluated.

Interventions

In all patients with sinus tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min), heart rate control with intravenous diltiazem was attempted after adequate intravascular volume expansion, pain, and anxiety control. In all patients, beta-blockade either was contraindicated or (in 7%) had failed. Intravenous diltiazem was administered as a slow 10-mg bolus dose (0.1–0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), and then an infusion was started at 5 or 10 mg/hr and increased up to 30 mg/hr, as needed, to decrease heart rate to < 100 beats/min. Variables retrospectively collected included demographic data, preinfusion blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and preinfusion pressure-rate quotients (pressure-rate quotient = mean arterial pressure / heart rate). Intravenous bolus dose, when given, and diltiazem infusion rate and time necessary to achieve the target heart rate also were recorded. The lowest heart rate recorded within 24 hrs from the initiation of the infusion and the time necessary to achieve the lowest heart rate after beginning the infusion were recorded.

Measurements and Results

Of 171 patients studied, 97 (56%) were classified as responders. Multiple linear regression suggested that response could be predicted by age, pressure-rate quotients, baseline mean arterial pressure, and central nervous system failure. In the responders, a heart rate < 100 beats/min was achieved in an average of 2 hrs, at a mean diltiazem infusion of 13.3 mg/hr. The lowest rate reached by the responders in a 24-hr period averaged 86 beats/min and was achieved in 4.8 hrs with a mean infusion rate of 14.8 mg/hr. Both target and lowest rate values were statistically different from baseline heart rate.

Conclusion

Diltiazem was effective in achieving short-term control of heart rate in 56% of the patients, virtually without adverse effects, where beta-blockade was contraindicated or ineffective.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) medical therapy — scope, typical agents, and cautions: "In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control". "There are no randomized studies that have evaluated different medical treatments in the treatment of AAS", and therapy "is usually accomplished with a combination of intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmolol, metoprolol, and labetalol) and vasodilators (eg, nicardipine, clevidipine, and sodium nitroprusside) with the goal of reducing both heart rate and BP to decrease aortic wall stress". Targets highlighted include "reducing heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and SBP to < 120 mm Hg", with the principle that "the lowest BP that does not compromise end-organ function should be targeted". "Caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia)", and for intolerance "intravenous non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment". "Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia". For longer-term management after dissection, "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and ARBs are beneficial in the long-term management of hypertension in patients with aortic dissection", and "Statins are used routinely in patients after aortic dissection, although the evidence is not very robust".

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^9947bf4f]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blocker therapy in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — acute vasoreactivity testing (AVT) responders, outcomes, contraindications, and dosing — is characterized as follows: Patients with PAH associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) had 9 of 60 patients (15%) acute responders (P = 0.006), and "patients with repaired CHD are less likely to be responsive to AVT than those with IPAH". For acute responders with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) treated with CCB, survival was 97%, 97%, and 81% at 1, 5, and 10 years, and sustained treatment success was 84%, 66%, and 47%. In contrast, IPAH children who were not reactive during AVT but were still treated with CCB had survival rates of 45%, 34%, 29%, and 29% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. CCBs are "contraindicated" in children who "have not undergone AVT, are nonresponders, or have RV failure (ie, WHO functional class IV)", and because negative inotropic effects are "more prominent in children < 1 year of age", they are "usually not recommended at this age". Recommended long-term agents for acute responders include nifedipine 2–5 mg·kg−1·d−1, diltiazem 3–5 mg·kg−1·d−1, and amlodipine 2.5–10 mg/d, whereas verapamil is contraindicated in PAH.

Table 1:
Indications and Contraindications for Stress Perfusion Imaging

Rest perfusion images are obtained when the heart is at rest during administration of contrast or radionuclide material. Rest images may be obtained either before the stress images or after the stress images once the heart rate has returned to baseline.

Vasodilators have a good safety profile but can cause significant adverse events in a small fraction of patients and are contraindicated in some conditions. Adenosine can cause second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in 8% of cases and can also precipitate bronchospasm. Thus, adenosine is contraindicated in patients with second-degree atrioventricular block and in patients with severe asthma or emphysema. Regadenoson is a selective alpha-2A (A 2A) adenosine receptor agonist with coronary vasodilator properties and thus avoids heart block and is not contraindicated in patients with asthma and emphysema, but these patients need to be monitored carefully, with emergency treatments for bronchospasm available. Dipyridamole vasodilates primarily by raising platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels via inhibition of its breakdown by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and also by blocking uptake of adenosine and thus has similar contraindications as those for adenosine.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs-clinical use and clinical decision making: a consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on cardiovascular pharmacology, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and international society of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy (ISCP) [^cd90544a]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drug pharmacodynamics — key interaction risks and monitoring are described: for Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), "Combinations of these drugs reduce cardiac contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia, intracardiac conduction disturbances, and proarrhythmia", and "Co-administration of Class I AAD with beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and hypotension"; "Lidocaine is less effective in the presence of hypokalaemia; therefore, it should be corrected", and "Propafenone increases the effects of cyclosporin, desipramine, and theophylline"; with beta‑blockers, "Their combination with Class I AAD, digoxin or amiodarone increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and myocardial depression… [and] The combination with diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided because it increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure"; for amiodarone, "Co-administration with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block and hypotension; thus, ECG and blood pressure should be monitored… Severe bradycardia has been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with hepatitis C antiviral drugs (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir)", while "Combination of amiodarone with fentanyl may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and decreases cardiac output" and "Higher IV doses of dopamine and dobutamine are needed in patients on amiodarone"; torsade risk is highlighted as "Class I and III AAD (particularly dofetilide, ibutilide, and sotalol) prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution (or avoided)… [and] Hypokalaemia increases the risk of torsades de pointes and potentiates digoxin-induced arrhythmias; thus, it should be corrected"; for nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers, "Co-administration of diltiazem or verapamil with disopyramide or inhaled anaesthetics decreases cardiac contractility and increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension; therefore, it should be avoided"; for adenosine, "Its coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block… Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine potentiating its effects; theophylline blocks adenosine receptors and decreases the effects of adenosine".

Secondary analyses

Differences found between BP-CCBs and amlodipine might reflect something unique about amlodipine rather than merely its low brain penetrability, such as aspects of its channel blocking kinetics Thus, in a secondary analysis we compared people prescribed BP-CCBs with patients prescribed verapamil or diltiazem. We omitted these drugs from the primary analysis since (a) they have different clinical indications from amlodipine (i.e. they are not recommended first line for hypertension, and are contraindicated in heart failure) and hence are more likely to lead to confounding by indication, and (b) their pharmacological profiles differ from the dihydropyridines. Though the evidence regarding the brain penetrability and central effects of verapamil and diltiazem is less clear than for the dihydropyridines, we included both drugs in the non-penetrant group, in line with others.

We also conducted secondary analyses for BP-CCBs versus amlodipine separately in men and women, and based on age (under or over 60 years). Finally, we compared BP-CCBs with ARBs, given the evidence mentioned earlier that the latter group are associated with lower risks of many neuropsychiatric disorders compared to CCBs as a class. We hypothesised that this difference would be reduced, or eliminated, when the comparison was limited to BP-CCBs. The same covariates were used for the secondary analyses as for the primary comparison between BP-CCBs and amlodipine.
