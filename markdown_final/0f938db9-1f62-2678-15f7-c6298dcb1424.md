## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code Q89.9 when used to capture a rare congenital craniofacial syndrome characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition is represented by ICD-10 code Q89.9 when used to capture a rare congenital craniofacial syndrome characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Q89.9 actually means in ICD-10. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided sources explicitly map arhinia and microphthalmia to Q89.9. Next, I will consider the most likely clinical entity that fits arhinia with ocular anomalies and check its genetic basis. After that, I should review ICD-10 coding conventions for rare syndromes and see if a more specific code exists. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and note limitations of ICD-10 for rare diseases coding.

> Let me first confirm the code definition. Q89.9 in ICD-10-CM is "Congenital malformation, unspecified", which is a residual category used when no more specific congenital anomaly code applies; it sits within the Q89 block for other congenital malformations not elsewhere classified, and it is inherently nonspecific by design.

> Wait, let me verify whether any of the supplied documents directly link Q89.9 to arhinia and microphthalmia. I need to check carefully: none of the provided references explicitly map arhinia, microphthalmia, or a named syndrome with those features to Q89.9, which means any assignment of Q89.9 to this phenotype would be inferential rather than source-supported.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should identify the clinical entity that best matches arhinia with ocular defects. The most coherent match is Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS), characterized by complete absence of the nose (arhinia) with microphthalmia or anophthalmia, and caused by de novo missense variants in SMCHD1; this is supported by multiple independent reports and mechanistic studies, even though BAMS itself is not assigned a unique ICD-10 code in the materials provided [^4f4584e0] [^d978599d].

> I should confirm the ICD-10 coding reality for rare syndromes. Many rare diseases, including BAMS, lack a dedicated ICD-10 code and are often captured with nonspecific Q89.x codes or multiple organ-system codes; this is a known limitation of ICD-10 for rare disease surveillance and research, and it is why some studies and registries resort to broader categories or text-based phenotyping to improve ascertainment [^2c6ff3f4] [^e09309e9].

> Let me consider whether a more specific ICD-10 code could apply. Arhinia could be coded under Q30.1 (agenesis and underdevelopment of nose), and microphthalmia under Q11.2 (microphthalmia), but neither captures the syndromic combination; Q89.9 is used when the syndrome is not otherwise specified, so using Q89.9 for a BAMS-like presentation is clinically reasonable when a specific syndrome code is unavailable, albeit imprecise [^d33e9305].

> But wait, what if the phenotype reflects a different entity? I should double-check the differential. Other syndromes can include microphthalmia with craniofacial anomalies, such as CHARGE or certain frontonasal dysplasias, yet the combination of complete arhinia with microphthalmia is particularly characteristic of BAMS; without a named syndrome code in ICD-10, Q89.9 remains the closest administrative placeholder for "rare congenital craniofacial syndrome with arhinia and microphthalmia" in this context [^4f4584e0] [^663d5650].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: ICD-10 code Q89.9 does not name a specific condition; when used for a rare congenital craniofacial syndrome with arhinia and microphthalmia, it most plausibly corresponds to Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome, recognizing that ICD-10 lacks a unique code for BAMS and that Q89.9 functions as an unspecified congenital malformation category in this scenario [^4f4584e0] [^d978599d].

---

The ICD-10 code Q89.9 denotes a **congenital malformation, unspecified** and is used when a rare craniofacial syndrome with arhinia and microphthalmia lacks a more specific ICD-10 diagnosis. This code is a **nonspecific placeholder** for congenital anomalies not elsewhere classified, including rare syndromes such as Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) [^4f4584e0] when no dedicated code exists. Accurate clinical documentation and genetic testing are essential to support precise coding and to identify whether a more specific ICD-10 code may apply.

---

## Clinical features of arhinia and microphthalmia

Arhinia is the **complete absence of the external nose**, a rare congenital anomaly with significant functional and aesthetic consequences, including impaired breathing, olfaction, and facial symmetry [^4f4584e0]. Microphthalmia is a **congenital eye anomaly** characterized by a smaller-than-normal eye, often associated with visual impairment or blindness [^7a1a3ac4]. Together, these features define a rare craniofacial syndrome that may also involve other anomalies, such as midline brain defects, pituitary hypoplasia, and reproductive abnormalities [^4f4584e0].

---

## Genetic basis of the syndrome

Recent studies have identified **SMCHD1 mutations** as a cause of Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS), a rare condition characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia [^4f4584e0]. SMCHD1 is an epigenetic regulator, and mutations in this gene disrupt normal craniofacial and ocular development, leading to the distinctive phenotype observed in BAMS [^d978599d].

---

## ICD-10 coding considerations

The ICD-10 code Q89.9 is designated as "congenital malformation, unspecified" and is used when a congenital anomaly does not have a more specific ICD-10 code. This code is often used for rare or newly described syndromes that have not yet been assigned a specific ICD-10 code. In the case of a rare craniofacial syndrome characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia, Q89.9 is the most appropriate code when a more specific diagnosis is not available [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of ICD-10 coding

ICD-10 coding has limitations when dealing with rare or newly described syndromes. Many rare diseases, including BAMS, **do not have specific ICD-10 codes**, leading to the use of nonspecific codes such as Q89.9. This can result in challenges for accurate diagnosis, epidemiological tracking, and clinical management. Efforts are underway to improve ICD-10 coding for rare diseases, including the development of more specific codes and the integration of genetic information into coding systems [^2c6ff3f4].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Patients with rare craniofacial syndromes characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia require **multidisciplinary care** involving plastic surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, genetics, and psychology. Management includes surgical reconstruction of the nasal structures, ophthalmologic interventions for microphthalmia, and genetic counseling for affected individuals and their families [^28c4a967] [^31e427fd]. Accurate diagnosis and coding are essential for coordinating care, accessing appropriate resources, and supporting research efforts.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code Q89.9 is used to denote a rare congenital craniofacial syndrome characterized by arhinia and microphthalmia when a more specific diagnosis is not available. This code reflects the limitations of ICD-10 in capturing rare or newly described syndromes. Accurate clinical documentation and genetic testing are essential for improving diagnosis, coding, and management of these complex conditions.

### Cleft and craniofacial coding in ICD-10 [^f2229b68]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

With the gradual replacement of the ICD-9 coding system by the newer ICD-10 system, there is a need to critically evaluate how the system improves-or fails to improve-the coding of specific cleft and craniofacial anomalies. The following review examines the new system and the key components for practitioners who treat patients with such anomalies.

Conclusions

While seemingly beneficial in certain respects, the newer ICD-10 system remains far from ideal for cleft and craniofacial anomalies. With future iterations of the system, a more concerted effort to precisely code such anomalies is warranted, which will likely require input from key practitioners.

* Identified by scanning up to 40 available fields for ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes Q00–Q99: congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities. Patent ductus arteriosus (Q25.0) and atrial septal defect (Q21.1) were not considered birth defects when occurring in neonates aged < 28 days or with an associated indicator of preterm birth (ICD-10-CM codes P07.2 or P07.3). An additional 23 conditions of lesser clinical importance classified within the Q00–Q99 code range were not considered birth defects.

† Birth defects categories correspond to blocks of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes: cardiovascular (Q20–Q28), central nervous system (Q00–Q07), chromosomal (Q90–Q99), cleft lip/palate (Q35–Q37), ear (Q16–Q17), eye (Q10–Q15), gastrointestinal (Q38–Q45), genitourinary (Q50–Q64), integumentary (Q80–Q85), musculoskeletal (Q65–Q79), and other syndrome (Q87). "Other defect" includes birth defects of the face and neck (Q18), respiratory system (Q30–Q34), and other congenital malformations (Q86 and Q89). Critical cardiovascular defects were operationalized using the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report. The specific defects included are only those defined in the National Birth Defects Prevention Network Congenital Malformations Surveillance Report; birth defects not included contribute to frequencies and costs aggregated by birth defect category and overall. Because a single hospitalization might include more than one specific birth defect, individual birth defect frequencies might sum to > 100% of birth defects categories or overall frequencies, and mean costs multiplied by frequencies will correspondingly sum to > 100% of total costs.

### Treacher Collins syndrome in the United States: examining incidence and inpatient interventions [^03ebdedf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advancements have been made in the care of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), but epidemiological data are lacking given its rarity. A national database provides a valuable opportunity for studying the incidence of rare craniofacial conditions. We sought to evaluate disease incidence of phenotypically severe cases and the frequency of the most common associated diagnoses and interventions.

Design

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was the first version to include updated International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding encompassing a unique code for TCS. The 2016 KID was queried for the unique code. Incidence was calculated using national estimates. Diagnosis and procedure codes were pooled and analyzed.

Patients

A total of 266 discharge cases with a diagnosis code for TCS (Q75.4).

Main Outcomes

Disease incidence and the most frequent diagnosis and procedure codes.

Results

The estimated incidence of children born with a diagnosis of TCS was approximately 1 in 80,000. Two of the three most common ICD-10 diagnosis codes were tracheostomy status and obstructive sleep apnea. The most common procedures performed were airway examination procedures.

Conclusions

Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare craniofacial disorder requiring complex multidisciplinary management. Phenotypically severe cases requiring inpatient management may be rarer than previous estimates suggest. Inpatient airway interventions are very common, and multidisciplinary team members should anticipate the degree of potential airway risk these patients pose.

Table 2
NLP validation and results for three methods of mapping diagnosis descriptions

Orphanet also provides mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, which are classified as Exact, BTNT (broader term to narrower term), NTBT (narrower term to broader term), and ND (unable to decide). When considering all mapping classes, 5,527 RGD ORPHA codes were mapped to ICD-10 codes in our cohort. However, only 884 ICD-10 codes were used to describe these ORPHA codes, and a total of 149,222 patients in the cohort (a prevalence of 22.6%) had at least one of these 884 ICD-10 codes. This result suggests that direct mappings from ICD-10 to ORPHA codes are not only non-specific but also contain substantial false positives that may arise when a narrower ORPHA code is mapped to a broader ICD-10 code. When considering only the exact mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, a mere 154 ICD-10 codes were mapped to 150 ORPHA codes in 29,777 patients in our cohort. Compared with the results of text-based mapping using the NOBLE Coder-based NLP pipeline, this represents a striking 88% reduction in RGD diagnoses and a 20% reduction in the number of patients identified. Moreover, there is a higher likelihood of false positives in these 29,777 patients, as many ICD-10 codes are mapped to multiple ORPHA codes with only one of the mappings as exact. For instance, H90.5 is mapped to four ORPHA codes (998, 87884, 330029, and 363396); however, only the mapping to 87884 (non-syndromic genetic deafness) is exact. In contrast, the diagnosis descriptions from IMO terminology are often more accurate than ICD-10 codes. For example, in our EHR data, diagnosis texts such as "Aarskog syndrome", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome", "Noonan syndrome", "Russell's syndrome", and many more syndromes were all noted as Q87.19. This ICD-10 code, however, is not used at all in Orphanet. Instead, a different ICD-10 code, Q87.1 is used, which is mapped to more than 60 RGD ORPHA codes.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^ef2cf36d]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This is a large cohort of standardised national data within a centralised and nationalised health care system, and therefore represents a unique resource. The CRANE registry has high case ascertainment, and given its national coverage is likely to be representative of children born with an orofacial in England during the study period. A minimum follow-up of 2.25 years in HES data allowed sufficient time for congenital anomalies to be identified after birth. Although the cohort was born between 2000 and 2012, we believe that the knowledge gained from this study is still relevant to people born with an orofacial cleft in the present day. Discordance in cleft subtypes in one fifth of the patient records between the datasets was a weakness as it resulted in the exclusion of otherwise successfully linked data.

The ICD-10 categorisation system of malformations is advantageous because it is an international system that is widely accessible and facilitates thorough documentation of anatomical detail. However, despite the ICD-10 being regarded as the international standard, a variety of different classifications have been used in the literature, which makes comparison difficult. The ICD-10 anatomical subcategorization is not necessarily clinically intuitive and cannot differentiate between minor and major ACMs. Whilst the use of ICD-10 codes allowed us to report many congenital malformations, HES restricts the entry of these codes to 4 characters (eg, Q87.0), which means that some codes were not sensitive enough to distinguish between certain diagnoses (for example, Pierre Robin Sequence and Goldenhar syndrome share the same 4-character ICD-10 code). Furthermore, ICD-10 codes utilised in HES tend to focus on a physical diagnosis or phenotype, rather than the underlying genetic cause. This means the prevalence of specific genetic and/or syndromic diagnoses associated with orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations could not be reported. With the now widespread application of genomic testing, this limitation highlights a need for cleft research cohorts to accurately capture data relating to genetic and syndromic diagnoses.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^a9a3b2d2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### SMCHD1 mutations associated with a rare muscular dystrophy can also cause isolated arhinia and bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome [^d978599d]. Nature Genetics (2017). Medium credibility.

Arhinia, or absence of the nose, is a rare malformation of unknown etiology that is often accompanied by ocular and reproductive defects. Sequencing of 40 people with arhinia revealed that 84% of probands harbor a missense mutation localized to a constrained region of SMCHD1 encompassing the ATPase domain. SMCHD1 mutations cause facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) via a trans-acting loss-of-function epigenetic mechanism. We discovered shared mutations and comparable DNA hypomethylation patterning between these distinct disorders. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated alteration of smchd1 in zebrafish yielded arhinia-relevant phenotypes. Transcriptome and protein analyses in arhinia probands and controls showed no differences in SMCHD1 mRNA or protein abundance but revealed regulatory changes in genes and pathways associated with craniofacial patterning. Mutations in SMCHD1 thus contribute to distinct phenotypic spectra, from craniofacial malformation and reproductive disorders to muscular dystrophy, which we speculate to be consistent with oligogenic mechanisms resulting in pleiotropic outcomes.

### Cleft lip sidedness and the association with additional congenital malformations [^d33e9305]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional Congenital Malformations (ACMs)

ACMs were classified based on the International Classification of Disease Version 10 (ICD-10) codeswhich are reported in HES data. ICD-10 is considered the international standard diagnostic classification for disease and is developed and maintained by the World Health Organisation. Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosome abnormalities are coded Q00-Q99 and are categorised according to the body or organ system they affect (see Appendix 1). Codes for ACMs relating to cleft lip and palate (Q35-Q37) were excluded from the analysis. The code for nasal ACMs (Q30) was included in the analysis because despite the nose being positioned anatomically adjacent to the lip and palate, the specified nasal anomalies would not be expected to represent the underlying orofacial cleft (Q30.1 Agenesis and underdevelopment of nose; Q30.2 Fissured, notched and cleft nose; Q30.3 Congenital perforated nasal septum; Q30.8 Other congenital malformations of nose; Q30.9 Congenital malformation of nose, unspecified). Similarly, code Q38 relating to malformations of tongue, mouth and pharynx was included as it specified that it excluded cleft lip and/or palate.

We did not attempt to remove individuals with a specific genetic and/or syndromic diagnosis from the analysis cohort, since there was no means of reliably achieving this distinction using ICD-10 codes.

### FSHD type 2 and bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome: two faces of the same mutation [^6f00a53c]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether congenital arhinia/Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2), 2 seemingly unrelated disorders both caused by heterozygous pathogenic missense variants in the SMCHD1 gene, might represent different ends of a broad single phenotypic spectrum associated with SMCHD1 dysfunction.

Methods

We examined and/or interviewed 14 patients with FSHD2 and 4 unaffected family members with N-terminal SMCHD1 pathogenic missense variants to identify BAMS subphenotypes.

Results

None of the patients with FSHD2 or family members demonstrated any congenital defects or dysmorphic features commonly found in patients with BAMS. One patient became anosmic after nasal surgery and one patient was hyposmic; one man was infertile (unknown cause) but reported normal pubertal development.

Conclusion

These data suggest that arhinia/BAMS and FSHD2 do not represent one phenotypic spectrum and that SMCHD1 pathogenic variants by themselves are insufficient to cause either of the 2 disorders. More likely, both arhinia/BAMS and FSHD2 are caused by complex oligogenic or multifactorial mechanisms that only partially overlap at the level of SMCHD1.

### Diagnosis and incidence of congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency in Denmark – A national observational study [^3d83d5ab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

The study included all patients with cCPHD in Denmark born between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2020, identified through ICD-10 diagnosis code searches in the DNPR and locally at the 4 Danish tertiary hospitals.

The DNPR contains all inpatients in Denmark since 1977 and all outpatients since 1995, with ICD-10 diagnosis codes since 1994. Whenever a patient is in contact with a Danish hospital, 1 primary and an optional number of secondary ICD-10 diagnosis codes are registered as the reason for the contact, along with codes identifying the reporting hospital and department. The DNPR identifies patients based on a central person registrations number, which is a unique personal identification number, including information on date of birth, given to all Danish citizens since 1968. The validity and completeness of the DNPR ICD-10 diagnosis code registration allow for national incidence estimations according to a systematic review.

The DNPR search identified all Danish patients with relevant diagnoses before age 15 years from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2020. As cCPHD does not have a specific ICD-10 diagnosis code, we had to search the DNPR for broader pituitary-related ICD-10 diagnosis codes E23.0-E23.9 (hypofunction and other disorders of pituitary) and Q89.2G (congenital malformation of pituitary), thus including both isolated PHD and acquired CPHD. A number of additional ICD-10 diagnosis codes indicating an acquired etiology of PHD were used as exclusion criteria, as detailed in Table 1. Furthermore, identified patients who were not treated at a tertiary hospital were excluded. To detect failure of referral of patients with cCPHD to a tertiary hospital, we reviewed the hospital files of all patients registered at 1 secondary hospital in the DNPR data set as a spot sample (Table 2). This was done to examine the frequency of referral failure and, through that, the validity of the method used to identify patients with cCPHD.

### Subphenotyping and classification of orofacial clefts: need for orofacial cleft subphenotyping calls for revised classification [^2dfdd719]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Nonsyndromic orofacial clefting (OFC) describes a range of phenotypes that represent the most common craniofacial birth defects in humans, with an overall birth prevalence of 1:700 live births. Because of the lifelong negative implications on health and well-being associated with OFC and the numbers of people affected, quality research into its etiology, diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and preventative strategies is essential. A range of different methods is used for recording and classifying OFC subphenotypes, one of which is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system. However, there is a general perception that research is being hampered by a lack of sensitivity and specificity in grouping those with OFC into subphenotypes, with potential heterogeneity and confounding in epidemiologic, genetic, and genotype-phenotype correlation studies. This article provides a background to the necessity of OFC research, discusses current controversies within cleft subphenotyping, and provides a brief overview of current OFC classifications as well as their limitations. The LAHSHAL classification is described in the context of a potentially useful tool for OFC that could complement the ICD-10/ICD-11 Beta coding systems to become a simply understood, universally accepted, clinically friendly, and research-sensitive instrument. Empowering registries, clinicians, and researchers to use a common classification system would have significant implications for OFC research across the world at a time when accurate subphenotyping is crucial and health care research is becoming increasingly tailored toward the individual.

### Ano / microphthalmia, ocular cysts, central nervous system malformations, and neuropsychological delay. diagnostic considerations on 2 Brazilian patients [^1558ca52]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

We report on two unrelated Brazilian patients both presenting a very unusual association of ano/microphthalmia, cystic orbital anomaly, atypical clefting, and facial appendages in one patient. Clinical manifestations presented by these patients represent a MCA/MR syndrome of unknown etiology. Considerations about syndromic delineation, genetic aspects, and differential diagnosis are discussed.

### De novo mutations in SMCHD1 cause bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome and abrogate nasal development [^4f4584e0]. Nature Genetics (2017). Medium credibility.

Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS) is an extremely rare and striking condition characterized by complete absence of the nose with or without ocular defects. We report here that missense mutations in the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 mapping to the extended ATPase domain of the encoded protein cause BAMS in all 14 cases studied. All mutations were de novo where parental DNA was available. Biochemical tests and in vivo assays in Xenopus laevis embryos suggest that these mutations may behave as gain-of-function alleles. This finding is in contrast to the loss-of-function mutations in SMCHD1 that have been associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) type 2. Our results establish SMCHD1 as a key player in nasal development and provide biochemical insight into its enzymatic function that may be exploited for development of therapeutics for FSHD.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^e09309e9]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The overall cost of RDs is likely larger than the current HCUP utilization analysis. HCUP estimate charges likely underestimate the true costs of these conditions because they do not factor direct costs such as professional (e.g. physician, dentist, and other clinicians) fees, indirect costs (e.g. lost work productivity), and secondary downstream health-care effects.

HCUP databases are useful for giving estimates on a national scale. There are, however, several limitations of HCUP sample data: (1) the frequencies represent hospital discharges, and not patients, and thus, recurrent hospitalizations by the same patient appear as distinct observations; (2) the prevalence data may be affected by hospital coding; (3) databases do not capture outpatient encounters, and the full health-care utilization of patients suffering from RDs is underrepresented; (4) data do not represent the complete universe of all discharges in the United States since not all states participate; (5) hospital charges represent the bill that is sent to the payer, not the actual cost to the hospital which may vary, depending on reimbursement, if any; (6) the number of rare conditions included in this study primarily correspond to ICD-10 codes provided by Orphanet, which is far from the nearly 7,000–10,000 rare conditions currently described; (7) patients with undiagnosed rare conditions are not included in the RD cohort; (8) conditions are heterogeneous and genetic basis may affect only a disease subpopulation; (9) the ICD-10 codes used also include CC, which are unable to be separated from RDs, and thus are included in the health-care utilization and cost data reported here; and (10) we did not distinguish conditions in Table S3 that are indicated as having a genetic basis due to genetic susceptibility, genetic role in the phenotype, or disease-causing somatic mutation(s) from those with disease-causing germline mutation(s).

### A practical guide to the management of anophthalmia and microphthalmia [^31e427fd]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital anophthalmia and microphthalmia are rare developmental defects of the globe. They often arise in conjunction with other ocular defects such as coloboma and orbital cyst. They may also be part of more generalised syndromes, such as CHARGE syndrome. Anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and coloboma are likely to be caused by disturbances of the morphogenetic pathway that controls eye development, either as a result of primary genetic defect, or external gestational factors, including infection or drugs that can influence the smooth processes of morphogenesis. The ophthalmologist is often the primary carer for children with anophthalmia and microphthalmia, and as such can coordinate the multidisciplinary input needed to offer optimal care for these individuals, including vision and family support services. They are able to assess the vision and maximise the visual potential of the child and they can also ensure that the cosmetic and social impact of anophthalmia or microphthalmia is minimised by starting socket expansion or referring to a specialist oculoplastics and prosthetics unit. A coordinated approach with paediatrics is necessary to manage any associated conditions. Genetic diagnosis and investigations can greatly assist in providing a diagnosis and informed genetic counselling.

### Microphthalmia and linear skin defects syndrome: precise diagnosis guides prognosis [^94f65b78]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Microphthalmia and linear skin defects syndrome (MLS) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder characterized by microphthalmia and linear atrophic plaques of the face and neck. The diagnosis of MLS can be challenging secondary to both its rarity and to clinical overlap with Goltz syndrome. Whereas the skin lesions of MLS are more likely to improve in appearance with age, the lesions of Goltz are typically persistent.

### A naturally occurring canine model of syndromic congenital microphthalmia [^f8a222d5]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Of the 42 cases, we were initially able to gather complete information about both their paternal and maternal ancestries from 23 individuals. This allowed us to reconstruct a family tree in which a common ancestor, MP739, was identified (Fig. 3). The structure of the tree, alongside the fact that all parents of affected puppies were clinically normal, and that both males and females were affected, were all highly suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. During the study, complete information of all 42 cases was gathered. The complete family tree is shown in Supplementary file 1.

### Real-world clinical and molecular management of 50 prospective patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia and / or ocular coloboma [^6c5fae8f]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients diagnosed with a molecular cause were directed to appropriate specialists for investigation and management of ocular/systemic features where genotype–phenotype correlations were known. Furthermore, genetically solved patients in this cohort were given access to genetic counselling to provide information on the potential impacts of their test results and guide future choices. However, with less than a third of families (28%) obtaining a genetic diagnosis, unfortunately many families could not be given specific clinical care or advice based on their underlying molecular cause, resulting in greater uncertainty regarding prognosis and family planning.

Clear understanding of MAC aetiology is key to providing appropriate clinical care and genetic counselling. However, genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance patterns make molecular diagnosis challenging, particularly for unilateral cohorts. This work highlights the importance of careful phenotyping, to assemble the appropriate multidisciplinary care team to undertake investigations such as MRI brain imaging and genetic testing. Increased usage of next-generation sequencing to identify novel variants and complex non-mendelian causes of MAC can clarify genotype–phenotype relationships, pointing to potential comorbidities, which ensure that patients are referred to the correct specialists, which can improve prognosis.

### High incidence and geographic distribution of cleft palate in Finland are associated with the IRF6 gene [^db479acf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Phenotype definitions

Case subjects with non-syndromic forms of OFCs in FinnGen were defined from electronic health records in the Care Register for Health Care of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the Causes of Death Register from Statistics Finland, using diagnosis codes of the Finnish version of ICD (versions 10, 9, 8). Codes of versions ICD-10, ICD-9 and ICD-8 were available since 1996, between 1987–1995 and between 1967–1986, respectively. Cases with CP only (discovery cohort n = 228; 157 females and 71 males and replication cohort n = 165; 116 females and 49 males) were defined based on the ICD-10 code Q35, ICD-9 code 7490[ABCE], and ICD-8 code 74900. Cases with CLP (n = 121; 62 females and 59 males) were defined using the ICD-10 code Q37, ICD9 code 7492[ABCDE], and ICD8 codes 74920 and 74924. Cases with CL (n = 54; 28 females and 26 males) were defined using ICD10 code Q36, ICD9 codes 7491[ABCDEFG] and ICD8 codes 74910 and 7491[123]. Syndromic cases with the following ICD-10 codes were excluded: Q75.4 (mandibulofacial dysostosis), Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q86 (congenital malformation syndromes due to known exogenous causes, not elsewhere classified), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems) and Q91 (Edward's syndrome and Patau's syndrome). The Estonian cohort consisted of 71 CP cases and 198,973 population controls. Cases with isolated CP (n = 71; 54 females and 17 males) in the Estonian biobank were ascertained using the ICD-10 code Q35 through a questionnaire implemented by the biobank and national health registry-based medical records. The following ICD-10 codes for syndromic cases were excluded from both Estonian cases and controls: Q38.0 (congenital malformations of lips, not elsewhere classified, including VWS), Q38.1 (ankyloglossia), Q38.5 (congenital malformation of palate), Q87 (other specified congenital malformation syndromes affecting multiple systems), and Q91 (Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome).

### Classification systems of cleft lip, alveolus and palate: results of an international survey [^ee26e2e7]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Great variety of classification systems currently used exists among clinicians when confronted with patients with OFCs. Because future advances in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of OFCs will require us to compare precisely phenotyped cohorts of patients with clefts, further research and involvement among geneticists and embryologists is needed to provide optimal comprehension of classifying clefts amongst all craniofacial specialists. Classifying clefts with a universally implemented classification system is essential for improved communication between craniofacial specialists and comparison of scientific data globally. According to the results of this study, LAHSHAL could be the most suited universal classification system, due to its extensiveness, relatively high implementation rate and convenient usage to complement the ICD-10 system. Potentially, this could make up for the deficiencies of the ICD-10 codes that do not indicate laterality, completeness, and clefts of the alveolus. For more international acceptance, standardization and better communication globally it is prudent to demonstrate to users the merits of the LAHSHAL classification system.

### Perinatal airway management mandibular anomalies: a national inpatient cohort analysis [^e3f43a0b]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). It is a nationally representative sample of about 3 million pediatric discharges representing all payers. Each discharge record captures diagnosis and procedure codes for a given inpatient admission as defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions (ICD‐9 and ICD‐10, respectively) as well as demographics, hospital characteristics, charges, and length of stay.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing the KID data from 2000 to 2019 and included all birth hospitalization encounters for live and stillbirths. Out‐of‐hospital births and transfers were excluded. A certified professional coder assisted with code selection and verified that the ICD‐9 to ICD‐10 transition for each diagnostic category was accurate. In some cases, not reportable (NR) was listed in accordance with the HCUP privacy policy. In other cases, data were listed in ranges to illustrate clinically relevant information, while respecting privacy policies. Sampling weights based on survey design allow for calculation of national estimates. Due to the de‐identified nature of the data in the KID, this study was exempt from institutional review board review.

Exposure

Patients with birth hospitalization discharge diagnosis (BHDD) along the spectrum of mandibular anomaly were identified using ICD‐9/10 codes and stratified into six phenotypic groups: (1) retrognathia, (2) isolated micrognathia, (3) syndromic micrognathia, (4) micrognathia plus cleft palate or cleft lip and palate, (5) agnathia/micrognathia plus cervical auricle/otocephaly, and (6) agnathia/micrognathia plus microstomia (Supplementary Table I).

### The molecular basis of congenital hypopituitarism and related disorders [^775b1433]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Congenital hypopituitarism (CH) is characterized by the presence of deficiencies in one or more of the 6 anterior pituitary (AP) hormones secreted from the 5 different specialized cell types of the AP. During human embryogenesis, hypothalamo-pituitary (HP) development is controlled by a complex spatio-temporal genetic cascade of transcription factors and signaling molecules within the hypothalamus and Rathke's pouch, the primordium of the AP.

Evidence Acquisition

This mini-review discusses the genes and pathways involved in HP development and how mutations of these give rise to CH. This may present in the neonatal period or later on in childhood and may be associated with craniofacial midline structural abnormalities such as cleft lip/palate, visual impairment due to eye abnormalities such as optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) and microphthalmia or anophthalmia, or midline forebrain neuroradiological defects including agenesis of the septum pellucidum or corpus callosum or the more severe holoprosencephaly.

Evidence Synthesis

Mutations give rise to an array of highly variable disorders ranging in severity. There are many known causative genes in HP developmental pathways that are routinely screened in CH patients; however, over the last 5 years this list has rapidly increased due to the identification of variants in new genes and pathways of interest by next-generation sequencing.

Conclusion

The majority of patients with these disorders do not have an identified molecular basis, often making management challenging. This mini-review aims to guide clinicians in making a genetic diagnosis based on patient phenotype, which in turn may impact on clinical management.

### Congenital Tooth agenesis and risk of early-onset cancer [^889daa20]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Cancer Diagnosis

Topography and morphology codes were obtained from the Danish Cancer Registryand converted to International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3) codes. The ICCC-3 classification is based on pathology, whereas cancers in the ICD system are grouped according to anatomical location. To ease comparison across age groups, the ICCC-3 classification was also used for adult-onset cancers. If a morphology code was missing (ie, no pathology sample available), an assigned ICD-10 code in the registry was converted to a corresponding ICCC-3 code. If assigning an ICCC-3 code was not possible due to poor specification of the cancer type and location, the event was included only in the analysis of any cancer.

Syndrome Diagnosis

A syndrome diagnosis was defined as either an abnormal karyotype (except balanced translocations) or abnormal chromosomal microarray registered in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Registeror a syndrome ICD code in the Danish National Patient Registry, also including ectodermal dysplasia and incontinentia pigmenti, which are coded as malformations of the skin in the ICD-10 (ICD-8 codes 7592–7599 and ICD-10 codes Q82.3-Q82.4 or within Q85-Q99) (detailed description in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1). Genetic testing for a syndrome registered in these data sources was performed as part of clinical care if the examining clinician suspected a syndromic diagnosis. Results of single-gene tests (eg, colorectal cancer panel screening, including APC and AXIN2) were not available. Tooth agenesis in itself was not an indication for genetic testing within the study period, and no testing was performed as part of this study.

### Inbreeding, native American ancestry and child mortality: linking human selection and paediatric medicine [^194452cc]. Human Molecular Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2 shows the estimated SMR for certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities. Bold type is used to highlight SMR with associated probability values lower than 0.002 (0.05/23), and therefore significant after accounting for multiple testing. SROH was associated with an increased mortality due to disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07, 3% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 1–4%) and to intracranial non-traumatic haemorrhage of foetus and newborn (ICD-10 code P52, 5% risk increase per Mb in SROH, 95%CI: 2–9%). The proportion of Aymara–Quechua ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to respiratory distress of newborn (ICD-10 code P22, 3% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 1–5%) and to anencephaly and similar malformations (ICD-10 code Q00, 5% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 3–7%), and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 4% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −6 to −2%). The proportion of Mapuche–Huilliche ancestry was associated with an increased mortality due to other congenital malformations of brain (ICD-10 code Q04, 7% increased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: 2–12%) and with a decreased mortality due to Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome (ICD-10 code Q91, 5% decreased risk per 1% ancestry proportion, 95%CI: −8 to −2%).

### Causes of death in children with congenital anomalies up to age 10 in eight European countries [^5dd26ef5]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Classification of cause of death

All causes of death were recorded using ICD-10 or ICD-9. Four registries were able to provide only the underlying cause of death. Other registries were able to report in addition to the underlying cause of death the primary/immediate cause of death, contributing cause of death and any other causes of death.

Deaths were categorised into neonatal (0–27 days), postneonatal (28–364 days) and child (365–3651 days). In England and Wales, the underlying cause for neonatal deaths was not specified and each cause was classified as related to infant, mother or either; main causes were listed before other (secondary) causes. For this study, in Wales, the first cause of death related to the infant was taken to be the underlying cause of death. In England, the first mention of a CA (if present) was taken to be the underlying cause.

Seven categories of cause of neonatal and post-neonatal deaths, based on a modified version of the UK Office for National Statistics' (ONS) classification of neonatal and postneonatal causes of deathwere used in this study (see online supplemental appendix A). The 'All other conditions' group was very heterogeneous. It included neoplasms, metabolic disorders, jaundice and endocrine disorders, and external causes.

Similarly, the classification of cause of death for children aged 1–9 in this study was based on the UK ONS classification of causes of deathand was divided into 13 categories (see online supplemental appendix B).

To determine the accuracy of the CA recorded on death certificates, two paediatricians agreed a set of ICD-10 and ICD-9 codes corresponding to an 'exact match' for the child's anomaly and a larger set of codes that were considered as an 'acceptable match' (see online supplemental appendix C). For example, for a child with spina bifida (ICD-10 code-Q05), if Q05 was on the death certificate this was considered an exact code; if there were codes for other neural tube defects Q00 (anencephaly) or Q01 (encephalocele) they were considered as acceptable codes. All the available causes of death were searched to determine if any exact or acceptable anomaly codes had been specified.

### Diagnosis and incidence of congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency in Denmark – A national observational study [^ad0efdec]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Through the ICD-10 diagnosis code searches and the subsequent hospital file reviews, we identified 114 patients through the DNPR search and 14 patients through the tertiary hospital registries, resulting in a national cCPHD cohort of 128 patients (Table S1). Of these, 116 were born in Denmark and diagnosed before age 18 years, representing the national incidence cohort of cCPHD diagnosed < 18 years (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Flow chart of the identification of the national congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency (cCPHD) cohort and the national cCPHD incidence cohort. Patients at risk of cCPHD were identified through searches on ICD-10 diagnosis codes E23.0-E23.9 (hypofunction and other disorders of pituitary), Q89.2G (congenital malformation of pituitary), and Q04.0-Q04.9 (other congenital malformations of brain).

### Prevalence of microcephaly in Europe: population based study [^78a87154]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

All EUROCAT registries use multiple sources of information to ascertain cases among all live births, late fetal deaths (> 20 weeks' gestation), and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly at any gestation. Data sources, depending on registry, include maternity, neonatal, and paediatric records; fetal medicine, cytogenetic, pathology, and medical genetics records; specialist services including paediatric cardiology; and hospital discharge and child health records. The EUROCAT central database is hosted by the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, since 2015. Registries either submit individual anonymised records of cases of congenital anomalies (full members) or submit the same data in aggregate form (associate members). All cases are coded with ICD-9 or ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, ninth or 10th versions) with 1-digit British Paediatric Association (BPA) extension. In each case there can be one syndrome and up to eight malformation codes. All coding is standardised by using the EUROCAT guide (version 1.4) with isolated minor anomalies, such as skin tags, being excluded.

### Health care resource utilization by patients with Alagille syndrome [^2be71018]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess and characterize health care resource utilization (HRU) in children with the rare, genetic, multisystem disorder, Alagille syndrome.

Study Design

This retrospective analysis reviewed commercially insured and Medicaid-insured claims from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019 to assess HRU in patients with Alagille syndrome. As there is no specific International Classification ofDiseases-10 code for Alagille syndrome, patients were identified using the following algorithm: ≥ 1 claim with diagnosis code Q44.7 (other congenital malformations of the liver); < 18 years of age, with no history of biliary atresia (International Classification ofDiseases-10 code: Q44.2); and ≥ 6 months of insurance eligibility prior to diagnosis. HRU was summarized per patient per year over all available claims postdiagnosis.

Results

A total of 171 commercially insured and 215 Medicaid-insured patients with Alagille syndrome were available for analysis. Annually, commercially insured and Medicaid-insured patients averaged 31 medical visits (range, 1.5–237) and 48 medical visits (range, 0.7–690), respectively. The most common visits were outpatient with the majority encompassing lab/imaging and primary care visits (commercially insured: 21 [range, 0.0–183]; Medicaid-insured: 26 [range, 0.0–609]). Inpatient visits were the highest driver of costs in both the commercial and Medicaid populations.

Conclusions

Patients with Alagille syndrome have a substantial HRU burden driven largely by numerous outpatient visits and costly inpatient stays. Given the complexity and variability of Alagille syndrome presentation, patients may benefit from multidisciplinary and subspecialized care.

Quality evaluation and risk of bias in individual studies

Two investigators (M.C.F.T. and A. I.L) assessed the quality of the methodology of the selected studies. Disagreement was checked by an independent reviewer (A.V.C). The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for case control studies was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. The NOS scale has 3 principal categories: initial assessment and selection of participants, comparability of groups, and assessment of the outcome of interest (Table 3). Studies with five or more points were considered high quality. A detailed explanation of the quality assessment of the included studies can be found in Table 3.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^0c3ce87b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### Fever in pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations: a cohort study [^d611b462]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome

Denmark has a Civil Registration System where all citizens are registered with a unique 10-digit identification number used in all registries to identify the person. The identification numbers were used to link information from the Danish National Patient Registry, where pregnancy outcomes including information on congenital malformations were identified.

Congenital malformations in live-born children were diagnosed by physicians according to the International Classification of Disease 10th version (ICD-10), and all children diagnosed with ICD-codes Q00.0 to Q99.9 during the first three and a half year of life were identified.

The congenital malformations were divided into categories according to the classification criteria of the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) as seen in Table 3, where the ICD-10 codes are also specified. Isolated minor congenital malformations (n = 1692) were excluded as cases. According to EUROCAT, minor congenital malformations are characterized as malformations with lesser medical, functional or cosmetic importance.

A small group of infants with aneuploidy (n = 36) was not included as cases, as this chromosomal anomaly is a result of errors in mitosis or meiosis happening before conception.

Some of the congenital malformation categories were joined to form a broader group. The ear, face and neck subgroup was pooled with the eye subgroup and the musculo-skeletal- and limb categories were also united. Finally, in addition to the ICD-10 codes defined by EUROCAT, the category "Other" included the subgroups with abdominal malformations and the chromosomal malformations other than aneuploidies.

Children with more than one malformation were included in each appropriate anomaly subgroup, but were only counted once in the "Overall malformations" group.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### An aetiological classification of birth defects for epidemiological research [^265f500e]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital anomaly registers collect data on antenatally and postnatally detected anomalies for surveillance, research, and public health purposes. Each anomaly is coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9/ICD-10) based on body systems, allowing accurate comparisons between registers for individual anomalies. When commencing an environmental, epidemiological study, it became clear to us that there is no standard classification that takes aetiology into account. This paper describes a new classification for use in studies addressing aetiology.

Method

A classification system was evolved and piloted using cases in a study of geographical variation in congenital anomaly prevalence.1 Cases that were difficult to categorise were noted, and after discussion with a team of experts, the classification was adjusted accordingly.

Results and Conclusion

A robust, hierarchical method of classifying birth defects into eight categories has been produced, for use at source of data registration in conjunction with, but independent of, ICD coding.

### Prevalence of congenital malformations at the "les orangers" maternity and reproductive health hospital of rabat: descriptive study of 470 anomalies [^7d48d0b8]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

During the study period, 43,923 births were included, of which 245 cases had one or more congenital malformations, which represents a prevalence of 5.58 per thousand births (or 55.8 per 10,000 births). Of these cases, 96.7% had one or more clinically visible malformations, 51.9% were males and 43.5% were females with a sex ratio of 1.19.

A polymalformative syndrome was found in 26.5% of cases which explains why the total number of identified congenital malformations, with 470 anomalies, exceeds the number of patients.

Within these 470 reported CMs, musculoskeletal malformations accounted for 33% of cases followed by neurological malformations with a rate of 18%, and then abnormalities of the eye, ear, face and neck at 12%. Genetic abnormalities represented 8.5%. (The different types and subtypes of recorded malformations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2).

### Rare craniofacial clefts: a surgical classification [^aee3c8b1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The Tessier classification is the current standard for identifying and reporting rare craniofacial clefts. This numerically based system describes 16 different primary clefts, with additional possible combinations that can significantly raise the total number of potentially describable clefts. Problems with this system include a complexity that requires most surgeons to consult a diagram to describe the location of a cleft. In addition, the Tessier classification can include conditions that may not actually involve a true cleft such as frontonasal dysplasia, Treacher Collins syndrome, and craniofacial microsomia. A surgically based classification is proposed that includes only true clefts (eliminating hyperplasias, hypoplasias, and aplasias) and classifies these rare anomalies into 1 of 4 types based on anatomic regions: midline, median, orbital, and lateral. This simplified classification for craniofacial clefts, which is based on a different surgical paradigm appropriate to each regional location, enables surgeons to describe an observed cleft in such a way that others can easily visualize the location and have a starting point for formulating treatment decisions.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Maternal alcohol use, adverse neonatal outcomes and pregnancy complications in British columbia, Canada: a population-based study [^80102901]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

* Difference between alcohol exposed and non-alcohol exposed p < 0.05

 Difference between alcohol exposed and non-alcohol exposed p < 0.001

There were 5 neonatal records (0.003%) with a diagnosis of "Fetal alcohol syndrome" (FAS; ICD-10: Q86.0) in total among children born in this time period. Interestingly, in 3 of the 5 corresponding pregnancies, alcohol use was not identified as a risk by the antenatal care provider. Additionally, there were 30 neonatal records (0.02%) with a diagnosis of "Fetus and newborn affected by maternal use of alcohol" (ICD-10: P04.3), and 12 out of 30 were not identified as alcohol-exposed based on the same criteria.

Compared to pregnancies without reported alcohol use, pregnancies with alcohol use identified as a risk factor were statistically significantly associated with a greater proportion of the following ICD-10 diagnoses: P04.3: "Fetus and newborn affected by maternal use of alcohol"; P05.9: "Slow fetal growth, unspecified"; P07.1: "Other low birth weight (1000-2499g)"; P22.8: "Other respiration distress of newborn"; P36: "Bacterial sepsis of newborn"; P92.5: "Neonatal difficulty in feeding at breast"; P92.9: "Feeding problems, unspecified"; P96.1: "Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs of addiction"; P96.8: "Other specified conditions originating in the perinatal period"; Q86.0: "Fetal alcohol syndrome (dysmorphic)"; and Q89.7: "Multiple congenital malformations, not elsewhere classified" (Table 4).

### Epidemiology of congenital cerebral anomalies in Europe: a multicentre, population-based EUROCAT study [^a4e45e4a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiology and geographical differences in prevalence of congenital cerebral anomalies in Europe.

Design and Setting

Congenital cerebral anomalies (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code Q04) recorded in 29 population-based EUROCAT registries conducting surveillance of 1.7 million births per annum (29% of all European births).

Participants

All birth outcomes (live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation and terminations of pregnancy after prenatal diagnosis of a fetal anomaly (TOPFA)) from 2005 to 2014.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence, proportion of associated non-cerebral anomalies, prenatal detection rate.

Results

4927 cases with congenital cerebral anomalies were identified; a prevalence (adjusted for under-reporting) of 9.8 (95% CI: 8.5 to 11.2) per 10000 births. There was a sixfold difference in prevalence across the registries. Registries with higher proportions of prenatal diagnoses had higher prevalence. Overall, 55% of all cases were liveborn, 3% were fetal deaths and 41% resulted in TOPFA. Forty-eight per cent of all cases were an isolated cerebral anomaly, 25% had associated non-cerebral anomalies and 27% were chromosomal or part of a syndrome (genetic or teratogenic). The prevalence excluding genetic or chromosomal conditions increased by 2.4% per annum (95%CI: 1.3% to 3.5%), with the increases occurring only for congenital malformations of the corpus callosum (3.0% per annum) and 'other reduction deformities of the brain' (2.8% per annum).

Conclusions

Only half of the cases were isolated cerebral anomalies. Improved prenatal and postnatal diagnosis may account for the increase in prevalence of congenital cerebral anomalies from 2005 to 2014. However, major differences in prevalence remain between regions.

### Genetics of anophthalmia and microphthalmia. part 1: non-syndromic anophthalmia / microphthalmia [^b5abd993]. Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Eye formation is the result of coordinated induction and differentiation processes during embryogenesis. Disruption of any one of these events has the potential to cause ocular growth and structural defects, such as anophthalmia and microphthalmia (A/M). A/M can be isolated or occur with systemic anomalies, when they may form part of a recognizable syndrome. Their etiology includes genetic and environmental factors; several hundred genes involved in ocular development have been identified in humans or animal models. In humans, around 30 genes have been repeatedly implicated in A/M families, although many other genes have been described in single cases or families, and some genetic syndromes include eye anomalies occasionally as part of a wider phenotype. As a result of this broad genetic heterogeneity, with one or two notable exceptions, each gene explains only a small percentage of cases. Given the overlapping phenotypes, these genes can be most efficiently tested on panels or by whole exome/genome sequencing for the purposes of molecular diagnosis. However, despite whole exome/genome testing more than half of patients currently remain without a molecular diagnosis. The proportion of undiagnosed cases is even higher in those individuals with unilateral or milder phenotypes. Furthermore, even when a strong gene candidate is available for a patient, issues of incomplete penetrance and germinal mosaicism make diagnosis and genetic counseling challenging. In this review, we present the main genes implicated in non-syndromic human A/M phenotypes and, for practical purposes, classify them according to the most frequent or predominant phenotype each is associated with. Our intention is that this will allow clinicians to rank and prioritize their molecular analyses and interpretations according to the phenotypes of their patients.

### Risk factors for hospitalisation in Welsh infants with a congenital anomaly [^d531c617]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and record linkage

A national population-based cohort study was established using registry data from the Congenital Anomaly Register and Information Service (CARIS) for Wales, linked to Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW), and births and deaths registration data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and deidentified for analysis.

Deterministic and probabilistic linkage between datasets were performed using an unique Anonymised Linkage Field (ALF) encrypted code provided by NHS Wales Informatics Service, based on infant's NHS number, name, date of birth and address. All infants in the CARIS and PEDW datasets have a validated ALF and hence each infant was matched with hospital admissions using one to multiple merge; unmatched infants were treated as zero admissions. The outputs of linkage were validated by the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) team.

Study population

The inclusion criteria for this study were:

All livebirths between 1999 and 2015 with birth weight ≥ 500 g, gestational age ≥ 22 +0 weeks, with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of a congenital anomaly reported to CARIS. CARIS defines congenital anomalies as structural, metabolic, endocrine or genetic defects, as well as rare diseases of hereditary origin present in the child or fetus at the end of pregnancy, even if not detected until after birth. Therefore, the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) 'Q', 'P35' and 'P37' codes, as well as other non-'Q' ICD-10 codes of congenital anomalies and rare diseases were also included in this study.
All hospital admissions (ie, emergency, elective and transfer admissions) of infants with a congenital anomaly. An admission is defined as a hospital stay of a patient using a bed on premises controlled by the one healthcare provider. An admission is ended by a discharge, transfer to another NHS provider or death. All infants who were admitted from birth due to medical reasons were included in the analysis.

Exclusion criteria:

Admissions solely for the birth of babies (ie, birth hospitalisation) were excluded.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^c2389deb]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

### Clinical and genetic analysis further delineates the phenotypic spectrum of ALDH1A3-related anophthalmia and microphthalmia [^f455986d]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

ALDH1A3 is a member of the retinoic acid pathway, encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase involved in oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid (RA). RA levels are tightly regulated during embryonic development and are essential for normal eye morphogenesis. Including this study, 32 pathogenic ALDH1A3 variants have been reported: 18 missense, 7 splicing, 4 nonsense, 2 frameshift and 1 inframe deletion. Some of the missense (p.(Arg89Cys), p.(Ala493Pro), p.(Arg96His), p.(Gly237Arg)) and nonsense (p.(Lys190*), p.(Lys389*)) variants have been shown to impair protein production and cause loss of function and were reported in patients with variable additional neurodevelopmental phenotypes in the A/M spectrum.

### Surveillance of multiple congenital anomalies; searching for new associations [^b0f82e5d]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjects and methods

The first step in the identification of multiple anomalies is correct case classification. The EUROCAT multiple congenital anomaly algorithm has been developed in collaboration between the EUROCAT Central Registry and the Coding and Classification Committee and continuously improved since 2004. The members of the Coding and Classification Committee are geneticists and pediatricians. The algorithm classifies cases into different groups based on ICD-10/British Paediatric Association (BPA) codes. The aim of the algorithm is to classify congenital anomaly cases into:
Chromosomal syndromes: all cases where an unbalanced chromosomal anomaly has been diagnosed, irrespective of types of anatomically defined anomalies.
Genetic and environmental syndromes: all cases are due to a single gene defect or a known environmental teratogen, irrespective of types of anatomically defined anomalies. This includes skeletal dysplasias and hereditary skin disorders.
Isolated anomalies: all cases with one congenital anomaly/anomalies occurring in only one organ subgroup or with a known sequence where multiple congenital anomalies cascade as a consequence of a single primary anomaly.
Multiple congenital anomalies: cases with two or more major congenital anomalies in different organ systems, where the pattern of anomalies has not previously been recognized as part of a syndrome or sequence.

Papers published in 2011 and 2014 describe the methodology and results of the first 2 years of data. The computer algorithm allocates 90% of all EUROCAT cases into classification groups (a), (b) or (c). Approximately 10% of cases are classified by the computer as potential multiple cases and these cases were reviewed by three EUROCAT geneticists to reach an agreement for classification as true multiple congenital anomaly cases (d) or allocation to another group. A web-based system for review of cases has been developed, which allows easy and fast review of many cases and transfer of the final decision back to the central database. If two geneticists agreed on a case classification, this was considered the final decision. If all three geneticists disagreed or one of them classified the case for query, the moderator made the final decision.

Thirty-two full-member registries covering 6,599,765 births provided 154,154 cases with one or more major congenital anomalies born between 2008 and 2016. Cases with chromosomal and genetic syndromes, skeletal dysplasias or hereditary skin disorders were excluded resulting in 123,566 cases for inclusion in this analysis.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^9939bc72]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11

ICD-11 will succeed ICD-10 as the current version of the ICD managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June, 2018. ICD-10 was completed in 1990, making the interval between versions 28 years, the longest interval in the history of the ICD. Work began on ICD-11 in 2007, with the intention to make a more comprehensive and computable version of the ICD than previously available. As an aside, readers should be aware that many countries create an expanded version of the WHO ICD revision, such as the United States (ICD-10-CM), Australia (ICD-10-AM), Canada (ICD-10-CA), and Germany (ICD-10-GM). An aspiration is that ICD-11 many not require any country-specific extensions.

Foundation component

A key architectural component of the ICD is the presence of a semantic network of words and terms, which forms the backbone of all statistical tabulations of the ICD-11 that derives from it. This the Foundation component, which is a large and deep polyhierarchy of medical concepts without any residual terms. The Foundation clearly violates the two conditions of a statistical classification, which remains the core use-case of the ICD; thus, a statistical tabulation must be created to accommodate the requirements of a statistical classification (below). However, the Foundation persists as a rich resource of terms, concepts, multiply parented relationships, and detail that is far in excess of what would be sensible in a statistical classification. As a practical matter, the Foundation semantic network has superseded the historical ICD index and become a basis for semi-automatic and algorithmic coding of terms into ICD rubrics.

Another novel feature of Foundation terms is that each has a small information model of globally unique identifiers (URIs), fully specified terms, definitions, synonyms, language variants, and many axial properties, such as options for anatomy, severity, extent, or etiology.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Clinical outcomes in neonates with congenital heart disease with concurrent congenital neurological anomalies [^0fbecfd2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

In this study, we used the nationally representative National Inpatient Sample database, spanning the years 2016–2020. A neonate was defined as any patient aged 28 days or younger. Inclusion required at least one hospital admission during the initial 28‑day window, regardless of whether it was the initial delivery admission or a readmission after discharge. Our analytical approach involved a categorization of CHD into three distinct subtypes: simple lesions, complex bi-ventricular lesions, and single ventricle lesions. Supplemental Table (1) This detailed categorization acknowledged the heterogeneity within the broader spectrum of CHD. We used categorization of congenital central nervous system conditions to include both brain and spine anomalies. Supplemental Table (2) We also stratified and evaluated the outcomes in the neonates who underwent surgical repair for CHD vs. those who did not during the admission.

To identify neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) and central nervous system anomalies, we utilized the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. For CHD we used International Classification of Diseases-10 codes Q20-Q26 and for central nervous system anomalies we used codes Q00- Q07 and further divided into brain, spinal cord and combined anomalies. ICD-10 codes Q00–Q01 encompass major neural tube defects, including anencephaly and encephalocele. Q02 designates microcephaly, while Q03 refers to congenital hydrocephalus. Q04 includes a range of other cerebral malformations, such as lissencephaly and holoprosencephaly. Q05 and Q06 cover spina bifida and additional spinal cord anomalies, and Q07 captures other specified congenital disorders of the nervous system. Supplemental Table 2 We excluded the neonates with chromosomal anomalies and known genetic conditions. Simple or mild CHD encompasses conditions such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and other septal defects. Single ventricle lesions consisted of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia/stenosis, aortic atresia/stenosis, and common ventricle. The remaining lesions were classified as biventricular complex lesions. Supplementary Table 1.

To evaluate baseline characteristics, we employed descriptive statistics to compare the characteristics of neonates presenting with isolated CHD against those with concurrent CNS anomalies.

Our primary objective was to describe disparities in mortality rates between neonates with isolated CHD and those presenting with concurrent CNS anomalies for both surgical and non-surgical neonates in each complexity of CHD category. Our secondary objectives entails a comparative analysis of associated clinical complications.

The software tools Stata version 15 and RStudio were used for data analysis and statistical modeling. We used ggplot for figures.

### Pediatric sleep apnea and craniofacial anomalies: a population-based case-control study [^8d3bf27b]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between craniofacial anomalies and diagnosis with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a large, population-based sample of children.

Design

Retrospective case-control study.

Methods

Cases of OSA (n = 1,203) were identified by International Classification of Diseases-9 codes consistent with OSA in the 1987–2003 Washington State inpatient discharge database among children ≤ 18 years of age and born in Washington state. For each case, five controls without OSA (n = 6,015) were randomly selected from the remaining Washington State births, frequency matched by birth year. Congenital anomaly diagnoses and covariates were extracted from discharge data for all inpatient hospitalizations during the study period and linked birth certificate data. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between congenital anomalies (including subgroups) and OSA.

Results

An OSA diagnosis was strongly associated with the presence of any craniofacial anomaly (adjusted OR 38, 95%CI [24, 60]) and, in particular, with orofacial cleft (adjusted OR 40, 95%CI [17, 94]) and Down syndrome (adjusted OR 51, 95%CI [20, 128]). OSA was less associated with any noncraniofacial malformation (adjusted OR 4.1, 95%CI [3.1, 5.3]), which may reflect the relatively small effect of inpatient exposure bias in the associations above.

Conclusions

The presence of congenital craniofacial anomalies is strongly associated with inpatient diagnosis of OSA. These findings persist even after control of major potential biases. Parents and clinicians should consider screening for OSA among children with craniofacial anomalies.

### Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma and associated ocular and systemic features: understanding the spectrum [^dfdbcf20]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma form an interrelated spectrum of congenital eye abnormalities.

Objective

To document the ocular and systemic findings and inheritance patterns in patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma disease to gain insight into the underlying developmental etiologies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective consecutive case series was conducted at a tertiary referral center. Included in the study were 141 patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma disease without a recognized syndromic etiology who attended the Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney, from 1981–2012.

Exposure

Cases were grouped on the basis of the presence or absence of an optic fissure closure defect (OFCD); those with OFCD were further subdivided into microphthalmic and nonmicrophthalmic cases. Anophthalmic cases were considered as a separate group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Associated ocular and systemic abnormalities and inheritance patterns were assessed.

Results

Of 141 cases, 61 (43%) were microphthalmic non-OFCD (NOFCD), 34 (24%) microphthalmic OFCD, 32 (23%) nonmicrophthalmic coloboma (OFCD), 9 (6%) anophthalmic, and 5 (4%) were unclassified. Sixty-three (45%) had bilateral disease. Eighty-four patients (60%) had an associated ocular abnormality; of these, cataract (P < .001) and posterior segment anomalies (P < .001) were most common in the NOFCD group. Forty-eight (34%) had an associated systemic abnormality, most commonly neurological, musculoskeletal and facial, urological and genital, or cardiac. Neurological abnormalities were most common in the anophthalmic group (P = 0.003), while urological abnormalities were particularly seen in the OFCD groups (P = 0.009). Familial cases were identified in both the OFCD and NOFCD groups, with a likely autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in 9 of 10 families.

Conclusions and Relevance

This series indicated that the OFCD/NOFCD distinction may be useful in guiding evaluation for ocular and systemic associations, as well as the direction and analysis of genetic investigation.

### Perinatal airway management mandibular anomalies: a national inpatient cohort analysis [^5c3fdd16]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis identified 32,185 weighted individuals with a BHDD of mandibular anomaly and yielded a mean weighted incidence of 119 per 100,000 birth visits. This incidence is significantly higher than a prior nationwide database analysis of micrognathia from 2000 to 2012 that reported 999 cases out of 19,638,453 (5 per 100,000 births). Notably, the prior analysis included only live born infants with a single diagnostic code for micrognathia, ICD‐9 code 52404. Patients were segregated into micrognathia with and without cleft palate; however, patients with cleft lip and palate were not utilized in their analysis. Perinatal airway interventions were not examined.

The present study aimed specifically to differentiate presentations and predictive data. The coding algorithm was designed in collaboration with a certified professional coder to capture the clinical spectrum of mandibular anomalies and accompanying phenotypic features that might be identifiable prenatally. Accordingly, we broadened the coded definition for micrognathia and added retrognathia, syndromic micrognathia, micrognathia plus cleft palate or cleft lip and palate, agnathia/micrognathia plus cervical auricle/otocephaly, and agnathia/micrognathia plus microstomia. After reviewing the data, we advocate for a broader definition of congenital mandibular anomalies given the high rate of perinatal airway interventions and hypoxic complications demonstrated across the BHDD of mandibular anomaly phenotype spectrum.

Preterm delivery was more frequent in each group of individuals with BHDD of mandibular anomaly. The potential for preterm delivery is recognized among patients with potential perinatal airway obstruction, including micrognathia, and is recommended to be accounted for in prenatal planning. This study is the first to report the relative frequency of preterm delivery in a large population with mandibular anomalies. Further, the data show variable risk of preterm delivery according to phenotype. Individuals with mandibular anomalies and accompanying features such as cleft palate, cervical auricle/otocephaly, and microstomia have the highest rate of preterm delivery. The KID data does not include linkage to maternal records, and presentation for scheduled delivery dates and presentation in labor were not differentiated. Future investigations should integrate fetal and maternal factors that predict preterm delivery such as presence of polyhydramnios.

### Risk estimates of recurrent congenital anomalies in the UK: a population-based register study [^3b9363fd]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Identification of recurrent cases

Mothers with recurrent pregnancies affected by congenital anomaly were identified from the NorCAS maternal index number, a unique number given to each new mother when first recorded on the database. The mother's National Health Service (NHS) number (complete from 2003 onwards), name, date of birth, postcode of residence and hospital of delivery, as well as the baby's details were used to cross-validate all recurrent pregnancies and identify duplicate records.

Definitions and classification of congenital anomalies

The NorCAS records text descriptions and WHO ICD-10 codes for up to six individual congenital anomalies per case. These were categorised into group (the organ system affected, e.g. 'cardiovascular'), subtype (the specific condition, e.g. 'coarctation of the aorta') and syndrome (e.g. 'DiGeorge syndrome') based on EUROCAT guidelines. Cases with more than one ICD code were assigned a primary diagnosis using a hierarchical approach with the highest allocated from: (1) chromosomal syndromes (anomalies of chromosomal number or structure, e.g. 'Down syndrome'); (2) genetic syndromes (patterns of anomalies arising from a single gene, e.g. 'DiGeorge syndrome'); (3) skeletal dysplasias (syndromes of skeletal development, e.g. 'osteogenesis imperfecta'); (4) other genetic anomalies (resulting from microdeletions or mutations, e.g. 'neurofibromatosis'); or (5) other syndromes of non-genetic origin (recognised patterns of anomalies, with or without a known cause, e.g. 'Noonan syndrome').

Isolated cases were allocated to their primary anomaly group and subtype. Cases with two or more structural anomalies were reviewed to identify a primary group or subtype or to assign a diagnosis of multiple anomalies (two or more unrelated structural anomalies across separate organs). More details of the classification principles are described elsewhere.

Congenital anomalies occurring in successive pregnancies of the same woman were considered 'similar' if they belonged to the same group (e.g. cardiovascular) or the same syndromic group (e.g. chromosomal syndromes), regardless of the specific subtypes, and 'dissimilar' if they belonged to different groups.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Alport syndrome, more specifically with respect to hearing assessment, ERA/ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a hearing evaluation at diagnosis or upon reaching adulthood in female patients with X-linked alport syndrome, and then every 5 years in the absence of hearing loss symptoms.

### Methadone, Pierre robin sequence and other congenital anomalies: case-control study [^be6b5a05]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Methadone is a vital treatment for women with opioid use disorder in pregnancy. Previous reports suggested an association between methadone exposure and Pierre Robin sequence (PRS), a rare craniofacial anomaly. We assessed the association between gestational methadone exposure and PRS.

Design/Setting

This case-malformed control study used European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies population-based registries in Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Malta, Portugal, Germany, Wales, Norway and Spain, 1995–2011.

Patients

Cases included PRS based on International Classification of Disease (ICD), Ninth Edition-British Paediatric Association (BPA) code 75603 or ICD, Tenth Edition-BPA code Q8708. Malformed controls were all non-PRS anomalies, excluding genetic conditions, among live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks' gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. An exploratory analysis assessed the association between methadone exposure and other congenital anomalies (CAs) excluding PRS. Methadone exposure was ascertained from medical records and maternal interview.

Results

Among 87 979 CA registrations, there were 127 methadone-exposed pregnancies and 336 PRS cases. There was an association between methadone exposure and PRS (OR adjusted for registry 12.3, 95%CI 5.7 to 26.8). In absolute terms, this association reflects a risk increase from approximately 1–12 cases per 10000 births. A raised OR was found for cleft palate (adjusted OR 5.0, 95%CI 2.7 to 9.2).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that gestational methadone exposure is associated with PRS. The association may be explained by unmeasured confounding factors. The small increased risk of PRS in itself does not alter the risk-benefit balance for gestational methadone use. The association with cleft palate, a more common CA, should be assessed with independent data.

### Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: consensus guidelines from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^ea6cd846]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

ICD-10 coding for CF and other CFTR dysfunction — primary ICD-10 codes include CF, unspecified (E84.9), CF, with meconium ileus (E84.11), CF with other intestinal manifestations (eg, DIOS) (E84.19), and CF, with pulmonary manifestations (E84.0). For CFSPID, use P09 (abnormal findings on neonatal screening) or E88.89 (if CRMS/CFSPID is adopted as the preferred terminology). A secondary code option is Z14.1 (CF carrier status).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Gorlin syndrome: the PTCH gene links ocular developmental defects and tumour formation [^92dcd916]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify a gene linking microphthalmia with cyst with early onset medulloblastoma.

Methods

Mutation analysis of the PTCH gene.

Results

A mutation in exon 10 of the PTCH gene was identified, confirming a diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome.

Conclusions

This is the first genetically identified mutation giving rise to microphthalmia with cyst and provides a valuable link in the eye developmental gene pathway.

### Hospitalizations in people with down syndrome across age groups: a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^0393f5ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses

We classified the primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses based on ICD-10 codes and classified these into six main disease groups as most relevant due to their prevalence and clinical importance: circulatory system (I00–I99), infectious diseases (A00–B99), digestive system (K00–K95), nervous system (G00–G99), neoplasms (C00–D49), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00–N99). Congenital malformations of the nervous system (Q00–Q07) were subclassified in the nervous system diseases, congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20–Q28) were subclassified in the circulatory system diseases, and congenital malformations of the digestive system (Q38–Q45) in the digestive system diseases, respectively. Furthermore, we classified the following infectious diseases classified elsewhere in ICD-10 as infectious diseases: respiratory infections (J00–J22), infectious arthropathies (M00–M02), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00–G09). Secondary diagnoses are defined diseases diagnosed according to ICD-10 and include both acute and chronic diagnoses. Physiognomic or expected features of Down syndrome could not be assessed, since they are not part of the ICD-10 catalogue and are hence not documented in the nationwide dataset used in this study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations characterized by the incidence rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 population person-years, displayed across age groups and stratified by primary reasons for hospitalization. Secondary outcomes comprised (i) the number of diagnoses per hospitalized patient over lifetime, (ii) length of hospital stay (LOS) — defined as days spent in the hospital during the hospitalization, (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, (iv) mechanical ventilation rate, (v) length of ICU stay, (vi) all-cause in-hospital mortality, and (vii) 30-day all-cause hospital readmission.

### Long term trends in prevalence of neural tube defects in Europe: population based study [^42b7a483]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources

Since 1980, the EUROCAT central database has held individual anonymised records of cases of congenital anomaly occurring for full member registries and aggregate data for associate member registries, including live births, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestational age, and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Information on each of the registries, including methods of case ascertainment and local procedures regarding ethics approval for the registries' activities and their collaborations with EUROCAT, are available on the EUROCAT website and in the publication by Greenlees et al. All registries use ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, 9th revision) or ICD-10 with BPA extension to code up to nine syndrome or malformation codes for each case.

All cases that were not associated with a chromosomal anomaly and had a diagnostic code corresponding to a neural tube defect (ICD-9 740–742 and ICD-10 Q00, Q01, Q05) were included for full and associate EUROCAT registries that could provide data from both the 1990s and the 2000s; most registries provided data for the entire, or almost the entire, time period between 1991 and 2011 (table 1). We extracted data on 11 353 cases of NTD, including 4162 cases of anencephaly (ICD-9 740 and ICD-10 Q00), 5776 cases of spina bifida (ICD-9 741 and ICD-10 Q05), and 1415 cases of encephalocele (ICD-9 7420 and ICD-10 Q01), from 28 registries in 19 countries covering approximately 12.5 million births, in October 2013 for the analysis of time trends in total and live birth prevalence of NTD between 1991 and 2011.

Table 1
Total and live birth prevalence of neutral tube defects in study population, European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT), 1991–2011

*Total number comprises cases of anencephaly, spina bifida, and encephalocele.

†Higher prevalence of neural tube defects (NTD), specifically spina bifida, has been consistent observation in Mainz; substantial fluctuations in prevalence of NTD in Mainz occurred over time, however (as in other registries), and no evidence was found that lack of clear downward trend in prevalence of NTD in overall data could be explained by any changes in Mainz.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures; nor were they involved in design and implementation of the study. There are no plans to involve patients in dissemination.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Increased prevalence of some birth defects in Korea, 2009–2010 [^180d7b79]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

However, the results in this study must be interpreted in the context of some limitations. The study cannot avoid the methodological limitation of insurance based data analysis. Diagnostic criteria, coding and the timing for follow-up of outpatients might vary in the hospitals, and further validation of the diagnosis was difficult with the insurance database analysis due to lack of detailed records. For example, some newborns with birth defects might have died before entering the hospital, although the number of such patients should be rare. In addition, ICD-9 codes were used to specify birth defects for years 1993–1994, while ICD-10 was used to classify birth defects for 2009–2010. Two versions of disease classification differ substantially. The change to the tenth revision resulted in more detailed classification, with about 8,000 categories compared with about 5,000 categories in the ninth revision. The relatively large difference of some birth defects reported between 1993–1994 and 2009–2010 may be due to the switch from ICD-9 to ICD-10. This study used a comparable category of codes for 26 selected defects according to the ninth and tenth revisions. However, there may be an important underlying variation to case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria (inclusion or exclusion of minor cases) which may have given higher reported rates in some birth defects. A study found the comparability ratio of 0.9064 between ICD-10 and ICD-9 while explaining congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities as a cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, this study is helpful in understanding increased prevalence of some important birth defects in Korea.

### Real-world clinical and molecular management of 50 prospective patients with microphthalmia, anophthalmia and / or ocular coloboma [^7a1a3ac4]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microphthalmia, anophthalmia and ocular coloboma (MAC) fall within the same phenotypic spectrum of ocular maldevelopment. Anophthalmia is defined as no visible ocular globe, while microphthalmia consists of a small eye (axial length ≥ 2 SD below the normal axial length), both of which are caused by disrupted eye development, resulting in failure to initiate or premature arrest of oculogenesis. Ocular coloboma is a persistent inferonasal tissue defect arising from incomplete fusion of the optic fissure, affecting one or more structures including the iris, ciliary body and retina.MAC may present in one or both eyes (unilateral/bilateral) and can occur in combination (mixed) within the same eye or contralateral eyes. MAC can be simplex, with no additional ocular complications, but frequently manifests with complex associated features including cataracts and anterior segment dysgenesis. Furthermore, between 33% and 95% of patients display extraocular involvement (syndromic).MAC has a combined prevalence of between 1 and 4 live births per 10 000and often results in reduced visual acuity, contributing up to 15% of childhood blindness and severe visual impairment worldwide.

Genetic or environmental factors disturbing eye development from 3 weeks of gestation can cause MAC by altering molecular signalling pathways regulating oculogenesis. Over 100 monogenic associations with MAC have been identified as well as large chromosomal anomalies detected in up to 15% of patients through conventional cytogenetics, although lower rates are reported in non-syndromic cohorts (8%). Clinical heterogeneity in MAC cohorts is partially due to the spectrum of causative genes playing diverse roles in controlling multiorgan/tissue development. Discovering genotype–phenotype correlations can guide patient management and genetic counselling. While a genetic cause can be identified in 80% of bilateral severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia patients, only 10% of unilateral patients typically receive a molecular diagnosis. Improving molecular diagnostic rates through increased genetic testing and identification of novel variants will improve understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships.

This study reports clinical evaluation and genetic testing results of 50 MAC patients referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) NHS Foundation Trust ocular genetics service prospectively over a 29-month period.

### Inbreeding, native American ancestry and child mortality: linking human selection and paediatric medicine [^ddc2eeb7]. Human Molecular Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Number of deaths before the age of 5 years and SMRs due to common childhood diseases per Mb in SROH, 1% proportion of Aymara–Quechua and 1% proportion of Mapuche–Huilliche genetic ancestry

n.e.c.: not elsewhere classified. Bold represents associated probability values smaller than 0.05/23 investigated diseases = 0.002.

To examine the robustness of the identified associations, we inspected visually the relationship between gender-specific mortality rates, SROH and ancestry, and performed gender-stratified regression analyses. Figure 2A shows the scatterplot for SROH and disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight, not elsewhere classified (ICD-10 code P07). Results are represented in red for young girls and blue for young boys. The corresponding estimated SMRs are shown in Supplementary Material, Table S3. Opposite associations were noticed for young girls (1% risk decrease) and young boys (3% risk increase per Mb in SROH). Results for young girls strongly depended on the data from De Maule region, which showed the highest average SROH (76.2 Mb). However, effect estimates for males and females were even more different after exclusion of this high-leverage observation (6% risk decrease for young girls, data not shown).

### Classification systems of cleft lip, alveolus and palate: results of an international survey [^9dcff628]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

More recently, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) system has been promoted for both epidemiology and reimbursement. The ICD system is used in the WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project, which has made reporting by ICD codes required for most governmental health registries. Healthcare payers in both Europe and North America have also mandated use of the ICD system for reimbursements. These two forces have led to broad implementation of the ICD system, despite concerns with its lack of specificity, mutual exclusivity, and comprehensiveness for classifying OFCs.

It is prudent to make a difference between registration and classification of clefts. For example, the ICD-10 classification, although described as a "classification", is actually a registration process for coding and categorization of disease as opposed to being designed for the primary purpose of classification per se. This article makes no particular distinction between registration and classification systems.

As a result of great variety in possible classification systems, craniofacial specialists often use different classification systems. This hampers mutual understanding, communication and treatment outcome comparison among specialists and prevents the development of a uniform prevalence/incidence system. The aim of this article is to describe which classification systems are used globally, including their perceived indications and limitations. Furthermore, it aims to make a recommendation on which system is most suitable for global implementation so development of a global prevalence system and improvement of scientific data comparison is achievable.

### Rethinking non-syndromic hearing loss and its mimics in the genomic era [^3f612381]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Scenario 2: The syndrome presents mildly and goes unnoticed

In other instances, the indicators of a syndrome may already be present but in a mild or atypical manner, resulting in their oversight. In such examples, syndromes are clinically identified through retrospective evaluation following molecular genetic testing. Enhancing diagnostic accuracy can occasionally be achieved through a thorough dysmorphology assessment, which can reveal subtle dysmorphisms. As an example, the identification of dystopia canthorum in Waardenburg Syndrome type I through eye measurements illustrates the importance of a meticulous physical examination in uncovering syndromic features that may not be immediately evident. Another example pertains to missed abnormal branchial arches and kidneys in patients with branchio-oto-renal syndrome, where hearing loss typically starts at birth. In many cases, the degree of subtlety of the syndromic findings does not merit a clinical diagnosis or meet diagnostic criteria of the associated syndrome. The broad spectrum of presentation and sheer number of hearing loss syndromes makes the probability of encountering such a scenario in clinical practice a possibility.

An early diagnosis of a non-syndromic mimic was unattainable before advanced molecular genetic testing. In fact, it was not until the widespread adoption of such testing that the term "non-syndromic mimic" emerged and only recently has it been possible to grasp an appreciation of its prevalence. However, estimating the occurrence of non-syndromic mimics continues to prove challenging, often relying on the recognition of healthcare professionals and a progressively refined understanding of the natural progression of such syndromes. Identifying genes that mimic non-syndromic hearing loss remains a hurdle. Nevertheless, it is crucial to raise awareness and the growing volume of reports detailing unusual natural progressions. Early identification of syndromes remains imperative, enabling prompt referral of affected individuals to specialists, facilitating tailored interventions, and enhancing prognostic accuracy.

### Disease trajectory browser for exploring temporal, population-wide disease progression patterns in 7.2 million Danish patients [^0e06aa70]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We present the Danish Disease Trajectory Browser (DTB), a tool for exploring almost 25 years of data from the Danish National Patient Register. In the dataset comprising 7.2 million patients and 122 million admissions, users can identify diagnosis pairs with statistically significant directionality and combine them to linear disease trajectories. Users can search for one or more disease codes (ICD-10 classification) and explore disease progression patterns via an array of functionalities. For example, a set of linear trajectories can be merged into a disease trajectory network displaying the entire multimorbidity spectrum of a disease in a single connected graph. Using data from the Danish Register for Causes of Death mortality is also included. The tool is disease-agnostic across both rare and common diseases and is showcased by exploring multimorbidity in Down syndrome (ICD-10 code Q90) and hypertension (ICD-10 code I10). Finally, we show how search results can be customized and exported from the browser in a format of choice (i.e. JSON, PNG, JPEG and CSV).

### Optimal diagnostic and treatment practices for facial dysostosis syndromes: a clinical consensus statement among European experts [^28c4a967]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Facial dysostosis syndromes (FDS) are rare congenital conditions impacting facial development, often leading to diverse craniofacial abnormalities. This study addresses the scarcity of evidence on these syndromes about optimal diagnostic and treatment practices. To overcome this scarcity, European experts from ERN CRANIO collaborated to develop a clinical consensus statement through the Delphi consensus method. A systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases was conducted until February 2023. The quality of evidence was evaluated using various tools depending on the study design. Statements were subsequently formed based on literature and expert opinion, followed by a Delphi process with expert health care providers and patient representatives. In total, 92 experts from various specialties and three patient representatives were involved in the Delphi process. Over 3 voting rounds, consensus was achieved on 92 (46.9%), 58 (59.2%), and 19 (70.4%) statements, respectively. These statements cover the topics of general care; craniofacial reconstruction; the eyes and lacrimal system; upper airway management; genetics; hearing; speech; growth, feeding, and swallowing; dental treatment and orthodontics; extracranial anomalies; and psychology and cognition. The current clinical consensus statement provides valuable insights into optimal diagnostic and treatment practices and identifies key research opportunities for FDS. This consensus statement represents a significant advancement in FDS care, underlining the commitment of health care professionals to improve the understanding and management of these rare syndromes in Europe.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Lenalidomide [^653a8818]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to lenalidomide during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to lenalidomide. This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy. Report any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also to the Lenalidomide REMS at 1-888-423-5436.

Risk Summary

Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] and findings from animal studies [see Data], lenalidomide can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4.1), and Use in Specific Populations (5.1)].

Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue. Thalidomide is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants.

### How well doCodes predict true congenital heart defects? A centers for disease control and prevention-based multisite validation project [^7c95c4c3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Ideally, constructing an algorithm that utilizes data from administrative and eHRs will help to identify true CHD cases with improved accuracy and sensitivity. Machine learning is one possibility to improve both the PPV and sensitivity of CHD codes for CHD, and specific CHD type, based on ICD codes and other variables from clinical and administrative data sets, using the most predictive factors, while reducing the false negative rate. Restricting analyses to certain ICD codes and age categories may also improve the PPV. As a result of the current findings and previous research, researchers may consider excluding the following codes from administrative data sets to improve the PPV for analyses seeking to study CHD:
ICD‐9‐CM and anatomically equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes that code for conditions other than heart defects, including congenital heart block (746.86, Q24.6), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (747.32, Q25.72), absent/hypoplastic umbilical artery (747.5, Q27.0), other anomalies of peripheral vascular system (747.6x, Q27.9), and other specified anomalies of circulatory system (747.8x, Q28.8). These codes were also excluded in the surveillance methodology.
The "Other" CHD anatomic group (as noted in Figure 1 and Data S1) and nonspecific ICD‐9‐CM codes and the equivalent ICD‐10‐CM codes including: other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.8 (Q24.8), obstructive anomalies of heart, not elsewhere classified 746.84, coronary artery anomaly 746.85 (Q24.5), malposition of heart and cardiac apex 746.87 (Q24.0), other specified congenital anomalies of heart 746.89 (Q24.8), unspecified congenital anomaly of heart 746.9 (Q24.9), other congenital anomalies of aorta 747.2 (Q25.49), anomaly of aorta, unspecified 747.20 (Q25.40), anomalies of aortic arch 747.21, other anomalies of aorta 747.29 (Q25.49), congenital anomalies of great veins 747.4 (Q26.1), anomaly of great veins, unspecified 747.40 (Q26.9), other anomalies of great veins 747.49 (Q26.8), unspecified anomaly of circulatory system 747.9 (Q28.9, personal history of congenital malformations of heart and circulatory system V13.65 (Z87.74)

### An introduction to standardized clinical nomenclature for dysmorphic features: the elements of morphology project [^b6f0bf85]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Human structural malformations (anomalies or birth defects) have an enormous and complex range of manifestations and severity. The description of these findings can be challenging because the variation of many of the features is continuous and only some of them can be objectively assessed (that is, measured), among other factors. An international group of clinicians resolved to develop a set of terms that could be used to describe human structural malformations, under the general project name 'Elements of Morphology'. Here, the background to the project, progress to date, and the practical implementation of the terminology in research reporting is discussed.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Vitreoretinopathy-associated pediatric retinal detachment treatment outcomes: IRIS® registry (intelligent research in sight) analysis [^7bcd67fd]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of patients who were documented with a vitreoretinopathy and were younger than 18 years at the time of diagnosis with an RD between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2019. Cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 and 10 diagnostic codes from the IRIS Registry cohort. Data from the IRIS Registry are deidentified and do not require patient-level consent. This study abides by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study Sample

ICD codes were used to identify RRD (H33.00–05, 361.00–05), proliferative vitreoretinopathy (H35.2, 362.2) tractional RD (H33.4, 361.81), hemorrhagic RD (H35.73, 362.43), and other specified congenital malformations, such as Stickler syndrome (Q89.8∗, 759.89∗), Marfan syndrome (Q87.4∗, 759.82∗), or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Q76.9∗, 756.83∗). Other hereditary vitreoretinopathies that are not encoded by specific ICD code(s) were captured by text search for the following terms: Stickler syndrome, Wagner syndrome, Jansen syndrome, Marshall syndrome, Knobloch syndrome, juvenile retinoschisis, snowflake degeneration, erosive vitreoretinopathy, Kneist dysplasia, and Goldman Favre/enhanced S-cone syndrome. Nonspecific vitreous abnormality ICD codes were also included for other disorders of the vitreous (H43.8, 379.21, 379.27, 379.29), vitreous degeneration (H43.819), vitreous membranes and strands (H43.31, 379.25), unspecified disorder of vitreous (H43.9), congenital malformation of vitreous humor (Q14.08, 743.51), unspecified retinoschisis (361.10), and other retinoschisis and retinal cysts (H33.19, 361.19). The exclusion criteria included traumatic RDs via the ICD codes for ocular trauma (S05.90XA, 918.9) and serous or exudative RD (H33.20, 361.2). The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to generate the study population are summarized in Figure 1.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Prenatal findings in children with early postnatal diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome [^663d5650]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background

CHARGE syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome caused by mutations in CHD7. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed to improve diagnosis in fetuses at clinicopathological survey, but no criteria exist for fetal diagnosis during pregnancy.

Method

We collected prenatal findings of 12 children with CHARGE syndrome diagnosed in the first 3months and a CHD7 mutation. We retrieved data on prenatal ultrasound (US) follow-up, fetal supplementary investigations, and results of postnatal evaluation.

Result

Seven pregnancies were complicated by the identification of isolated or multiple congenital anomalies. CHARGE syndrome was suspected in three fetuses but could not be confirmed despite additional examinations. Retrospectively, several postnatal findings could have been seen if they had been specifically searched. Intrauterine growth restriction, previously proposed as an exclusion criterion, complicated two pregnancies and is thus compatible with the diagnosis.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome remains difficult during pregnancy. If the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is raised in utero, we suggest a careful US examination to identify typical external ears, choanal atresia, or microphthalmia. Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful, but a normal result does not exclude the diagnosis. When CHARGE syndrome is highly suspected, CHD7 molecular analysis must be proposed to confirm the diagnosis. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Mouse models for microphthalmia, anophthalmia and cataracts [^86677e78]. Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blindness in children is a very severe condition affecting ~ 14 million children worldwide (Solebo et al.). Among them, cataracts are the major subgroup affecting 28% of the cases (Solebo et al.); the prevalence of congenital cataracts ranges from 0.32 to 22.9/10,000 children in different geographic regions over the world (Sheeladavi et al.). Similarly, the prevalence of anophthalmia/microphthalmia has been estimated between 0.2 and 3.0 per 10,000 births (summarized by Llorente-González et al.) with an incidence of congenital anophthalmia (in England) ranging from 0.4 to 2.9 per 100,000 infants and an incidence of congenital microphthalmia ranging from 10.0 to 10.8 per 100,000 children (Dharmasena et al.). Although these eye disorders are rare, they represent a major challenge for the treating clinicians and for the families, who have to fight the diseases. Discussing the reasons for such severe disorders, we have to consider prenatal environmental factors such as intrauterine infections or toxins, but also genetic reasons. Here, we will focus on these genetic aspects leading to anophthalmia, microphthalmia or congenital cataracts. Summaries of the human cases have been published recently (e.g. Reis and Semina; Anand et al.); therefore, in this review, I will concentrate on mouse models, because the mouse is genetically the best characterized mammalian model system for hereditary diseases, particularly, if they affect the eye.

### Evaluation of research diagnostic criteria in craniofacial microsomia [^f411a918]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

It is also questionable whether craniofacial microsomia is a true distinct entity. It is a syndrome with a specific phenotype as delineated in by the Pruzansky-Kaban and O.M.E.N.S. classification. CFM is heterogeneous, without showing clusters of specific patient groups. Some articles showed that CFM occurs more frequently in certain families, is related to specific pre-natal factors, or associated with genetic mutations. – Nonetheless, the pathophysiology of CFM is yet unknown. Besides the facial anomalies, extra craniofacial anomalies might occur too. The heterogenic presentation, overlapping or possibly co-occurring with other syndromes might indicate that CFM is not a distinct entity but could be seen as a developmental disorder that constitute to a spectrum. This spectrum, varying in type and severity of affected structures, might include syndromes like the VACTERL association, limb-body wall complex or Mullerian duct aplasia, renal anomalies, cervicothoracic somite dysplasia (MURCS), and could be described as a "recurrent constellation of embryonic malformations" (RCEM). By abandoning the idea that CFM is a distinct entity but part of a spectrum with other developmental disorders, a RCEM, many more patients with overlapping features can be studied. This also advocates the use of eligibility criteria instead of diagnostic criteria.

There are some limitations in this study. An analysis on the specificity could not be performed as no control group with the characteristics of other craniofacial syndromes was included. The large cohort of CFM patients enabled us to study these criteria. Comparing the outcomes with other syndromes, which also creates the ability to identify diagnostic criteria using logistic regression, was not considered possible due to the high number of patients with other, rare, craniofacial syndromes that needed to be included.

Another consideration of this study is the included CFM cohort. All patients were identified using after a thorough search using search terms in all electronic patient management systems. After receiving the diagnosis CFM by an experienced craniofacial surgeon/team, the diagnosis was verified using radiographic or clinical images by peers. Nonetheless, no strict inclusion criteria were set-up to include the patients. As there is no 'golden standard' for CFM, the included cohort is based on an extensive approach to create a reproducible group of patients based on double checked clinical evaluation. By using this cohort, we can study whether the theoretically developed criteria match clinical patients with CFM, enabling future prospective research to include a well-defined cohort of patient with CFM.

### Thalidomide (Thalomid) [^63456bcf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], human and animal data (see Data), THALOMID can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

THALOMID is a human teratogen, inducing a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects such as amelia (absence of limbs), phocomelia (short limbs), hypoplasticity of the bones, absence of bones, external ear abnormalities (including anotia, micropinna, small or absent external auditory canals), facial palsy, eye abnormalities (anophthalmos, microphthalmos), and congenital heart defects. Alimentary tract, urinary tract, and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40% of infants. Even a single dose taken by a pregnant woman can cause birth defects. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus.

If pregnancy does occur during treatment, immediately discontinue the drug. Under these conditions, refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. Report any suspected fetal exposure to THALOMID to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088 and also the REMS Call Center at 1-888-423-5436.

Thalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant hamsters (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.
