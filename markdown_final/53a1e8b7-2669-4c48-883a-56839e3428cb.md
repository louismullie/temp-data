## Question

As a community-based nurse at a Sea Mar clinic in South Park, two effective interventions can be implemented to support families in accessing financial resources like the Washington Basic Food Program and SNAP. First, organizing community outreach and education workshops can help families understand available food assistance programs and the application process. These workshops would be tailored to meet linguistic needs by providing materials in English and Spanish, and could involve partnerships with local schools and community centers. By inviting representatives from food assistance programs, families can receive expert guidance and hands-on help with applications, creating a supportive environment that encourages participation. Second, implementing mobile assistance clinics can bring resources directly to the community. This initiative would involve a mobile unit staffed with bilingual nurses and social workers who can assist families with on-site applications for food assistance. By establishing a regular schedule for these mobile clinics at accessible locations, families can not only receive help with applications but also connect with additional health and social services, creating a comprehensive support network. Together, these interventions aim to enhance awareness and access to vital resources, ultimately improving the health and well-being of families in South Park.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about two community-based nursing interventions to improve SNAP/Basic Food access in South Park, Seattle, with explicit attention to evidence, equity, and implementation feasibility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical and public health rationale for addressing food insecurity and the role of SNAP. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting outreach/education and mobile assistance models. Next, I will examine equity and linguistic considerations, followed by implementation logistics and partnerships. After that, I should review expected outcomes and evaluation metrics. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically framed recommendation that aligns with best practices and available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale and baseline burden. Food insecurity is a social driver of health associated with higher risks of obesity, chronic disease, and adverse child development outcomes, and SNAP participation reduces food insecurity and is associated with lower healthcare expenditures, which strengthens the case for proactive screening and enrollment support in clinical-community settings [^114XVaTn] [^116mW5RM]. I should double-check the pediatric signal: children in food-insecure households have markedly higher odds of obesity, and participation in food assistance programs reduces food insecurity, underscoring the urgency of connecting families to SNAP and related resources [^114BZpVg] [^115PzR2U].

> Now, I will examine the evidence for community outreach and education workshops. Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness signals: providing food or monetary assistance reduces food insecurity, and SNAP-Ed has evidence of improving food security in the short term, which supports pairing education with concrete enrollment assistance during workshops [^116QYwhT] [^115zZYLF]. I need to ensure we incorporate screening and referral: the USPSTF recommends screening for food insecurity in primary care and linking to community resources, and nutrition professionals are advised to include food insecurity screening and referrals to SNAP/WIC/food banks during assessment, which can be operationalized in community workshops with on-site application support [^111JawaT] [^11321qax]. Hold on, I should verify equity considerations: racial disparities in food insecurity persist among nonparticipants, whereas disparities attenuate among SNAP participants, suggesting that targeted outreach to Black, Hispanic, and immigrant families can mitigate structural barriers and improve equity in access [^114mwccy] [^117JSvGW].

> Next, I should review the evidence for mobile assistance clinics. Let me consider analogous models: nurse home visitation programs demonstrate high penetration and meaningful connections to community resources, supporting the feasibility of deploying nurses and social workers into the community for SNAP/WIC enrollment and wraparound services [^115oV567]. I should confirm that mobile, on-site enrollment reduces structural barriers; indeed, clinic-based navigation programs show substantial increases in SNAP and WIC uptake when services are embedded and accessible, which supports a mobile unit bringing enrollment assistance directly to neighborhoods with transportation and time constraints [^115VXmDv]. But wait, what if families prefer certain modalities? Caregiver preference studies indicate families often prefer assistance from benefits specialists or community health workers rather than clinicians alone, reinforcing the value of multidisciplinary staffing for mobile clinics [^112ZrJX8].

> I will now examine equity and linguistic tailoring. I need to ensure materials and staffing reflect the community's languages and cultural norms; the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics emphasizes culturally responsive programming and the need to address preferences and practices of diverse communities, which applies to SNAP outreach and education design in South Park's multilingual context [^111dVptJ]. Hold on, I should verify the local food environment angle: proximity to SNAP-authorized retailers, especially superstores and grocery stores, is associated with better diet quality among SNAP recipients, so situating mobile clinics near such retailers or transit-accessible hubs could synergize enrollment with improved food access and utilization [^111FbjGS] [^113MEbDt].

> Let me think about implementation logistics and partnerships. I should confirm that multi-sector collaboration improves reach and sustainability; the Task Force on Community Preventive Services and subsequent community implementation literature highlight that coalitions, formal coordination, and diverse partnerships are associated with more sustainable strategies, which is pertinent for maintaining outreach and mobile services beyond initial funding cycles [^116hHyXc]. I need to check that aligning with schools and community centers leverages trusted touchpoints; pediatric clinics have successfully embedded economic bundles that integrate SNAP/WIC enrollment with other family supports, providing a template for coordination with local institutions in South Park [^115VXmDv]. Hold on, I should verify that program design aligns with family preferences for delivery and staffing to maximize uptake and engagement [^112ZrJX8].

> Next, I should review expected outcomes and evaluation. I should double-check that SNAP participation reduces food insecurity and healthcare spending; observational and quasi-experimental data show SNAP enrollment is associated with lower subsequent healthcare expenditures in adults and improved food security, supporting the cost–benefit rationale for proactive enrollment efforts [^111ASFEj] [^116QYwhT]. Let me verify pediatric outcomes: SNAP and related programs reduce food insecurity in households with children, and while diet quality remains a concern, pairing SNAP with education and incentives yields stronger dietary improvements than education alone, which informs workshop content and follow-up supports [^116QYwhT] [^114Urkuk]. I need to ensure we measure meaningful metrics: validated food insecurity screens (e.g. Hunger Vital Sign), SNAP/WIC enrollment rates, connection to community resources, and, when feasible, dietary quality or utilization outcomes to capture impact and guide iterative improvement [^115PzR2U] [^111JawaT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought mobile clinics alone might be sufficient, but I should reconsider. Evidence suggests that combining information with tangible assistance and addressing access barriers yields stronger uptake than information alone; therefore, integrating outreach/education with mobile, on-site enrollment and linkage to retailers or food resources is more likely to be effective and equitable than either strategy in isolation [^116uH7Ze] [^114Urkuk]. I should confirm that this integrated approach also aligns with caregiver preferences for practical, family-centered supports delivered by benefits specialists or community health workers, reinforcing the multidisciplinary staffing model for mobile services [^112ZrJX8].

> Final synthesis: Two complementary, evidence-aligned interventions are recommended for South Park. First, community outreach and education workshops co-designed with local partners, offered in English and Spanish, featuring food insecurity screening, SNAP/WIC education, and on-site application assistance, can address awareness and administrative barriers. Second, regularly scheduled mobile assistance clinics staffed by bilingual nurses and social workers that provide SNAP/WIC enrollment, connections to local food resources, and referrals to health and social services, strategically positioned near SNAP-authorized retailers or transit-accessible hubs, can reduce access barriers and improve equity. Together, these interventions operationalize clinical-community integration, leverage evidence that SNAP reduces food insecurity and healthcare costs, and embed equity through linguistic and culturally responsive design, with evaluation using validated screens and enrollment metrics to demonstrate impact and guide continuous improvement [^111JawaT] [^111ASFEj] [^114mwccy] [^111FbjGS].

Two effective community-based nursing interventions to help families access financial resources for food assistance are: (1) **bilingual outreach and enrollment events** at trusted community sites (schools, churches, libraries) with on-site SNAP/Basic Food application assistance, nutrition education, and direct referrals to WIC and local food programs; and (2) **mobile SNAP enrollment units** staffed by nurses and community health workers that provide on-site screening, application support, and connections to additional social services. These interventions reduce barriers such as language, transportation, and stigma, and are supported by evidence that SNAP participation reduces food insecurity and improves health outcomes [^111dVptJ] [^116QYwhT] [^111ASFEj].

---

## Intervention 1: bilingual outreach and enrollment events

### Description

- **Setting**: Host events at trusted community locations (schools, churches, libraries, community centers).
- **Staffing**: Bilingual nurses and community health workers provide culturally sensitive assistance.
- **Services**: On-site SNAP/Basic Food application assistance, nutrition education, and direct referrals to WIC and local food programs.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with local organizations, schools, and faith-based groups to build trust and reach underserved families.

---

### Evidence base

- **Effectiveness**: SNAP participation reduces food insecurity by ~30% and improves dietary quality [^116QYwhT] [^114Urkuk].
- **Health outcomes**: SNAP is associated with lower healthcare expenditures and improved health outcomes [^111ASFEj] [^116mW5RM].
- **Barriers addressed**: Language, transportation, and stigma are key barriers to SNAP access; bilingual, on-site events directly address these [^116uH7Ze] [^111pjDdv].

---

### Implementation considerations

Implementation should include **identifying and partnering with trusted community organizations** to host events and promote participation. Provide **bilingual materials and interpreters** to ensure accessibility. Offer **on-site application assistance** to streamline enrollment and reduce administrative burdens. Integrate **nutrition education** to improve dietary choices and food security.

---

## Intervention 2: mobile SNAP enrollment units

### Description

Mobile SNAP enrollment units are **mobile clinics** staffed by nurses and community health workers that travel to underserved neighborhoods. Services include on-site screening for food insecurity, assistance with SNAP/Basic Food applications, and connections to additional social services (WIC, housing, healthcare). The approach prioritizes **convenience and accessibility** to reduce transportation and time barriers.

---

### Evidence base

Evidence shows that **multicomponent interventions** combining screening, application assistance, and referrals improve food security and health outcomes [^notfound]. Mobile clinics are effective for delivering health services and social support in underserved communities. SNAP participation is associated with reduced food insecurity and improved dietary quality [^116QYwhT].

---

### Implementation considerations

Implementation should include **securing funding and resources** for mobile units and staff. Develop **routes and schedules** based on community needs and demographics. Train staff in **cultural competency** and SNAP application processes. Integrate with local healthcare providers and social service agencies for comprehensive support.

Importance

Inadequate access to food is a risk factor for poor health and the effectiveness of federal programs targeting food insecurity, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), are well-documented. The associations between other types of interventions to provide adequate food access and food insecurity status, health outcomes, and health care utilization, however, are unclear.

Objective

To review evidence on the association between food insecurity interventions and food insecurity status, clinically-relevant health outcomes, and health care utilization among adults, excluding SNAP.

Data Sources

A systematic search for English-language literature was performed in PubMed Central and Cochrane Trials databases (inception to January 23, 2020), the Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network database (December 10, 2019); and the gray literature using Google (February 1, 2021).

Study Selection

Studies of any design that assessed the association between food insecurity interventions for adult participants and food insecurity status, health outcomes, and health care utilization were screened for inclusion. Studies of interventions that described addressing participants' food needs or reporting food insecurity as an outcome were included. Interventions were categorized as home-delivered food, food offered at a secondary site, monetary assistance in the form of subsidies or income supplements, food desert interventions, and miscellaneous.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was performed independently by 3 reviewers. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions) tool, and a modified version of the National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After Studies With No Control. The certainty of evidence was based on GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria and supplemented with mechanistic and parallel evidence. For outcomes within intervention categories with at least 3 studies, random effects meta-analysis was performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Food insecurity (measured through surveys; eg, the 2-item Hunger Vital Sign), health outcomes (eg, hemoglobin A 1c), and health care utilization (eg, hospitalizations, costs).

Results

A total of 39 studies comprising 170 605 participants were included (8 randomized clinical trials and 31 observational studies). Of these, 14 studies provided high-certainty evidence of an association between offering food and reduced food insecurity (pooled random effects; adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33–0.67). Ten studies provided moderate-certainty evidence of an association between offering monetary assistance and reduced food insecurity (pooled random effects; adjusted odds ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.84). There were fewer studies of the associations between interventions and health outcomes or health care utilization, and the evidence in these areas was of low or very low certainty that any food insecurity interventions were associated with changes in either.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review with meta-analysis found that providing food and monetary assistance was associated with improved food insecurity measures; however, whether it translated to better health outcomes or reduced health care utilization was unclear.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the society for nutrition education and behavior: food and nutrition programs for community-residing older adults [^111dVptJ]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2019). High credibility.

Community-based food and nutrition programs for older adults — participation and evolving needs are highlighted: Participation in community-based food and nutrition programs should enable older adults to remain healthy and independent. RDNs and NDTRs play an integral role in coordinating efforts among all community entities. By 2043, it is projected that the combined minority population will become the majority, and moving forward, it is important that these programs address the food preferences and practices of multiple cultures. Also, as use of technology increases, the traditional in-person nutrition education model may need re-examination. However, research is emerging that SNAP participation among older adults may lead to reduced use and costs associated with nursing homes and hospitalizations.

### Does state-level supplemental nutrition assistance program access reduce firearm mortality among black youth? A two-way fixed effects analysis of age-stratified and cause-specific outcomes across 22 states, 2000–2020 [^111c5mE7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings suggest several key directions for pediatric health policy and practice. First, expanding SNAP benefits could serve as an upstream strategy for reducing firearm violence exposure among Black youth. Recent literature indicates that pediatric healthcare providers can play an important role in screening for social needs, such as food insecurity to facilitate SNAP enrollment and other resource linkages among at-risk families, particularly those with adolescent children. Second, integrating economic support programs with community- and school-based youth violence prevention initiatives could enhance protective associations. This might include co-locating services or developing coordinated referral systems between social services and violence prevention programs. Third, special attention should focus on families with school-aged children, given the critical role of economic stability during adolescent development.

Future research should address several key questions raised by this study. First, investigators should explore potential mechanisms via qualitative analysis through which SNAP access influences community stability, community resources, social mobility, and social cohesion, focusing on how these factors mediate the relationship between economic support and firearm mortality. Second, studies should examine the combined associations of SNAP and other welfare policies to understand their collective impact on reducing firearm violence. Finally, longitudinal studies examining the temporal dynamics of SNAP benefits and their associations on long-term violence trends would offer valuable insights for designing sustainable interventions.

### Six recommendations for accelerating uptake of national food security screening in primary care settings [^1124jiv8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Food insecurity is the limited access to nutritious food that prevents people from living active and healthy lives. Importantly, it is associated with nutritional deficiency, obesity, and chronic disease health disparities across the United States. For the past decade, roughly one in eight US households was food insecure, with lower-income, minority households experiencing a greater burden. Over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an economic crisis for many individuals and the demand for food assistance has nearly doubled. Food assistance comes in many forms. Federally funded programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and school meal programs. These programs serve one in four Americans and actively work with non-profit and public organizations, such as food pantries and public schools to make healthy and nutritious food more accessible and affordable for children and low-income families.

A multi-sector response that integrates clinical care and community food assistance services is a powerful lever to ameliorate this growing crisis. Studies have demonstrated effective collaborations between primary care and community organizations to assist with chronic disease management through coordinated care and increased access to unmet social needs. Evidence also points to multi-sector interventions to address food insecurity in response to national organizations calling for clinical food security screening in primary care practice.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^1122PBfg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In preparation for synthesis, we first grouped all studies assessing the same intervention categories to identify which studies could be grouped under each preplanned comparison, and no changes to prespecified grouping were required. The comparison groups were based on the pre‐specified types of interventions listed in table 2: cash transfers (unconditional; conditional), income generation interventions, food vouchers, food subsidies, and social support interventions. Under each comparison, we tabulated the available data and time frames reported for each outcome, which helped identify what data were available, and thus where meta‐analysis was possible and where we had to synthesise using effect direction. A meta‐analysis was possible if the effect and variance estimates were available for all studies or could be calculated from the available data, and if all effect estimates were of the same type (e.g. OR or MD) or could be converted for the comparison (e.g. OR to SMD). Where necessary, we converted OR to SMD, MD to SMD, or MD to SMD to OR.

We prepared two additional types of tables to aid visualisation of available data. One was the 'Overview of included studies' table, summarising main characteristics and reported outcomes of included studies for each comparison (McKenzie 2019). In this table, we organised studies first by study design, with RCTs first followed by PCS, and second according to their overall risk of bias (low, unclear and then high risk of bias). The second type were tables with the results for individual studies, for each comparison, for scrutiny by the reader. The studies in these tables were also ordered according to their overall risk of bias.

We had planned to assess and discuss the implementation factors common to effective interventions, if this information was reported in included studies or in published process evaluations that are mentioned in the study report. However, there was insufficient information from included studies on this.

Interventions to Address Food Insecurity

The NIH workshop also explored the current evidence on clinical, policy, and community-based interventions and implementation approaches to address food insecurity and promote health equity. The workshop focused both on interventions, programs, and policies designed to reduce the prevalence and/or prevent vulnerable households from becoming food insecure, such as population-based strategies [e.g. the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)] and those that center on mitigating the adverse health or nutritional consequences of food insecurity.

Administered by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, the 16 federal nutrition assistance programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), SNAP, and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and the School Breakfast Program, provide the most robust response for preventing and alleviating the burden of food insecurity in the United States Although strong evidence has demonstrated the impact of these programs on population rates of food insecurity, challenges with program implementation have included the inadequacy of current benefit levels, the stigma associated with program participation, and the limited access/eligibility among some economically and socially vulnerable groups. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several policy approaches were leveraged to ease program administration and provide greater flexibilities to address the needs of individuals and families experiencing food insecurity and improve access, including Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), which offered temporary emergency nutrition benefits to school children eligible for free school meals via an EBT card, temporary increases in SNAP allocations, a lower minimum identified student percentage participation threshold for the Community Eligibility Provision in the NSLP, and remote certification appointments in the WIC program.

### Interventions targeting diet quality of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) participants: a scoping review [^114Urkuk]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (SNAP) has been successful in reducing food insecurity among low-income Americans. However, the program has also been criticized as unhealthy food choices, and rates of diet-related chronic diseases remain high among SNAP beneficiaries. Recently, several multi-component interventions have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, aiming to improve how benefits are utilized to support a healthful diet. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the breadth of published interventions that have targeted SNAP beneficiaries, and their reported impact on diet and nutrition related outcomes. Using key search terms, a literature search of government and peer review databases was conducted. Twelve unique interventions were identified and categorized based on the type of intervention delivered: 1) monetary incentives 2) nutrition education, and 3) combined nutrition education plus monetary incentives. Across all interventions, monetary interventions showed modest improvements in reported fruit and vegetable intake among SNAP beneficiaries. While nutrition education interventions showed improvement in psychosocial correlates of diet, changes in dietary intake were inconsistent. Combination programs demonstrated the strongest improvements in dietary change among beneficiaries. Variability in types of outcomes measured limits comparability of findings across studies, and our findings calls for further evaluation in this area. This scoping review suggests using financial incentives combined with nutrition education may be effective in improving dietary intake among SNAP beneficiaries. Future research should integrate more robust study designs and consider multiple levels of intervention to effectively change beneficiary habits and in turn, reduce diet related disease in this population.

### Implementation of food is medicine programs in healthcare settings: a narrative review [^116Fre8N]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

While higher fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is associated with positive health outcomes, most adults in the United States (US) do not meet FV intake recommendations as advised by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Racial and ethnic minority populations with low income face greater challenges in accessing FVs due to structural inequities, – contributing to a disproportionate burden of diet-related chronic disease. Food and nutrition security strategies that ensure all Americans have consistent access to healthy foods to prevent or treat diet-related chronic diseaseare gaining attention as a national priorityto supplement other forms of federal food assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Food is Medicine (FIM) programs are one such approach, typically calling for healthcare providers such as physicians and allied health professionals to screen patients with diet-related chronic disease for food insecurity and refer to reduced cost or free nutritious food, especially FVs, often for redemption at an off-site location like food retail sites or food banks/pantries.– FIM programs are promising, with some estimating that national implementation of FV prescriptions could save nearly 40 billion dollars in healthcare costs and prevent over 250,000 cardiovascular disease instances. As such, funders are increasing investments in FIM to expand reach and elucidate program impacts. The US Department of Agriculture is one example that funds FV prescriptions nationwide through the Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) and supports the National Training, Technical Assistance, Evaluation, and Information Center (NTAE) to provide GusNIP grantees with implementation and evaluation support.

However, many healthcare organizations, especially those that serve patients with low incomes, face challenges in the funding, staff time, technology, and experience or knowledge necessary for deploying FIM programs.– Because these programs are relatively new and the literature base is rapidly growing, it is critical to understand gaps and opportunities to FIM adoption, implementation, and sustainability (herein "integration") in diverse US healthcare contexts (e.g. rural, tribal), – especially amid calls for scaling. Implementation science is the study of evidence-based innovation integration into real-world settings to ensure benefits are realized, barriers overcome, and assets built upon. Importantly, implementation science research demonstrates contextual factors such as the characteristics of organizations, staff, leadership, and processes are often predictive of efforts to integrate evidence-based innovations in healthcare settings. –

### Supplemental nutrition assistance program participation and health care expenditures in children [^116mW5RM]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately one in five children in the United States experiences food insecurity, meaning that their access to adequate food is limited by a lack of money or other resources in the household. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated household food insecurity, as significantly more families experienced periods of unemployment or underemployment, with associated financial hardships and an inability to meet basic needs. It is well-established that food insecurity can have deleterious short- and long-term effects on children's health and development, including increased odds of being hospitalized, increased risk of asthma and other chronic health conditions, and lower test scores and behavioral outcomes in school.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an important federal food assistance program that assists many low-income families in becoming and remaining food-secure. Approximately one-quarter of all US children receive SNAP supports, representing 17 million households of SNAP recipients. Prior studies have demonstrated the positive effects of SNAP for both adults and children through subjective measures, such as associations with better self-reported health status in recipients, and objective measures, including increased birth weight and decreased likelihood of underweight status among children in recipient households. Reduced healthcare expenditures in SNAP recipients for adults are likely a result of improved overall health related to better nutrition. For example, in those with diabetes, proposed mechanisms linking SNAP receipt and improved health include increased fruit and vegetable intake and better glycemic control. While not the original intent of SNAP, the program's measurable effects on the health of its recipients, which go beyond just alleviating hunger, raise the question of whether a corresponding effect on health care expenditures also occurs. A prior study demonstrated that receipt of SNAP in low-income adults is associated with lower health care expenditures over the course of 24 months when compared with eligible non-recipients. However, to date, it remains unknown whether this association holds true among children. Investigating this association is important because it carries significant policy and clinical practice implications. For example, findings could provide evidence supporting cost-saving, innovative partnerships between social services and medical homes, and for novel pediatric care delivery models that address food insecurity. Some insurers and state Medicaid agencies have already begun to implement direct nutrition supports under value based care arrangements, with the explicit goal of reducing costs; the relationship between SNAP, as a robust pre-existing food insecurity intervention, and health care costs outside the adult population is deserving of further investigation. Thus, in this study we used data from a nationally representative survey to compare longitudinal health care expenditures among children in low-income households who received SNAP to those of children who did not receive SNAP, while accounting for sociodemographic and clinical differences in program enrollment.

### Barriers, opportunities, and challenges in addressing disparities in diet-related cardiovascular disease in the United States [^115zZYLF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

SNAP‐Education (SNAP‐Ed) is another federally funded nutrition education program, complementary to SNAP, administered by agencies at a state level. 108 The goal of SNAP‐Ed is to use community/public health approaches to provide educational programs, messaging, policies, and systems to increase food security and adherence to the Dietary Guidelines. To be eligible for SNAP‐Ed, individuals do not have to participate in SNAP, but this is the target population. Relatively few quantitative analyses have assessed the impact of SNAP‐Ed on diet quality 109; however, some evidence from relatively small trials shows SNAP‐Ed improves food security during the education period (4–7 weeks), 110, 111, 112 although the longer‐term impacts are less clear. 109 In the only randomized controlled trial to collect longer‐term outcome data, household food security improved by 25% (or 1.2 ± 0.4 units on the US Household Food Security Scale) after 1 year in low‐income households in Indiana with at least 1 child, after participation in 4 to 10 weeks of SNAP‐Ed, compared with a control group. 113 There is currently inconsistent and limited evidence to suggest SNAP‐Ed improves dietary intake, 109 although this is primarily because of the lack of rigorous evaluation of the program, which underscores the importance of research in this area to quantify the impact and potential for changes to promote effectiveness.

### Nutritional and activity recommendations for the child with normal weight, overweight, and obesity with consideration of food insecurity: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^115PzR2U]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Obesity Medical Association (OMA) food insecurity (FI) impact and guidance for pediatric overweight/obesity provide definition, prevalence, risk, mitigation, and screening: food insecurity is defined as being uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food to meet the needs of all family members because of insufficient money or other resources for food; as of 2020, 10.5% of Americans are food insecure, 6.6% report low food security, and 3.9% report very low food security; in households with children, 14.8% reported food insecurity representing 6.1 million children; the odds of children having obesity are 5 times higher in food insecure households compared to food-secure households; participation in a food assistance program (such as NSLP/WIC/SNAP) shows a reduction in FI; and a positive screen for FI includes a positive response to either or both of two questions: "Within the past 12 months, we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more" and "Within the past 12 months, the food we bought just didn't last and we didn't have money to get more".

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^115sKgvz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In majority of studies, the intervention was not compared with another intervention. For some larger studies of government programmes, such as cash transfers, it was common for a delayed control to be used as a comparator. In this case, the control group also received the intervention, but at a later stage, as it would be unethical to randomise communities to no intervention in these types of programmes. One issue with this was that many long‐term outcomes were not eligible for reporting in this review as, by that time, both the intervention and control groups were receiving the intervention.

In terms of outcomes, no included study reported on the primary outcome of prevalence of undernourishment. Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) is a national‐level model‐based indicator used to understand access to food in terms of dietary energy inadequacy and can be measured at national or household level (INDDEX Project 2018). It measures the percentage of the population whose dietary energy intake is below the MDER. In line with this, the adequacy of dietary intake at the individual level was also not reported in most studies, and only six studies reported this outcome. Most studies reported on actual energy intake (i.e. calories) or intake of specific nutrients (i.e.g.rams), without assessing this intake against some measure of adequacy, such as the DRIs. Besides these outcome categories, fewer studies reported on child cognitive function and development compared to other outcomes. We had intended to assess not only if adequacy of dietary intake improved, but also if diet quality increased. Included studies did not report on dietary quality (i.e. whether they were refined and high in saturated fat or healthier foods such as legumes, fruit and vegetables). However, many studies reported on dietary diversity, which is an approximate measure of diet quality. Greater dietary diversity should indicate better overall dietary quality, as it means that foods from more food groups are being consumed. For most outcomes, data were available at two and three years, so there is not much evidence on longer‐term impact of included interventions. Only three studies reported on the adverse outcome of overweight and obesity.

Due to the lack of information in many included studies, we were unable to address our first secondary objective – to identify features of interventions that enable or impair the effective implementation. We believe this warrants a separate study assessing each intervention more in‐depth and using different study designs, such as qualitative studies.

### Healthy food benefit programs, fruit and vegetable consumption, and food security [^1157bCgD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Much of the existing literature evaluating FIM or the older government-funded programs is hampered by noncausal research designs. One study of 9 produce prescription plans found reduced food insecurity and improved diet, but the evaluation lacked a comparison group. A few rigorous evaluations employ randomization, but findings are inconsistent. One randomized evaluation of medically tailored meals found that treatment improved a diet quality score, but not fruit and vegetable consumption or health. Similarly, 2 randomized evaluations of government-funded matched spending programs found that household purchases of fruits and vegetables increased, but only 1 of these found dietary changes.

This study contributes to the literature on the outcomes of healthy food benefit programs by using a rigorous study design to evaluate a fruit and vegetable benefit program available to lower-income households in Seattle, Washington. We leveraged randomized program assignment to assess the outcomes of both gaining access to the program for 6 months and of losing access to the program for 6 months after over 1 year of receipt. The program has several innovative characteristics that have not been previously examined in the literature. These include no required participant spending match and sustainable financing through a beverage tax, focused enrollment of households not eligible for other nutrition assistance programs and no requirement for SNAP participation, and the ability to redeem benefits at a large chain food retailer and smaller local stores located in lower-income neighborhoods.

### Food insecurity, neighborhood food environment, and health disparities: state of the science, research gaps and opportunities [^116Gob6j]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention Studies

- Consider the impact of neighborhood context on food insecurity. Session speakers noted that poor neighborhood conditions coexist in neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority groups and those experiencing food insecurity. Strategies and solutions that emerged include evaluating the efficacy of structural and upstream approaches, such as universal basic income (UBI) interventions and childcare subsidies in social, economic, and political environments that contribute to food insecurity outcomes. Intervention approaches should explore strategies that apply decolonizing methodologies, use indigenous and critical theories, examine intersectionality, and build on the experiences of underserved populations within the context of their environment and address the stigma attached to food insecurity.
- Integrate the food sovereignty model in interventions. In contrast to traditional approaches, speakers advocated for using a food sovereignty model, which encompasses food systems in which the community stakeholders and residents produce, distribute, and consume food, as well as control the mechanisms and policies for food production and distribution. It was proposed that food sovereignty model-guided interventions are likely to facilitate long-term systems change, particularly in American Indian and other historically marginalized communities.
- Consider innovative approaches to expand access to food assistance programs. Speakers indicated that programs and policies need to consider a more comprehensive way to support people throughout their lives to access necessary nutritional services, such as SNAP, WIC, and other government programs. This includes creating innovative partnerships and community linkages to increase enrollment and participation in federal nutrition programs.
- Address food insecurity as a poverty issue. Although SNAP has been shown to be effective in reducing food insecurity, food insecurity prevalence is greatly impacted by unemployment and industry closures. One recommended potential is the restructuring of SNAP as a UBI program through which each household receives maximum nutrition assistance without having to demonstrate need on the basis of the income relative to the federal poverty line. If implemented, some experts suggest that UBI could potentially lead to a 98% decrease in food insecurity in the United States. Nontraditional intervention studies that focus on wealth building (e.g. Building Wealth and Health Network) have also shown promise in reducing food insecurity. A key focus could be to develop targeted interventions to disrupt the poverty cycle at every stage of life and apply an equity lens.
- Increase support for nutrition education and incentive programs. Recent studies suggest that providing funding for nutrition incentives and nutrition education supports healthy eating. For example, expanding efforts such as the GusNIP can help broaden the reach to other communities.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of food security interventions targeting multiple health conditions. For example, interventions that target cardiometabolic risk have the potential to reduce food insecurity and can simultaneously help address health challenges. Research shows that food insecurity impairs these pathways, interacts in a vicious cycle, is linked to obesity, and disproportionately affects minority populations. Many interventions in health care settings are small-scale and may not be representative of those that are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity disparities. More research is needed to understand who enrolls/participates in these programs, the effective dose, and the mechanism by which they work.

### Supplemental nutrition assistance program access and racial disparities in food insecurity [^117JSvGW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

There are at least 2 different, although likely not mutually exclusive, potential reasons for these study findings. First, it is possible that SNAP benefits are successful in attenuating racial disparities in food insecurity for participants. However, it is also possible that there are race-based differences in access to this critical entitlement program. With regard to the first, there is well-documented structural and systemic racism in financial systems, and evidence of racially segregated food environments, including less access to fruits and vegetables, and fewer grocery stores, in predominately Black communities, which may contribute to higher food costs in those areas. SNAP may partly address these structural barriers to accessing healthy and affordable food. However, the effects of SNAP benefits on food insecurity likely depend partly on the local cost of food, suggesting that SNAP benefit amounts may need to be better adjusted for cost of living (currently, the rate is higher only for people in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands). Also, additional interventions and policies are likely needed to address equity in food environments. As an example, a recent review of interventions aiming to improve food security among Black households identified gaps in the development and testing of interventions that address food affordability in communities. Together, these studies simultaneously highlight the importance of SNAP in combating inequities and identify opportunities to strengthen food assistance programs.

### Does state-level supplemental nutrition assistance program access reduce firearm mortality among black youth? A two-way fixed effects analysis of age-stratified and cause-specific outcomes across 22 states, 2000–2020 [^117Xbt4A]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Understanding this relationship is crucial given both SNAP's extensive reach and the stark racial inequities in poverty exposure. Black families are 12 times more likely to live in concentrated poverty than White families, and multi-generational poverty is more than 16 times higher among Black adults than White adults. Recent evidence suggests that economic support programs may be especially effective at reducing injury and violence when they address basic needs like food security. This investigation is particularly timely given growing recognition of how structural racism has historically perpetuated health disparities, leading to increased calls for upstream interventions to address youth violence. Indeed, structural racism creates a cascade of challenges for Black youth, who are disproportionately exposed to poverty, reduced healthcare access, and increased community violence. As both a function and consequence of structural racism, these interconnected material hardships represent upstream factors that traditional violence prevention approaches– such as child access prevention laws and mass media awareness campaigns– often fail to adequately address. By considering SNAP as a structural intervention, this study responds to calls to target the fundamental causes of racial disparities in youth firearm violence.

This study investigates the relationship between state-level SNAP access and firearm-related mortality among Black youth, leveraging variation in policy and program implementation across states. Our analysis addresses key methodological challenges, including race classification discrepancies in death certificates, while examining how differences in SNAP policies influence mortality outcomes. By exploring the intersection of social policy and firearm violence, this research aims to inform evidence-based interventions that advance health equity and community safety.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^112ioHuq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

After decades of decline since 2005, the global prevalence of undernourishment reverted and since 2015 has increased to levels seen in 2010 to 2011. The prevalence is highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially Africa and Asia. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community-level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs.

Objectives

To determine the effects of community-level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at-risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups.

Search Methods

We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) and prospective controlled studies (PCS). All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community-level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children). Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income-generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary. For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician. We assessed risk of bias for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group. We conducted meta-analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta-analyse, we used the random-effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta-analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction.

Main Results

We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low-certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate-certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low-certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate-certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low-certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate-certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low-certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low-certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low-certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate-certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low-certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment.

Authors' Conclusions

The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs.

### Effect of a community agency-administered nurse home visitation program on program use and maternal and infant health outcomes: a randomized clinical trial [^115oV567]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the effect of a nurse home visitation program for families with newborns implemented in a community setting on program penetration and fidelity and family outcomes?

Findings

This community-based randomized clinical trial found that the visitation program was implemented with 76% penetration and 90% adherence to the protocol, leading nurses to address minor problems for 52% of families and connect an additional 42% to community resources. Analyses of interviews and administrative records indicated that families assigned to the intervention had more community connections, fewer cases of maternal anxiety or depression, and fewer investigations for child abuse.

Meaning

This study demonstrates successful implementation and decreased child abuse investigations among participants in a postnatal nurse home visitation program implemented at scale in a community setting.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — eligibility, services, participation, and outcomes are detailed as follows: The program assists low-income families to buy food that is nutritionally adequate and provides nutrition education; however, it does not require targeting older adults. Eligible participants are US citizens and legal residents who are most in need with gross income ≤ 130% federal poverty level and resources up to $2,000, or $3,000 if age 60+y or disabled. Benefits can be used to buy any foods and nonalcoholic beverages that are sold to be eaten at home and can buy plants and seeds to grow food. As of 2015, 45.6 million Americans were enrolled in SNAP; 81.6% of SNAP benefits were redeemed at supermarkets and superstores, and SNAP benefits redeemed at farmers' markets increased 221% in the past 5 fiscal years. Reported outcomes include that participants experienced a 10% decrease in food insecurity, 23% participants improved nutritious food intake, and SNAP-Education for adults age 60 to 80 y led to increased produce intakes among older adults.

### Effect of a community agency-administered nurse home visitation program on program use and maternal and infant health outcomes: a randomized clinical trial [^114W9fXF]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Home visitation programs promoting healthy development in early childhood have proliferated based on promising empirical evidence. The federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home-Visiting (MIECHV) Programallocates $400 million annually to programs with positive impact demonstrated through randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Simultaneously, the field is challenged by failures to replicate findings when university-developed programs are implemented by community agencies, known as the scale-up penalty. The need for studies of implementation and impact of intervention in community settings is one of the highest priorities in medicine.

The study we report here evaluated implementation and impact of the MIECHV-approved Family Connects (FC) program during its community dissemination following a university RCT. The FC program is a systems-based approach to supporting families at birth by combining engagement and alignment of community resources with voluntary home visits for all families of newborns, including brief interventions, assessments of family needs, and connections to community resources to meet family-specific needs. Trained nurses offer mothers one to several home visits for support, clinical assessment, and referrals, as needed. They use motivational interviewing techniques to help families clarify needs in each of 12 empirically based risk domains and to facilitate referrals to community agencies. A community specialist aligns service agencies and makes available to nurses an annotated directory that includes service description, eligibility criteria, fees, and waiting lists. Agencies include formal service providers (eg, substance abuse, maternal depression, parenting support); government and nonprofit programs (eg, housing assistance, childcare subsidies); and paraprofessional parent support groups. An integrated electronic data system documents visits, family needs, and outcomes of referrals to community services. The FC program is unique among MIECHV programs in emphasizing population impact, short-term duration, and low cost (about $500 per family).

### Resource navigation in primary care During the first year of life: the StreetCred economic bundle [^115VXmDv]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Public economic resources reduce the impact of poverty on health but are underused and challenging to access, particularly for families from marginalized racial and ethnic groups. We describe the development of a clinically embedded program (the economic bundle) that facilitates enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), on-site food pantries, free tax preparation, 529 college savings accounts (CSAs), paid family and medical leave (PFML), and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program. We designed this economic bundle in response to our pediatric primary care clinic patient population's needs (85% Medicaid-insured, 30% immigrants, 68% Black/African American or Hispanic/Latinx). We delivered services using navigators embedded into routine well-child visits throughout the first year of life. We performed a retrospective review of the program's first 14 months (April 2022 to June 2023) to describe the program's design, implementation, and early outcomes. Among the 311 families who received the service, few eligible families were enrolled in the offered economic resources at the newborn visit (WIC 31%, SNAP 23%, food pantry 17%, PFML 37%, tax preparation 21%, 529 CSA 1%, and FSS 7%). Among families whose infants were aged at least 6 months at the time of follow-up and were eligible but unenrolled at the newborn visit, many subsequently were enrolled in WIC (59%), SNAP (41%), on-site food pantry (39%), PFML (26%), and 529 CSAs (4%); 12% utilized tax preparation services. Our economic bundle is a promising approach to support families' economic stability throughout the first year of a child's life.

### Does state-level supplemental nutrition assistance program access reduce firearm mortality among black youth? A two-way fixed effects analysis of age-stratified and cause-specific outcomes across 22 states, 2000–2020 [^114cQ91M]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The differential impact of access to SNAP across age groups and causes of death provides important insights for intervention design, especially given that firearm-related homicide became the leading cause of death in 2021 among Black males ages 15–34. The stronger protective association observed among adolescents highlights the particular importance of economic support during critical developmental periods when youth are most vulnerable to community violence exposure. This finding aligns with developmental research showing increased susceptibility to environmental influences during early and middle adolescence. Our lagged models revealed significant protective associations with both overall firearm mortality and suicide among young adults aged 19–25 years, suggesting that economic security programs may have delayed protective effects that manifest over time for this age group. The significant findings in our time-lagged models suggest that economic stability may be associated with reduced suicide risk by alleviating financial distress, enhancing access to mental health resources, and strengthening social support networks. These delayed associations may reflect the cumulative impact of economic security on psychological well-being and community conditions over time.

Our findings contribute to the growing literature on structural interventions for youth violence prevention in several ways. First, they demonstrate the potential of broad-based economic support programs to reduce firearm violence, extending previous work focused primarily on targeted violence prevention initiatives. Second, they highlight the importance of considering developmental timing in policy implementation, suggesting that adolescence may represent a particularly effective intervention point for homicide prevention, while young adulthood may be critical for suicide prevention. Third, they provide evidence for the role of state-level policy decisions in shaping local health outcomes, supporting calls for policy-level interventions to address health disparities.

Several limitations warrant consideration. Variability in race classification on death certificates introduced measurement challenges forcing us to restrict our analyses to years up through 2020. Our reliance on state-level SNAP access measures may mask important local variations in program access and effectiveness. Additionally, our SNAP measure was estimated from existing data, which introduces additional statistical uncertainty to our estimates. While we controlled for key covariates, unmeasured confounding factors such as community-level firearm ownership rates and the availability of local violence prevention programs may have influenced results. Additionally, data limitations did not allow for race-specific measures of these key confounders. Finally, analyses of suicides and accidental deaths were limited by smaller event numbers, potentially affecting statistical power.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^116o5Air]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included community‐level interventions that aim to improve access to food, as detailed in our logic model (Figure 1). Community‐level interventions were defined as those in which the community was the setting where the intervention was implemented, with every member of that community potentially benefiting from it (McLeroy 2003). This includes interventions that are district‐, city‐ or village‐wide or interventions that take place within community institutions such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, households, organisations or public policy. Based on the literature in this field, and on the findings of our scoping review, we decided to include the following interventions that address access to food (Table 8):

2
Definition of interventions included in the review

interventions that improve buying power (e.g. income‐generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes);
interventions addressing food prices (e.g. policies, discounts, vouchers and subsidies);
interventions addressing infrastructure and transport that affect physical access to food outlets;
interventions addressing the social environment and social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government).

### A community-based intervention to prevent serious complications and death 2 years after discharge in people with spinal cord injury in Bangladesh (CIVIC): a randomised trial [^113BSsqb]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

We had hypothesised that many of the complications people with spinal cord injury commonly develop could be managed at home with appropriate advice and support, and that regular contact with participants, even if only over the phone, would provide an effective way of identifying complications early so that the complications could be managed before becoming insurmountable. The trial findings refute that hypothesis. Similarly, two recent large trials conducted in India and China failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of community-based programs for people with stroke. This highlights the importance of using rigorous research designs to test the effectiveness of community-based interventions that would be widely expected to be effective.

The failure of the intervention to reduce secondary complications and prevent death 2 years after discharge might indicate that the prevention and management strategies recommended by the health professionals were not effective, or that the strategies were not implemented well. Alternatively, it could be that strategies that would otherwise have been effective were ineffective in the current context, even though they were implemented well, because they were administered to people living in poverty with few resources, poor nutrition, and limited access to health care. To the extent that is true, effective long-term intervention for this population may require strengthening of economic and health systems. It is possible that the intervention may have been more effective if delivered by nurses or doctors. We did not employ doctors because of the greater cost. We tried to employ nurses but only one appropriately qualified nurse applied for the position (this person was employed as an assessor). We do not believe that failure to recruit nurses was a major limitation because the physiotherapists were comprehensively trained and became skilled at providing the intervention.

Interestingly, even though healthcare costs for participants in the Intervention group were subsidised (maximum AUD80), this did not improve health outcomes. The small amount of financial assistance may however have gone some way to alleviating the financial strain experienced by participants and their families. There may also be other beneficial effects of the intervention that were not captured with the measured outcomes. As part of a formal process evaluation, 14 participants from the Intervention group were interviewed. All indicated that the regular phone calls alleviated the sense of social isolation and gave them increased confidence to manage their situations.

It is possible that the education participants received prior to discharge rendered the post-discharge support unnecessary. During the period of hospitalisation at the CRP, people with spinal cord injury and their carers were educated about prevention and management of secondary complications. Post-discharge phone-based care may be more effective in other contexts where less education is provided while in hospital.

How the intervention might work

Based on the literature cited in the above sections, and on guidance on how to use logic models in systematic reviews (Rohwer 2016), we developed a logic model that illustrates how interventions addressing food insecurity might work in improving the nutritional status of individuals (Figure 1). In this model, we present interventions that address food availability, access and utilisation. The interventions may operate at different levels of influence, including the macro (national, regional, global), meso (community) and micro (household and individual) levels. As mentioned above, food security at one level does not ensure food security at another level (Gross 2000). As our review focused on chronic food insecurity, the logic model does not include interventions that address transient food insecurity.

1
Food security logic model: how interventions influence food and nutritional security.

Although this logic model encompasses three dimensions of food security – availability, access and utilisation – we only explored how interventions addressing access to food may lead to food and nutrition security. As mentioned above, access to food concerns the ability of households (and communities) to acquire sufficient and appropriate foods to ensure a diet that is diverse, nutrient dense and safe, and that satisfies the nutrient needs of its members (ACF‐IN 2008; WHO 2013). This logic model provides examples of interventions that address the determinants of food access. These include income‐ or employment‐generating opportunities, coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money from a community fund, childcare), social grants, food price policies and regulations, rural infrastructure development, and food or cash vouchers. The direct effects of these interventions include increased financial resources in the household, reduced food prices, increased social support and assistance (e.g. from family, neighbours or the government), having adequate facilities to store food, and ensuring that there is affordable transport to food outlets as well as existence of food outlets closer to where people live (Cotta 2013; Ecker 2012; FAO 2012). Many of these factors interact with each other. For example, having more money may enable the household to buy a fridge to store fresh food, being able to borrow money increases the money available to buy food or the existence of adequate road infrastructure may lead to decreased food prices. These direct effects all lead to a common intermediate effect, which is better ability of households to acquire healthy and nutritious food. The acquisition of healthy food is dependent on there being food available. Being able to acquire healthy food makes it easier for households to make healthy food choices, which in turn influences their intake of healthy and safe food. This represents the interaction across the different dimensions of food security. When the intermediate effects across all dimensions of food security are in place – that is, when nutritious food is commonly available in sufficient quantities at fair prices – households are able to acquire healthy food, all individuals within the household can eat healthy food that meets their nutritional requirements as well as their preferences, and long‐term outcomes of food and nutrition security, and thus of improved nutritional status of everyone in the household and in the community, are achievable.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^114FDqt8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

After decades of decline since 2005, the global prevalence of undernourishment reverted and since 2015 has increased to levels seen in 2010 to 2011. The prevalence is highest in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), especially Africa and Asia. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community‐level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs.

Objectives

To determine the effects of community‐level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at‐risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups.

Search methods

We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020. We applied no language or publication status limits.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) and prospective controlled studies (PCS). All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community‐level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children).

Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income‐generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government).

Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary.

For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician.

We assessed risk of bias for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group.

We conducted meta‐analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta‐analyse, we used the random‐effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta‐analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction.

Main results

We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions).

Interventions that improved buying power:

Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high‐certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low‐certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight.

Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high‐certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate‐certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low‐certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children.

Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate‐certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low‐certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households.

Interventions that addressed food prices:

Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate‐certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low‐certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting.

Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low‐certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low‐certainty evidence).

Interventions that addressed the social environment:

Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate‐certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low‐certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity.

None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment.

Authors' conclusions

The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs.

### Effects of subsidies and prohibitions on nutrition in a food benefit program: a randomized clinical trial [^115xdB17]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Strategies to improve the nutritional status of those participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are of interest to policymakers.

Objective

To evaluate whether the proposed policy of incentivizing the purchase of fruits and vegetables and prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious foods in a food benefit program improves the nutritional quality of participants' diets.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Lower income participants (n = 279) not currently enrolled in SNAP were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental financial food benefit conditions: (1) incentive (30% financial incentive for fruits and vegetables purchased using food benefits); (2) restriction (not allowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or candies with food benefits); (3) incentive plus restriction (30% financial incentive on fruits and vegetables and restriction of purchase of sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or candy with food benefits); or (4) control (no incentive or restrictions on foods purchased with food benefits). Participants in all conditions were given a study-specific debit card where funds were added every 4 weeks for a 12-week period. Outcome measures were collected at baseline and in the final 4 weeks of the experimental period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes (from 24-hour dietary recalls) included intake of energy, discretionary calories, and overall diet quality.

Results

A number of favorable changes were observed in the incentive plus restriction condition that were significantly different from changes in the control condition. These included (1) reduced intake of energy (-96 kcal/d, standard error [SE], 59.9); (2) reduced intake of discretionary calories (-64 kcal/d, SE 26.3); (3) reduced intake of sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, and candies (-0.6 servings/d, SE 0.2); (4) increased intake of solid fruit (0.2 servings/d, SE 0.1); and (5) improved Healthy Eating Index score (4.1 points, SE 1.4). Fewer improvements were observed in the incentive only and restriction only arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

A food benefit program that pairs incentives for purchasing more fruits and vegetables with restrictions on the purchase of less nutritious foods may reduce energy intake and improve the nutritional quality of the diet of participants compared with a program that does not include incentives or restrictions.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: child and adolescent federally funded nutrition assistance programs [^113PiD5X]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Overview of child and adolescent federally funded nutrition assistance programs — scope and SNAP/SNAP-Ed features — states that in fiscal year 2015 the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent approximately $104.1 billion in 15 domestic food and nutrition programs, with programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), NSLP, SBP, WIC, SFSP, and CACFP. Federally funded nutrition assistance programs were developed to subsidize food served to children and adolescents in schools and other organizations in which they receive instruction or care, and since the mid-1940s the US government has been committed to eradicating hunger and nutrient deficiencies among its population. SNAP provides the opportunity for individuals to select healthy meals, purchase nutritional staples, and helps to reduce food insecurity in families with low incomes, and according to SNAP rules all recipients must meet work requirements unless they are exempt because of age, disability, or other specific reasons. Collaborative efforts between states, nutrition educators (including RDNs), and neighborhood and faith-based organizations provide resources to ensure that individuals eligible for the program are aware of the benefits of the program and the application process, and SNAP-Ed is an evidence-based nutrition program that teaches people using the theory for SNAP-Ed about nutrition and how to make their food dollars stretch.

### Community-based priorities for improving nutrition and physical activity in childhood [^1166NzaV]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Overweight among America's youth has prompted a large response from foundations, government, and private organizations to support programmatic interventions. The architecture for many of these programs was derived from "experts", whereas the perspective of families, and communities — those most affected and most instrumental in altering behavior — is rarely the driving force. Shaping America's Youth (SAY) was established to assess programs that target nutrition and physical activity and to promote the necessary family and community input. In a 2004 report, SAY documented how community efforts are motivated, funded, structured, and evaluated. It identified discordance between that effort and the opinions of experts. To ensure that the voices of families and communities are integrated into such local and national policies and programs, SAY initiated a unique series of 5-day-long town meetings, input from which was independently statistically analyzed. Across a range of demographics, the results indicated that participants perceive the barriers and solutions similarly. There was broad agreement that the family has primary responsibility, starting with a need to focus on improved quality and duration of family time directed at nutrition and activity. Concurrently they identified needed actions from external sources, including clear and consistent nutrition information; ready access to healthy foods; and a built environment that promotes physical activity. Rather than one-dimensional or governmental solutions, they expressed a need for community-based partnerships integrating health care, education, environment, government, and business. Although this citizen-engagement process did not identify specific actions, it defined basic steps that communities must integrate into future approaches.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the society for nutrition education and behavior: food and nutrition programs for community-residing older adults [^117WwJFh]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2019). High credibility.

USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and SNAP-Education (SNAP-Ed) for older adults — SNAP and SNAP-Ed are described as the largest federal food assistance programs, with SNAP's primary goal to decrease hunger by providing individuals with limited incomes funds via electronic benefit transfer cards usable at grocery stores, direct marketing farmers, treatment centers, farmers' markets, homeless meal providers, and group homes. Participation in SNAP has decreased food insecurity by 10%, yet only 42% of older adults who qualify are enrolled, and reported intake outcomes are mixed: more than half (54%) reported their consumption of nutritious foods consumed the same when enrolled, while fewer than one-quarter (23%) reported an increase. The goal of SNAP-Ed is to increase the likelihood a participant will select healthy foods and incorporate physical activity into their lifestyle, but although SNAP-Ed is moving toward an evidence-based education model, there is no consistent assessment tool used to measure the impact of SNAP-Ed for older adults; one quasi-experimental four-session program resulted in improved fruit and vegetable intakes among adults aged 60 to 80 years. States can provide nutrition education to participants regarding food choices, but guidance does not specify targeting older adults, and to reduce participation barriers SNAP has created a recertification interview waiver in 11 states and proposed extending the certification period to 36 months for older adults with no earned income.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^115uZcUP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions selected based on scoping review results

Based on the findings of the scoping review, we decided to focus this Cochrane Review on community‐level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs; as we found that there are fewer reviews addressing food access compared to food availability or utilisation. Furthermore, we know that in many areas of LMICs, nutritious food is available at a national level, but physical distance and financial constraints prevent thousands of people from accessing the food (FAO 2013). As explained above, increased intake of ultraprocessed food products and sugar‐sweetened beverages has contributed to the rise in overweight and obesity in LMICs and poor diet quality is also responsible for micronutrient deficiencies. Thus, interventions should aim to improve access to nutritious food. Nutritious foods can be defined as those that are nutrient dense, that is providing substantial amounts of vitamins and minerals (Pennington 2007). This includes fresh or minimally processed foods from the different food groups, such as whole grains, lean meats, dairy products, legumes, vegetables and fruits, and excludes ultraprocessed products and sugar‐sweetened beverages that provide empty calories (Drewnowski 2005; Ministry of Health of Brazil 2014).

The interventions addressing food access include those aimed at infrastructure and transport, food prices, the social environment, coping strategies and buying power. In our scoping review, we found no systematic reviews addressing infrastructure and transport or coping strategies. We did, however, find reviews focusing on food prices, social environment and buying power, but these did not assess all relevant outcomes and not all were of good quality. Therefore, we included all these interventions addressing food access in this review.

We chose to assess community‐level interventions because every community member residing in the setting where they are implemented can potentially benefit from them (McLeroy 2003). These types of interventions have been shown to be effective (Bhandari 2003; Mohammadifard 2009), and include interventions that take place across cities or within community institutions, such as schools, neighbourhoods, churches or work sites. The intervention may involve individuals, families, organisations or public policy.

This review focused on LMICs as they experience the greatest burden from food insecurity and malnutrition and because another Cochrane Review will address food security in developed countries (Burns 2010).

### The effect of women, infant, and children (WIC) services on birth weight before and during the 2007–2009 great recession in Washington state and Florida: a pooled cross-sectional time series analysis [^115nUJ2E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent research has suggested that WIC recruitment efforts and program supports during the Great Recession were attenuated by cuts to local health department budgets/staffing — despite millions of dollars being unused for WIC response to increased need during the Great Recession. Prah (2012) also reported that some potential recipients did not avail themselves of WIC services during the Great Recession — despite increased need — as they found the process of enrolling in the WIC program to be more troublesome than it was worth. Prah cites the relative ease of enrolling in and using SNAP, as well as how much the benefit is worth compared to WIC, as one possible explanation for lower than expected increases in WIC enrollment during the Great Recession. The average person on SNAP (food stamps) received $134/month and the average mother on WIC received $50/month in 2011. SNAP benefits were also accessed via unobtrusive debit cards while throughout the Great Recession most WIC sites continued to use paper vouchers. While we were not able to include SNAP utilization data in this study, it will be valuable to see — as the WIC program shifts increasingly to electronic benefit methods — whether more individuals eligible for WIC services enroll and what the impact of these services will be on maternal and child health outcomes among WIC recipients.

### Effect of a community agency-administered nurse home visitation program on program use and maternal and infant health outcomes: a randomized clinical trial [^117Nv66f]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Postnatal home visitation to support parenting and infant healthy development is becoming increasingly common based on university efficacy studies, but effectiveness when disseminated by communities is not clear.

Objective

To test implementation and impact of the Family Connects (FC) program when administered by a community agency.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized clinical trial, births were randomly assigned to receive FC or treatment as usual. Independent evaluation was conducted through parent interviews and review of health and child protective services records. Interviewers were blind to the experimental condition of participants, and participants were blind about the purpose of the interview as an intervention evaluation. A total of 936 consecutive residential births at Duke University Hospital from January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2014, were included. Data were analyzed preliminarily for reporting to funders in early 2015 before all birth-record covariates were scored and were analyzed more comprehensively in mid-2019 after administrative birth and child protective service records became available.

Interventions

The goals of the FC brief universal program were to assess family-specific needs, complete brief interventions, and connect families with community resources. Community agencies and families were aligned through an electronic data system.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Case records documented program penetration and quality. The primary outcome was child protective services investigations for maltreatment. Secondary outcomes were the number of sustained community connections, maternal mental health, parenting behavior, infant well-child care visits and maternal postpartum care compliance, and emergency health care utilization.

Results

Of 936 births, 451 infants (48.2%) were female and 433 (46.3%) were from racial/ethnic minority groups. In all, 456 births (46.5%) were randomized to the intervention and 480 (53.5%) were randomized to the control. All analyses were based on intention to treat. The impact analysis included 158 intervention families and 158 control families. Intervention penetration was 76%, adherence to the protocol was 90%, and independent agreement in scoring (κ) was 0.75. Nurses identified and addressed minor problems for 52% of families and connected an additional 42% to community resources. Analysis of the primary outcome of child abuse investigations revealed a mean (SD) of 0.10 (0.30) investigations for the intervention group vs 0.18 (0.56) investigations for the control group (b = -0.09; 90% CI, -0.01 to -0.12; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.01; p = 0.07). The intervention group's rate of possible maternal anxiety or depression was 18.2% vs 25.9% for the control group (b = -7.70; 90% CI, -15.2 to -0.1; 95% CI, -16.6 to 1.3; p = 0.09).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study indicates that a nurse home visitation program for families of newborns can be implemented by a community agency with high penetration and quality. Other communities could benefit from wider dissemination of the program provided that quality remains strong and evaluation continues.

### Supplemental nutrition assistance program access and racial disparities in food insecurity [^114mwccy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) address racial disparities in food insecurity?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 4974 US households, Black and multiracial households had higher rates of food insecurity than White households in adjusted analyses. This disparity was not found among households that had access to SNAP benefits.

Meaning

These findings suggest that SNAP likely plays a key role in addressing food insecurity, but there are racial disparities in food insecurity among those not participating in the program.

USPSTF recommendation: screening for food insecurity — interventions in health care settings identifies options including food prescription programs, food boxes or pantries provided in or linked to clinics, and medically tailored meals. Another common primary care–based intervention is care coordination linking patients with local, state, or federal programs, and the majority of these programs, such as food pantries, free lunch programs, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program, or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children are delivered in community settings rather than through primary care.

### Strengthening food and nutrition security to promote public health in the United States: a position paper from the American College of Physicians [^117AA2qD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Food insecurity functions as a social driver of health, directly negatively impacting health status and outcomes, which can further negatively impact employment and income and increase medical expenditures-all of which exacerbates food insecurity. Progress in meaningfully reducing the food-insecurity rate has stalled in recent years. Although rates have decreased since their peak during the Great Recession, these gains have been reversed by the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the federal government is the largest provider of food assistance, there is much potential in better leveraging nutrition assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Child Nutrition Programs to increase access to healthful foods and improve public health. However, these programs face many funding challenges and internal shortcomings that create uncertainties and prevent maximal effect. Physicians and other medical professionals also have a role in improving nutritional health by screening for food insecurity and serving as connectors between patients, community organizations, and government services. Governments and payers must support these efforts by providing sufficient resources to practices to fulfill this role. In this position paper, the American College of Physicians (ACP) offers several policy recommendations to strengthen the federal food-insecurity response and empower physicians and other medical professionals to better address those social drivers of health occurring beyond the office doors.

### Barriers, opportunities, and challenges in addressing disparities in diet-related cardiovascular disease in the United States [^114FTGE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Food Assistance Programs for Underserved Populations

Federal food assistance programs, including SNAP, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and school meal programs exist to augment recipients' food purchasing power. In 2017, ≈58% of food insecure households participated in ≥ 1 of these federally funded food assistance programs. 60 SNAP, American's largest nutrition assistance program, serves ≈1 in 7 Americans; ≈25% of recipients are NH blacks, 36% are NH whites, and 17% are Hispanics. 77 SNAP benefits apply to any food product, except for alcoholic beverages, food for animals, lunch‐counter items, foods to be eaten in stores, and vitamins. In some jurisdictions, SNAP benefits may be used at restaurants. The major eligibility criterion for SNAP is a gross income of ≤ 130% of the federal poverty threshold, although several other criteria are assessed in the SNAP eligibility process. 78

### Access to SNAP-authorized retailers and diet quality among SNAP recipients [^111FbjGS]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between access to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)–authorized retail stores and diet quality among SNAP recipients?

Finding

This cross-sectional study, including 5041 SNAP recipients, found that living closer to SNAP-authorized retailers, particularly superstores and grocery stores, was associated with higher Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores among participants.

Meaning

This finding suggests that improving access to SNAP-authorized retailers is important for supporting better diet quality among SNAP recipients in underserved areas.

### Increasing use of a healthy food incentive: a waiting room intervention among low-income patients [^115jSHd6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diet-related disease is disproportionately concentrated in low-income communities where fruit and vegetable consumption is far below guidelines. To address financial barriers, Double Up Food Bucks (DUFB)-a statewide healthy food incentive-matches Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds spent at farmers markets. However, incentive use is limited. This study examined the impact of a brief waiting room-based intervention about DUFB on program utilization and produce consumption.

Study Design

Longitudinal, repeated measures, quasi-experimental trial.

Setting/Participants

SNAP-enrolled adults at a health center in a low-income, racially and ethnically diverse area of Southeast Michigan.

Intervention

Participants received a brief explanation of DUFB, written program materials, a map highlighting market locations and hours, and an initial $10 market voucher. DUFB use and produce consumption were measured through four surveys over 5 months (August 2014-January 2015).

Main Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included DUFB use and fruit and vegetable consumption (analyses conducted in 2015–2016).

Results

A total of 302 eligible adults were identified, and 177 (59%) enrolled. One hundred twenty-seven (72%) completed all surveys. At baseline, 57% of participants reported shopping at a farmers market within the last year; 18% had previously used DUFB. By the end of the DUFB season, participants were significantly more likely to report DUFB use than at baseline (AOR = 19.2, 95% CI = 10.3, 35.5, p < 0.001), with 69% of participants reporting use of DUFB at least once, and 34% reporting use of DUFB three or more times. Adjusted fruit and vegetable consumption increased from baseline by 0.65 servings/day (95% CI = 0.37, 0.93, p < 0.001) at 3 months, and remained 0.62 servings/day (95% CI = 0.32, 0.92, p < 0.001) higher than baseline 2 months post-DUFB season.

Conclusions

A brief clinic-based intervention was associated with a nearly fourfold increase in uptake of a SNAP incentive program, as well as clinically and statistically significant increases in produce consumption. Results suggested sustained behavior change even once the financial incentive was no longer available. Providing information about healthy food incentives is a low-cost, easily implemented intervention that may increase produce consumption among low-income patients.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^112viBMi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Scoping review: preparation for this systematic review

The complexity of food security allows for a wide range of interventions addressing its different dimensions at varying levels of influence. In order to better conceptualise the framework for our review with regards to the type(s) of intervention(s) to assess, the eligibility criteria for study selection and the outcomes to be assessed, we conducted a scoping review of existing systematic reviews of interventions addressing food security in LMICs (more information about the methods is available on request).

We included 29 systematic reviews in the scoping review (references available on request). Fourteen reviews addressed food availability, mainly assessing food production interventions and food utilisation (13 reviews, including five which also addressed availability), specifically around issues of nutrition education for people to improve their dietary intake. Seven reviews addressed food access. The scoping review also revealed that the included reviews were unclear regarding the description of participants and settings, types of interventions and comparisons, or the outcomes they would assess (Table 7). The quality of reviews varied considerably, some with very low‐quality scores using the AMSTAR tool (Shea 2009).

### Improving nutrition by limiting choice in the supplemental nutrition assistance program [^113ZjBM9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) currently allows the purchase of almost any food. This paper reconsiders the role of two forms of limiting choice in SNAP. Using economic theory, descriptive analysis of survey data, and discussion of random assignment evaluation evidence from the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children Demonstration, the paper argues that because households can substitute cash for SNAP, banning the use of SNAP for less nutritionally desirable foods (e.g., soda, candy) is unlikely to have a large impact. By contrast, because many households currently consume so little of more nutritionally desirable foods (e.g., whole grains, fruits, and vegetables), requiring that some portion of SNAP benefits be spent on those foods is likely to improve dietary intake. Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children Demonstration impact estimates are consistent with this conjecture. Furthermore, these data and evidence from the Healthy Incentives Pilot implementation suggest that such a policy can be feasibly integrated into existing operational processes.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^117NScPt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Cluster randomised controlled trials

Evidence from four RCTs suggests that income‐generation interventions may improve dietary diversity in children and may result in little or no difference to household dietary diversity (4 cRCTs, 3677 households and 3790 children; low‐certainty evidence; Table 3). Two cRCTs reported a clear effect favouring income‐generation interventions (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018), one reported an unclear effect favouring the intervention (Olney 2016), and one reported an unclear effect favouring the control group (Beegle 2017) (P = 0.047; Figure 7).

A meta‐analysis of two of these trials, assessing a public works programme in Malawi and an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme including provision of inputs and training, showed that income‐generation interventions make no difference to the HDDSs at three months to two years (SMD 0.02, 95% CI –0.09 to 0.13; 3677 households; I² = 63%; Analysis 3.2) (Beegle 2017; Olney 2016). Beegle 2017 was at high and Olney 2016 at unclear overall risk of bias. Beegle 2017 measured dietary diversity using the FCS (scale: 0 to 126) and Olney 2016 used the HDDS (scale: 0 to 11); for both, the higher the score, the higher the food diversity. Another meta‐analysis of three of these cRCTs, assessing the implementation of women's groups, agricultural and nutritional training, and community development, showed that children in intervention households were 1.28 times more likely to achieve MDD, compared to children from control households, one to two years after the implementation of the interventions (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.47; 3790 children; Analysis 3.3) (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Marquis 2018; Olney 2016). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias and Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Olney 2016 were at unclear overall risk of bias.

### Access to SNAP-authorized retailers and diet quality among SNAP recipients [^116oVVfJ]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Prior studies have shown that food environments can influence dietary behaviors and health outcomes. Our study extends this evidence by examining SNAP recipients, a population representing 22 million families who rely on authorized retailers for most of their food purchases, and may face consequential health risks associated with food access and diet quality.

Our results highlight the need for policies aimed at improving the SNAP retail environment for these participants. Increasing the density of SNAP-authorized retailers in underserved areas may improve access to healthy and affordable foods for SNAP families. Policy interventions could include incentives such as tax breaks, zoning adjustments, and grant programs to encourage the establishment of new stores.

Over the decades, SNAP policy has evolved substantially, evolving from a food-stamp program to a comprehensive electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system. Recent policy discussions have prioritized expanding online EBT options and refining eligibility criteria for SNAP-authorized retailers. Our findings support these efforts, highlighting the importance of improving access to healthy food and the potential cost-effectiveness of expanding online EBT. Additionally, re-evaluating retailer eligibility requirements could promote a broader range of authorized retailers in underserved areas by streamlining the authorization process, updating standards, and assisting smaller stores in meeting the necessary standards.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this study include the use of restricted NHANES data-enabled precise linkage of individual dietary records with store locations through coordinate and intertemporal identifiers, thereby facilitating a detailed assessment of how access to SNAP-authorized stores affects the diet quality of SNAP recipients. Additionally, our findings regarding store proximity and dietary quality among SNAP recipients with different weights and diabetes status provide insight into these relationships in specific populations.

This study also had several limitations. First, self-reported 24-hour dietary recalls may introduce the potential for measurement error due to day-to-day variability in food intake. Second, the exclusion of participants with incomplete socioeconomic data, including education and income, may affect generalizability. Third, while straight-line distance calculations provide standardized accessibility measures, they do not account for actual and common travel factors such as road networks, traffic patterns, physical barriers, and transportation options that could influence store access. Nevertheless, this approach is consistent with previous food access studies, and provides a robust measure of store accessibility. Fourth, this analysis lacked data on where SNAP recipients purchased their food, limiting our understanding of how different store types may contribute to dietary patterns.

### Supporting community-based healthy eating and active living efforts in sustaining beyond the funding cycle [^116hHyXc]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Considerable research has been done to define, conceptualize, and study sustainability for public health initiatives. New research suggests evaluating sustainability through additional characteristics, like type of intervention or focus of change, may help uncover differences in approaches and resources needed for sustainability. Additionally, available research often misses perspectives from those involved on what is necessary to sustain strategies long term.

Methods

Data collected through community reports and interviews with eight Colorado communities implementing large-scale community-based healthy eating and active living initiatives were used to document strategy characteristics, barriers to sustainability, and community-based perspectives on supports needed for long-term sustainability. Characteristics of implementation were also assessed based on intervention type (program, environment, policy) and to identify similarities and differences in implementation.

Results

Policy and environment interventions were sustained more often compared with program interventions. Coalitions or formal committees, community-level coordination, and diverse partnerships were associated with sustainable strategies regardless of intervention type, though primary transition partners varied by intervention type. Loss of a sole champion and shifts in institutional priorities were common barriers for sustainability. Communities requested supports for creative funding and formal coordination, public and political will-building, inclusivity, and advanced evaluation methods to support long-term sustainability.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that community intervention strategies can be highly sustainable, particularly for environment and policy change, and suggest strategies may require similar, yet tailored, partnerships based on intervention type. Additionally, supports requested highlight sophisticated community needs, offering important insights for how providers and funders can best support communities in long-term sustainability efforts.

### Effect of price on women, infants, and children-eligible caregiver participation in a produce program: a randomized trial [^115R5m16]. Academic Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This pilot randomized trial examined the associations between price, participation of WIC-eligible families in a produce delivery program and reported healthy eating behaviors.

Methods

Fifty caregivers of WIC-eligible children from an urban primary care center enrolled in an 8-week produce delivery program. Participants received free produce boxes for the first 4 weeks and were randomized to a cost of $5 or $10 per box for the remaining 4 weeks. Weekly orders were tracked, and longitudinal surveys were conducted to assess the program's impact on healthy eating.

Results

Forty-three caregivers (86%) participated in the study. An average of 35.3 (SD 5.74) participants ordered weekly during the free period with a significant drop-off to 18.3 (SD 0.96) ordering weekly during the paid period (P < 0.001); most (73%) participants paid with SNAP benefits. There was no significant difference in average orders between the $5 and $10 groups (12.25 [SD 4.4] vs. 14.5 [SD 5.63], P = 0.19). Participation was significantly associated with an increase in reported produce access (53% vs. 97%, P < 0.001) and ability to eat healthy (34% vs. 61%, P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Our study found that participation in a delivery-produce program decreased significantly with introduction of cost and use of food assistance benefits to purchase produce was common among sustained participants. Participants reported improvements in healthy eating and ability to access produce. Future study is needed to further evaluate price points to optimize program sustainability and participation and the impact of produce delivery programs on childhood produce intake.

### Prevention of pediatric overweight and obesity: position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based on an umbrella review of systematic reviews [^116NVtfQ]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric overweight and obesity — federal food assistance programs: Two systematic reviews examined the impact of federal food assistance programs on BMI measures, with limited evidence suggesting that a US Department of Agriculture program providing fresh fruits and vegetables outside of the school setting may result in reduced BMI z score and BMI in elementary school–aged children. The effect of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) was heterogeneous, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of overweight or obesity with use of SNAP benefits in certain subpopulations, including girls aged 5 through 18 years; there was no information available on the impact on overweight or obesity prevention in relation to participation in food assistance programs in any age group, and evidence certainty was VERY LOW. Practitioner-facing text states that RDNs play an integral role in the development of federal food assistance programs and that a 2015 study of the US Department of Agriculture's Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program demonstrated that exposure to fresh foods outside of school meals improved weight measures for elementary school–aged children; thus, RDNs assess food insecurity along with weight- and diet-related measures to determine appropriate referrals and support to federal food assistance programs, and the Academy provides tools for RDNs to prioritize food security solutions, with additional notes that increased access to food assistance programs can be facilitated by changing program requirements and that RDNs can help develop healthier food options through advocacy at the state or national level.

### Food insecurity prevalence among US medical students [^1168M58S]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

To illustrate, 1 of the 8 medical schools in our study developed a student-led taskforce that worked together with their school's administration to pilot various initiatives primarily revolving around food insecurity and transportation inaccessibility, including a dining points program, wherein eligible students receive renewable credit for use at the medical school cafeteria; a hospital meal card program for preclinical and clinical students in need for use at the hospital cafeteria; a transit pass program for all students to use public bus transportation; and a rideshare reimbursement program for clerkship students for travel to and from off-campus clinical sites. Tailored programs like these are not the only approach to unmet basic needs; community partnerships with farmer's markets on campus, at some frequency, or community-supported agriculture produce boxes may address underlying nonsocioeconomic determinants of food insecurity for medical students such as time or accessibility constraints to affordable, nutritious foods. Various studies have shown the success of such initiatives in addressing malnutrition and food insecurity among patient populations; however, unless subsidized, it is not as effective among working-class adults given its prohibitive costs. More options can include campus programming such as food offerings or food pantries to increase the amount of food available on campus. Further work is warranted to evaluate the most cost-effective and optimal approaches.

Beyond medical school, administrators may increase awareness efforts or assist eligible in-need students with enrolling in SNAP where available. Given most medical students are able-bodied adults without dependents, a common criterion for SNAP benefit eligibility revolves around working a minimum number of hours (eg, part-time status) or status as an employee of a work-study program — the former being difficult to maintain for medical students relative to their time-intensive student obligations and the latter varying by medical school financial aid policy. State eligibility criteria vary but, given the vast disparity and deleterious effects of food insecurity on student well-being and academic potential, the USDA and the Department of Education have been working to increase awareness and access for eligible students. For some students, these SNAP benefits may alleviate financial burden associated with food cost, allowing prioritization of other financial obligations such as rent or affording academic resources (ie, US Medical Licensing Examination Step study materials).

### Child hunger and the protective effects of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) and alternative food sources among Mexican-origin families in Texas border colonias [^114ougST]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Notwithstanding these limitations, there are a number of strengths to this study, including a large sample of immigrant and hard-to-reach Mexican-origin households and comprehensive data collected in Spanish during in-person interviews conducted by trained promotora -researchers. The results of this study further our understanding of child hunger among Mexican-origin households in Texas border colonias. In documenting an unacceptably high exposure of children to hunger, which may influence dietary intake and health outcomes, the results confirm the important role of safety net programs, such as SNAP. However, the results may understate the degree of child hunger during the summer months when children are not in school and away from SBP and NSLP. A large percentage of potentially eligible households did not participate in these nutrition assistance programs. There may be restrictions on immigrants which may ultimately affect the health of children. Efforts must be made to increase access to food-related resources, expand the availability of meals for low-income children, and ensure that all eligible families, especially mixed-status families receive nutrition assistance. In the end, child hunger raises serious concerns for communities. Considering the important relationship between child hunger and adverse mental and physical health outcomes among low-income children, this study underscores the importance of identifying the presence of child hunger among low-income Mexican-origin children and increasing access to nutrition-related resources. Health inequities at younger ages among the Mexican-origin population are likely to persist across the lifespan and into old age, with an accumulation of risk. Our findings support the identification of child hunger as a possible target for screening and interventions to prevent poor developmental and health outcomes, and the importance of improved culturally-specific communication with Mexican-origin residents about availability of community and federal nutrition resources. SNAP and school-based nutrition assistance programs are critical to millions of people, especially children. However, in the case of SNAP, efforts should be undertaken as suggested by the recent IOM report to define the adequacy of the SNAP allotment and make adjustments accordingly. In the case of school-based nutrition programs, acceptable meals and sufficient time for consuming SBP and NSLP meals should be made available to all children at risk of or experiencing hunger. Creative approaches, such as provision of a third meal and meals on weekends, should be explored. Our greatest return on the investment in these feeding programs is in ensuring that all children and families have access to affordable and healthy food supplies. Further explorations on strategies to address child hunger with young mothers are needed that incorporate both knowledge and skill-building. Ideally, this would include the empowerment of promotoras to deliver culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions and strategies.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^113CjMyG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

6.3 Proportion of households who were food secure

One PCS reported on food security and dietary diversity measures (Brunie 2014).

6.3.1 Food security

The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on food security (MD 1.25, 95% CI –0.28 to 2.79; 851 households; very low‐certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect potentially favouring the VSL intervention on the number of self‐reported months of food sufficiency in the previous year, with an increase by 1.25 months in the intervention group at three years (Table 27).

6.3.2 Dietary diversity

The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of VSLs on dietary diversity (1 study, 802 households; very low‐certainty evidence; Table 6; Figure 10). Brunie 2014 reported an unclear effect on household dietary diversity favouring the control (MD –0.30, 95% CI –1.46 to 0.87; 1615 households) (Table 27).

Brunie 2014 also reported on Individual Dietary Diversity Scores (IDDS) among children: IDDS was slightly higher by 0.81 points (out of 12) in the VSL group (MD 0.52, 95% CI –0.18 to 1.23; 1121 children) (Table 27).

### Behavioral economics and the supplemental nutrition assistance program:: making the healthy choice the easy choice [^111M266v]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves as an important nutritional safety net program for many Americans. Given its aim to use traditional economic levers to provide access to food, the SNAP program includes minimal nutritional requirements and restrictions. As food choices are influenced by more than just economic constraints, behavioral economics may offer insights and tools for altering food purchases for SNAP users. This manuscript outlines behavioral economics strategies that have potential to encourage healthier food choices within the SNAP program.

### Caregiver preferences for primary care clinic-based food assistance: a discrete choice experiment [^112ZrJX8]. Academic Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatric providers screen families for food insecurity and connect them to appropriate resources. However, it is unclear how clinics can best provide families with resources consistent with their needs and preferences. In this study, we elicited caregiver preferences for clinic-based food assistance.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional discrete choice experiment in which caregivers at 2 pediatric primary care clinics were asked to choose between hypothetical food programs. Programs varied across 4 categories: 1) resources provided (eg, food delivery, food in clinic, assistance enrolling in benefits); 2) support staff providing resources (eg, social worker, community health worker, physician, or nurse); 3) outreach modality (eg, phone, email, text); and 4) outreach frequency. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess caregiver preferences within each category and the relative importance of each category to caregiver decisions.

Results

We surveyed 142 caregivers who were predominantly Black (87%) and Medicaid-insured (90%). Caregiver preferences for food programs were most strongly influenced by the food resources provided. Caregivers preferred food delivery over other forms of food supports, such as food provided in clinic. They preferred assistance from a benefits enrollment specialist, community health worker, or social worker to assistance from a physician or nurse.

Conclusions

Pediatric clinics serving families at risk of food insecurity should use caregiver preferences to inform the design of family-centered interventions. Clinics should consider connecting caregivers with food delivery programs, and pediatric payors should adopt reimbursement models that support multidisciplinary team-based care to address food insecurity.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^113qrtTA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Regarding the effect direction synthesis, we reported the number of studies with results in the different effect categories for each outcome domain, and the probability of observing this based on the multinomial distribution (for outcome domains with two or more studies and assuming the true proportion is 0.25 for all categories). This information was reported in the first paragraph reporting results for a specific outcome in the effects of interventions section. If a meta‐analysis of all studies in the outcome domain was possible, the multinomial distribution P value was not reported. To visually display the results for key outcomes included in the 'Summary of findings' tables, we created harvest plots for each comparison. These harvest plots depict data both from RCTs and from PCS for key summary of findings outcomes. We presented the results of the effect direction synthesis separately for RCTs and for PCS, in the Effects of interventions section.

In some instances, we were able to carry out a meta‐analysis, either for all studies reporting on the same outcome measure (n = 35), or for a subset of studies that could be combined in a meta‐analysis (n = 8). We conducted meta‐analyses in Review Manager 2014 if the included studies were sufficiently homogeneous (I² < 75%) and if there was a minimum of two studies for any type of intervention being compared reporting the same outcome measure. Not pooling results in cases of high heterogeneity is an accepted approach in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2019). We also explored heterogeneity and reported this when there was high heterogeneity. We did not have sufficient data to carry out any subgroup analysis or meta‐regression to more formally explore heterogeneity. We carried out meta‐analyses separately for each outcome and type of study design, and we used the random‐effects model for all analyses to account for any existing heterogeneity. We generated forest plots for each comparison and outcome where meta‐analyses could be carried out (see Data and analyses).

### Facilitators and barriers to supplemental nutrition assistance program incentive use: findings from a clinic intervention for low-income patients [^116uH7Ze]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Healthy food incentives matching Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits spent on fruits and vegetables subsidize increased produce consumption among low-income individuals at risk for food insecurity and diet-related disease. Yet many eligible participants do not use these incentives, in part because of limited awareness. This study examined the acceptability and impact of a primary care-based informational intervention on facilitators and barriers to use of the statewide SNAP incentive program Double Up Food Bucks.

Methods

Focus groups (n = 5) were conducted April-June 2015 among a purposive sample (n = 26) of SNAP-enrolled adults from a Michigan health clinic serving low-income patients. All had participated in a waiting room-based informational intervention about Double Up Food Bucks; none had used Double Up Food Bucks before the intervention. Groups were stratified by Double Up Food Bucks use/non-use during the 6-month intervention period. Results were analyzed in 2016–2017 through an iterative content analysis process.

Results

Participants reported the waiting room intervention was acceptable and a key facilitator of first-time Double Up Food Bucks use. Motivators for Double Up Food Bucks use included (1) eating more healthfully, (2) stretching SNAP benefits, (3) higher-quality produce at markets, and (4) unique market environments. Remaining barriers included (1) lack of transportation, (2) limited market locations/hours, and (3) persistent confusion among a small number of participants regarding incentive use.

Conclusions

Low-income patients who received an informational intervention about Double Up Food Bucks reported numerous benefits from participation. Yet barriers remained for a subset of patients. Improving geographic accessibility and ease of SNAP incentive redemption may further improve dietary quality and food security among vulnerable populations.

### Access to SNAP-authorized retailers and diet quality among SNAP recipients [^113MEbDt]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Availability of SNAP-Authorized Store and Dietary Quality

Figure 1 shows the estimated association of SNAP-authorized store availability with HEI-2015 among SNAP recipients for the composite category "any" (all store types combined), all distances within 1.00 mile were significantly associated with higher scores compared to living more than 1.00 mile away. Specifically, the HEI-2015 was 3.50 higher (95% CI, 1.56–5.44) for SNAP recipients living within 0.1 miles of any SNAP-authorized store compared with those living beyond 1 mile. A similar association (3.50 higher; 95% CI, 1.45–5.55) was observed for those living 0.10 to 0.25 mile away.

### Supplemental nutrition assistance program access and racial disparities in food insecurity [^1149x9x3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study found racial disparities in food insecurity among low-income adults who do not participate in SNAP but not among those who do participate. Although these results may be due to SNAP's ability to reduce food insecurity for low-income households, it is also possible that there are systemic barriers to SNAP participation that disproportionately affect minoritized communities. These findings call for greater attention to address structural barriers to affordable food and food assistance that perpetuate racial inequities in food insecurity.

### Associations between ending supplemental nutrition assistance program emergency allotments and food insufficiency [^117K1hfV]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Food insecurity — a lack of stable access to food in adequate quantity or quality — can negatively influence health through multiple pathways. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) distributes cash-like benefits to impoverished households in the US to buy food, with an average benefit size of approximately $240 a month per household before the COVID-19 pandemic. SNAP's benefit size (coupled with challenges in accessing SNAP) has historically limited the program's ability to fully address food insecurity, which continues to affect roughly 10% of US households. During the COVID-19 pandemic, SNAP emergency allotments (EAs) provided temporary increases to households' benefit size — either to the maximum or by $95, whichever was greater. These EAs were the largest-ever increases in SNAP benefit amounts. The EAs ended in March 2023, but 18 states discontinued them even earlier when ending their state's public health emergency (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). This state-level variation in SNAP benefit size allowed us to evaluate associations between changes in SNAP benefit amounts and food insufficiency, a severe form of food insecurity characterized by recent food inadequacy.

### Beyond the clinic: improving child health through evidence-based community development [^111X7CcS]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Results

We identified published systematic reviews for 98 policy-relevant community strategies with 288 studied outcomes. Based on the standards of evidence for efficacious interventions laid out by the Society for Prevention Research, 46 strategies meet scientific criteria for efficacy by having consistent, positive outcomes from at least two high-quality experimental or quasi-experimental trials using a comparison group or interrupted time-series design (Additional file 1). An additional 21 community intervention strategies had consistent evidence of positive outcomes from high-quality observational studies only (Additional file 1), and 28 strategies had insufficient evidence available to assess effectiveness based on published systematic reviews (Additional file 1). The Additional files 1 and 2 stratify policy-relevant community strategies by quality of evidence (i.e. Level 1–3) and intervention domain (i.e. income and resources, social cohesion, physical environment, family influences, school influences, and peer influences), and display each strategy's studied outcomes, including direction and magnitude of effect.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^1153V7sL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

One potentially harmful unintended consequence of interventions that improve access to food is the increased risk of overweight or obesity (Cotta 2013; Ruel 2013), particularly if there is increased intake of energy‐dense ultraprocessed products and sugar‐sweetened beverages (Lignani 2011). People may choose to acquire these foods because of lower cost; lack of knowledge about healthy diets; or other social, cultural or individual preferences (Ruel 2013).

Although we are assessing interventions addressing access to food, it is important to note that, in order to have long‐term food and nutrition security, all three dimensions need to be in place: food needs to be available; people need to be able to access it; and they also need to know how to choose the food, prepare and store it appropriately (Pinstrup‐Andersen 2009; WHO 2013).

Why it is important to do this review

Although many interventions are being implemented to address food insecurity globally, the lack of sufficient improvements in levels of undernutrition over time, particularly in LMICs, highlights the need for the effectiveness of these interventions to be assessed. Furthermore, our scoping review highlighted that existing reviews addressing access to food in LMICs were not of high methodological quality. Therefore, we aimed to apply rigorous Cochrane Review methods to produce a high‐quality review to identify effective interventions addressing food access. This evidence would then inform relevant stakeholders' decisions about which interventions to implement in order to achieve desirable results and ensure that scarce resources are utilised efficiently. Furthermore, improving access to food would help improve overall food security and the health and nutritional status of populations, which are requisites for the socioeconomic development of individuals and societies (FAO 2003).

### Meeting men's mental health needs during COVID-19 and beyond: a global health imperative [^113cpQKy]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Such mounting evidence about this crisis requires an urgent global response. First and foremost is addressing social and economic vulnerabilities long known to be fundamental drivers of poor mental healthand which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the most basic level, this requires ensuring food, housing and financial security. In addition, the mental health crisis — along with men's willingness to seek support — highlights the renewed salience of longstanding calls by global mental health experts to drastically scale up mental health services for men, families and communities. Decades of work have demonstrated how to deliver effective care for the most common mental health issues and illnesses (such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and substance abuse) in affordable and acceptable ways, even in low-resource settings (while ensuring specialist services for the most severe and enduring conditions). Particularly notable is the shift toward decentralisation of mental healthcare, mainly by having peer counsellors or community health workers deliver psychosocial interventions. For example, the Common Elements Treatment Approach combines treatments for a range of mental health issues and illnesses into a single model, adaptable to the unique situations of each person or family and readily implementable by lay providers. Such strategies may in fact be particularly well-suited to meeting the unique needs of men, who typically have less consistent interactions with the formal health system than women, may anticipate greater stigma from accessing mental health services, and frequently prefer talking to men with similar backgrounds and experiences. The recent explosion of online mental health support services also shows promise to reach large numbers (especially young people), including men who may perceive such services to be less stigmatising and more convenient than in-person services. Research evaluating effectiveness, implementation practices and equity of access will be critical as these types of interventions roll out within GBV, SRH, HIV/AIDS, parenting, early child development and other global health programmes, as well as more broadly.

With the necessary global will and investment in evidence-based and readily scalable solutions, we can have an immense impact on mental health among men, families and communities struggling during the pandemic, as well as on long-term global health outcomes.

### Dietary quality of Americans by supplemental nutrition assistance program participation status: a systematic review [^112xybaB]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is an effective component in reducing food insecurity in the U.S. In the discussion of strategies to also help SNAP participants maximize diet quality, it is important to know their current dietary patterns and food choices. This paper provides a systematic review of recent U.S. studies on dietary quality, food consumption, and spending among SNAP participants as compared to income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants.

Evidence Acquisition

The review, completed in 2014, summarized studies that were peer-reviewed, published between January 2003 and August 2014, and provided data on dietary quality and intake of SNAP participants and nonparticipants.

Evidence Synthesis

Twenty-five studies were included in this review. Daily caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake of SNAP participants did not differ systematically from those of income-eligible nonparticipants; however, differences in dietary quality emerged. Adult SNAP participants scored lower on the Healthy Eating Index than either group of nonparticipants. Children's diets were similar among SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants, but were less nutritious than diets of higher-income children. The evidence regarding sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was mixed, with most studies indicating significantly higher beverage intake among SNAP participants compared with higher-income nonparticipants, but no difference compared to income-eligible nonparticipants.

Conclusions

SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.

Public policy approaches to promote healthy eating and active living — Implementation of public policy initiatives is a critically important component of a comprehensive approach to supporting all individuals in limiting alcohol consumption, eating healthy diets, and living a physically active lifestyle. Policies that improve access to healthy foods and beverages, provide information to consumers to support and facilitate healthier choices, limit marketing, advertising, and accessibility to foods and beverages of low nutritional value (including alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages), and establish standards for and increase funding for physical activity–related infrastructure in communities may be effective in improving healthy lifestyles and the primary prevention of cancer, other chronic diseases and disabilities, and other related health outcomes. Public policies in nutrition assistance programs including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that allow and incentivize healthy purchases such as vegetables and fruit have resulted in healthier food purchases and dietary patterns and could result in substantial health benefits. Standards for foods and beverages served in schools and in early childcare and education settings help ensure youth are exposed to nutrient-dense options and that energy-dense options are limited. Although research is mixed on menu labeling legislation, labeling may be more effective in specific types of restaurants and restaurants are reformulating menu items in part because of this legislation. Numerous recommended policy approaches to promote lifelong physical activity among Americans — especially for youth — include comprehensive school physical activity programming with high-quality physical education and daily recess, requirements for physical activity in afterschool and early childcare programs, and active transport opportunities to school, all with the potential to increase physical activity levels among youth.

### Changes in food insecurity among US adults with low income during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1118dZYZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that food insecurity prevalence decreased during the pandemic compared with the prepandemic period for US White adults with low income, but it did not change significantly for Hispanic, Asian, and Black adults. There were differential associations of both SNAP use and race and ethnicity with food insecurity changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Food insecurity prevalence decreased during the pandemic for SNAP participants in Asian, Hispanic, and White groups but did not decrease among non-SNAP participants in any racial and ethnic group. These findings suggest that expanded SNAP benefits during the pandemic may have played an important role in decreasing food insecurity for many adults with low income who were able to access SNAP but did not appear to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in food insecurity.

Several changes to SNAP, the majority of whose beneficiaries come from racial and ethnic minority groups, were enacted throughout the examined COVID-19 period. SNAP emergency allotments, which enabled all beneficiaries to receive the maximum benefit amount for their household size, became available at the beginning of the pandemic with all US states opting to participate. In October 2021, the Thrifty Food Plan reevaluation resulted in baseline increases for all SNAP beneficiaries, along with the annual cost-of-living adjustment.SNAP eligibility, enrollment, and maintenance requirements were also broadened, including waiving interview requirements in March 2020, suspending work requirements in April 2020, extending certification periods in April 2020, and expanding eligibility for qualifying students in February 2021. These changes may have contributed to our findings, wherein SNAP participants from Asian, Hispanic, and White groups experienced significant decreases in food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, several states gradually withdrew from the emergency allotment program, and the program ended in March 2023 for the remaining 32 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, all eligibility moderations ended by October 2023.

### Improving the nutritional impact of the supplemental nutrition assistance program:: perspectives from the participants [^11565ocX]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest federal food assistance program designed to alleviate food insecurity and improve dietary intake. This study assessed the opinions of SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants on their perceptions of the program and strategies to improve its nutritional impact.

Methods

This study surveyed 387 individuals via Amazon Mechanical Turk, of whom 118 were SNAP participants and 269 were food insufficient but not enrolled in SNAP (nonparticipants). Open-ended questions were coded and analyzed for thematic content. For closed-ended questions, response frequencies were compared using chi-square tests. Data were analyzed in 2016.

Results

SNAP participants reported that the program successfully served its primary purpose: to allow individuals to buy enough food to make ends meet and reduce food insecurity. Importance was placed on buying food for their children/families and the ability to allocate money for other expenses. To improve the nutritional impact, SNAP participants suggested more nutrition education, increasing the benefit allotment, incentivizing healthful foods, and excluding unhealthful foods for purchase with SNAP. When participants and nonparticipants were asked to choose between SNAP and a nutritionally enhanced program combining healthy incentives with exclusions for sugary beverages (i.e. SNAP+), 68% of participants and 83% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+. Of those who initially chose SNAP, 68% of participants and 64% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+ if paired with a 50% increase in total benefits.

Conclusions

SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants support policies that facilitate purchases of healthful foods and limit purchases of unhealthful foods, specifically sugary beverages.

### Treatment of pediatric overweight and obesity: position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based on an umbrella review of systematic reviews [^114tP2Df]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric overweight and obesity — registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) roles and reimbursement considerations emphasize addressing social needs, collaboration, and cost barriers. RDNs should be aware of local and community resources to facilitate healthy eating in patients with limited resources, and it may be beneficial for RDNs to routinely screen for food insecurity; the Hunger Vital Sign is a validated two-item tool to screen households for food insecurity. RDNs refer to and collaborate with other specialists when needed to address the complex needs of individuals, and complex interventions that address multiple targets and settings seem to be less likely to increase disparities. Evidence describing cost-effectiveness of pediatric weight management treatment interventions was limited and evidence certainty is VERY LOW. Inadequate reimbursement also contributes to lack of services in rural and underserved areas, and adequate reimbursement is crucial for increasing access. Obtaining adequate reimbursement will require demonstration of intervention efficacy on short- and long-term health outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness, and outcomes data can support increased reimbursement and justify institutional support. RDNs can participate in dietetics research through research projects within their university or organization or through the Academy's Nutrition Research Network and Evidence Analysis Center. Institutions can use innovative approaches to increase reach and engagement, including telehealth, group visits, and collaboration with community partners to increase cost efficiency, and new and novel models of care include integrating RDNs into primary care practices, improving access to RDNs, family-based behavioral group interventions, and telehealth and other remote delivery methods.

### Supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) participation and health care expenditures among low-income adults [^111ASFEj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Food insecurity is associated with high health care expenditures, but the effectiveness of food insecurity interventions on health care costs is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which addresses food insecurity, can reduce health care expenditures.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a retrospective cohort study of 4447 noninstitutionalized adults with income below 200% of the federal poverty threshold who participated in the 2011 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2012–2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).

Exposures

Self-reported SNAP participation in 2011.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Total health care expenditures (all paid claims and out-of-pocket costs) in the 2012–2013 period. To test whether SNAP participation was associated with lower subsequent health care expenditures, we used generalized linear modeling (gamma distribution, log link, with survey design information), adjusting for demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (income, education, Social Security Disability Insurance disability, urban/rural), census region, health insurance, and self-reported medical conditions. We also conducted sensitivity analyses as a robustness check for these modeling assumptions.

Results

A total of 4447 participants (2567 women and 1880 men) were enrolled in the study, mean (SE) age, 42.7 (0.5) years; 1889 were SNAP participants, and 2558 were not. Compared with other low-income adults, SNAP participants were younger (mean [SE] age, 40.3 [0.6] vs 44.1 [0.7] years), more likely to have public insurance or be uninsured (84.9% vs 67.7%), and more likely to be disabled (24.2% vs 10.6%) (P < .001 for all). In age- and gender-adjusted models, health care expenditures between those who did and did not participate in SNAP were similar (difference, $34; 95% CI, -$1097 to $1165). In fully adjusted models, SNAP was associated with lower estimated annual health care expenditures (-$1409; 95% CI, -$2694 to -$125). Sensitivity analyses were consistent with these results, also indicating that SNAP participation was associated with significantly lower estimated expenditures.

Conclusions and Relevance

SNAP enrollment is associated with reduced health care spending among low-income American adults, a finding consistent across several analytic approaches. Encouraging SNAP enrollment among eligible adults may help reduce health care costs in the United States.

### Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the society for nutrition education and behavior: food and nutrition programs for community-residing older adults [^116M5hbX]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2019). High credibility.

Food and nutrition programs for community-residing older adults — To enhance the overall relevance and increase funding of food and nutrition programs for community-residing older adults, the following steps are recommended. Improve evidence-based outcomes to design and implement uniform outcome data collection and analysis procedures that can be shared across community and health care settings and research institutions, conduct nutritional screenings and assessments and document food and nutrition programs impact on food and/or nutrient intake and nutritional status using validated tools, and determine the extent food and nutrition programs contribute toward health care– related outcomes, such as decreases in avoidable hospitalization, emergency department use, and long-term care. Better target programs to screen and assess those at high risk for food and nutrition-related problems due to health and cultural disparities, poor function, illnesses, chronic diseases, poor cognition, social isolation, and other risk factors, and collaborate with nutrition programs and health care delivery systems to streamline transitions of care. Communicate and coordinate across the various food and nutrition programs and agencies, and among health, social, and food and nutrition practitioners and their agencies to ensure coordination of services across the continuum of care. Advocate for increased funding for programs to increase the evidence base for effectiveness, improve targeting of programs to those most in need, collaborate with policymakers and payers on budgetary decisions, and publicize the need for and benefits of food and nutrition services at the local, state, and national level to payers, policy makers, and other stakeholders. Educate health care team members regarding nutrition-related disease management and educate older adults and caregivers about food safety risks and ways to lower risk and provide access to publicly available food safety resources, such as foodsafety.gov and cdc.gov/foodsafety.

### Reaching communities through food allergy advocacy, research, and education: a comprehensive analysis [^112NgwWU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Educational programs and resources

Educational initiatives are multifaceted, with an emphasis on reaching marginalized communities. These initiatives can be done at the school or community level. Almost six million children deal with FA, and schools, particularly those in underserved areas, are critical touch points for education. Teachers are increasingly becoming the first respondents to FA reactions in schools, often owing to a lack of available nursing staff to accommodate a large number of students, but deficiencies in teacher recognition and reaction have been identified. School-based initiatives should focus on allergy management, recognizing symptoms, and emergency response, concentrating on addressing disparities in access to health care. In the study by Shah et al, there was a 24.6% to 34.6% discrepancy in scores between teachers at the baseline schools and the intervention schools who received more education on FA. The results further exemplify the drastic change that can occur when there are improvements to the way education is delivered to the school faculty. Education initiatives through community outreach may take the form of awareness campaigns and community-based workshops to inform individuals and families about FA and best practices for allergen avoidance, targeting marginalized communities.

Measuring the effectiveness of education efforts

Evaluating the impact of educational programs is essential, particularly in underserved communities. Metrics such as increased awareness, adherence to allergen safety guidelines, and reduced allergic reactions serve as indicators of success, with a focus on addressing disparities in health care access and knowledge. A study in a Houston school district identified significant disparities between schools and their preparation for an allergic reaction depending on the SES, in which 97% of schools in the district reported having one or more students with allergies, but only 43% of the schools reported being equipped with epinephrine autoinjectors. When the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act went into effect, it increased the push and access for schools in lower-SES areas, which was shown to benefit their preparation, but education about FA, indications for epinephrine device use, and increased availability of assigned epinephrine devices are still needed.

### Beyond the clinic: improving child health through evidence-based community development [^114yuczb]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

In addition to helping select individual efficacious policies to improve child outcomes, another important application of our framework and policy briefs is to facilitate combining multiple strategies across domains of influence. This comprehensive approach contrasts with the narrow and isolated prevention efforts often implemented by local leaders and institutions. Ameliorating the many, and diverse, deleterious consequence of children living in high-poverty neighborhoods requires the mutually reinforcing benefits of multiple effective policy strategies across what have traditionally been viewed as separate areas of action. To illustrate a comprehensive approach to supporting child health and development (Figure 3), we selected 2–4 strategies per intervention domain based on the quality of the evidence (Level 1 or 2), magnitude of effects, and breadth of outcomes. This illustrative combination of evidence-based policy strategies is intended to improve income and resources for disadvantaged families; develop social cohesion within work, school and neighborhood environments; alter the physical environment to protect against risk and to promote physical activity and safety; encourage nurturing and safe home environments; provide high-quality education and educational environments; and support positive, health-promoting peer influences. Combining effective strategies across key intervention domains that influence child health produces multiple, positive reinforcing beneficial effects on intermediate and primary child health outcomes.

Primary outcomes

3.1 Change in the prevalence of undernourishment

None of the included studies measured prevalence of undernourishment.

3.2 Proportion of household expenditure on food

We found no evidence about the effect of income‐generation interventions on the proportion of household expenditure on food. Although two PCS mentioned this outcome in their manuscript, they did not report relevant numerical data or indicate clearly the direction of the effect (Alaofe 2016; Kennedy 1989). Four other PCS reported total expenditure on food, not in relation to income or total expenditure and these results are thus not reported here (Asadullah 2015; Jodlowski 2016; Katz 2001; Murshed E Jahan 2011).

3.3 Proportion of households who were food secure

Two cRCTs reported the effects on food security of interventions where households received training for activities such as livestock management, aquaculture interventions and community development through women's self‐help groups (Darrouzet Nardi 2016; Osei 2017), whereas two cRCTs assessed the effects of an integrated agriculture and nutrition programme (Olney 2016; Marquis 2018). In one cRCT, households participated in a public works programme in Malawi (Beegle 2017). Six PCS assessing different interventions reported different food security or dietary diversity measures (Alaofe 2019; Asadullah 2015; Doocy 2017; Jodlowski 2016; Kangmennaang 2017; Weinhardt 2017).

Standard 4: Implementation — The nutrition support nurse (NSN) may participate in the implementation of an NCP to promote its appropriateness, safety, and accuracy and ensure that it is economic and resource-efficient care. The NSN shall participate in an interdisciplinary process for placement and management of enteral and vascular access devices, should collaborate with other healthcare professionals regarding the selection and insertion of the appropriate enteral or vascular access device for the patient's specific needs, and shall follow organizational policies and procedures for management of enteral and vascular access devices. The NSN with specialized education and validated competency may place, exchange, or remove enteral or vascular access devices, following formal established protocols and procedures, as delineated by clinical privileges and professional licensure laws. The NSN may write orders for feeding formulations and laboratory tests, adjust regimens according to response to therapy, changing clinical conditions, and nutrition parameters, as delineated by clinical privileges and professional licensure laws, and may recommend the equipment and supplies according to the route of nutrient administration, the type of feeding access device, the desired infusion rate, the clinical situation, safety, and cost-effectiveness according to the individual needs of the patient and family or caregiver. The NSN should use interventions designed to prevent, detect, and manage complications related to the feeding formulation, infusion rate, equipment and supplies, or access devices, may coordinate the patient/caregiver education program related to nutrition support, which should include assessment of learning needs, ability, and willingness to perform care, provision of education, identification of barriers to learning, evaluation of teaching effectiveness, and referral to appropriate community resources, and may develop or approve patient/caregiver educational materials related to the administration and management of nutrition support therapy modalities.

### Food insecurity in the food allergic population: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^1165vTgu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Food insecurity actions for allergy care — The report advises to "Develop community partnerships with pantries/food banks/ agencies in your community to provide more allergy-safe alternatives in the pantries", to "Start a food drive for allergy-friendly foods", and to "Consider starting a pantry or allergy-friendly shelf in your clinic that patients can access". It further directs to "Advocate for policy changes" with options including "Increased amounts of benefits", "Strengthening federal nutrition programs", "Assistance programs to recognize dietary restrictions with more options and alternatives available", and "Fewer restrictions on substitutions in the WIC program with more offerings of allergy-friendly foods and nutritionally equivalent offerings". It also states to "Change health plans to allow dietary accommodations with a prescription", noting "Produce prescriptions have been shown to be successful in improving fruit and vegetable consumption", that "Food prescriptions for healthy foods can promote behavior change, improve nutrition education, include financial incentives, and connect patients to local resources", and that "The food prescription movement has moved into other chronic disease management as well".

### Food assistance is associated with decreased nursing home admissions for Maryland's dually eligible older adults [^113uaiKe]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between SNAP benefits and nursing home admissions among low-income older adults. Study findings align with recent research showing that home delivered meals are associated with lower rates of nursing home admissions. In Maryland's dually eligible older adults, only about half received food assistance benefits and of those who received benefits, the average benefit was $117 per month, while 15% received the minimum benefit of $16 per month. Our findings that higher SNAP benefits are associated with fewer nursing home admissions suggest that greater spending on food assistance may reduce nursing home utilization.

Limitations to the methods

Limitations of this study include the following. First, we do not have access to information about and are unable to assess lifetime exposure to SNAP, food insecurity, lifetime access to health insurance, or housing adequacy. Second, our comprehensive approach to measurement and the inclusion of income and chronic conditions in our statistical models will lead to conservative estimates of association between food assistance and nursing home admission. Third, some individuals may have benefitted from food assistance programs other than SNAP such as food banks or Meals on Wheels, but information about other food assistance programs was not available to us. This could bias the results in a conservative direction. Fourth, people who enroll in SNAP may be fundamentally different in ways we have been unable to measure than people who do not, such as the ability to navigate the complex enrollment process. Due to this selection bias, the literature on SNAP has been somewhat mixed. While it is clear that SNAP decreases food insecurity, and minimizes the adverse effect of food insecurity on dietary quality and obesity. some studies have found greater obesity rates in women who participate in SNAP than in eligible nonparticipants (as summarized by a recent review by DeBono and colleagues). However, those studies may have been confounded by poor access to healthy foods in low income communities and biased by self-selection into the SNAP program; this association is not consistently found in longitudinal studies that apply instrumental variable or difference in difference techniques to account for self-selection. Because random assignment is not feasible for SNAP inferences regarding non-SNAP participants must be done with caution and we cannot assert causality. Due to the second stage modeling however, we can conclude that higher SNAP benefits among program participants are associated with a protective effect, since we are comparing SNAP participants to each other.

### Participant support for changes to the supplemental nutrition assistance program [^112dezSF]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This nationally representative study found that most SNAP participants, regardless of political affiliation, supported policies to expand SNAP, whereas restrictive policies were broadly unpopular. These findings highlight multiple potentially bipartisan strategies for expanding SNAP that could improve food access and diet quality. For example, similar to past studies, this study found high levels of support for increasing SNAP benefits for healthy foods specifically; evidence suggests increased benefits for healthy foods can improve diet quality and may be cost-effective due to reduced health care spending.

Study limitations include variation in participants' understanding of policy options and potential nonresponse bias. Although survey weights helped address nonresponse bias, it may still exist due to unobserved differences between respondents and nonrespondents.

As part of Farm Bill discussions, policymakers concerned about SNAP participants' diet quality may consider prioritizing these policies and other proposals to expand SNAP, given their broad, bipartisan support.

### Access to SNAP-authorized retailers and diet quality among SNAP recipients [^111HBqD1]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest federal nutrition assistance program in the US, serves more than 40 million residents with household incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty level through more than 250 000 SNAP-authorized retailers. However, despite this broad reach, poor dietary quality, which is associated with increased mortality risk, remains prevalent among low-income populations in the US. Although not all food retailers are authorized to accept SNAP benefits, those that are authorized are critical infrastructure through which recipients — who rely heavily on these benefits for food purchases — access food.

Food environments have been associated with mortality from cancer, heart failure, and cardiorenal diseases, as well as obesity and diabetes. While the retail landscape has shifted toward supercenters and convenience stores that particularly affect access patterns in low-income areas, the relationship between SNAP retailer access and participants' dietary quality remains unexamined at the national level.

Using restricted-use National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data linked with Historical SNAP Retailer Locator dataset, we assessed various dimensions of retail access, including both availability of and distance to different store types, while considering SNAP recipients' health conditions. Extending beyond previous studies of general food access, this SNAP-specific analysis provides evidence to inform priorities and policies regarding the improvement of dietary quality and reducing diet-related health disparities among participating low-income and vulnerable populations.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^116mDkzL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Food security "exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life" (FAO 2019). When these conditions are not met, the population and people within it are said to be food insecure.

Food insecurity and associated undernutrition affect health and socioeconomic development on different levels (Black 2013; Ecker 2012; Victora 2008). For adults, it has been associated with an increased risk of disability, morbidity and mortality, and with a decrease in income‐generation potential (Black 2008; Black 2013; Victora 2008). Food insecurity is also associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, both in high‐income as well as low‐ and middle‐income settings (Arenas 2019; Carter 2011; Cole 2011; Hadley 2006; Hadley 2008; Maynard 2018). Children who are affected may experience impaired physical and cognitive development, and decreased school performance (Black 2008; Black 2013; Liu 2012; Victora 2008). At the macro‐level, undernutrition is associated with direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are due to increased healthcare costs for preventing and treating affected individuals (Black 2013; Victora 2008). Indirect costs are due to poor productivity and losses of human resources due to mental and physical under‐performance and death (Victora 2008). Given these far‐reaching consequences, and considering that food security is defined as a human right by the United Nations (FAO 2003), it is important to address food insecurity.

### Evaluation of the scale-up and implementation of mind, exercise, nutrition… do it! (MEND) in British columbia: a hybrid trial type 3 evaluation [^111332Pw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to evaluate the implementation and scale-up of MEND in B.C. Canada. Scale-up of family-based childhood obesity intervention programs is likely a key component of strategies to combat the upward trends in childhood obesity. MEND B.C. was an example of how a cross-sectoral partnership can work together to implement and scale-up a comprehensive family-based behavioural health program over 4 years. The program reached a broad demographic of children and adolescents (7–13 years of age) in B.C. At scale, MEND B.C. was effective in improving BMI z-score, lifestyle behaviours and psychological well-being among children. However, we also identified several challenges to continuing the implementation of MEND, which included in B.C. targeting a program to overweight and obese children, program resource requirements, stakeholder need for more program delivery flexibility and tailoring the program to indigenous and non-traditional families.

Scaling up efficacious interventions into real-world settings is critical to prevent delays in community access to effective health services. The method of MEND B.C. implementation and scale-up followed the best-practices and strategies identified to support the scale-up of public health initiatives. The main strategies that supported the successful MEND B.C. scale-up were active engagement with multilevel stakeholders (e.g. B. C Ministry of Health, Childhood Obesity foundation) and delivery agents: YMCA of Greater Vancouver and BCRPA, PHSA) to implement and evaluate the program and to enable the stakeholders to work together to tailor the scale-up approach to the B.C. context. Other facilitators included: highly qualified and motivated staff with strong community connections, staff continuity, highly responsive external support (Regional Coordinators) and strong centralized training.

Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2023). High credibility.

Barriers and facilitators to application — low proportions of adults follow population-based recommendations for dietary intake and physical activity, which implies a need for professional behavior-change support for adults interested in preventing disease and associated costs and suffering; a major barrier to care is the cost of interventions and lack of payment available via employer or health insurance companies for interventions prior to disease development, with additional barriers that may include time and travel costs or childcare, transportation, and childcare; nutrition and exercise practitioners can address these barriers by extending their hours or offering options of delivering care, and remote care interventions may be more financially feasible and accessible for adults who work during business hours or feasible for adults who have disabilities or who live in rural communities; another potential barrier to care may be client motivation, and practitioners can assess a client's stage of change and adapt counseling/coaching methods and goals, while addressing scope limitations by creating a network of trusted, qualified practitioners from disciplines other than their own to encourage collaborative, responsible, high-quality care; to aid implementation, a two-page practitioner guide with key figures and take-home messages was created to be used as a quick reference tool.

### Community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries [^116MriXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Cluster randomised controlled trials

Evidence from two trials indicated that income‐generation interventions probably make little or no difference to wasting (2 trials, 3500 children; moderate‐certainty evidence; Table 3) (Osei 2017; Verbowski 2018). A meta‐analysis of these two studies showed no difference to stunting (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; I² = 0%; Analysis 3.5).

In addition to reporting the proportion of children who are stunted, Marquis 2018, Darrouzet Nardi 2016, and Osei 2017 reported on the effect of income‐generation interventions on mean HAZ. Data from these studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity (I² = 100%; Analysis 3.6). Marquis 2018 was at low overall risk of bias whereas Darrouzet Nardi 2016 and Osei 2017 were at unclear risk. All three studies assessed some form of training on agricultural practices or livestock management but, in all but one (Darrouzet Nardi 2016), nutrition and health education sessions were also provided, with which the most beneficial effects were observed. If this study was removed from the meta‐analysis, heterogeneity reduced to 0%. All three studies reported a clear effect favouring income‐generation interventions at 1 to 2.5 years of follow‐up. In Marquis 2018, the mean HAZ increased by 0.22 SD with the intervention at 12 months (95% CI 0.10 to 0.34; 428 children); the study assessed an integrated package of agricultural inputs and training as well as education in nutrition, health care and child stimulation for participants. In Darrouzet Nardi 2016, it increased by 0.03 SD in the intervention group, which included training for poverty alleviation, citizen empowerment, community development and optimisation of livestock management as means to generate income (95% CI 0.02 to 0.04; 609 children). However, the effect was unclear potentially favouring the intervention at one year. In Osei 2017, which assessed an enhanced homestead food production (EHFP) programme encompassing training in improved gardening and poultry‐rearing practices, among others, it increased by 0.22 SD at 2.5 years (95% CI 0.22 to 0.22; 2569 children) (Table 20).

### Trends and disparities in diet quality among US adults by supplemental nutrition assistance program participation status [^113BRPMq]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program served 42.1 million people in fiscal year 2017, with an annual budget of $70 billion, exceeding the budgets of the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Food and Drug Administration, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality combined. While SNAP provides essential financial assistance to alleviate hunger and food insecurity in low-income families, less emphasis has been given to improving diet quality and healthfulness. To our knowledge, the time trends in diet disparities of multiple food groups and nutrients associated with chronic diseases have not been previously evaluated by SNAP participation status. Our results demonstrate that from 1999 to 2014, overall diet quality of SNAP participants did not significantly improve, in contrast to improvements among both income-eligible nonparticipants and higher-income individuals. Consistent with this, disparities in most individual dietary components persisted or worsened over time.

Some improvements were seen in individual dietary components among SNAP participants. These included increased whole grains, whole fruits, and dark green vegetables and decreased SSBs. These encouraging trends could be attributable to public health policies and nutrition education that influence all consumers, including SNAP participants, such as the 5 A Day national campaign, increasing public support for tax initiatives on SSBs, and new federal dietary recommendations on whole grains in 2000 and 2005. Advocacy groups such as the AHA have also launched nutrition campaigns, while the food industry has increased the number of whole-grain products 20-fold over 10 years.

Despite these positive trends, we found that SNAP participants experienced the smallest improvements in these food categories and also experienced increasing disparities in processed meats, added sugars, nuts and seeds, and fish and shellfish. Our findings highlight the need to investigate and address the reasons for these worsening disparities. For example, access to healthful foods and beverages by low-income families participating in SNAP may remain limited. Our findings should not be interpreted as a causal effect of participating in SNAP, however. It is possible that dietary trends in this group could have been even worse without participation in SNAP. Nevertheless, our findings underscore the need for robust new strategies to improve diet quality and reduce dietary disparities in the United States.

Community resources and financial supports — clinician roles and available programs are summarized: the clinician should be knowledgeable about community-based resources that can help reduce the pragmatic and emotional burdens of pediatric illness; hospitals and other community programs may have parent support groups, and clergy and members of religious congregations are of invaluable support and can educate the medical team about the family's religious beliefs; specialized day treatment facilities can reduce daily burdens, offer education, and provide contact with other families; camps for children with specific physical illnesses offer safe care, education, opportunities for independence and peer interactions, and respite for parents, and parents themselves become expert advocates; national organizations (including Make-a-Wish Foundation) and agencies such as Family Voices and the Federation for Children With Special Health Care Needs provide services, information, networking, eligibility information, and sometimes financial aid; together with the family, the clinician can identify supportive organizations; given the often inordinate costs, the clinician should encourage parents to explore eligibility for state or federal financial and management benefits, and community fundraising can offer additional financial resources and a gratifying validation of others' caring.

Child and Adult Care Food Program — scope, eligibility, and meal standards are as follows: The Child and Adult Care Food Program provides nutritious meals and snacks to eligible adults 60 years old and older enrolled in adult day care centers. Community-residing adults living with family members are also targeted. To participate, a center must be licensed to provide care and sign an agreement with a sponsoring organization. Low-income older adults may receive meals at no cost to the participant. Meal patterns vary depending on participant age and type of meal served, but all meals must meet federal dietary guidelines.

Introduction

Black individuals have had consistently higher food insecurity rates during the past 20 years than White individuals in the US, even after accounting for relatively lower mean income levels. However, national data examining racial disparities in food insecurity have not accounted for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation. This is an important gap for 2 reasons. First, longitudinal studies, applying quasi-experimental methods have shown that SNAP participation reduces food insecurity by providing money for food, and there is also good evidence that households that are food insecure are more likely to enroll in SNAP than food-secure households. Therefore, SNAP may play a key role in attenuating racial disparities in food insecurity by addressing economic inequality, but these potential effects have not been considered in prior studies. Second, there is conflicting information about racial disparities in SNAP access. As examples, 1 study found that parents of children who are Black were less likely to be consistently enrolled in SNAP than parents of children who were White,1 study documented lower SNAP participation rates in predominately Black Southern states, and 1 study in the Baltimore City area found that individuals who are Black were more likely to participate in SNAP than those who are White. Overall, there is a lack of attention paid in national data to the role of SNAP in addressing racial disparities in food insecurity.

There is good rationale to evaluate the role of SNAP because of evidence of racially segregated access to healthy foods. There is substantial geographic variation in the price of basic healthy food itemsand some evidence that predominately Black neighborhoods have higher prices for items such as low-fat milk and fruits and vegetables. Although there has been an increasing recognition of the ways that structural racism in the health care sector has shaped health inequitiesand an increasing recognition that food insecurity is a public health issue, there is a lack of attention to the ways that systemic racism in food systems and food assistance programs may shape food insecurity inequities. Therefore, this study examined the interrelationships among racial background, SNAP access, and food insecurity among households that are income eligible for the SNAP program (incomes ≤ 130% of the federal poverty threshold). Specifically, this study examined racial disparities in food insecurity overall and compared households participating in SNAP with those not participating.
