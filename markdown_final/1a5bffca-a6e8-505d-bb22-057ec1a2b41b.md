## Question

provide more detail and structure to dosing and dosage form used

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for more detail and structure on dosing and dosage form used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of dose versus dosage and dosage form versus route. Then, I should verify the regulatory framework and labeling conventions that govern how dosing is presented. Next, I will examine patient-specific factors that necessitate dose individualization, followed by formulation and route considerations that shape dose selection. After that, I should review dose optimization strategies across drug development phases, including special populations and therapeutic drug monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing principles and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate terms. Dose refers to the specific amount of drug administered at one time, whereas dosage refers to the amount plus the frequency and schedule, so "500 mg twice daily" is a dosage and "500 mg" is a dose, and this distinction is codified in FDA labeling guidance and reflected in drug labels that specify dose, interval, and duration [^f666c4ad] [^f3bc28dd]. Dosage form denotes the physical form of the drug product, such as tablet, capsule, solution, injection, or patch, while route of administration describes the path by which the drug is given, for example oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, topical, or transdermal, and these are standardized in structured product labeling frameworks to ensure clarity and interoperability [^b0f4d28e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about how dosing is determined; I need to check the regulatory framework that shapes what appears on labels. FDA labeling guidance requires that the Dosage and Administration section present recommended dose, frequency, titration, maximum dose, and duration, and it distinguishes dose from dosage consistently throughout labeling, which anchors how clinicians interpret and apply prescribing information [^f666c4ad] [^f3bc28dd]. Early FDA–sponsor interactions often support individualized dosing strategies, and FDA has encouraged sponsors to evaluate multiple doses and incorporate exposure–response data into dose selection, which increasingly influences whether labels include dose adjustments by phenotype, genotype, or organ function [^34e1db7c] [^cc7dee14].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that necessitate dose individualization, and I need to ensure I cite high-quality sources. Age, body size, organ function, genetics, and concomitant medications can materially alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, so dose must be tailored; for example, warfarin dosing is individualized by clinical factors and CYP2C9/VKORC1 genotype, with typical maintenance ranges of 2–10 mg daily and explicit cautions to start low in elderly or Asian patients and to avoid routine loading doses [^da12b9d2] [^79ebb08b]. In pediatrics, weight-based dosing is standard, but I should confirm that simple mg/kg scaling is insufficient; developmental pharmacology and maturation of clearance pathways require pediatric-specific PK/PD studies and, when available, model-informed dosing to avoid under- or overdosing [^f732d2a9] [^b97ddfb4]. For renally cleared drugs, KDIGO advises considering non–BSA-indexed eGFR and adapting dosing when GFR or volume of distribution is not at steady state, which is crucial in obesity, pregnancy, and dynamic renal function [^a2abae4c] [^3732f72a].

> I will now examine formulation and route considerations that shape dose selection and patient outcomes. Immediate-release versus extended-release formulations change dose frequency and peak/trough exposure, which can improve adherence and tolerability; for example, HIV treatment guidelines prioritize once-daily and single-tablet regimens to enhance adherence and virologic outcomes, and reducing dose frequency has been associated with better adherence and outcomes across chronic diseases [^75f3bafa] [^365829f7]. But wait, what if the route changes bioavailability; I should double-check that switching routes may require dose adjustments, as with dabigatran where different oral dosage forms are not interchangeable milligram-for-milligram and renal impairment mandates lower doses, underscoring the need to match dose to formulation and organ function [^bce94eaa] [^64bc46b1]. In pediatrics, liquid formulations are often necessary for accurate weight-based dosing, and standardized dosing tools are recommended to reduce home administration errors, especially for small volumes [^7239ec56].

> Let me consider dose optimization across drug development phases, and I should confirm where the evidence is strongest. Historically, oncology relied on maximum tolerated dose, but modern targeted therapies and ADCs often show non-linear exposure–response and narrow therapeutic windows, prompting randomized dose-finding, schedule optimization, and response-guided strategies; recent analyses show many newly approved oncology agents are candidates for dose reduction or regimen modification to improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy [^2a9b8b36] [^caea7498]. FDA's Project Optimus encourages randomized evaluations of multiple doses early in development, and model-informed approaches are increasingly used to integrate PK, PD, efficacy, and safety to select optimal doses and schedules, including for subsequent indications where dose may need adjustment for safety or tumor biology differences [^cc7dee14] [^6bc6e987]. For antibiotics in critical illness, early TDM and PK/PD-targeted dosing are advocated to rapidly achieve pharmacodynamic targets and overcome altered volumes of distribution and clearance, highlighting the need for early, aggressive, and monitored dosing strategies in sepsis and severe infection [^7f265514] [^3b1d3826].

> I should confirm special population nuances so I don't overgeneralize. In pediatrics, regulatory incentives have improved labeling, yet many drugs still lack pediatric-specific dosing; model-based approaches and opportunistic PK sampling are essential to derive evidence-based pediatric regimens and to update formularies as new data emerge [^f732d2a9] [^83f7d499]. In older adults, physiologic changes and polypharmacy complicate dosing; modeling and simulation can help anticipate age-related PK/PD shifts and guide safer starting doses and titration cadence, though evidence generation remains challenging [^dc0e1ce0]. In pregnancy, physiologic changes alter drug disposition; population PK models have informed dose adjustments for agents like darunavir, illustrating the value of MIPD in special populations where traditional trials are limited [^5e80bcbf].

> Next, I should review therapeutic drug monitoring and precision dosing, and I need to ensure I distinguish population targets from individual targets. TDM adjusts dosing to achieve predefined exposure targets associated with efficacy and safety, and is standard for narrow therapeutic index drugs like immunosuppressants and some antibiotics; however, emerging critiques argue that population-level targets may not be optimal for all individuals, calling for biomarker-integrated, individual-level targets that account for interpatient variability in pharmacodynamics and disease biology [^365829f7] [^0ee848de]. In oncology, PK-guided dose personalization is increasingly justified for targeted agents with exposure–response relationships, and some experts argue that randomized trials may not always be necessary if exposure links to outcomes are robust and dose adjustments are feasible [^a225ca01]. For antibiotics, early TDM within the first 24–48 hours and use of loading doses can mitigate underexposure during the critical early treatment window in sepsis, though protocols must balance timeliness with analytical readiness [^7f265514].

> Let me synthesize practical prescribing principles, and I should double-check that each element is evidence-linked. Start low and titrate to effect while monitoring for efficacy and toxicity, as done with stimulants in pediatric ADHD and heart failure therapies where even subtarget doses confer benefit, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration across analgesics and anti-inflammatories to minimize harm [^4f899082] [^1b5655c2] [^9ba49797]. Individualize based on patient factors and drug properties, including organ function, body size, genetics, and interactions, and prefer simpler regimens when feasible to support adherence, aligning with HIV and diabetes guidance favoring once-daily and single-tablet options when clinically appropriate [^75f3bafa] [^eb730a1e]. Document dose rationale and provide clear administration instructions, including food effects, swallowing constraints, and what to do if a dose is missed, to reduce errors and improve real-world effectiveness [^f84a0789].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and future directions; I should flag them explicitly. Many drugs still lack robust dose–exposure–response data in diverse populations, and regulatory incentives may be needed to extend precision dosing to off-patent agents and to standardize how real-world data inform label updates, as proposed in dosing roadmaps and precision dosing initiatives [^4af91807] [^50e2bfbe]. Implementation barriers for model-informed precision dosing persist, including unclear regulatory pathways, limited validation datasets, and workflow constraints, which must be addressed through multi-stakeholder collaboration and CDS integration [^1b4a4ab0] [^5e80bcbf]. Finally, the field must move toward integrating multiple biomarkers and patient-specific factors into individualized dosing targets, moving beyond one-size-fits-all population targets to realize the full promise of precision medicine [^0ee848de].

Dosing and dosage form selection should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors (age, weight, organ function, genetics, comorbidities) [^0497d4aa] and **drug-specific factors** (pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, therapeutic window, formulation) [^cc48b83c]. Use the **lowest effective dose** [^9ba49797] and titrate to response or target exposure, adjusting for renal/hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and adherence [^a7459075]. Choose dosage forms that balance efficacy, safety, and patient preference: immediate-release for rapid effect, extended-release for adherence, liquids for pediatrics, and parenteral for severe or non-oral cases [^a7459075] [^9ba49797] [^7239ec56] [^7fa91813]. Always follow label guidance and consider precision dosing or therapeutic drug monitoring when variability is high or the window is narrow [^f666c4ad] [^365829f7].

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing

- **Age**: Neonates, infants, children, and older adults have distinct pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, often requiring age-specific dosing adjustments [^f732d2a9] [^dc0e1ce0].

- **Body weight and surface area**: Pediatric dosing is commonly weight- or body surface area–based to account for growth and developmental changes [^06594593] [^f732d2a9].

- **Organ function**: Renal and hepatic impairment significantly alter drug clearance, necessitating dose adjustments to avoid toxicity or therapeutic failure [^a1ecdc45] [^37e75bf1].

- **Genetics**: Pharmacogenomic variability (e.g. CYP2D6, CYP2C19, DPYD) can markedly affect drug metabolism and response, supporting genotype-guided dosing in some cases [^da12b9d2] [^c7c381d0].

- **Comorbidities and concomitant medications**: Disease states and drug–drug interactions can alter exposure and response, requiring individualized dose modifications [^cc48b83c] [^0497d4aa].

---

## Drug-specific factors influencing dosing

- **Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics**: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics, as well as dose–response relationships, guide dose selection and titration [^cc48b83c] [^0497d4aa].

- **Therapeutic window**: Narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g. warfarin, digoxin, immunosuppressants) often require therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and careful dose adjustments to maintain efficacy while minimizing toxicity [^365829f7] [^050ed6ba].

- **Formulation considerations**: Immediate-release formulations provide rapid onset but may require frequent dosing, whereas extended-release formulations improve adherence but may have different onset/offset profiles [^a7459075].

---

## General principles of dosing

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at the lowest effective dose and titrate based on clinical response and tolerability [^4f899082] [^9ba49797].

- **Individualize dosing**: Tailor dose to patient-specific and drug-specific factors rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach [^0497d4aa] [^1cfed7d9].

- **Monitor and adjust**: Regularly assess efficacy, safety, and adherence, adjusting the dose as needed [^59c0ca0c] [^4f899082].

## Dosage form considerations

| **Dosage form** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immediate-release tablets/capsules | - Rapid onset <br/> - Flexible titration | - Frequent dosing <br/> - Adherence challenges | Short-term or acute therapy; rapid effect needed [^notfound] |
| Extended-release tablets/capsules | - Reduced dosing frequency <br/> - Improved adherence | - Slower onset <br/> - Less flexibility | Chronic conditions; stable patients [^a7459075] |
| Liquid formulations | - Flexible dosing <br/> - Suitable for pediatrics | - Taste issues <br/> - Stability concerns | Pediatrics; patients with swallowing difficulties [^7239ec56] |
| Injectable formulations | - Rapid onset <br/> - Bypass GI issues | - Invasive <br/> - Requires trained personnel | Severe/acute conditions; non-oral patients [^7fa91813] |

## Special populations and dosing adjustments

- **Pediatrics**: Weight-based dosing, developmental pharmacology, and age-appropriate formulations are essential; model-informed approaches are increasingly used to optimize pediatric dosing [^f732d2a9] [^b97ddfb4].

- **Geriatrics**: Lower starting doses, slower titration, and heightened monitoring for adverse effects are recommended due to altered pharmacokinetics and increased vulnerability [^dc0e1ce0] [^16e2bb6f].

- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: Dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance or Child-Pugh score are critical to avoid accumulation and toxicity [^a1ecdc45] [^37e75bf1].

- **Pregnancy**: Physiological changes alter drug disposition; careful dose selection and monitoring are required, with preference for agents with established safety profiles [^5e80bcbf].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Precision dosing**: Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) integrates patient-specific data to individualize dosing, particularly for drugs with high interindividual variability or narrow therapeutic windows [^5e80bcbf] [^1b4a4ab0].

- **Digital health tools**: Mobile apps and clinical decision support systems are being developed to support dose calculation, adherence, and monitoring [^4af91807].

- **Regulatory guidance**: FDA and other authorities increasingly emphasize dose optimization, exposure–response characterization, and inclusion of diverse populations in clinical trials to improve dosing recommendations [^cc7dee14] [^884eb491].

---

Dosing and dosage form selection require a **patient-centered, evidence-based approach** that integrates patient-specific factors, drug properties, and clinical context. By starting low, titrating to effect, and leveraging appropriate formulations, clinicians can optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing harm.

RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

These changes provide a number of new research opportunities to provide more optimal dosing recommendations for all patients. It will be useful to establish working groups with diverse perspectives to create prioritized investment topics including the following:
Develop precision dosing recommendations for high priority off‐patent drugs. Lists need to be prepared with input from clinicians (e.g. physicians and pharmacists) and possibly patient advocacy groups. This could be coordinated by American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT) by therapeutic area possibly in conjunction with a disease centric society (e.g. American Cancer Society). These groups can participate in raising funding, approving a research plan and investigators, reviewing plans with the FDA Office of New Drugs therapeutic division for comment before starting, and, once the research is complete, filing a Citizen Petition to add more precise dosing to the label.
Create a regulatory path to revise drug labeling for generic drugs by including more precise dosing based on new research. This will likely require a Citizen Petition application to the FDA Office of New Drugs.
Better quantify the impact of individual patient characteristics on efficacy, safety, and dosing.
Better predict drug absorption and clearance for different mechanisms across patient‐disease diversity leading to better prediction tools.
Develop better disease models from clinical end points to biomarkers, including wearable devices and patient‐reported outcomes.
Develop CDS software that recommends optimal treatment choices in real time (e.g. drug dose and regimen) based on patient data in their chart (disease, phenotype, genotype, and laboratory data) and current drug optimal drug dosing information from broader sources.
Develop better patient drug exposure level sampling techniques/devices and assay technology offering greater analytical accuracy, speed, convenience, and cost‐effective data.
Develop and maintain clinical data and model warehouses/libraries facilitating both research and dosing tool development/improvement.
Development of new formulations that better support optimization of individual dosing.
Develop regulatory standards for what constitutes adequate predictive ability to be used for dosing recommendations.

ADJUSTING DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE DOSING FOR ALL

Consideration should be given to making a few relatively minor changes to the current drug development‐regulatory paradigm based on three principles:
Commitment to provide drug dosing information supporting efficacy and safety for all patients likely to be prescribed the drug as close to market approval as possible and then continuously improve this information by incorporation of RWE.
Continuously invest in developing better prediction tools supporting efficacy, safety, and dosing across projects.
Specific company and the FDA actions taken to develop and implement precision dosing during the investigational new drug process are described in Figure 1 below. These eight steps are designed to determine the need for precision dosing for a new drug, develop the information and analysis needed to create dosing recommendations, and to systematically revise dosing recommendations over the product life cycle.

### A systematic assessment of US food and drug administration dosing recommendations for drug development programs amenable to response-guided titration [^34e1db7c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

A key goal in drug development is optimized dosing for patients. Interactions between drug developers and regulatory scientists throughout development are important for the optimization of dosing and serve as a forum to discuss approaches for optimal dosing, such as precision or individualized dosing. To date, there has not been a systematic assessment of the advice provided by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to drug developers from an individualized dosing perspective. Here, we reviewed FDA recommendations on dose selection for efficacy trials at end-of-phase meetings between the FDA and drug developers for 76 new molecular entities approved between 2013 and 2017 that are considered amenable for an individualized dosing method, response-guided titration. Forty FDA dosing recommendations were identified as specific to dose selection and design of the respective efficacy trials and subsequently: (i) characterized based on if they were supportive of individualized dosing and (ii) compared with dosing regimens used in efficacy trials and labeling at approval to evaluate if FDA recommendations were implemented. Of these 40 recommendations for efficacy trials, 35 (88%) were considered supportive of individualized dosing. Eighteen of these 40 recommendations (45%) were incorporated into efficacy trials and 11 (28%) were incorporated into labeling. This research suggests that early FDA-sponsor interactions can support the study of doses in efficacy trials that may lead to individualized dosing strategies in labeling.

### Barriers and facilitators for bringing model-informed precision dosing to the patient's bedside: a systematic review [^1b4a4ab0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) utilizes mathematical models to predict the optimal medication dose tailored to an individual patient or a patient population. The goal of MIPD is to enhance drug treatment by determining the most adequate dose to achieve therapeutic benefits, while preventing toxicity. However, little research has been conducted on the clinical implementation of MIPD, which remains limited in practice.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

This systematic review aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for the implementation of MIPD into patient care.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

This study draws an overview of barriers and facilitators pertaining to the implementation of MIPD in clinical care. It underscores key challenges that need to be addressed, including unclear regulatory pathways for model endorsement, limited data availability for model validation, technical and logistical hurdles, and financial barriers linked to implementing MIPD in clinical practice. Additionally, it highlights opportunities for promoting MIPD implementation, emphasizing the importance of multi‐stakeholder collaboration and awareness‐raising regarding the benefits of MIPD.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

We have highlighted important barriers for the clinical application of MIPD and potential opportunities to address them. This may promote a broader use of MIPD in clinical care, with potential improvement in drug therapies for special populations.

### New paradigm in dose-finding trials: patient-specific dosing and beyond phase I [^813baedb]. Clinical Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

We propose a new paradigm for the clinical evaluation of new cancer therapies. It entails adjusting the search for the optimal dose on the basis of measurable patient characteristics that may be predictive of adverse responses to treatment, and extending this search beyond phase I and into phases II and III. We provide examples of (a) how the fine-tuning of dose may involve utilization of patient-specific attributes to obtain a personalized treatment regimen, and (b) how novel methods for phase I design can be used to update the working dose for the conduct of phase II and III cancer clinical trials. These examples should be interpreted as an enticement for the development of new methods to implement the proposed new paradigm.

### The impact of reducing dose frequency on health outcomes [^a7459075]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Dosing schedules may be one important factor determining whether patients take their prescribed medication. Schedules may influence whether a patient stays on the prescribed therapy and, if so, the degree to which the regimen is followed. Both factors are important determinants of health outcomes and health care costs.

Objective

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of reducing dose frequency on health outcomes and health care costs.

Methods

Articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified from the medical literature databases MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and HealthSTAR for the years 1985 through 2002. The search included all references that reported on the impact of a change of dose frequency on chronic disease. Search terms used were combinations of dose frequency, dose schedule, and dosing and efficacy, safety, clinical effectiveness, preferences, adherence, compliance, persistence, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, resource use, and costs.

Results

Reducing the number of daily doses through extended-release formulations or newer drugs has frequently been shown to provide the patient with better symptom control in a number of disease states. Overall improvements were seen in adherence, patient quality of life, patient satisfaction, and costs. However, results of some studies indicate that not all patients, medications, or diseases may be candidates for reduced dosing due to the potential effects on symptom control, incidence of adverse events, and overcompensation for missed doses.

Conclusion

Where feasible, reducing dose frequency may offer benefits for the patient in terms of health outcomes and for the health care budget holder in terms of costs.

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^1cfed7d9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Today clinicians may have to guess the drug dosing regimen if the patient is a neonate, very old, morbidly obese, emaciated, or has any number of other factors (e.g. unusual genotype, renal failure, and/or taking an interacting drug). It has been estimated that clinicians treating neonate patients may face this dilemma five times daily. 1 Relatively recent regulatory changes have provided a scientific and clinical basis for dosing pediatric patients for many new drugs. 2 Yet, drug dosing is still guesswork for clinicians treating the many patients who are not well‐represented in clinical trials upon which the regulatory approved label is primarily based. Current labels typically fall between one of two patient drug dosing extremes where either each patient's dose is titrated to a biomarker (e.g. plasma glucose, cholesterol, or drug concentration), or one dosing regimen is approved for all adult patients without adequately understanding the limits based on age, size, organ function, genetics, or drug interactions.

At market approval, the new drug labelled dosing regimen usually reflects the dosing scheme used in the phase III pivotal studies, upon which the regulatory approval decision was based with additional dosing adjustments for pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) reasons. Dosing adjustment characteristics are either quantitative or directional (e.g. increase/decrease dose) and univariate (one factor, not combinations of factors). Although more recent legislation has provided incentives for pharmaceutical companies to provide dosing recommendations for children, much of this work is incomplete at initial approval with a multiple year gap until pediatric labeling is approved and incorporated. Further, adult dose selection may be guesswork for a patient who has characteristics at the extremes of size or age, is pregnant, or who is medically complex (polypharmacy or specific genotypes), as these types of patients typically are excluded from clinical trials. 3, 4, 5 However, it does not have to be this way. It is now feasible to decrease the uncertainty of dosing such patients by integrating available scientific knowledge, utilizing newly available real‐world patient (RWP) data‐analytics, and modifying current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐industry practices.

### Determining the optimal dose in the development of anticancer agents [^cc48b83c]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Identification of the optimal dose remains a key challenge in drug development. For cytotoxic drugs, the standard approach is based on identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I trials and incorporating this to subsequent trials. However, this strategy does not take into account important aspects of clinical pharmacology. For targeted agents, the dose-effect relationships from preclinical studies are less obvious, and it is important to change the way these agents are developed to avoid recommending drug doses for different populations without evidence of differential antitumour effects in different diseases. The use of expanded cohorts in phase I trials to better define MTD and refine dose optimization should be further explored together with a focus on efficacy rather than toxicity-based predictions. Another key consideration in dose optimization is related to interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. High variability in intra-individual pharmacokinetics has been observed for many orally-administered drugs, especially those with low bioavailability, which might complicate identification of dose-effect relationships. End-organ dysfunction, interactions with other prescription drugs, herbal supplements, adherence, and food intake can influence pharmacokinetics. It is important these variables are identified during early clinical trials and considered in the development of further phase II and subsequent large-scale phase III studies.

### Pharmacokinetic studies in children: recommendations for practice and research [^f732d2a9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The importance of improving pharmacotherapy for children is widely recognised. Until recently, only 30% of medications used in paediatrics in the USA were actually studied in children. The lack of appropriate drug labelling for children is a long-standing problem, which also has implications for drug safety, particularly in neonates. High-quality pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies are an essential component of understanding the dose–concentration–effect relationship and should underpin dosing recommendations in children. Without PK data from appropriate populations to support marketing authorisations, clinicians have little choice but to use medications off-label, which can lead to increased risk of toxicity or subtherapeutic dosing. During drug development, model-based (pharmacometric) approaches can be used in several ways, including identifying the dose regimen for different age groups in order to inform clinical trial design. PK/PD models can inform the expected effect size during sample size calculations, reducing the burden of unnecessary research, and also help refine dosing strategies relevant to routine clinical practice.

Despite detailed guidance on adult PK/PD research, specific challenges affect the design and conduct of paediatric pharmacological studies. This review defines the key challenges encountered, exploring solutions and providing recommendations for practice and future research.

Paediatric PK studies: what are they?

PK studies absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs. PK studies guide the determination of a drug's optimal route of administration and formulation, and appropriate dose and dose schedule(s). PK studies include (1) early-phase studies including PK components, comprising (a) first-dose-in-child studies and (b) phase II and III studies; and (2) phase IV postmarketing PK studies (including, eg, dose optimisation or therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) studies).

Paediatric research is challenging because children are considered vulnerable and sample sizes are small. Nevertheless, accurate dosing is paramount to safe and effective treatment, which makes paediatric PK studies essential. The USA and European Union (EU) have adopted paediatric clinical trial regulations to address historic deficiencies in this research. These reflect the recent paradigm shift in attitudes recognising that 'the time has come to protect children and young people through research not from research'.

### Precision dosing: an industry perspective [^ef98771f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

In determining the need or opportunity for precision dosing, the critical factors are the size of the individual therapeutic window compared with the variability between patients and the consequences of using a suboptimal dose. There are not simply two groups of drugs with either a wide or no population level therapeutic window; instead there is a continuum from drugs for which one‐size‐fits‐all dosing is feasible to those where it is impossible. Towards the "impossible" end of the continuum are drugs where it is possible to identify a single dose level with acceptable efficacy and safety but for which an individualized precision dosing approach would deliver significantly greater efficacy and/or safety, albeit at the cost of some added complexity (Figure 1c). An elegant mathematical approach to describe this uses utility functions to demonstrate the variation of optimal individual doses compared with the optimal population dose. 2 Today such drugs are still developed using the familiar one‐dose‐for‐all approach that meets health authority needs. They remain separated in our minds from the small group of drugs where precision dosing is an absolute requirement. The questions for drug developers are is this the right thing to do and will the dividing line change in future use?

It is becoming easier and therefore more necessary to consider precision dosing in the future for drugs that today are developed, approved, and used as one dose for all. 1 From the industry perspective it is important to note that prescribers and payers are exploring ways to reduce drug expenditure by individualized dosing, which should encourage a better understanding of dosing at the time of approval and pricing. The growth of outcomes‐based pricing will further encourage understanding of dose individualization. Precision dosing will increase efficacy and/or decrease unacceptable adverse events and thereby improve development success rates and competitiveness in clinical use. Precision dosing is already included successfully in some clinical development today. Seventeen percent of drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2013 and 2017 have a response‐guided dose titration component in their label. In almost all of these cases the pivotal trials included the precision dosing approach or multiple separate dose levels from which a subsequent dose titration could be developed. 3 Omalizumab was developed with a dosing algorithm taking account of disease variability, specifically immunoglobulin E concentration, 4 and replacement therapies for immunoglobulin 5 or factor VIII protein / von Willebrand factor protein 6 included relatively complex precision dosing algorithms in at least one pivotal trial.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^1b5655c2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

What can we conclude about the dosing of evidence‐based pharmacotherapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

The most correct conclusion from the landmark trials in HFrEF is that the substantial benefits observed were obtained despite a third to a half of patients not achieving the 'target doses' aspired to. However, it is important to reiterate that in all trials it was recognized that every patient would not tolerate the target dose and up‐titration towards the target might be limited by intolerance (and indeed for some drugs was limited by the protocol e.g. because of hyperkalaemia). The rate of target dose achievement must also be interpreted in the light of the rates achieved in the placebo group. Therefore, the average dose achieved and the proportion attaining the target dose, as compared with the same metrics in the relevant trials, is the best way to assess dosing success in a patient cohort; it is a mistake to assume that 100% of patients should achieve the target dose. More importantly, it must be recognized that the low doses used during the up‐titration phase of these drugs also have a substantial effect. It is this evidence – that there is a clear clinical benefit from even low doses and this is demonstrable within a very short time after starting treatment – that supports the change in emphasis in the new guidance. Up‐titrating the dose of a single agent before starting the next therapy is of secondary importance. Initiating a low dose of as many protective therapies as possible as quickly as possible is the priority. This is to avoid delay in obtaining the early and additive benefit from the multiple mechanistically distinct evidence‐based therapies available. As argued elsewhere, the order in which these drugs is started does not matter and may be tailored to patient characteristics. Up‐titration of dose, guided by patient tolerability, remains important but can be done later.

### Using quantitative approaches to optimize dosages for new combinations and subsequent indications for oncology drugs [^26182c65]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Ongoing efforts to optimize the dosages of oncology drugs have largely focused on the initial indication, with emphasis placed on maximizing the utility of all available evidence to improve dose finding, dose selection, and trial design; however, optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications is more complex and warrants further discussion. For example, the dose-response (DR) or exposure-response (ER) relationships can change when multiple drugs are used (combination therapies) and can differ between tumor types, patient populations, and treatment settings (subsequent indications). Quantitative approaches can help address the challenges of optimizing dosages for new combinations or subsequent indications. To further this dialogue, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Clinical Pharmacology and the International Society of Pharmacometrics co-sponsored a workshop to discuss the development of investigational and approved drugs in new combinations or for subsequent indications using model-informed approaches to investigate, support, and select optimized dosages for oncology drugs.

### Optimizing dosing of oncology drugs [^666ecb46]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to acknowledge the challenges in optimizing the dosing of oncology drugs and to propose potential approaches to address these challenges in order to optimize effectiveness, minimize toxicity, and promote adherence in patients. These approaches could provide better opportunities to understand the sources of variability in drug exposure and clinical outcomes during the development and premarketing evaluation of investigational new drugs.

### Towards rational cancer therapeutics: optimizing dosing, delivery, scheduling, and combinations [^8ac3be20]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The current trend to personalize anticancer therapies mostly relies on selecting the best drug or combination of drugs to achieve optimal efficacy in patients. In addition to the comprehensive genetic and molecular knowledge of each tumor before choosing the drugs to be given, there is probably much room left for improvement by further personalizing the very modes by which the drugs are given, once they have been carefully selected. In particular, shifting from standard dosing to tailored dosing should help in maintaining drug exposure levels in the right therapeutic window, thus ensuring that the efficacy/toxicity balance is optimal. This paper covers the current knowledge regarding pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of anticancer agents, from decades-old cytotoxics to the latest immune checkpoint inhibitors, the most frequent sources for long-neglected interpatient variability impacting on drug exposure levels, and what could be done to achieve real personalized medicine in oncology such as implementing therapeutic drug monitoring with adaptive dosing strategies or using model-driven modalities for personalized dosing and scheduling.

### Drug dosing recommendations for all patients: a roadmap for change [^b8170f50]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Country differences in drug dose selection seem reasonable to expect when the decision is made based on the likelihood of providing the best opportunity for local patients to achieve efficacy without toxicity based on evidence. Several ways to achieve this are to include more local patients in global clinical pivotal studies, include adequate measures to characterize the patient, disease, and drug so that responders can be differentiated from nonresponders, and to use modeling to bridge the clinical trial results to local patient population characteristics. This may require revising ICH guidances on clinical trials, dose‐response, and ethnicity.

### Oncology dose selection in subsequent indications: what can we learn from FDA-approved oncology drugs? [^6bc6e987]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The modern oncology drug development landscape has shifted away from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies. Following their initial approvals, many oncology drugs have been approved in subsequent indications either as monotherapy or in combination to benefit a broader patient population. To date, dose selection strategies for subsequent indications have not been systematically reviewed. This review examines how approved dosing regimens were selected in subsequent indications for FDA-approved oncology drugs.

Methods

The Drugs@FDA database was used to identify FDA-approved new molecular entities (NMEs) between 2010 and 2023. NMEs with more than 1 approved indication were included in the analysis. In total, the dosing regimens for 67 novel oncology drugs that obtained FDA approvals for multiple indications were evaluated.

Findings

Overall, in subsequent indications, 72% of NMEs used the same or clinically equivalent alternative dosing regimens to those approved in the initial indications. Amongst the 28% of NMEs that used different dosing regimens, safety/tolerability was the leading cause of a dosing regimen changes in both monotherapy and combination therapy settings. Other factors leading to changes in dosing regimens include differences in tumor biology, disease burden, pharmacokinetics, and overall benefit-risk profiles obtained from dose-finding studies.

Implications

Our analysis highlighted the importance of selecting a safe, tolerable, and yet efficacious dosing regimen for the initial indication as a suboptimal initially approved regimen could lead to dosing regimen changes in later indications. Preclinical and clinical data could be leveraged to understand the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic differences between indications and thus support dose selection in subsequent indications.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^da12b9d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of warfarin sodium tablets varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of warfarin sodium tablets is usually 2 mg to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 mg to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance warfarin sodium tablets doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

### Beyond population-level targets for drug concentrations: precision dosing needs individual-level targets that include superior biomarkers of drug responses [^0ee848de]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

The purpose of precision dosing is to increase the chances of therapeutic success in individual patients. This is achieved in practice by adjusting doses to reach precision dosing targets determined previously in relevant populations, ideally with robust supportive evidence showing improved clinical outcomes compared with standard dosing. But is this implicit assumption of translatable population-level precision dosing targets correct and the best for all patients? In this review, the types of precision dosing targets and how they are determined are outlined, problems with the translatability of these targets to individual patients are identified, and ways forward to address these challengers are proposed. Achieving improved clinical outcomes to support precision dosing over standard dosing is currently hampered by applying population-level targets to all patients. Just as "one-dose-fits-all" may be an inappropriate philosophy for drug treatment overall, a "one-target-fits-all" philosophy may limit the broad clinical benefits of precision dosing. Defining individual-level precision dosing targets may be needed for greatest therapeutic success. Superior future precision dosing targets will integrate several biomarkers that together account for the multiple sources of drug response variability.

### The role of medication regimen complexity in diabetes management: a rapid review [^eb730a1e]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes continues to pose a significant challenge to individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Recent reports showed that its prevalence is still increasing, with the expectation to rise from 537 to 643 million between 2021 and 2030, with most cases related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, in 2021, it was responsible for 6.7 million deaths and an increased health expenditure by 316% over the last 15 years. With this increased prevalence, variation of individual tolerance to medication, and the need to improve patients' outcomes, convenience, and safety, different new antidiabetic medications have been approved in the market. However, most are used as an add-on medication. Combination or add-on therapy remains standard practice among healthcare prescribers to achieve optimal glycemic control, especially in chronic progressive cases. Early use of this approach is also recommended in selected individuals at treatment initiation to extend the time to treatment failure. – However, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), different patient-specific factors affect the choice of medication in patients with T2DM, such as individualized glycemic and weight targets, medication side effects, cardiorenal protection, patient choice, and complexity of medication regimen. Therefore, the ADA recommends that medication regimens and medication-taking behavior should be regularly evaluated (every 3–6 months) and adjusted as needed to account for factors influencing treatment choice and patient outcomes, particularly in individuals with T2DM who often require amendments and add-on medications over time. This regular evaluation helps optimize medication use while reducing treatment discontinuation and cost.

Nowadays, healthcare providers face increasing challenges in selecting appropriate medications to improve patients' health outcomes and prevent disease complications and hospitalization, challenges often linked to the complexity of diabetic medications. – Medication Regimen Complexity (MRC) refers to the number of medications in the regimen, dosing frequencies, dosage forms, and additional medication directions. Previous studies identified different factors associated with MRC. For example, elderly patients often had a higher MRC than other age groups. Similarly, the presence of comorbid conditions, for example, congestive heart failure and chronic pulmonary disease, was associated with having MRC in many patients. Consequently, the ADA has recently recommended simplifying medication regimens in high-risk populations, for example, elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, to reduce the treatment burden and prevent diabetes complications such as hypoglycemia. Some studies have explored the association between MRC and different patient characteristics,–; however, evidence regarding its impact on patient outcomes varies.

### Haloperidol lactate [^16e2bb6f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 mg to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory. The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.

Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Switchover Procedure

An oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable. In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested. For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the patient's clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to choice of agent and dosage, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to assess benefits and risks carefully and exercise care when changing the opioid dosage in patients already receiving opioid therapy. Optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy if the benefits outweigh the risks of continued opioid therapy. Optimize other therapies and gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioids if the benefits do not outweigh the risks of continued opioid therapy.

### Daily dosing of highly active antiretroviral therapy [^d4e8e7b7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Complex treatment schedules for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, which can have a high pill burden and can include multiple daily doses, in addition to the adverse effects that the medications can cause, may reduce patient adherence to therapy. Reduced adherence prevents achievement of the desired goal of full suppression of HIV replication, and it also promotes the development of drug-resistant strains of HIV. Thus, the focus of treatment has shifted toward the use of simpler regimens. A major strategy is the development of medications and regimens for management of HIV infection that can be taken once per day. The goal of such a strategy is to improve convenience and optimize adherence, which is critical to maximizing the likelihood of sustained virologic response. Several studies involving regimens with once-daily dosing, which have involved both available agents and agents in development, have yielded promising results. In comparison with standard regimens, which involve dosing 2 or 3 times daily, the regimens with once-daily dosing improved tolerability while maintaining efficacy and safety. The results are expected to increase adherence rates among patients, reduce the incidence of antiretroviral-resistant variants of HIV, and improve the clinical outcomes during a prolonged treatment course.

### Warfarin sodium (Coumadin) [^79ebb08b]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of COUMADIN varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of COUMADIN is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance COUMADIN doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

### Impact of dosing on treatment with TNF inhibitors: managing dose adjustment [^68aee67f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represented a significant advance in the treatment of this debilitating disease, and led to dramatic changes in overall treatment goals and guidelines. Despite these advances, best practice use of TNF inhibitors in the clinical setting still needs to be determined. In particular, although all TNF inhibitors have standard, recommended doses that were determined in clinical trials, dose adjustments are often necessary in clinical practice to optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. Dose escalation may be necessary in patients who experience disease flares, or because of insufficient initial efficacy or loss of efficacy over time, while dose tapering can be a response to adverse events, or if a patient achieves remission of disease. The amount of available evidence for managing dose adjustments for the currently available TNF inhibitors varies, and thus the strategies used with each are different. At present, although dose adjustments are common, data are insufficient for consensus guidelines to be recommended.

### Principles of kidney pharmacotherapy for the nephrologist: core curriculum 2021 [^37e75bf1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Medications are an important part of the management of patients with kidney disease. When used appropriately, pharmacotherapy can slow disease progression and reduce morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, reduced kidney function can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many medications, putting patients at risk for drug toxicity if modifications to therapy are not appropriately managed. Adding complexity to the appropriateness of medication and dosage selection is the difficulty in estimating kidney function and the discordance between the Cockcroft-Gault-derived dosing cut points in most medication package inserts and the estimations of glomerular filtration rate by newer and generally more accurate guideline-recommended equations. This installment of the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology provides recent updates and practical considerations for designing optimal medication regimens. Given the prevalence of abnormal kidney function and its importance in medication selection and dose adjustment, additional focus and specific recommendations are provided for anticoagulant, anti-infective, analgesic, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive agents.

### Model-informed therapeutic dose optimization strategies for antibody-drug conjugates in oncology: what can we learn from US food and drug administration-approved antibody-drug conjugates? [^a39324a3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of an antibody with the cytotoxicity of a chemical agent. They represent a rapidly evolving area of oncology drug development and hold significant promise. There are currently nine ADCs on the market, more than half of which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval more recently, since 2019. Despite their enormous promise, the therapeutic window for these ADCs remains relatively narrow, especially when compared with other oncology drugs, such as targeted therapies or checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the five dosing regimen optimization strategies that have been leveraged to broaden the therapeutic window by mitigating the safety risks while maintaining efficacy. These include body weight cap dosing; treatment duration capping; dose schedule (e.g., dosing frequency and dose fractionation); response-guided dosing recommendations; and randomized dose-finding. We then discuss how the lessons learned from these studies can inform ADC development going forward. Informed application of these dosing strategies should allow researchers to maximize the safety and efficacy for next-generation ADCs.

### Barriers and facilitators for bringing model-informed precision dosing to the patient's bedside: a systematic review [^5e80bcbf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Model‐informed precision dosing (MIPD) utilizes mathematical models to predict optimal medication doses considering specific patient characteristics such as age, weight, and comorbidities.

MIPD has emerged as an alternative approach for dosing alongside empirical methods that have historically been used to determine medication doses on drug labels. In contrast with a one‐size‐fits all approach to dosing, the use of MIPD is gaining traction given its potential to achieve enhanced therapeutic outcomes and reduced toxicity for individual patients.MIPD may be particularly advantageous in cases where physiological variations may necessitate dose adjustments and where data to support adequate dosing are limited. This is particularly true for so‐called "special populations" such as children, pregnant women or adults with renal or hepatic impairment, whose physiological characteristics may differ from healthy adults. However, MIPD may only be beneficial when a clear dose–response relationship and exposure–safety relationship is present.

MIPD encompasses a variety of approaches ranging from dosing recommendations for patient groups ("population‐level MIPD") to doses tailored to individual patients. Population‐level MIPD involves providing dose recommendations for a group of patients who share certain characteristics. These fixed, population‐level doses are generally established and/or endorsed prior to clinical use. For instance, a model‐informed dosing strategy may be determined for pregnant women, considering their altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to nonpregnant adults, requiring dose adjustments for certain medications. These group‐level recommendations can further vary based on factors like gestational age, but do not require reliance on extensive calculations, or modeling and simulations at the point of care.

Various models can be used to establish dose recommendations at the population level. These include population pharmacokinetic (popPK) and physiologically‐based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models that integrate population and/or physiological data with drug characteristics to predict drug exposures for a given dose, and pharmacokinetic‐pharmacodynamic (PK‐PD) models linking drug concentration and effect. These models have for example supported dose recommendations for several antibiotics in critically ill children, and for the antiretroviral darunavir during pregnancy. Population‐level models require validation, which may be challenging given limited data in certain patient populations.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f84a0789]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Medication adherence counseling for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) — when initiating a PrEP regimen, clinicians must educate patients so that they understand clearly how to take their medications and what to do if they experience problems. Patients should be told to take a single missed dose as soon as they remember it, unless it is almost time for the next dose; if it is almost time for the next dose, patients should skip the missed dose and continue with the regular dosing schedule. Clinicians should tell patients about the most common side effects and should work with patients to develop a specific plan for handling them, including the use of specific over-the-counter medications that can mitigate symptoms, and the importance of using condoms during sex, especially for patients who decide to stop taking their medications, should be reinforced. Key components of adherence counseling include to establish trust and bidirectional communication; provide simple explanations and education on medication dosage and schedule, management of common side effects, relationship of adherence to the efficacy of PrEP, and signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection and recommended actions; support adherence by tailoring daily dose to patient's daily routine, identifying reminders and devices to minimize forgetting doses, and identifying and addressing barriers to adherence; and monitor medication adherence in a non-judgmental manner by normalizing occasional missed doses while ensuring patient understands importance of daily dosing for optimal protection, reinforcing success, identifying factors interfering with adherence and plan with patient to address them, and assessing side effects and plan how to manage them. Using a broad array of a health care professionals that work together on a health care team to influence and reinforce adherence instructions significantly improves medication adherence and may alleviate the time constraints of individual providers, and this broad-team approach may also provide a larger number of providers to counsel patients about self-management of behavioral risks.

### Optimal dosing for targeted therapies in oncology: drug development cases leading by example [^b455c92f]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

One of the key objectives of oncology first-in-human trials has often been to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). However, targeted therapies might not exhibit dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at doses significantly higher than sufficiently active doses, and there is frequently a limited ability to objectively quantify adverse events. Thus, while MTD-based determination of recommended phase II dose may have yielded appropriate dosing for some cytotoxics, targeted therapeutics (including monoclonal antibodies and/or immunotherapies) sometimes need alternative or complementary strategies to help identify dose ranges for a randomized dose-ranging study. One complementary strategy is to define a biologically efficacious dose (BED) using an "effect marker". An effect marker could be a target engagement, pharmacodynamic, or disease progression marker (change in tumor size for solid tumors or bone marrow blast count for some hematologic tumors). Although the concept of BED has been discussed extensively, we review specific examples in which the approach influenced oncology clinical development. Data extracted from the literature and the examples support improving dose selection strategies to benefit patients, providers, and the biopharmaceutical industry. Although the examples illustrate key contributions of effect markers in dose selection, no one-size-fits-all approach to dosing can be justified. Higher-than-optimal dosing can increase toxicity in later trials (and in clinical use), which can have a negative impact on efficacy (via lower adherence or direct sequelae of toxicities). Proper dose selection in oncology should follow a multifactorial decision process leading to a randomized, dose-ranging study instead of a single phase II dose.

### Dose determinations at drug approval reviews: FDA-approved drugs in past 5 Years [^a79c5509]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Product characteristics, particularly safety‐related factors, seemed substantially affect the dose decisions at approval. Products with "E‐R in safety only", "CV warnings on label", and "Oral administration" had 4.29‐fold, 3.11‐fold, and 3.29‐fold higher odds of downward dose changes, respectively (Figure 1). The importance of understanding E–R in finding the optimal dose has long been advocated, and so has the implementation of "Dose‐Exposure‐Response at the center of drug development and regulatory approval". Our study highlighted the substantial role of E‐R analysis in FDA's decision‐making during drug approval. In a similar context, "CV warnings on label" here is one example where the unfavorable effect of a drug is life‐threatening that is often dose/exposure‐related. Our results do not preclude the possibility that other exposure‐related adverse reactions may have influenced this decision. For dosage forms historically, self‐administered oral dosage forms have received more scrutiny during drug review than other dosage forms. This analysis accounts for disease area, modality, and the presence or absence of dose‐ranging studies, but additional considerations for oral and other dosage forms may exist.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^d4dab7ae]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Pharmacokinetic studies in children: recommendations for practice and research [^b97ddfb4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Optimising the dosing of medicines for neonates and children remains a challenge. The importance of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) research is recognised both in medicines regulation and paediatric clinical pharmacology, yet there remain barriers to undertaking high-quality PK and PD studies. While these studies are essential in understanding the dose-concentration-effect relationship and should underpin dosing recommendations, this review examines how challenges affecting the design and conduct of paediatric pharmacological studies can be overcome using targeted pharmacometric strategies. Model-based approaches confer benefits at all stages of the drug life-cycle, from identifying the first dose to be used in children, to clinical trial design, and optimising the dosing regimens of older, off-patent medications. To benefit patients, strategies to ensure that new PK, PD and trial data are incorporated into evidence-based dosing recommendations are needed. This review summarises practical strategies to address current challenges, particularly the use of model-based (pharmacometric) approaches in study design and analysis. Recommendations for practice and directions for future paediatric pharmacological research are given, based on current literature and our joint international experience. Success of PK research in children requires a robust infrastructure, with sustainable funding mechanisms at its core, supported by political and regulatory initiatives, and international collaborations. There is a unique opportunity to advance paediatric medicines research at an unprecedented pace, bringing the age of evidence-based paediatric pharmacotherapy into sight.

### Precision dosing of targeted therapies is ready for prime time [^a225ca01]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Fixed dosing of oral targeted therapies is inadequate in the era of precision medicine. Personalized dosing, based on pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure, known as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is rational and supported by increasing evidence. The purpose of this perspective is to discuss whether randomized studies are needed to confirm the clinical value of precision dosing in oncology. PK-based dose adjustments are routinely made for many drugs and are recommended by health authorities, for example, for patients with renal impairment or for drug-drug interaction management strategies. Personalized dosing simply extrapolates this paradigm from selected patient populations to each individual patient with suboptimal exposure, irrespective of the underlying cause. If it has been demonstrated that exposure is related to a relevant clinical outcome, such as efficacy or toxicity, and that exposure can be optimized by PK-guided dosing, it could be logically assumed that PK-guided dosing would result in better treatment outcomes without the need for randomized confirmatory trials. We propose a path forward to demonstrate the clinical relevance of individualized dosing of molecularly-targeted anticancer drugs.

### Dose-optimization of a novel Co-formulated triple combination antimalarial therapy: artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine [^822fb048]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) is the first‐line therapy for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Artemisinin‐resistant P. falciparum was first identified in Southeast Asia, but artemisinin resistance has recently emerged in East Africa. Triple‐ACTs have emerged as a viable alternative treatment to combat declining ACT efficacy due to multi‐drug‐resistant malaria.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Artemether‐lumefantrine is the most commonly used antimalarial today and has been proposed for development into a fixed‐dose combination with amodiaquine to address potential adherence issues associated with loose‐tablet regimens. This study aimed to select and evaluate a novel fixed‐dose regimen of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine through population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

Based on simulated total exposure and peak concentrations, an optimal dose regimen was developed resulting in an extension of the current 4 weight bands to a total of 5 weight bands to generate equivalent exposures in all body weight groups and minimize the fluctuation in exposure between patients.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

Using a modeling and simulation approach, we propose a fixed‐dose formulation of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine (20:120:40 mg) to simplify manufacturing, implementation, and further development of a co‐formulated product. The proposed dosing should maximize the chance of patient cure by providing an increased artemether‐lumefantrine dose in small children and large adults while minimizing the risk of increased adverse events linked to higher doses of amodiaquine by splitting the standard once‐daily dose into twice‐daily dosing to be co‐formulated with artemether‐lumefantrine.

### Clinical evaluation of novel bisphosphonate dosing regimens in osteoporosis: the role of comparative studies and implications for future studies [^4f127faa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Daily nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have shown antifracture efficacy in many studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, current dosing schedules are often inconvenient or impractical for patients. Efforts to reduce dosing frequency to improve adherence (ie, compliance and persistence), and therefore treatment outcomes, are ongoing. Although a number of trial designs can be used to consider the efficacy of therapy, comparing the efficacy of different regimens should only be undertaken in purposefully designed head-to-head studies.

Objective

This article summarizes the design and conduct of clinical studies that have investigated alternative bisphosphonate regimens and those that have directly compared different approved bisphosphonates. It also explores the implications for future studies of postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment.

Methods

Using the terms bisphosphonate, daily, weekly, and monthly, a search (completed in 2006) of the PubMed database was conducted to identify primary English-language publications of pertinent studies comparing either novel with established regimens of the same bisphosphonates or different established bisphosphonates.

Results

The first option is the equivalence or noninferiority bridging study for comparison of new treatment regimens versus the established regimen of the same bisphosphonate, known as the active comparator. Four such studies have led to the registration of novel bisphosphonate dosing regimens designed to provide easier dosing alternatives for patients. The second option is the active comparator study, which compares one bisphosphonate with the most prescribed weekly bisphosphonate. Weekly dosed oral alendronate has previously been shown to be superior (for bone mineral density gains) to daily and weekly dosed oral risedronate. An ongoing noninferiority study, Monthly Oral Therapy with Ibandronate for Osteoporosis Intervention, is comparing weekly alendronate with ibandronate, a monthly oral bisphosphonate.

Conclusions

The exploration of new dosing schedules and formulations aims to identify the optimal bisphosphonate regimen for postmenopausal osteoporosis. To achieve this, careful consideration must be given to the choice of a scientifically valid study design that effectively, and ethically, meets the study objectives. Given the concerns regarding placebo-controlled antifracture studies, 2 alternative study designs should be considered, both using validated surrogate end points (bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover) as the principal mode of assessment.

### Methods for measuring, enhancing, and accounting for medication adherence in clinical trials [^26afba95]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Adherence to rationally prescribed medications is essential for effective pharmacotherapy. However, widely variable adherence to protocol-specified dosing regimens is prevalent among participants in ambulatory drug trials, mostly manifested in the form of underdosing. Drug actions are inherently dose and time dependent, and as a result, variable underdosing diminishes the actions of trial medications by various degrees. The ensuing combination of increased variability and decreased magnitude of trial drug actions reduces statistical power to discern between-group differences in drug actions. Variable underdosing has many adverse consequences, some of which can be mitigated by the combination of reliable measurements of ambulatory patients' adherence to trial and nontrial medications, measurement-guided management of adherence, statistically and pharmacometrically sound analyses, and modifications in trial design. Although nonadherence is prevalent across all therapeutic areas in which the patients are responsible for treatment administration, the significance of the adverse consequences depends on the characteristics of both the disease and the medications.

### Rational use of medicines in older adults: can we do better during clinical development? [^dc0e1ce0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

There is an evidence gap to ensuring safe/effective use of medicines in older adults. Generating clinical data in these patients poses ethical and operational challenges, yielding results that may not be generalizable to the overall population. Modeling and simulation (M&S) is proposed as a basis for assessing the impact of age-related changes and their clinical implications. M&S can be used in conjunction with bridging and extrapolation to ensure the selection of appropriate dose(s)/regimen(s) in this population.

Stimulant titration and monitoring in pediatric ADHD emphasize individualized dosing and timely follow-up: "it is recommended to titrate from a low dose to one that achieves a maximum, optimal effect in controlling symptoms without adverse effects". "Calculating the dose on the basis of milligrams per kilogram has not usually been helpful because variations in dose have not been found to be related to height or weight". "Stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 7-day basis, but in urgent situations, they may be effectively titrated in as few as 3 days". "The PCC should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication may be necessary for optimal medication management, may require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be monitored at regular intervals".

### Model-informed therapeutic dose optimization strategies for antibody-drug conjugates in oncology: what can we learn from US food and drug administration-approved antibody-drug conjugates? [^501e6b7f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the specificity of an antibody with the cytotoxicity of a chemical agent. They represent a rapidly evolving area of oncology drug development and hold significant promise. There are currently nine ADCs on the market, more than half of which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval more recently, since 2019. Despite their enormous promise, the therapeutic window for these ADCs remains relatively narrow, especially when compared with other oncology drugs, such as targeted therapies or checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the five dosing regimen optimization strategies that have been leveraged to broaden the therapeutic window by mitigating the safety risks while maintaining efficacy. These include body weight cap dosing; treatment duration capping; dose schedule (e.g. dosing frequency and dose fractionation); response‐guided dosing recommendations; and randomized dose‐finding. We then discuss how the lessons learned from these studies can inform ADC development going forward. Informed application of these dosing strategies should allow researchers to maximize the safety and efficacy for next‐generation ADCs.

### Methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis: optimizing therapy among different formulations. current and emerging paradigms [^8d0278ab]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is currently considered the drug of choice, among the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its favorable risk/benefit ratio, good safety profile, and low costs. Despite MTX's widespread use and large experience accumulated over the many years since its introduction into clinical practice, specific guidelines have not been published.

Objective

We report here the available research regarding the optimal dosage and route of MTX administration.

Methods

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published between 1990 and 2013, using terms related to RA and MTX. The search was conducted by using both MeSH terms and free text. The references of the retrieved studies were also screened manually for additional articles.

Results

For the treatment of rheumatic diseases, the antimetabolite drug MTX can be administered weekly by different routes: oral, subcutaneous, or intramuscular. One of the goals of treatment is to minimize acute and chronic toxicity. A starting dose of 15 mg/week orally, escalating to 25 to 30 mg/week or the highest tolerable dose (with a subsequent switch to parenteral administration in cases of insufficient response), seems to be the optimal evidence-based strategy for MTX treatment of RA. Oral MTX is widely preferred because of its low costs and patient preferences; the bioavailability of parenteral MTX is higher, however. This is supported by data from observational studies, in which patients switching from parenteral to oral MTX at an equal dose had disease exacerbations. In several trials, the subcutaneous formulation of MTX was considered, by both physicians and patients, to be more advantageous in terms of discomfort and compliance. In addition, a significant proportion of patients reported that this formulation led to greater independence, with a resulting improvement in quality of life.

Conclusions

Although MTX treatment can be initiated by using the oral administration route, parenteral administration of MTX is indicated in those patients with poor compliance toward the oral form. The subcutaneous route seems to be more effective than the oral route for MTX administration based on the results of several studies, and this route may be preferred because of better usability and absence of pain at the infusion site.

### Personalized minimal effective concentration therapy [^365829f7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

It has been recognized for literally centuries that patients should be given only the amount of medication necessary to treat disease(s) or relieve symptoms. It is also well known that this amount can vary greatly between patients or even over time in the same patient. The ability to identify this amount, that is, to "personalize" dosing, requires a reliable measure of a patient's response to treatment. The development of analytical methods for the accurate measurement of pharmacologically meaningful drug concentrations in physiologic fluids, combined with mathematical methods for reliable prediction of how dosing changes affect these concentrations, has led to the development of therapeutic drug management (TDM) for more effective individualization of dosing. Using TDM, clinicians modify dosing to achieve concentrations or exposures (ie, AUC) found to be effective in patients with similar clinical attributes and conditions. These concentrations, called therapeutic (or target) concentrations or exposure ranges (TRs), are specific to both disease/condition and patient population. TDM is routinely used by many clinicians to adjust dosing of a wide range of medications for maximal efficacy and limited toxicity, thereby improving clinical outcomes. Failure to properly perform TDM or to appreciate the limitations of TDM have, however, contributed to the delayed acceptance of TDM by clinicians. This Commentary briefly discusses the limitations and the benefits of TR-guided TDM, and then discusses immunosuppressant drugs and anticancer medications as examples of drugs that require clinicians to change their prescribing practices from giving all patients the same or maximal tolerated doses, to instead adjusting individual doses to achieve minimal effective concentrations identified using circulating tumor- or graft-derived DNA or copy number instability rather than published TRs.

### Improving dose-optimization processes used in oncology drug development to minimize toxicity and maximize benefit to patients [^caea7498]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review highlights strategies to integrate dose optimization into premarketing drug development and discusses the underlying statistical principles. Poor dose optimization can have negative consequences for patients, most commonly because of toxicity, including poor quality of life, reduced effectiveness because of inability of patients to stay on current therapy or receive subsequent therapy because of toxicities, and difficulty in developing combination regimens. We reviewed US Food and Drug Administration initial approvals (2019–2021) of small molecules and antibody-drug conjugates for oncologic indications to determine the proportion with a recommended dosage at the maximum tolerated dose or the maximal administered dose, to characterize the use of randomized evaluations of multiple dosages in dose selection, to describe the frequency of dose modifications at the recommended dosage, and to identify case examples that highlight key principles for premarket dose optimization during drug development. Herein, we highlight major principles for dose optimization and review examples of recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals that illustrate how investigation of dose- and exposure-response relationships and use of randomized dose trials can support dose optimization. Although there has been some progress, dose optimization through randomized dose evaluation in oncology trials is not routinely conducted. Dose optimization is essential to ensure that patients receive therapies which maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity.

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^0425bb41]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration Section

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of potent opioids for the management of chronic pain.

Do not use tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets concomitantly with other tramadol products [see WARNINGS].

Do not administer tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS].

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS]

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly [see WARNINGS].

Instruct patients to swallow tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients], and to take it with liquid. Crushing, chewing, splitting, or dissolving tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can lead to overdose or death [see WARNINGS].

### Haloperidol lactate (haloperidol) [^463fd938]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less Haloperidol Injection, USP. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.

Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory. The maximum dose is 20 mg per day.

Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Switchover Procedure

An oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable. In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested. For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the patient's clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride [^a39f24e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxymorphone hydrochloride should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Oxymorphone hydrochloride for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxymorphone hydrochloride. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxymorphone hydrochloride and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Oxymorphone hydrochloride should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that oxymorphone is available as both immediate-release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets and extended-release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

### Pediatric dose selection [^d862adea]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Selection of a drug dose in pediatrics is generally based on no or incomplete pharmacokinetic data. Traditionally, allometric, or scaling, techniques have been used; however, they have inherent limitations and may not make optimal use of the drug-specific clinical pharmacokinetic information that is available. Modeling is a tool that holds promise. The future challenge is to create a structured approach to determining pediatric doses for new therapeutic agents.

### A rational approach for selection of optimal covariate-based dosing strategies [^ff10e1ca]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

At present, there is no rational approach for choosing a dosing strategy for individualization based on a covariate. An approach to use in establishment of an a priori dosing strategy for individualization is presented. Factors influencing the choice of such a dosing strategy are identified.

Methods

The approach requires definition of the following: target variable, seriousness of deviations from the target (ie, risk function), population model, covariate distributions, and constraints. Minimizing the total risk yields an optimal dosing strategy, estimated as dose sizes for different subpopulations and covariate cutoff values at which doses are increased or decreased. The method was illustrated with the use of simulated and real drug examples for the situation in which clearance is related to creatinine clearance.

Results

The estimated optimal cutoff(s) paralleled the median creatinine clearance in the population. The extent of variability in clearance explained by creatinine clearance was the main factor influencing the optimal ratios between adjacent dose sizes. An optimal dosing strategy was possible to estimate for the real drug.

Conclusions

The method is simple to perform, although one difficulty lies in defining the target variable and risk function. Our results imply that commonly used constraints in dosing strategies based on renal function (ie, dose ratio of 2 and predetermined cutoffs) are nonoptimal in the sense we propose. Because an optimal dosing strategy may not be practical to use, the therapeutic cost that would result with any constraint can be assessed by comparison of the outcome after the desired and the optimal strategy.

### Prescribing habits and caregiver satisfaction with resources for dosing children: rationale for more informative dosing guidance [^a77d46d8]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Children represent a dynamic target for prescribing pharmacotherapy as age, size, organ function and developmental state are factors that contribute to the variation in drug response that limit the simplistic scale-down from the adult "one size fits all" dosing approach. While this concept is reasonably well appreciated by pediatric caregivers, the extent to which this appreciation translates into rationale dosing guidance in children is unknown. Likewise, while prescribing to pediatric in-patients is decidedly focused on the individual patient with respect to dosing, this desire is often in conflict with data generated by the drug sponsor where the resultant prescribing information emphasizes the average or typical patient, providing guidance to aggregate "special" populations. The introduction of new agents on formulary may provide an improvement in clinical options but often further complicates prescribing practice. In addition, prescribing patterns change constantly and are not entirely generalizable across institutions. Many studies support the correlation between deficient drug prescribing and poor adherence to evidence based treatment guidelines, inadequate individual dosage adjustments and adverse drug events.

### Dosing and therapy utilization: a discussion of updates on PI treatment guidelines [^dddc8572]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment decisions made in clinical practice, based on current guidelines, often conflict with decisions by third-party payors that restrict the ability of patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PI) to adhere to appropriate treatment. This is seen by many physicians as potentially placing the health of patients at risk. Key treatment decisions challenged by third-party payors and discussed here include dosing, product safety, and routes of administration. Data on safety issues emphasize that IgG products are not generic drugs and each of the products currently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must be regarded as an individual therapy, given the products' different manufacturing processes and stabilizing ingredients. The issue of switching patients to a different product needs careful consideration as evidence shows that infusion-related adverse events in many patients are frequently related to this activity. Decisions regarding the route of therapy should also be individualized to the patient, weighing such factors as side effects, adherence with therapy, and lifestyle.

### How to design a study to evaluate therapeutic drug monitoring in infectious diseases? [^18861e38]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool to personalize and optimize dosing by measuring the drug concentration and subsequently adjusting the dose to reach a target concentration or exposure. The evidence to support TDM is however often ranked as expert opinion. Limitations in study design and sample size have hampered definitive conclusions of the potential added value of TDM.

Objectives

We aim to give expert opinion and discuss the main points and limitations of available data from antibiotic TDM trials and emphasize key elements for consideration in design of future clinical studies to quantify the benefits of TDM.

Sources

The sources were peer-reviewed publications, guidelines and expert opinions from the field of TDM.

Content

This review focuses on key aspects of antimicrobial TDM study design: describing the rationale for a TDM study, assessing the exposure of a drug, assessing susceptibility of pathogens and selecting appropriate clinical endpoints. Moreover we provide guidance on appropriate study design.

Implications

This is an overview of different aspects relevant for the conduct of a TDM study. We believe that this paper will help researchers and clinicians to design and conduct high-quality TDM studies.

### Dabigatran etexilate [^bce94eaa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage Information

Dabigatran etexilate is available in different dosage forms and not all dosage forms are approved for the same indications and age groups. In addition, there are differences between the dosage forms with respect to dosing due to differences in bioavailability. Do not substitute different dosage forms on a milligram-to-milligram basis and do not combine more than one dosage form to achieve the total dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules Dosage for Adults

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 mL/min, the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min), the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 75 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided.

Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients

For patients with CrCl > 30 mL/min, the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily, after 5 to 10 days of parenteral anticoagulation. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients

For patients with CrCl > 30 mL/min, the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily after previous treatment. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^1a361c35]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — research gaps and future directions for opioid use in adults with cancer pain are presented as prioritized questions, covering comparative effectiveness, dosing strategies, and special populations, and the page provides resource links. Priorities include clinically meaningful differences between opioids in patients with cancer; differences between scheduling an immediate-release opioid with as-needed dosing versus extended-release administration with as-needed immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain; the preferred opioid for breakthrough pain; and the optimal increase or decrease when modifying opioid dose in response to changes in pain. Additional questions address the clinical impact of renal and hepatic dysfunction on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of each opioid; conversion factors for different opioids and routes and whether these vary based upon dose (low dose v high dose); optimal strategy for opioid switching; strategies for preventing and managing opioid-induced adverse effects; the real-world role of genetic testing in guiding opioid dosing; and the safest and most effective strategies for treating cancer pain in patients with opioid use disorders or nonmedical opioid use.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^a2abae4c]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) guideline — drug dosing and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement states that in people with extremes of body weight, "eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) may be indicated, especially for medications with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentration to be effective", and to "Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the filtration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state".

### What's new in therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials? [^7f265514]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Is steady state a prerequisite for TDM to offer meaningful information?

An often overlooked issue with TDM is the first 1–2 days of therapy. Most TDM protocols recommend sampling at steady-state level which is anticipated after 4 doses or at 24–48 h after initiation of therapy. Even though this is meaningful for the correction of steady-state levels, it imposes a risk of not achieving antibiotic target concentrations during the "golden" first 24–48 h of therapy. A loading dose or an extra dose within the first dosing interval is often recommended to more rapidly achieve target and steady-state levels. However, this is still empirical dosing and a protocol for earlier TDM, also in this early phase, could probably increase target attainment, but this will need further exploration Fig. 1.

### A drug mix and dose decision algorithm for individualized type 2 diabetes management [^7c1beb04]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment recommendation task

Given input of a patient's visit medical profile, the task is to recommend the drug mix and daily dose regimen that optimizes glycemic control (defined as achieving a post-visit HbA 1c at or under the patient's individualized HbA 1c target), subject to clinical knowledge-based guidelines. We set individualized HbA 1c targets based on age, diabetes duration, and medical history. In general, patients had a glycemic target of 7.0%. However, for patients aged < 50 years with diabetes duration of < 10 years and no prior history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, we adopted a tighter target of 6.5%. For patients aged 75–79 years, we set the target at 7.5%. For patients aged ≥ 80 years, we relaxed the target to 8.0%.

Treatment options

We defined the drug mix options as all possible subsets of 24 generic name antidiabetic medications: comprising all OADs, injectables or combination drugs available in the SDR, except those with very low outpatient utilization rates (Supplementary Table 2). For non-insulin medications, we defined cumulative daily dosage options using local formulary configurations. For insulins, since exact dose titration often relies on factors beyond the EMR, including self-monitored capillary blood glucose readings, we limited dosage options to "maintain" or "increase" relative to the previous prescription.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^b8e18eb3]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — dosage regimens describe three approaches: Front loading uses moderate to high doses of a long-acting medication given frequently at the start of treatment to achieve rapid control and can be followed by a symptom-triggered or fixed-dose regimen; fixed dosing administers a predetermined dose at fixed intervals with doses usually decreasing in a gradual taper over several days and additional medication provided if symptoms are not adequately controlled; and symptom-triggered dosing gives medication only when symptoms cross a threshold, for example 15 mg oxazepam for CIWA-Ar scores 8–15 and 30 mg oxazepam for CIWA-Ar > 15. Symptom-triggered dosing, if used alone, requires highly reliable and dedicated staff to avoid undertreatment of withdrawal and should be used only when there are adequate qualified staff to perform assessments.

### Dose optimization in oncology drug development: risk factors for postmarketing requirements and commitments [^a7159295]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges and practical recommendations

The guidance issued by Project Optimus generally encourages the randomized evaluation of the benefit/risk profile across a range of doses before initiating a registration trial.

However, implementing a randomized comparison of at least two doses increases the initial cost of drug development, as it requires a significantly larger study due to the expanded sample size. Additionally, this approach may extend the development timeline, leading to delays in delivering the drug to patients in need. Our results showed that multiple dose evaluations and randomized dose‐ranging trials alone did not consistently reduce the risk of PMR/PMC on dose optimization.

The randomized, parallel dose–response trial recommended by Project Optimus is merely a means to an end; what truly matters is the design to effectively justify the optimal dose. The trial design, including sample size, number of ranging doses, and selected dose levels, is more critical than simply conducting a randomized trial.

### Precision dosing: an industry perspective [^9d5d0e07]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The relationship of individual and population therapeutic windows for drugs with (a) a wide population‐level therapeutic window, (b) no population‐level therapeutic window, and (c) a narrow population‐level therapeutic window. In each panel the therapeutic windows for 10 representative patients on the x‐axis are illustrated with minimum effective dose (green bar), maximum tolerated dose (red bar), the population therapeutic window (gray box), and a population dose (blue line). There is no population dose or therapeutic window in b. In c even the narrow dose window considered acceptable for the whole population is below the minimum effective dose or above the maximum tolerated dose for some patients.

Precision dosing adds some complexity and costs to clinical use with a requirement for additional tests, the need to interpret the tests, and additional clinic visits for monitoring and dose adjustment. For drug developers this raises concerns about commercial attractiveness, despite the increased benefit to patients and the growing number of examples where precision dosing has been shown to be cost‐effective despite the additional costs. 1 Perhaps an even more important reason why most drugs are not developed to support precision dosing is that there is no requirement to do so. If an acceptable level of efficacy and safety can be shown with a single population‐level dose, then health authorities will grant approval, so why do anything more? Precision dosing is only considered in situations where it is impossible to identify a single dose level that is adequately safe and effective in all patients. Even then, many drug developers would decide instead to stop development of that molecule and develop one with different properties that make it more likely there will be a single population dose level with adequate safety and efficacy. Only if the need for precision dosing is intrinsic to the drug class, and the benefits of that class are thought large enough, will continued development using precision dosing be considered.

### Clinical pharmacokinetics in kidney disease: application to rational design of dosing regimens [^dc451735]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A change in pharmacokinetics can alter drug exposure and predispose the patient to either over- or underdosing, potentially resulting in adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure. Kidney disease is characterized by multiple physiologic effects, which induce clinically significant changes in pharmacokinetics. These vary between individuals and may be quantitated in certain instances. An understanding of pharmacokinetic concepts is, therefore, important for a rational approach to the design of drug dosing regimens for the delivery of personalized medical care. Whether kidney disease is acute or chronic, drug clearance decreases and the volume of distribution may remain unchanged or increase. AKI is defined by dynamic changes in kidney function, which complicates attempts to accurately quantify drug clearance. In contrast, changes in drug clearance progress more slowly with CKD. In general, kidney replacement therapies increase drug clearance, but the extent to which this occurs depends on the modality used and its duration, the drug's properties, and the timing of drug administration. However, the changes in drug handling associated with kidney disease are not isolated to reduced kidney clearance and an appreciation of the scale of potential derangements is important. In most instances, the first dose administered in patients with kidney disease is the same as in patients with normal kidney function. However, in some cases, a higher (loading) initial dose is given to rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations, followed by a lower maintenance dose, as is well described when prescribing anti-infectives to patients with sepsis and AKI. This review provides an overview of how pharmacokinetic principles can be applied to patients with kidney disease to personalize dosage regimens. Patients with kidney disease are a vulnerable population and the increasing prevalence of kidney disease means that these considerations are important for all prescribers.

### Model-informed therapeutic dose optimization strategies for antibody-drug conjugates in oncology: what can we learn from US food and drug administration-approved antibody-drug conjugates? [^b0c7e4b0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ADCs represent a rapidly evolving area of oncology drug development and hold significant promise. The strategy of conjugating a potent, nonspecific payload to an antibody dramatically improves the therapeutic window of drugs whose cytotoxicity would otherwise be untenable, allowing them to be used therapeutically. The FDA has already approved nine ADCs across the solid and hematological tumor indications. Several additional ADCs show promising clinical activity and expect FDA approval in the next one to two years. Following the great success of these ADCs, numerous innovative approaches (e.g. site‐specific conjugation or novel payloads) have been implemented to further improve the therapeutic window, resulting in the "next‐generation" ADCs. However, it is worth noting that the therapeutic window for these next‐generation ADCs remains relatively narrow, especially when compared with other oncology drugs such as targeted therapies or checkpoint inhibitors. Maximum tolerated dose is often reached before ADCs achieve maximum efficacious dose, which poses a challenge to ADC dose optimization.

In this review, we have summarized multiple dosing strategies used for the FDA‐approved ADCs that broaden the therapeutic window by mitigating the safety risks while maintaining efficacy. BW‐based dose capping is an effective way to prevent the overdosing of heavier patients and to minimize the occurrence of AEs in these patients. Capping of treatment duration can effectively mitigate certain chronic AEs like PN that occur upon repeat dosing. Optimizing the dose schedule to a smaller and more frequent dose is a viable approach to reduce AE risks driven mainly by an ADC's C max while maintaining efficacy. Response‐guided dosing is an alternative approach for personalizing the ADC dose based on patients' response, although this approach usually requires fast onset (e.g. 21 days for inotuzumab ozogamicin) of response to enable this adaptive and individualized dosing approach. Finally, randomized dose‐finding studies, especially for ADCs that demonstrate both efficacy and safety concerns across multiple doses, become increasingly important to identify an appropriate dose and schedule for late development and may increase the overall efficiency of clinical development. Many of these approaches employ the quantitative integration of clinical PK, PD, efficacy, and safety. A comprehensive evaluation of risk–benefit balance is needed to maximize the therapeutic window of each ADC to determine an optimal dosing regimen. Innovative dosing strategies learning continues especially for next‐generation ADCs.

### Dose optimization during drug development: whether and when to optimize [^15065ee7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Medium credibility.

The goal of dose optimization during drug development is to identify a dose that preserves clinical benefit with optimal tolerability. Traditionally, the maximum tolerated dose in a small phase I dose escalation study is used in the phase II trial assessing clinical activity of the agent. Although it is possible that this dose level could be altered in the phase II trial if an unexpected level of toxicity is seen, no formal dose optimization has routinely been incorporated into later stages of drug development. Recently it has been suggested that formal dose optimization (involving randomly assigning patients between 2 or more dose levels) be routinely performed early in drug development, even before it is known that the experimental therapy has any clinical activity at any dose level. We consider the relative merits of performing dose optimization earlier vs later in the drug development process and demonstrate that a considerable number of patients may be exposed to ineffective therapies unless dose optimization is delayed until after clinical activity or benefit of the new agent has been established. We conclude that patient and public health interests may be better served by conducting dose optimization after (or during) phase III evaluation, with some exceptions when dose optimization should be performed after activity shown in phase II evaluation.

### Fixed-versus variable-dose prothrombin complex concentrate for the emergent reversal of vitamin K antagonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be39320c]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4-PCC) is recommended for rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin, yet optimal dosing remains uncertain.

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted of PubMed, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE (Wolters Kluwer) databases from January 2000 to August 2023 for clinical studies comparing fixed- vs. variable-dose 4-PCC for emergent VKA reversal with at least one reported clinical outcome.

Study Selection

Abstracts and full texts were assessed independently and in duplicate by two reviewers.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently and in duplicate by two reviewers using predefined extraction forms.

Data Synthesis

The analysis comprised three randomized trials and 16 cohort studies comprising a total of 323 participants in randomized trials (161 in fixed dosage and 162 in variable dosage) and 1912 patients in cohort studies (858 in fixed-dose and 1054 in variable dose). Extracranial bleeding was the predominant indication, while intracranial hemorrhage varied. Overall, a fixed-dose regimen may be associated with a lower dose of 4-PCC and results in a reduction in 4-PCC administration time compared with a variable-dose regimen. A fixed-dose regimen also likely results in increased clinical hemostasis. While there is no clear difference between the two regimens in terms of achieving a goal international normalized ratio (INR) less than 2, a fixed-dose regimen is less likely to achieve a goal INR less than 1.5. High certainty evidence indicates that the fixed-dose regimen reduces both mortality and the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Additional subgroup analyses provides exploratory data to guide future studies.

Conclusions

A fixed-dose regimen for 4-PCC administration provides benefits over a variable-dose regimen in terms of dose reduction, faster administration time, improved clinical hemostasis, and reduced mortality and thromboembolic events. Further studies are warranted to better refine the optimal fixed-dose regimen.

### Antibiotic dosing for multidrug-resistant pathogen pneumonia [^3b1d3826]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens is increasing in the ICU, and these infections are negatively associated with patient outcomes. Optimization of antibiotic dosing has been suggested as a key intervention to improve clinical outcomes in patients with nosocomial pneumonia. This review describes the recent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data relevant to antibiotic dosing for nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Recent Findings

Optimal antibiotic treatment is challenging in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia; most dosing guidelines do not consider the altered physiology and illness severity associated with severe lung infections. Antibiotic dosing can be guided by plasma drug concentrations, which do not reflect the concentrations at the site of infection. The application of aggressive dosing regimens, in accordance to the antibiotic's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, may be required to ensure rapid and effective drug exposure in infected lung tissues.

Summary

Conventional antibiotic dosing increases the likelihood of therapeutic failure in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Alternative dosing strategies, which exploit the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of an antibiotic, should be strongly considered to ensure optimal antibiotic exposure and better therapeutic outcomes in these patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) medication dosing — body size and steady-state considerations: Practice Point 4.2.4 states that "in people with extremes of body weight, eGFR indexed for body surface area (BSA) may be indicated, especially for medications with a narrow therapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentration to be effective", and Practice Point 4.2.5 says "Consider and adapt drug dosing in people where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the filtration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state". The KDOQI Work Group adds that "GFR adjusted for an individual's body surface area (BSA) in mL/min (eGFRBSA adj) should generally be utilized for pharmacologic dosing considerations where variations in body habits exist", noting that "Adjusting eGFR for an individual's BSA may be particularly important in the United States given that the standardized eGFR by the patients BSA/1.73 m2" and that "It will also allow for comparison in mL/min between eGFR and creatinine clearance, which is the current method that most pharmacists use to determine drug dose adjustments".

### Naproxen [^9ba49797]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen tablets, naproxen delayed-release tablets and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.

2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing
Spondylitis

The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets, are shown in Table 1.

T a ble 1: Recommended dosages for Naproxen t a blets

During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.

The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response.

In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1,500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen

1,500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.

2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children.

In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms.

### Development of therapeutic proteins for a new subcutaneous route of administration after the establishment of intravenous dosages: a systematic review [^7fa91813]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic proteins may first be developed as intravenous (i.v.) therapies with new subcutaneous (s.c.) dosage forms being subsequently developed to provide an alternative route of administration. As of August 2022, there have been 9 therapeutic proteins which were developed as a new s.c. dosage form after the approval of the corresponding i.v. product. This article provides a systematic review of prior experiences in the i.v. to s.c. switch development programs. We describe what types of clinical studies were conducted to support the i.v. to s.c. switch for these nine therapeutic proteins. Publicly available scientific advice from health authorities is summarized, particularly regarding recommendations on overall development strategy, dose selection, immunogenicity assessment, and indication extrapolation. The clinical data from these i.v. to s.c. development programs demonstrate that: (1) when switching from i.v. dosing to s.c. dosing, trough drug concentration (C trough) from s.c. dosing should not be inferior to i.v. dosing with average drug concentration (C avg; equivalent to AUC, area under the curve after correcting for dosing intervals between i.v. and s.c. administration) being matched or non-inferior to i.v. dosing; and (2) with appropriate s.c. dose regimens, treatment with s.c. therapeutic proteins can generally achieve similar efficacy and safety as the corresponding i.v. products, suggesting that the much higher maximum concentration (C max) after i.v. infusion as compared with that from s.c. injection is often not relevant to the treatment effect.

### Tuberculosis chemotherapy: current drug delivery approaches [^d48e38d7]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

The rationale for the development of a novel fixed dose combination anti-TB drug delivery system

Drug delivery, which takes into consideration the carrier, the route and the target, has evolved into a strategy of processes or devices designed to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic agents through modified or controlled release. This may involve enhanced bioavailability, improved therapeutic index, or improved patient acceptance or compliance. Drug delivery has been defined by Flynn as 'the use of whatever means possible, be it chemical, physicochemical or mechanical, to regulate a drug's access rate to the body's central compartment, or in some cases, directly to the involved tissues'. The underlying principle that drug delivery technology can bring both therapeutic and commercial value to health care products has been widely accepted. This has created an intense need for presenting 'old' drugs, such as those encompassed in the anti-TB regimen, in new forms utilising novel modes of delivery and dosage forms.

Patient failure to take the prescribed medications at the required intervals results in significant morbidity and mortality. The need for research into an oral anti-TB drug delivery system is thus warranted as the efficacy of the current regimen may be improved if the delivery rate, biodegradation, and site-specific targeting can be predicted, monitored, and controlled. From a financial and a global health care perspective, finding new ways to administer the anti-TB drugs in oral form and delivering the multiple-dose, long-term therapy in inexpensive, potent, forms with improved bioavailability is needed. The provision of an administration method, embodied by a dosage form that addresses FDC bioavailability concerns, that will allow patients to safely treat themselves and enhance their compliance with the anti-TB regimen is a significant health care development, particularly in developing countries where access to doctors, clean syringes, sterile needles, and sophisticated treatments are few and far between.

### Dabigatran etexilate (DABIgATRAN) [^64bc46b1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage Information

Dabigatran etexilate is available in different dosage forms and not all dosage forms are approved for the same indications and age groups. In addition, there are differences between the dosage forms with respect to dosing due to differences in bioavailability. Do not substitute different dosage forms on a milligram-to-milligram basis and do not combine more than one dosage form to achieve the total dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dabigatran etexilate Capsules Dosage for Adults

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 30 mL/min, the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily. For patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min), the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 75 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided.

 Treatment of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients

For patients with CrCl > 30 mL/min, the recommended dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily, after 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients

For patients with CrCl > 30 mL/min, the recommended dose of dabigatran etexilate capsules are 150 mg taken orally, twice daily after previous treatment. Dosing recommendations for patients with a CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis cannot be provided [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Pharmacokinetic studies in children: recommendations for practice and research [^83f7d499]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although undertaking high-quality paediatric PK studies is challenging, the tools and expertise needed are now available and affordable. Model-based approaches address many obstacles in PK study design and delivery. Thus, there is a unique opportunity to drive paediatric medicines research forward, providing adequate research infrastructure is developed and sustained. Political and practical support from regulators and physicians is paramount to the future success of these initiatives. As paediatric PK data continue to improve, we must create mechanisms for incorporating regular, rigorous reviews of the latest data into routine formulary updates, to ensure evidence-based dosing can be implemented to support rational paediatric pharmacotherapy. The importance of parallel paediatric PD research must not be forgotten, which we discuss in a related review. However, with the current energy and momentum in this field, it will be feasible to dramatically improve the evidence supporting optimal dosing of medicines for children in the near future, with great benefits for our patients.

### Manipulation of drugs to achieve the required dose is intrinsic to paediatric practice but is not supported by guidelines or evidence [^8dac65ce]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A lack of commercially-available, age-appropriate formulations makes it difficult to administer medication to children accurately. Many medicines given to children use dosage forms designed for adults. The magnitude of doses required throughout childhood can vary up to 100-fold. A proportion of the dose in the available marketed dosage form may be required. Medicines are thus manipulated by the physical alteration of a dosage form with the aim of achieving the required (usually smaller) dose for administration. Examples include splitting a tablet and administering a proportion or the further dilution of an injection when the available concentrations do not permit the paediatric dose to be measured accurately without dilution. Although commonly acknowledged among professionals as a widespread practice, reports about manipulations with the aim of achieving the required dose are limited. Manipulations may be time-consuming, can be inaccurate, and have unknown effects on the stability and bioavailability of the drug. This risks the administration of toxic or sub-therapeutic doses. Drug manipulations may also increase the risk of errors. Dose calculation errors are the most common medication error in neonatal and paediatric practice. Tablet manipulations have been encouraged (for adults) in some countries because of economic considerations. There may be little cost difference between different tablet strengths of the same drug. Therefore it may be significantly cheaper to split tablets than buy the tablet with the optimal dose. A systematic review completed in this area identified only one study (involving suppositories) that was not related to splitting tablets. Studies in the systematic review included drugs which are used in paediatric practice, though there were only two papers that included paediatric participants. Further research and practice guidance is needed.

A key barrier to good practice and research is the lack of understanding about the scope of manipulations in paediatric practice. There are few reports about the settings in which manipulations occur or the types of manipulations that are performed. Accordingly the aim of this study was to scope which dosage forms and drugs are routinely manipulated in paediatric practice. This study also investigated reasons for undertaking manipulations and concerns raised by those undertaking manipulations.

### Dose escalation methods in phase I cancer clinical trials [^9335bd1e]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians may find it more informative to know appropriate settings in which a specific dose escalation method would be more efficient than the traditional 3+3 design while offering a similar degree of safety than to be given generalized recommendations on the application of phase I dose escalation methods. Preclinical data, including toxicology and pharmacology data, existing knowledge about the inhibition of the putative pathway and the resulting on-target and off-target effects, and available information about the drug or similar classes of drugs, should help formulate the trial design decision and may also provide valuable guidance on how best to proceed with a first-in-human phase I cancer clinical trial. If the preclinical data indicate a wide therapeutic window and little expected toxicity in human subjects, it is very reasonable to apply an aggressive dose titration (eg, by using an accelerated titration design or Bayesian-based methods), at least at the beginning of the phase I trial. However, if the preclinical data were less certain about how human subjects will tolerate the drug or predict a very narrow therapeutic window, then it would be prudent to choose a more conservative dose escalation scheme. For trials of drug combinations, the most challenging issue is likely to be the choice of the dose escalation scheme. The traditional 3+3 design is presumably a reasonable design if an expected optimal dose combination is specified before starting the trial. On the contrary, if the optimal dose combination is not prespecified, Bayesian model–based methods may help to determine the safest and most effective drug combination. Finally, specific dose escalation methods that incorporate time-to-event endpoints, such as the TITE-CRM, should be considered for drugs that are expected to produce delayed or cumulative toxicities.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^7b9ddf7f]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — medication titration and monitoring in primary care states Action statement 6: Primary care clinicians should titrate doses of medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Because stimulants might produce positive but suboptimal effects at a low dose in some children and youth, titration to maximum doses that control symptoms without adverse effects is recommended instead of titration strictly on a milligram-per-kilogram basis. The findings from the MTA study suggested that more than 70% of children and youth with ADHD respond to one of the stimulant medications at an optimal dose when a systematic trial is used, and stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 3- to 7-day basis. Children in the MTA who were treated in the community with care as usual received lower doses of stimulants with less frequent monitoring and had less optimal results. Education of parents is an important component to ensure cooperation in titration, and the primary care clinician should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication type might be necessary, that the process might require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be systematically monitored at regular intervals.

Regarding specific circumstances for obsessive-compulsive disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend to ensure that the daily dosage takes account of the age and weight of the patient, starting at a low dose and recognizing that more rapid metabolism may lead to the need for adult doses.

### Dose optimization in oncology drug development: risk factors for postmarketing requirements and commitments [^17123180]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating E‐R analyses during dose selection in early clinical trials. These results offer practical guidance for dose optimization strategies.

Optimal dosing of oncology drugs is historically determined based on the occurrence of toxicity under the assumption that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the optimal dose. This approach stems from the "higher is better" paradigm, which was developed decades ago for cytotoxic agents. In fact, the effective concentration curve of most cytotoxic agents is steep, making it appropriate to select the MTD as the optimal dose based on the safety/tolerability‐driven dose selection strategy. However, with the development of new treatment modalities, such as molecularly targeted drugs, antibody drugs, and immunotherapies, the MTD paradigm has been challenged. This is due to the observation of non‐linear and even flat exposure‐response (E‐R) relationships during the clinical development of molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These drugs typically do not require dosing at an almost intolerable level but rather at a dose that achieves adequate target occupancy and inhabitation. As a result, the traditional system of defining the MTD based on toxicity limitations based on peak exposure is no longer appropriate. Hence, doses below the MTD may have similar activity to the MTD with fewer toxicities, and a lower dose level than the MTD could be the optimal dose. This highlights the need to set an appropriate dosage selection scheme according to drug profile.

Furthermore, 15.9% (24/151) of first‐cycle review failures among all drug applications first submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2012 for new molecular entities are due to the uncertainty related to dose selection. Dose optimization is, therefore, a key factor for the timely development of effective new drugs.

Moreover, if the optimal dose is not evaluated sufficiently in clinical trials and if the labeled dose is unnecessarily high, severe toxicity may occur without additional efficacy, leading to a high rate of dose reduction. Intolerable toxicities may lead to premature discontinuation and missed opportunities for continued benefit from the drug and a negative impact on overall survival. It may further decrease the patient's quality of life (QOL) and negatively impact the patient's financial burden. Furthermore, modern oncology drugs, unlike cytotoxic agents, may be administered for many years, and over time, even low‐grade toxicities, which would not meet traditional definitions of dose‐limiting toxicities, may lead to a reduced QOL for patients, making the drugs intolerable.

### Dosage form and route of administration… [^b0f4d28e]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

ISO 11239 Dosage Form and Route of Administration specifies data elements and structure that uniquely, and with certainty, identifies pharmaceutical dosage forms, units of presentation and routes of administration related to medicinal product. FDA's regional terminology for dosage form and route of administration is the FDA Terminology for Structured Product Labeling which is maintained by the National Cancer Institute / Enterprise Vocabulary Service. Examples of use cases for the FDA Terminology includes: content of structured product labeling; drug registration and listing; and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Currently, the FDA Terminology does not comply with the ISO 11239 standard for use in global IDMP and specifically for global PhPID.

ISO 11239 and its ISO Technical Specification 20440: 2016 specifies hierarchical and mandatory attributes for regional dosage form terminologies that are not part of the structure of the FDA Terminology. There is no central standardized dose form terminology for use in global IDMP. FDA has worked with the ISO Technical Committee 215 Work Group 6 and the Global IDMP Working Group to develop a process that utilizes EDQM dose form characteristics and codes to describe dose forms for use in global IDMP and to revise the ISO TS 20440 and ISO 11239 documents, as needed.

### Individualized dosing of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy to prevent severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity: what are the options? [^c7c381d0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

All the strategies described in this review have shown to have potential, however, the limitations of these strategies need to be overcome by conducting additional research before combining of strategies is possible. In an ideal world, all the proposed strategies could be combined into an algorithm or model that could accurately predict the probability of developing severe fluoropyrimidine‐related toxicity and translate this probability into a dose recommendation (Figure 2). By combining all these strategies all known factors that have been associated with severe fluoropyrimidine‐related toxicity are covered, which could significantly improve the safety of fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy.

### Dose selection of novel anticancer drugs: exposing the gap between selected and required doses [^2a9b8b36]. The Lancet: Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Historically, dose selection of anticancer drugs has mainly been based on establishing the maximum tolerated dose in phase 1 clinical trials with a traditional 3 plus 3 design. In the era of targeted therapies and immune-modulating agents, this approach does not necessarily lead to selection of the most favourable dose. This strategy can introduce potentially avoidable toxicity or inconvenience for patients. Multiple changes in drug development could lead to more rational dose selection, such as use of better predictive preclinical models, adaptive and randomised trial design, evaluation of multiple dose levels in late-phase development, assessment of target activity and saturation, and early biomarker use for efficacy and safety evaluation. In this Review, we evaluate the rationale and validation of dose selection in each phase of drug development for anticancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration from Jan 1, 2020, to June 30, 2023, and give recommendations for dose optimisation to improve safety and patient convenience. In our evaluation, we classified 20 (65%) of the 31 recently registered anticancer agents as potential candidates for dose optimisation, which could be achieved either by reducing the dose (n = 10 [32%]) or adjusting the dosage regimen (n = 10 [32%]). Dose selection seemed to be adequately justified for nine (29%) of the drugs, whereas the reviewed data were inconclusive for formulating a recommendation on dose optimisation for two (6%) of the drugs.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pharmacologic treatments for children: research priorities and approach to pediatric studies [^99e26fe9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials of pharmacologic treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being rapidly designed and implemented in adults. Children are often not considered during development of novel treatments for infectious diseases until very late. Although children appear to have a lower risk compared with adults of severe COVID-19 disease, a substantial number of children globally will benefit from pharmacologic treatments. It will be reasonable to extrapolate efficacy of most treatments from adult trials to children. Pediatric trials should focus on characterizing a treatment's pharmacokinetics, optimal dose, and safety across the age spectrum. These trials should use an adaptive design to efficiently add or remove arms in what will be a rapidly evolving treatment landscape, and should involve a large number of sites across the globe in a collaborative effort to facilitate efficient implementation. All stakeholders must commit to equitable access to any effective, safe treatment for children everywhere.

### Dosage regimens of intranasal aerosolized surfactant on otitis media with effusion in an animal model [^798159b3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine optimal dosage regimens of intranasal metered dose aerosolized surfactant with and without other medications in the treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME).

Study Design

Resolution of experimental OME in gerbils was determined based on otomicroscopy and tympanometry. Experimental intranasal drugs were: surfactant, surfactant with betamethasone, surfactant with phenylephrine, and a normal saline solution placebo. Medications were administered once or twice daily via a metered dose inhaler.

Results

For twice-daily dosing, mean days to OME resolution were 8.5 for the aerosolized surfactant, 6.3 for the surfactant with betamethasone, 18.7 for the surfactant with phenylephrine, and 16 each for control and placebo. Resolution with the once-daily dosage was longer for all conditions. Results were comparable using tympanometry.

Conclusion

OME resolved faster than the natural course when treated with intranasal surfactant with and without steroids. Twice-daily dosing was statistically superior.

Significance

This study reiterates the effectiveness of OME treatment with an aerosolized synthetic surfactant with and without steroids and establishes a superior twice-daily dosage schedule.

### Dose escalation methods in phase I cancer clinical trials [^8b1757a7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Phase I clinical trials are an essential step in the development of anticancer drugs. The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics.
