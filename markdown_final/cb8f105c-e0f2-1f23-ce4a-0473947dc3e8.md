## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults (philadelphia chromosome-positive + resistant or intolerant to prior therapy)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage of dasatinib for adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact indication and whether the label specifies a fixed dose or a weight-based regimen. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility sources, namely FDA labeling and major guidelines, to confirm the dose and any alternatives. Next, I will review pivotal clinical data that informed the recommendation, including phase 3 comparisons of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing. Finally, I should consider practical administration, dose modifications, and how mutation status might influence TKI choice, before stating the bottom line recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the indication and context. We are dealing with adult Ph-positive ALL that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, which is a labeled indication for dasatinib, and I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with pediatric newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL, where dosing is different and often weight-based in combination with chemotherapy [^116Cbzgd] [^111C24eh].

> I will now examine the FDA label, since that is the most authoritative source for dosing. Multiple FDA sources consistently state that the recommended dose for adult Ph-positive ALL with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy is 140 mg orally once daily, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, which directly answers the question [^116Cbzgd] [^112ARpfp].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline contradicts this or offers an alternative. The NCCN Guidelines for ALL align with the FDA, noting that once-daily 140 mg dosing has been studied and is appropriate in this setting, and they do not propose an alternative standard dose for this indication, which reinforces 140 mg once daily as the standard [^114nubMn] [^111WBPit].

> Hold on, I should review the clinical evidence that underpins this dose. A phase 3 study in Ph-positive ALL patients who failed imatinib compared dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice daily and found similar overall efficacy with somewhat better major cytogenetic response and less pleural effusion with once-daily dosing, supporting 140 mg once daily as the preferred schedule in this population [^115whu5N].

> Let me consider administration details and safety modifiers. Dasatinib is administered orally with or without food, and tablets should not be crushed, cut, or chewed. In cases of clinically significant myelosuppression or nonhematologic toxicity, dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation is recommended, and growth factors may be used for persistent cytopenias, which is important for real-world dosing management [^111pczBC] [^112ARpfp].

> But wait, what if there are BCR-ABL1 mutations that change the choice of TKI rather than the dose. I should confirm that T315I confers resistance to dasatinib, in which case ponatinib or asciminib-based strategies are preferred, whereas other imatinib-resistant mutations may still respond to dasatinib; this affects agent selection rather than the standard 140 mg dose of dasatinib itself [^111ZYStk] [^114o4uqJ] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm not mixing up frontline or pediatric regimens with this relapsed/refractory adult indication. Frontline adult Ph-positive ALL often uses dasatinib in combination regimens and may employ different strategies, and pediatric newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL uses weight-based dasatinib dosing with chemotherapy, which are distinct scenarios and should not override the 140 mg once-daily dose for adult Ph-positive ALL with resistance or intolerance [^115Ypkwk] [^111C24eh].

> Bottom line, after verifying the label, guidelines, and pivotal data, the recommended dasatinib dose for adult Ph-positive ALL that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy is 140 mg orally once daily, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with dose modifications for adverse effects as clinically indicated [^116Cbzgd] [^112ARpfp] [^114nubMn].

---

The recommended dose of dasatinib for adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy is **140 mg orally once daily** [^116Cbzgd] [^112ARpfp] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^116Cbzgd]. This dose is supported by FDA labeling [^112A5uij] and NCCN guidelines [^114nubMn], and is the standard regimen for this indication [^112A5uij].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose

- **Phase 3 study**: A randomized trial in imatinib-resistant or intolerant Ph+ ALL showed dasatinib 140 mg once daily achieved a major hematologic response in 38% and a major cytogenetic response in 70%, with similar efficacy to 70 mg twice daily but a lower pleural effusion rate [^115whu5N].

- **NCCN guidelines**: Recommend dasatinib 140 mg once daily for Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, citing improved cytogenetic response and acceptable safety [^114nubMn] [^111WBPit].

- **FDA approval**: The 140 mg once-daily dose is the labeled regimen for adult Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy [^116Cbzgd] [^112ARpfp].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

- **Hematologic response**: Major hematologic response rates around 38–42% have been reported in clinical studies [^115whu5N] [^114hhiyt].

- **Cytogenetic response**: Major cytogenetic response rates of approximately 52–70% have been observed [^115whu5N] [^114hhiyt].

- **Progression-free survival**: Median progression-free survival is approximately 3–4 months, with overall survival around 6–9 months in heavily pretreated patients [^115whu5N] [^114nubMn].

---

## Safety profile and dose modifications

- **Common adverse effects**: Myelosuppression, pleural effusion, diarrhea, and bleeding are common; pleural effusion is less frequent with once-daily dosing than with twice-daily regimens [^115whu5N] [^1133xEkk].

- **Dose modifications**: For grade 3–4 myelosuppression or nonhematologic toxicity, interrupt or reduce dose; resume at a lower dose upon recovery [^111pczBC] [^1151ZPye].

- **Monitoring**: Regular CBCs, liver function tests, and clinical assessments for effusions or bleeding are recommended during therapy [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative dosing regimens

| **Dose regimen** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Current recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 140 mg once daily | - Similar efficacy to 70 mg twice daily <br/> - Higher cytogenetic response | - Lower pleural effusion rate <br/> - More convenient | Recommended |
| 70 mg twice daily | - Similar efficacy <br/> - Lower cytogenetic response | - Higher pleural effusion rate <br/> - Less convenient | Not preferred |

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment is required, but monitor closely for toxicity and consider dose reduction if intolerance occurs [^111pczBC].

- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorders, or pulmonary conditions due to risks of pleural effusion and bleeding [^116ApKZD].

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers; adjust dose if coadministration is necessary [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 140 mg orally once daily [^116Cbzgd] [^112ARpfp].

- **Duration**: Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^116Cbzgd].

- **Monitoring**: Regular CBCs, liver function tests, and clinical assessments for adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Dose modifications**: Interrupt or reduce dose for significant toxicity; resume at a lower dose upon recovery [^111pczBC] [^1151ZPye].

---

The recommended dose of dasatinib for adult Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to prior therapy is **140 mg orally once daily** [^116Cbzgd], supported by FDA labeling and NCCN guidelines, with evidence of meaningful hematologic and cytogenetic responses and a manageable safety profile [^115whu5N] [^114nubMn].

### Dasatinib induces rapid hematologic and cytogenetic responses in adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance or intolerance to imatinib: interim results of a phase 2 study [^114hhiyt]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a rapid disease course and a poor prognosis. Dasatinib, a novel, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases, has previously induced responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant Ph-positive ALL. We present the interim results of a phase 2 study designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dasatinib 140 mg in this patient population (n = 36). With a minimum follow-up of 8 months, treatment with dasatinib resulted in substantial hematologic and cytogenetic response rates. Major hematologic responses were achieved in 42% (15/36) of patients, 67% of whom remained progression-free. Complete cytogenetic responses were attained by 58% (21/36) of patients. The presence of BCR-ABL mutations conferring imatinib resistance did not preclude a response to dasatinib. Dasatinib was also tolerable, with 6% (2/36) of patients discontinuing therapy as a result of study-drug toxicity. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2; febrile neutropenia was the most frequent severe AE, but this and other cytopenias were manageable with dose reduction. Dasatinib represents a safe and effective treatment option and an important therapeutic advance for patients with Ph-positive ALL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #CA180015.

Introduction

The introduction of BCR–ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resulted in improved patient prognosis, including greater survival rates, compared with the two previous standards of care 1, 2, 3. Survival in CML patients is now nearly identical to that of the general population 4. CML is currently considered a manageable chronic disease, requiring many patients to remain on TKI therapy indefinitely. Given the long‐term nature of treatment for CML, monitoring patients as they continue therapy is valuable for understanding the durability of responses, and for recognizing the emergence of new or previously unrecognized adverse events (AEs).

Dasatinib, a second‐generation TKI active against ABL, PDGFRβ, KIT, and SRC family kinases, is approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed adults with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CP); adults with Ph+ CML in chronic phase, accelerated phase (AP), or blast phase (BP) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib; and for adults with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have become resistant to or intolerant of other treatment 5. Previous analysis from the initial report at 6‐month follow‐up for the phase 3 CA180‐034 dose‐optimization study in imatinib‐resistant or ‐intolerant CML‐CP patients showed similar dasatinib efficacy with all dosing regimens evaluated; however, the 100 mg once‐daily (QD) dosing schedule showed improved tolerability with a reduced incidence of treatment‐related AEs of interest (i.e. pleural effusion and cytopenia), leading to a label change as the recommended dasatinib dose regimen in this patient population 5, 6. Longer‐term follow‐up of patients in this trial at 6 years continued to demonstrate durable efficacy and safety with dasatinib at 100 mg QD 1. Here, we report the final 7‐year analysis of efficacy and safety outcomes of CA180‐034, which represents the longest follow‐up to date in the second‐line of any second‐generation BCR–ABL1 TKI.

### Dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice daily in patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who failed imatinib: results from a phase 3 study [^115whu5N]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Dasatinib 70 mg twice daily is indicated for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) intolerant or resistant to imatinib. In patients with chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, once-daily dosing has similar efficacy with improved safety, compared with twice-daily dosing. A phase 3 study (n = 611) assessed the efficacy and safety of dasatinib 140 mg once daily versus 70 mg twice-daily in patients with advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Ph+ ALL resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Here, results from the Ph+ ALL subset (n = 84) with a 2-year follow-up are reported. Patients were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib either 140 mg once daily (n = 40) or 70 mg twice daily (n = 44). The rate of confirmed major hematologic response with once-daily dosing (38%) was similar to that with twice-daily dosing (32%). The rate of major cytogenetic response with once-daily dosing (70%) was higher than that with twice-daily dosing (52%). Compared with the twice-daily schedule, the once-daily schedule had longer progression-free survival (median, 3.0 months versus 4.0 months, respectively) and shorter overall survival (median, 9.1 months versus 6.5 months, respectively). Overall safety profiles were similar between two groups, with nonhematologic adverse events being mostly grade 1 or 2. Pleural effusion was less frequent with once-daily dosing than with twice-daily dosing (all grades, 18% versus 32%). Notably, none of the differences between the two schedules was statistically significant. Compared with the 70 mg twice daily, dasatinib 140 mg once daily had similar overall efficacy and safety in patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant Ph+ ALL.

Background

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is effective in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemias, but relapse occurs, mainly as a result of the outgrowth of leukemic subclones with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations. We evaluated dasatinib, a BCR-ABL inhibitor that targets most imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Methods

Patients with various phases of CML or with Ph-positive ALL who could not tolerate or were resistant to imatinib were enrolled in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Dasatinib (15 to 240 mg per day) was administered orally in four-week treatment cycles, once or twice daily.

Results

A complete hematologic response was achieved in 37 of 40 patients with chronic-phase CML, and major hematologic responses were seen in 31 of 44 patients with accelerated-phase CML, CML with blast crisis, or Ph-positive ALL. In these two phases, the rates of major cytogenetic response were 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Responses were maintained in 95 percent of patients with chronic-phase disease and in 82 percent of patients with accelerated-phase disease, with a median follow-up more than 12 months and 5 months, respectively. Nearly all patients with lymphoid blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL had a relapse within six months. Responses occurred among all BCR-ABL genotypes, with the exception of the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to both dasatinib and imatinib in vitro. Myelosuppression was common but not dose-limiting.

Conclusions

Dasatinib induces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who cannot tolerate or are resistant to imatinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00064233 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Dasatinib and CAR T-Cell therapy in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a nonrandomized clinical trial [^116bjEHd]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in combination with dasatinib as frontline therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)?

Findings

In this phase 2, single-arm, nonrandomized clinical trial that included 28 adults with Ph-positive ALL, the complete molecular remission rate after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy was 85%. This treatment showed good safety profile, with only grade 1 cytokine release syndrome and no neurotoxic effects.

Meaning

The results of this trial suggest that the combination of CAR T-cell therapy and dasatinib was associated with encouraging efficacy and acceptable toxic effects as frontline therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL.

### How we approach Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults [^115ADu9x]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia has changed radically over the past 20 years. This type of leukemia used to have dismal prognosis, but today cure rates have improved with combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as imatinib or dasatinib, with hematopoietic stem cell transplant reserved for patients who are at high risk based on slow response to therapy or who relapse. Treating these patients can be challenging particularly if they are not enrolled on a clinical trial. Here, we describe our approach to these patients.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112WE3s4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — Ph-positive B-ALL regimens for adults ≥ 65 years or adults with substantial comorbidities (frontline & relapsed/refractory) list the preferred option as Clinical trial; other recommended regimens include low-intensity TKIs in combination with blinatumomab, corticosteroid, or vincristine plus dexamethasone, and a moderate-intensity option of TKI + mini-hyperCVD. TKI options include bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib; ponatinib has activity against T315I mutations but is associated with a high frequency of serious vascular events, and the PhALLCON study shows improved minimal residual disease (MRD) responses with ponatinib compared to imatinib. Prior to blinatumomab initiation, cytoreduction with TKI plus corticosteroid to a peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of < 10 × 10⁹/L is specified. Use of a specific TKI should account for anticipated/prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features, and imatinib use in first line should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Once-daily dasatinib for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [^117KZQL1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the new dasatinib dosing regimen for the treatment of chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CP CML) in patients who failed or were intolerant to imatinib therapy.

Data Sources

Literature published between July 2008 and December 2008 was accessed via MEDLINE, the Proceedings of the American Society of Hematology, and the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology using the key words chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, pharmacokinetics, and regimen.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Meeting abstracts and reports of major Phase 1–3 studies published in English are included.

Data Synthesis

Imatinib is the standard first-line therapy for CML; however, some patients develop resistance or are intolerant to the drug. Dasatinib was approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the dosage of 70 mg twice daily. A Phase 3 dose-optimization study was performed to compare this regimen with others, including dasatinib 100 mg once daily, in patients with CP CML. Results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in efficacy between these 2 regimens. The safety profile was improved in the 100-mg once-daily dasatinib arm with significantly reduced frequencies of grade 3–4 thrombocytopenia and all-grade pleural effusions. The number of patients who had to discontinue, reduce, or interrupt their dosage was also less among patients taking dasatinib 100 mg once daily.

Conclusions

Dasatinib 100 mg once daily has a more favorable risk to benefit assessment compared with the previous 70 mg twice-daily regimen and is now the recommended schedule for patients with CP CML.

NCCN Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia — Ph+ B-ALL induction and consolidation TKI selection and use: TKI options include bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib, and the Panel notes there are limited data for bosutinib in Ph+ ALL. Use of a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) should account for anticipated/prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features, and imatinib use in first line should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. Consider using an alternative and more broadly acting TKI and see treatment options based on BCR::ABL1 mutation profile. TKI monotherapy is seldom effective as induction; however, it may be considered as consolidation/maintenance in those unfit for additional therapies. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Purpose

On June 28, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb), a new small-molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. This summary reviews the database supporting this approval.

Experimental Design

Four single-arm multicenter studies supported the efficacy and safety of dasatinib. The primary efficacy end point in chronic phase CML was major cytogenetic response. The primary end point in accelerated phase, myeloid phase, and lymphoid blast phase CML, and Ph(+) ALL was major hematologic response.

Results

The four studies combined enrolled 445 patients. In patients with chronic phase CML, the major cytogenetic response rate was 45% with a complete cytogenetic response rate of 33%. Major hematologic response rates in patients with accelerated phase CML, myeloid CML, lymphoid blast CML, and Ph(+) ALL were 59%, 32%, 31%, and 42%, respectively. Median response durations in chronic phase, accelerated phase, and myeloid phase CML had not been reached. The median durations of major hematologic response were 3.7 months in lymphoid blast CML and 4.8 months in Ph(+) ALL. Common toxicities with dasatinib included myelosuppression, bleeding, and fluid retention.

Conclusions

This report describes the Food and Drug Administration review supporting the approval of dasatinib for CML and Ph(+) ALL based on the rates and durability of cytogenetic and hematologic responses.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — Ph-positive B-ALL (adolescent and young adult [AYA] and adults) recommendations: The Panel recommends that patients < 65 years of age without substantial comorbidities be treated in a clinical trial, when possible; if no appropriate trial is available, induction options include multiagent therapy, blinatumomab, or hyperCVAD combined with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Prior to blinatumomab, cytoreduction to a peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count of < 10 × 10⁹/L is recommended and can frequently be achieved with a TKI plus corticosteroid. TKI options include (in alphabetical order) bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib, and choice of TKI should account for anticipated or prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features. The PhALLCON study suggests improved minimal residual disease (MRD) responses with ponatinib compared to imatinib, and imatinib use in first-line treatment should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. Treatment regimens should include adequate central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis for all patients, and it is important to adhere to the protocol in its entirety from induction through consolidation/delayed intensification to maintenance. For AYA and adult (< 65 years of age) patients with a marrow complete remission after initial induction therapy, an MRD assessment should be performed before consolidation; given the complexity of MRD management, referral to or consultation with a center with expertise is recommended for any patient with ALL with MRD positivity. BCR::ABL1 qPCR positivity may reflect persistence in the myeloid compartment, and where feasible flow sorting for FISH/qPCR studies and/or NGS MRD may help; the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in the myeloid compartment does not necessarily imply a diagnosis of CML with lymphoid blast transformation. For CD20-positive disease, there are data to support the benefit of adding rituximab to multiagent therapy (excluding immunotherapy) in AYA patients and adults < 65 years without substantial comorbidities.

### Dasatinib: a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111usxAb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The Philadelphia chromosome is formed from a translocation of genetic material involving human chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting gene product, BCR-ABL, encodes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase (TK) that is a factor in the pathology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Use of targeted therapy that inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity may lead to hematologic and cytogenetic responses in affected individuals. The oral TK inhibitor dasatinib was approved in 2006 for use in patients with CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are unable to tolerate or have not responded to other treatments.

Objective

This paper reviews the available data on dasatinib, including its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, findings of in vitro and in vivo studies, adverse effects, and potential place in therapy.

Methods

Pertinent information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-May 2007), EMBASE (1980-first quarter 2007), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2007) using the terms dasatinib, BMS-354825, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Sprycel, Philadelphia chromosome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review.

Results

Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors. Dasatinib has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against BCR-ABL, including mutations that are resistant to other available TK inhibitors. Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies.

Conclusions

Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors. It has shown clinical benefit and tolerability in patients in all phases of CML, as well as in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib illustrates the potential for targeted drug development based on an understanding of the genetic alterations leading to CML and the development of resistance to treatment.

### Dasatinib-based 2-step induction for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1178aV1k]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The standard treatment for adults with Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)–based chemotherapy. Although promising results were reported using a chemotherapy-only strategy with a TKI plus hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone administered as hyperfractionated therapy) at MD Anderson Cancer Center, a US intergroup study using dasatinib plus hyperCVAD followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) demonstrated significantly superior survival advantages for patients undergoing transplantation. Therefore, for adults who achieve complete remission (CR), HSCT in the first CR (CR1) is recommended if they have an appropriate donor.

The introduction of TKIs in the treatment of Ph + ALL led to a high rate of stable CR, which enabled more patients to undergo HSCT in CR1. However, severe therapy-related toxicities and relapse before HSCT and older age remain obstacles to undergoing HSCT in CR1. The Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group previously introduced imatinib into an HSCT-based strategy, which is currently the standard strategy for adults with Ph + ALL in Japan. Dasatinib is a more potent inhibitor against BCR-ABL1 kinase than imatiniband is active against imatinib-resistant mutations, except for T315I. Therefore, dasatinib was expected to improve the efficacy of the current HSCT-based strategy using imatinib. However, a study comparing hyperCVAD plus dasatinib with hyperCVAD plus imatinib found no significant difference in long-term survival outcomes. Chemotherapy combined with a TKI in induction therapy should be selected in consideration of early therapy-related toxicities. A TKI plus intensive chemotherapy can lead to CR in > 95% of patients and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in up to 70%, but rapid eradication of leukemic cells causes severe treatment-related toxicities, and the rate of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) has been reported to be 2% to 6%. A series of trials by the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto revealed that almost all patients, even elderly patients, can achieve CR using a TKI plus steroids without severe toxicities. Although achieving MRD negativity predicts long-term survival, the rate of MRD negativity with TKI plus steroid induction is low, resulting in relapse without effective consolidation. The Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia reported a randomized phase 3 study comparing imatinib plus reduced-intensity chemotherapy with imatinib plus hyperCVAD as induction therapy. Both arms were followed by imatinib plus high-dose methotrexate (MTX)/cytarabine therapy, and patients who had a donor were eligible for HSCT. Patients allocated to the imatinib plus reduced-intensity chemotherapy arm had a significantly higher CR rate and lower early death rate than those in the imatinib plus hyperCVAD arm. The Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia study demonstrated that intensive chemotherapy is not essential for induction with a TKI if followed by consolidations with a TKI plus intensive therapy. Thus, TKI plus steroid induction followed by a TKI plus intensive chemotherapy may reduce toxicities without attenuating the molecular response before HSCT and improve survival outcomes. Therefore, we designed the phase 2 Ph+ALL213 study to assess whether dasatinib could improve efficacy compared with imatinib and whether 2-step induction therapy could reduce toxicities, thereby improving 3-year event-free survival (EFS).

### Dasatinib as first-line treatment for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113dKffN]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Dasatinib is a potent BCR-ABL inhibitor effective in chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) resistant/intolerant to imatinib. In the GIMEMA LAL1205 protocol, patients with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL older than 18 years (with no upper age limit) received dasatinib induction therapy for 84 days combined with steroids for the first 32 days and intrathecal chemotherapy. Postremission therapy was free. Fifty-three patients were evaluable (median age, 53.6 years). All patients achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR), 49 (92.5%) at day 22. At this time point, 10 patients achieved a BCR-ABL reduction to < 10⁻³. At 20 months, the overall survival was 69.2% and disease-free survival was 51.1%. A significant difference in DFS was observed between patients who showed at day 22 a decrease in BCR-ABL levels to < 10⁻³ compared with patients who never reached these levels during induction. In multivariate analysis, BCR-ABL levels of < 10⁻³ at day 85 correlated with disease-free survival. No deaths or relapses occurred during induction. Twenty-three patients relapsed after completing induction. A T315I mutation was detected in 12 of 17 relapsed cases. Treatment was well tolerated; only 4 patients discontinued therapy during the last phase of the induction when already in CHR. In adult Ph(+) ALL, induction treatment with dasatinib plus steroids is associated with a CHR in virtually all patients, irrespective of age, good compliance, no deaths, and a very rapid debulking of the neoplastic clone.

NCCN Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia — Ph-positive B-ALL maintenance therapy lists the following options: POMP (mercaptopurine, vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone) + TKI; vincristine + prednisone + TKI; and TKI monotherapy (if post-HCT or previously received blinatumomab + TKI). TKI options include (in alphabetical order): bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib, and use should account for anticipated/prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features; imatinib use in first line should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. Ponatinib has activity against T315I mutations and is effective in treating patients with resistant or PD on multiple TKIs; however, it is associated with a high frequency of serious vascular events (eg, strokes, heart attacks, tissue ischemia), and the PhALLCON study shows improved MRD responses with ponatinib compared to imatinib. TKI monotherapy is seldom effective as induction; however, it may be considered as consolidation/maintenance in those unfit for additional therapies. There are data to support the benefit of rituximab in addition to multiagent therapy (excluding TKI + blinatumomab) for AYA patients and adults aged < 65 years without substantial comorbidities with CD20-positive disease (especially in patients aged < 60 years). Include IT chemotherapy per protocol, or as clinically indicated. TKI should be continued for at least 2 years post-HCT, and during maintenance chemotherapy the recommended duration of TKI is at least until completion of maintenance chemotherapy, although the optimal duration of TKI is unknown in both settings. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Methods

Study design, therapy and endpoint

The GIMEMA LAL1509 trial (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: EudraCT 2010-019119-39) was designed for adult Ph+ ALL patients (18–60 years). The identification of the BCR-ABL1 transcript was performed centrally within the steroid pre-phase (see below). Induction consisted of 12 weeks of dasatinib administration (140 mg/day), preceded by a 7-day steroid pre-phase (escalating doses from 20 up to 60 mg/m): steroids were administered for 24 days, then tapered until day 31. Patients continued treatment with dasatinib until day 84 after induction, cases in CMR continued dasatinib until progression or minimal residual disease (MRD) increase or occurrence of toxicity (grade ≥ 3). MRD-positive patients were stratified according to transplant eligibility: i) those with a promptly available human leukocyte antigen-compatible donor proceeded to an allo-SCT (by protocol guidelines, a haploidentical donor was not permitted); ii) those with a compatible, but not readily available donor, received one chemotherapy consolidation cycle prior to allo-SCT; iii) those non-eligible for allo- SCT received two chemotherapy consolidation cycles. The first consolidation cycle consisted of clofarabine (40 mg/m, days 1–5) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m, days 1–5); the second consolidation cycle consisted of 3 days of the same combination; dasatinib was interrupted during the 5 and 3 days of chemotherapy consolidation to avoid excessive toxicity and was restarted as soon as possible, at hematologic recovery. Upon consolidation, patients received dasatinib, until intolerance or relapse. Figure 1 summarizes the treatment scheme and patients' disposition.

CNS prophylaxis is detailed in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the rate of patients alive in CHR.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committees of all participating centers; patients gave their written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Hematologic response assessment

CHR was defined as bone marrow (BM) containing less than 5% blasts, absence of blasts in the peripheral blood (PB) and no extramedullary involvement. Hematologic relapse was defined as the re-appearance of blasts in the BM and/or in extramedullary sites.

### Current treatment options for adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116kDvUL]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical management of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been challenging primarily due to the aggressive nature of the disease and limited effective treatment options. The outcome for patients who receive conventional chemotherapy alone is poor, with remission duration of around 12 months and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of not more than 10%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been the only known curative treatment option, but is limited by the availability of a matched donor and the risk of treatment-related mortality. Given the role of BCR-ABL in the leukemogenesis of Ph+ ALL, current treatments have focused on inhibition of this oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Early studies demonstrate that the use of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, before alloSCT results in improved response rates and DFS when combined with standard chemotherapy regimens. Remission duration also is improved when combination chemotherapy and imatinib are administered intensively, even in the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, resistant disease remains an important problem, and the mechanisms underlying resistance in Ph+ ALL are multifactorial. Novel TKIs are currently under development and are effective in some patients with imatinib-resistant disease. The dual BCR-ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, has shown promising activity in the treatment of Ph+ ALL after imatinib failure and has recently been approved in this indication. Other TKI-based therapies are also showing potential in imatinib-resistant disease. This article reviews current and emerging treatments in Ph+ ALL.

### Dasatinib with intensive chemotherapy in de novo paediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CA180-372 / COG AALL1122): a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial [^111C24eh]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The outcome of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia significantly improved with the combination of imatinib and intensive chemotherapy. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of dasatinib, a second-generation ABL-class inhibitor, with intensive chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Methods

CA180-372/COG AALL1122 was a joint Children's Oncology Group (COG) and European intergroup study of post-induction treatment of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (EsPhALL) open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study. Eligible patients (aged > 1 year to < 18 years) with newly diagnosed Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and performance status of at least 60% received EsPhALL chemotherapy plus dasatinib 60 mg/m² orally once daily from day 15 of induction. Patients with minimal residual disease of at least 0.05% after induction 1B or who were positive for minimal residual disease after the three consolidation blocks were classified as high risk and allocated to receive haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission. The remaining patients were considered standard risk and received chemotherapy plus dasatinib for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the 3-year event-free survival of dasatinib plus chemotherapy compared with external historical controls. The trial was considered positive if one of the following conditions was met: superiority over chemotherapy alone in the AIEOP-BFM 2000 high-risk group; or non-inferiority (with a margin of -5%) or superiority to imatinib plus chemotherapy in the EsPhALL 2010 cohort. All participants who received at least one dose of dasatinib were included in the safety and efficacy analyses. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01460160, and recruitment is closed.

Findings

Between March 13, 2012, and May 27, 2014, 109 patients were enrolled at 69 sites (including 51 COG sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia, and 18 EsPhALL sites in Italy and the UK). Three patients were ineligible and did not receive dasatinib. 106 patients were treated and included in analyses (49 [46%] female and 57 [54%] male; 85 [80%] White, 13 [12%] Black or African American, five [5%] Asian, and three [3%] other races; 24 [23%] Hispanic or Latino ethnicity). All 106 treated patients reached complete remission; 87 (82%) were classified as standard risk and 19 (18%) met HSCT criteria and were classified as high risk, but only 15 (14%) received HSCT in first complete remission. The 3-year event-free survival of dasatinib plus chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone (65.5% [90% Clopper-Pearson CI 57.7 to 73.7] vs 49.2% [38.0 to 60.4]; p = 0.032), and was non-inferior to imatinib plus chemotherapy (59.1% [51.8 to 66.2], 90% CI of the treatment difference: -3.3 to 17.2), but not superior to imatinib plus chemotherapy (65.5% vs 59.1%; p = 0.27). The most frequent grade 3–5 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (n = 93) and bacteraemia (n = 21). Nine remission deaths occurred, which were due to infections (n = 5), transplantation-related (n = 2), due to cardiac arrest (n = 1), or had an unknown cause (n = 1). No dasatinib-related deaths occurred.

Interpretation

Dasatinib plus EsPhALL chemotherapy is safe and active in paediatric Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 3-year event-free survival was similar to that of previous Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia trials despite the limited use of HSCT in first complete remission.

Study treatments

Treatment schedules are listed in Table 1 and were the same as in our previous Ph+ALL208 study, but dasatinib was used instead of imatinib, and the induction phase was separated into 2 steps. The first induction therapy (IND1) was started with prednisolone after the diagnosis of precursor B-cell ALL. In the case of BCR - ABL1 positivity, dasatinib was started on day 8 to achieve hematological CR. IND1 was followed by IND2 to achieve MRD negativity, at which time dasatinib was administered in combination with the same 4-drug intensive chemotherapyas in our previous studies. After IND2, 2 types of consolidation therapy, dasatinib in combination with high-dose MTX/cytarabine in C1 or a CHOP-like (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen in C2, were administered alternatingly for 4 cycles. Maintenance therapy was 12 cycles of dasatinib plus prednisolone with vincristine. Intrathecal injection of MTX and dexamethasone was administered on day 22 of IND1, on the first day of IND2, and at each consolidation. Dose modification for patients age 60 to 64 years is described in Table 1.

Table 1.
Treatment schedule in the JALSG Ph+ALL213 study

Patients who achieved CR and had an appropriate donor underwent HSCT. The timing of HSCT was recommended to be during the consolidation phase, after the end of cycle 1 of the first consolidation (C1-1). The procedure for HSCT, including the conditioning regimen and prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), was determined by each institution. We defined a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen as having the following dosage levels: < 9 mg/kg of busulfan, < 140 mg/m² of melphalan, and total-body irradiation (TBI) at < 500 (single) or 500 to 800 cGy (fractionated). An RIC regimen was allowed when the patient was age ≥ 55 years or when myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was impossible because of poor physical condition. Patients who did not want to undergo HSCT or who had no satisfactory donor proceeded to the remaining rounds of consolidation and maintenance therapy. Patients with pretransplantation MRD positivity were assigned to receive prophylactic dasatinib after HSCT. For patients with pretransplantation MRD negativity, dasatinib was administered preemptively upon molecular relapse. Dasatinib was started at a dose of 50 mg per day and increased up to 100 mg if tolerable and continued for 4 weeks, which was repeated every 5 weeks for 10 cycles.

Dasatinib has significant clinical activity in patients with imatinib resistance. We examined the efficacy and safety of combining chemotherapy with dasatinib for patients with Ph(+) ALL. Newly diagnosed patients received dasatinib 50 mg by mouth twice per day (or 100 mg daily) for the first 14 days of each of 8 cycles of alternating hyper-CVAD, and high-dose cytarabine and methotrexate. Patients in complete remission received maintenance daily dasatinib and monthly vincristine and prednisone for 2 years, followed by dasatinib indefinitely. Thirty-five patients with untreated Ph(+) ALL with a median age of 53 years (range, 21–79 years) were treated; 33 patients (94%) achieved complete remission. Two patients died of infections before response assessment. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included hemorrhage and pleural and pericardial effusions. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 4–37 months), the median disease-free survival and median overall survival have not been reached, with an estimated 2-year survival of 64%. The combination of chemotherapy with dasatinib is effective in achieving long-term remissions in patients with newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL. This study was registered at www. ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00390793.

There are data to support the benefit of rituximab in addition to multiagent therapy (excluding TKI + blinatumomab) for AYA patients and adults aged < 65 years without substantial comorbidities with CD20-positive disease, especially in patients aged < 60 years. TKI options include bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib, and use of a specific TKI should account for anticipated/prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 T mutations, and disease-related features; imatinib use in first line should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. Ponatinib has activity against T315I mutations and is effective in treating resistant or PD on multiple TKIs but is associated with a high frequency of serious vascular events, and the PhALLCON study shows improved MRD responses with ponatinib compared to imatinib. Prior to blinatumomab initiation, cytoreduce with TKI plus corticosteroid to a peripheral WBC count of < 10 × 10⁹/L, and TKI + corticosteroid as induction should be followed by TKI + multiagent therapy or TKI + blinatumomab consolidation unless used in a palliative manner. All regimens include CNS prophylaxis with systemic therapy and/or IT therapy, and for hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase, ERW-rywn should be substituted to complete the full treatment course.

### Incidence, outcomes, and risk factors of pleural effusion in patients receiving dasatinib therapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia [^116ApKZD]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Dasatinib, a second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, both as first-line therapy and after imatinib intolerance or resistance. While generally well tolerated, dasatinib has been associated with a higher risk for pleural effusions. Frequency, risk factors, and outcomes associated with pleural effusion were assessed in two phase 3 trials (DASISION and 034/Dose-optimization) and a pooled population of 11 trials that evaluated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with dasatinib (including DASISION and 034/Dose-optimization). In this largest assessment of patients across the dasatinib clinical trial program (N = 2712), pleural effusion developed in 6–9% of patients at risk annually in DASISION, and in 5–15% of patients at risk annually in 034/Dose-optimization. With a minimum follow up of 5 and 7 years, drug-related pleural effusion occurred in 28% of patients in DASISION and in 33% of patients in 034/Dose-optimization, respectively. A significant risk factor identified for developing pleural effusion by a multivariate analysis was age. We found that overall responses to dasatinib, progression-free survival, and overall survival were similar in patients who developed pleural effusion and in patients who did not. clinicaltrials.gov identifier 00481247; 00123474.

### A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of minimal residual disease as a prognostic indicator in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112PLJ3k]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease that derives from lymphoid cell populations. Precursor B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is the most common immunological subtype, and the most common genetic abnormality in BALL is the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph-positive ALL), found in approximately one-quarter of adult patients. Genetic or molecular profiling can be used to characterize disease prognosis, predict response to therapy, and inform treatment decisions.

The mainstay of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL has historically involved induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidation and maintenance chemotherapies; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is recommended following consolidation in selected high-risk groups. However, for patients with Ph-positive disease in particular, outcomes with standard combination chemotherapy are poor. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib have shown efficacy in patients with Ph-positive disease, and there are some preliminary suggestions that they may also be efficacious in selected subsets of Ph-negative ALL. – Moreover, several targeted therapies have been developed for patients with B-ALL, such as the antibody-based therapies rituximab, inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab, these latter demonstrating greater effectiveness than salvage chemotherapy in the very high-risk setting of relapsed/refractory ALL, including both Ph-positive and Ph-negative patients. –

Ph-positive B-ALL consolidation — tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selection and adjunctive therapy notes: There are data to support the benefit of rituximab in addition to multiagent therapy (excluding TKI + blinatumomab) for AYA patients and adults aged < 65 years without substantial comorbidities with CD20-positive disease (especially in patients aged < 60 years). TKI options include bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib; not all TKIs have been directly studied within the context of each specific regimen, use of a specific TKI should account for anticipated/prior TKI intolerance, dose used, BCR::ABL1 mutations, and disease-related features, and imatinib use in first line should be restricted to patients who cannot tolerate broader acting TKIs. Ponatinib has activity against T315I mutations and is effective in treating patients with resistant or PD on multiple TKIs; however, it is associated with a high frequency of serious vascular events, and the PhALLCON study shows improved MRD responses with ponatinib compared to imatinib. All regimens include CNS prophylaxis with systemic therapy and/or IT therapy, and for patients who develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, ERW-rvyn should be substituted as a component of the multi-agent therapeutic regimen to complete the full treatment course.

### Dasatinib in pediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: results from a phase II trial [^111SMu6g]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Safe, effective treatments are needed for pediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Dasatinib is approved for treatment of adults and children with CML-CP. A phase I study determined suitable dosing for children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias. Methods CA180-226/NCT00777036 is a phase II, open-label, nonrandomized prospective trial of patients < 18 years of age receiving dasatinib. There are three cohorts: (1) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP, (2) imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML in accelerated/blast phase or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 17), and (3) newly diagnosed CML-CP treated with tablets or powder for oral suspension. Major cytogenetic response > 30% for imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) > 55% for newly diagnosed patients were of clinical interest. Results Of 113 patients with CML-CP, 14 (48%) who were imatinib-resistant/intolerant and 61 (73%) who were newly diagnosed remained on treatment at time of analysis. Major cytogenetic response > 30% was reached by 3 months in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and CCyR > 55% was reached by 6 months in the newly diagnosed CML-CP group. CCyR and major molecular response by 12 months, respectively, were 76% and 41% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant group and 92% and 52% in newly diagnosed CML-CP group. Progression-free survival by 48 months was 78% and 93% in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant and newly diagnosed CML-CP groups, respectively. No dasatinib-related pleural or pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported. Bone growth and development events were reported in 4% of patients. Conclusion In the largest prospective trial to date in children with CML-CP, we demonstrate that dasatinib is a safe, effective treatment of pediatric CML-CP. Target responses to first- or second-line dasatinib were met early, and deep molecular responses were observed. Safety of dasatinib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults; however, no cases of pleural or pericardial effusion or pulmonary arterial hypertension were reported.

Patients with relapsed/refractory Ph-positive B-ALL — Mutation testing for the ABL1 kinase domain is recommended in patients with Ph+ B-ALL that have experienced relapse after or have disease refractory to initial TKI-containing therapy. If not administered during initial induction, TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, or ponatinib) are recommended options for patients with R/R Ph+ B-ALL, and for second- and third-generation TKIs, relevant BCR::ABL1 mutations should be considered. For all patients with R/R Ph-positive B-ALL, participation in a clinical trial is preferred; in the absence of an appropriate trial, patients may be considered for second-line therapy with an alternative TKI alone, TKI combined with systemic therapy regimens, or TKI combined with corticosteroids, and other options include asciminib plus dasatinib or blinatumomab or InO with or without a TKI. Compared to standard care, InO is associated with increased hepatotoxicity, including fatal and life-threatening hepatic SOS, and increased risk of post-HCT non-relapse mortality; it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks from InO monotherapy and the start of conditioning for allogeneic HCT to minimize risk of SOS, and SOS has been shown to occur less frequently when less alkylators are used as part of the conditioning regimen.

### Pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1114VHzp]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We investigated nilotinib exposure in pediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) resistant to, relapsed on, refractory to, or intolerant of previous treatment.

Patients and Methods

Fifteen patients (aged 1- < 18 years) with CML resistant to or intolerant of imatinib and/or dasatinib (n = 11) or Ph + ALL relapsed on or refractory to standard therapy (n = 4) enrolled in this phase I study. Nilotinib (230 mg/m² twice daily; equivalent to the adult 400-mg twice-daily dose) was administered orally in 12 or 24 cycles of 28 days. The primary objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib in pediatric patients.

Results

The area under the concentration-time curve at steady state was slightly lower in pediatric patients versus adults (14,751.4 vs. 17,102.9 ng/h/mL); the geometric mean ratio (GMR; pediatric:adult) was 0.86 [90% confidence interval (CI), 0.70–1.06]. Body surface area-adjusted systemic clearance was slightly higher in pediatric versus adult patients (GMR, 1.30; 90% CI, 1.04–1.62). Nilotinib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events were headache, vomiting, increased blood bilirubin, and rash. Three patients with CML achieved major molecular response, and three with Ph + ALL achieved complete remission.

Conclusions

Nilotinib 230 mg/m² twice daily in pediatric patients provided a pharmacokinetics and safety profile comparable with the adult reference dose; clinical activity was demonstrated in both CML and Ph + ALL. This dose is recommended for further evaluation in pediatric patients. The safety profile was consistent with that in adults.

Dasatinib — recommended and alternative dosing strategies: The recommended starting dose of dasatinib is 100 mg once daily for patients with CP-CML; a single-arm study (81 evaluable patients) suggests that 50 mg once daily may have similar efficacy in low- or intermediate-risk CP-CML, and 20 mg once daily has been shown to be an appropriate starting dose for patients ≥ 65 years with newly diagnosed CP-CML. Intermittent dosing or dose reduction to 50 mg once daily has been shown effective as second-line and subsequent therapy in CP-CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib. For clinically significant intolerance to dasatinib 100 mg once daily, dasatinib at 50 mg (20 mg with careful monitoring in selected patients) should be considered to avoid serious adverse events necessitating discontinuation.

### Treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1112KRsz]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes at least one-quarter of all adults with ALL. Until recently, conventional chemotherapy programs that have been effective in other precursor B-cell ALL cases have been unable to cure patients with this diagnosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation early in first remission has been the recommended therapy. The availability of imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and small molecules that affect the BCR/ABL signaling pathways may be changing the treatment paradigm and the prognosis for these patients. The results from clinical trials using imatinib in the frontline setting and in relapsed patients as well as preliminary experience treating imatinib-resistant Ph(+) ALL will be described.

Clinical trials for AYA and adult patients are even more limited. Phase I/II trials conducted at the MD Anderson Cancer Center are testing dasatinib or low doses of ruxolitinib in combination with hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) in relapsed/refractory ALL and ABL -class fusions or CRLF2/JAK mutations, respectively. Interim data analysis has demonstrated the safety of these combinations with limited efficacy. A recent phase I trial at the University of Chicago and other institutions is studying ruxolitinib in combination with the pediatric-inspired CALBG (Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group B) 10403 chemotherapy regimen in adolescents with newly diagnosed Ph-like ALL harboring CRLF2/JAK alterations, with a planned phase II expansion study if safety is demonstrated.

Regarding the election of TKI, there is no clear evidence of the superiority of dasatinib over imatinib for Ph-like ALL cases with ABL -class fusions. This comparison is especially difficult given that the doses of these TKI differ among trials. Other TKI, such as nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib, are still being investigated as phase I and II trials in pediatric cancers. Since the combination of TKI and immunotherapy with blinatumomab has proven feasible and effective in patients with Ph-positive ALL, this approach should be explored in patients with Ph-like ALL together with reduced-intensity chemotherapy and HSCT.

There are challenges in the diagnosis of Ph-like ALL before using targeted therapy in frontline treatment. Diagnostic technologies such as RNA sequencing and similar strategies should be implemented in a timely fashion for all "B-other ALL", but to date appropriate assays are not yet available as widely recognized diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, although ABL -class and JAK pathway alterations account for most Ph-like ALL cases, there are also several alterations involving kinases that are not inhibited by either TKI or JAK inhibitors. For this subgroup of Ph-like cases without known targetable lesions innovative therapies such as immunotherapy could be useful to reduce the MRD level before MRD-guided HSCT. Nonetheless, all these efforts will undoubtedly require collaborative international approaches to conduct successful studies.

### Incidence, outcomes, and risk factors of pleural effusion in patients receiving dasatinib therapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia [^111kFrrs]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dasatinib is a potent second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved at 100 mg once daily (QD) as first-line therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP), and in patients with CML-CP who are resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. Dasatinib is also approved at 140 mg QD in patients with accelerated or blast phase CML (CML-AP/BP) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) with resistance to or intolerance of prior therapy. –

Although fluid retention has been associated with TKIs used to treat CML, pleural effusions, specifically with exudate characteristics, have been reported more commonly with dasatinib. The exact mechanisms behind treatment-related pleural effusion remain to be elucidated; however, it has been suggested that immune mechanisms may play a role, based on reports of association with lymphocytosis and the presence of lymphocyte-dominant exudates and chyle accumulate. – Alternatively, pleural effusion (with or without exudates) may also occur through inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β or SRC-family kinases. In clinical practice, pleural effusion observed with dasatinib therapy remains a concern for both patients and prescribers.

Risk factors for pleural effusion in dasatinib-treated patients have been described in previous reports, including advanced age, advanced disease, heart disease, preexisting hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, autoimmune disease, rash, drug dose and schedule, and the presence of lymphocytosis.– A correlation with plasma trough level, drug exposure, treatment duration, and depth of response to treatment has been suggested, but not confirmed.

Here, we present an analysis of the proportion of patients with pleural effusion by grade, and efficacy outcomes in these patients, in dasatinib clinical trials. Additionally, we report the results of multivariate analyses of dasatinib clinical trial data, exploring factors associated with the development of pleural effusion in dasatinib-treated patients.

### Treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-from intensive chemotherapy combinations to chemotherapy-free regimens: a review [^115Ypkwk]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

With the advent of potent BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is now a relatively favorable-risk acute leukemia. In this review, we discuss the current evidence for frontline therapies of Ph-positive ALL, the major principles that guide therapy, and the progress with chemotherapy-free regimens.

Observations

Incorporating TKIs into the chemotherapy regimens of patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL has led to improved remission rates, higher probability of reaching allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), and longer survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Early achievement of a complete molecular remission (CMR) is an important end point in Ph-positive ALL and identifies patients who have excellent long-term survival and may not need allogeneic SCT. Second-generation TKIs combined with intensive or low-intensity chemotherapy resulted in higher CMR rates compared with imatinib-based regimens. This translated into better outcomes, with less reliance on allogeneic SCT. To further improve the outcomes, the potent third-generation TKI ponatinib was added to chemotherapy. The combination of hyper-CVAD and ponatinib resulted in an overall CMR rate of 84% and a 5-year survival rate of 73% and 86% among patients who did and did not undergo allogeneic SCT, respectively, suggesting that allogeneic SCT may not be needed with this regimen. The recent chemotherapy-free combination of dasatinib and blinatumomab was safe and effective in patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL and resulted in an estimated 3-year OS rate of 80%; 50% of patients underwent allogeneic SCT. The chemotherapy-free regimen of ponatinib and blinatumomab resulted in a CMR rate of 86% and a 2-year survival rate of 93%, with no relapses or leukemia-related deaths, and with only 1 patient proceeding to allogeneic SCT.

Conclusions and Relevance

The promising results obtained with the chemotherapy-free regimens of blinatumomab plus TKIs question the role of allogeneic SCT in first remission. Patients with Ph-positive ALL who achieve early and deep molecular responses have excellent long-term outcomes and may not benefit from allogeneic SCT.

TKIs combined with hyperCVAD in Ph-positive ALL showed regimen-specific outcomes. Imatinib plus hyperCVAD in a phase II MDACC study of previously untreated or minimally treated ALL (n = 54; median age, 51 years; range, 17–84 years) had a 3-year OS of 54%; 14 patients underwent subsequent allogeneic HCT. In those ≤ 40 years (n = 16), there was a strong trend for OS benefit with HCT (3-year OS 90% vs. 33%; P = 0.05), whereas among patients ≤ 60 years there was no statistically significant difference (77% vs. 57%). Dasatinib plus hyperCVAD with maintenance in previously untreated Ph-positive ALL (n = 35; median age, 53 years; range, 21–79 years; 31% > 60 years) reported 2-year OS and EFS of 64% and 57%, with four patients receiving allogeneic HCT in CR1. Ponatinib plus hyperCVAD in a phase II prospective trial (n = 37; aged ≥ 18 years; median age, 51 years; 12 ≥ 60 years) produced overall complete cytogenetic response in all 32 evaluable patients (100%) and MRD negativity in 35 of 37 (95%) after a median 3 weeks; only half of patients ≥ 60 completed therapy and were switched to alternate TKIs. The 2-year OS and EFS were 80% and 81%, and a follow-up study (n = 76; age ≥ 18 years; median age, 47 years) showed a 3-year EFS of 70%.

### Advances and potential treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive adult acute lymphoid leukaemia [^115EBqU1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common subtype of ALL in adults. Conventional chemotherapy-based approaches that are effective in other precursor B cell ALL cases have a poor chances of cure in patients with a Ph+ diagnosis. Therefore, allogeneic stem cell transplantation performed during the first remission is the recommended therapy. Recently, the availability of imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and small molecules that affect the BCR/ABL signalling pathways has introduced a new therapeutic opportunity, and could change the treatment paradigm and prognosis for these patients. In this article, the results from clinical trials using imatinib in relapsed/refractory patients and as front-line therapy are described. In addition, preliminary experiences with novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors in imatinib-resistant Ph+ ALL are discussed.

### Asciminib for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias [^114FKYbG]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia

Early studies in CP-CML patients with prior resistance or intolerance to several lines of TKI therapy demonstrated that asciminib was indeed very well tolerated, and often efficacious. The phase I study of asciminib (ClinicalTrials. gov number NCT02081378, referred to hereafter as the X2101 study) enrolled patients with chronic and accelerated phase CML, as well as Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph +) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who had resistance or intolerance to two or more lines of treatment. Patients received doses between 10 mg and 200 mg once or twice a day. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported at any dose. The most recent update reported on 115 patients with CP-CML without the T315I mutation. With a median exposure of 4 years, a major molecular response (MMR; BCR::ABL1 ≤ 0.1%) was achieved by 62%; and a 4-log reduction in transcripts (MR4, BCR::ABL1 ≤ 0.01%) by 34%. Event-free survival (events included discontinuation because of adverse events, progression to accelerated or blast phase, or death on treatment) was 87% and 81% at 24 and 48 months respectively. Supported by additional pharmacokinetic studies, the dose of 80 mg QD was determined to be optimal in patients without T315I. In vitro data suggested that targeting T315I required a higher dose, and 200 mg twice a day was selected for a separate T315I cohort within the X2101 study. The latest data showed that 56% of this group of 48 patients remain on therapy, and 62% achieved a ≥ 2-log reduction in transcripts (MR2, BCR::ABL1 ≤ 1%). Ponatinib-naïve patients had an MR2 rate of 81%, versus 48% in patients resistant or intolerant to ponatinib. After a median follow-up of 2 years, grade 3–4 lipase elevation was observed in 19%, with 8% of patients reporting arterial occlusive events. These findings have been supported by small, real-world datasets (Table 2).-One such cohort comprised 31 patients with T315I mutations from eight countries. Twenty-eight had prior resistance or intolerance to ponatinib; MMR was achieved by 42% of those who were not in MMR at commencement of asciminib treatment. In patients who entered the study in MMR, six of 12 lost the MMR during the study. The safety data looked less favorable than those in the X2101 report; 26% experienced serious adverse events leading to hospitalization. Thus, asciminib is a reasonable option for patients with the T315I mutation, but more data are needed to determine the safety of this higher dose, especially in heavily pre-treated patients who may be particularly vulnerable to toxicity.

### Dasatinib-based 2-step induction for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113jCi4C]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Posttransplantation TKIs are expected to reduce relapse after HSCT. The Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation proposed that patients with posttransplantation MRD positivity can be treated using imatinib either prophylactically or preemptively upon molecular relapse. In this study, among 14 patients who were assigned to prophylactic dasatinib, 2 with posttransplantation MRD positivity received dasatinib but did not respond to dasatinib with grade 3/4 toxicities, and 6 with posttransplantation MRD negativity received prophylactic dasatinib, 5 of whom ended as MRD −, 4 (66.7%) with grade 3 toxicities. Among 44 patients who were assigned to preemptive dasatinib, 6 were treated using preemptive dasatinib, resulting in 2 patients (16.7%) with grade 3 toxicities, but 7 relapsed before receiving dasatinib with no response, although 4 survived in CR2 (3 after second HSCT and 1 after whole-brain irradiation). Considering the 29 of 44 patients with pretransplantation MRD negativity who did not require dasatinib, 4 survivors in CR2 among the 7 relapsed patients, and grade 3/4 toxicities observed after prophylactic dasatinib, we cannot recommend prophylactic dasatinib for patients with pretransplantation MRD negativity.

We introduced dasatinib instead of imatinib to improve the efficacy of treatment before HSCT. Ponatinib, the most potent BCR-ABL1 inhibitor against both wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL1, including T315I, is now available for relapsed and refractory Ph + ALL in Japan. Ponatinib provided deeper molecular remission than dasatinib and prevented relapse of the T315I clone during chemotherapy in this study. Two-step induction successfully reduced toxicities, but grade 3/4 toxicities remained frequent. Recently, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto reported that consolidation by blinatumomab after induction by dasatinib plus prednisone resulted in excellent molecular response with minimal severe toxicities. Of the 63 enrolled patients with a median age of 54 years (range, 24–82), the CR rate was 98%. The molecular response rate after 2 cycles of blinatumomab was 60%. This study suggested that chemotherapy-free treatment can further reduce the toxicities of treatment with a high molecular response before HSCT.

Targeted agents — tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: The emergence of targeted therapies for hematologic malignancies, including the treatment of Ph-positive disorders with TKIs, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, and bosutinib represents an important advancement in ALL therapy. Incorporation of TKIs into treatment regimens should include evaluation of clinical pharmacokinetics, clinicians should be aware of variation among the TKIs relating to absorption from the GI tract, and histamine-2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors can affect the bioavailability of some TKIs.

### Minimal residual disease-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line dasatinib combined with chemotherapy for adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1115asqt]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of imatinib combined with chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcome in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to die as a result of disease progression.

Patients and Methods

We assessed the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line incorporation of dasatinib (100 mg once daily) into chemotherapy alternatively for adults with Ph-positive ALL. The primary end point was the major molecular response (MMR) rate by the end of the second dasatinib cycle. Patients with a donor proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) as early as possible. MRD monitoring was centrally evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (4.5-log sensitivity) using bone marrow samples.

Results

Fifty-one patients (median age, 46 years) were enrolled and treated with this strategy. After the first dasatinib cycle, 50 patients (98.0%) achieved complete remission (CR). By the end of the second dasatinib cycle, 46 (93.9%) of 49 assessable patients had persistent CR, and 38 (77.6%) had MMR (32.7%) or undetectable MRD (44.9%). On the basis of the MRD kinetics by this time point, the numbers of early-stable, late, and poor molecular responders were 23 (46.9%), 15 (30.7%), and 11 (22.4%), respectively. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%) underwent allogeneic SCT in CR1. After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) rate for all patients were 30.0% and 52.0%, respectively, and the corresponding outcomes among those receiving allogeneic SCT in CR1 were 20.5% and 64.1%, respectively. Poor molecular responders had a higher risk of relapse and DFS than those of early-stable molecular responders.

Conclusion

This dasatinib-based protocol was effective for achieving a good quality molecular response and durable DFS in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

### Cross-intolerance with bosutinib after prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia: long-term analysis of a phase I / II study [^114CkgwY]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

The approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has significantly improved patient outcomes versus previous standard of care for Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and reduced the frequency of progression from chronic phase (CP) to accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP). Although most patients have a favorable outcome with front-line TKI, approximately half may require switching to an alternative TKI due to resistance or intolerance to one or more prior TKI. Long-term (≥ 4 years) follow-up data from a phase I/II study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00261846) was analyzed to assess the safety profile of bosutinib, an orally active, dual Src/Abl TKI, in patients with prior TKI intolerance, and to identify cross-intolerance between bosutinib and prior TKI across patients with Ph+ CP CML and advanced (ADV) leukemias (AP or BP CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]). The results confirm that cross-intolerance with bosutinib in patients with prior TKI intolerance was < 20%.

Bosutinib was approved as a second-line (2L) or third-/ fourth-line (3L/4L) therapy for Ph+ CP, AP, or BP CML following resistance or intolerance to prior TKI therapy based on data from a phase I/II study (clinicaltrials gov identifier: NCT00261846). Bosutinib is also approved as front-line therapy based on results from the phase III BFORE trial. Since TKI share a common mechanism of action, cross-intolerance, i.e. discontinuation of a TKI due to the same adverse event (AE) responsible for discontinuation of a prior TKI, is a frequent concern. Previous reports have suggested this to be modest to minimal for dasatinib or nilotinib after intolerance to prior imatinib therapy.

Study details were published previously. This analysis included all patients who had developed intolerance to prior imatinib, dasatinib, and/or nilotinib, defined as an inability to take the drug(s) due to treatment-related grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting > 7 days, treatment-related grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity, persistent grade 2 toxicity not responding to dose reductions and/or medical management, or loss of previously attained response on a lower TKI dose and an inability to receive a higher dose due to treatment-related toxicity. Patients should have recovered to grade ≤ 1 or to baseline from any toxicities of prior anti-cancer treatment prior to enrollment.

Results

Patient characteristics

Eighty-one patients were enrolled consecutively from 46 institutions between November 2013 and April 2016. Three patients were not included because of ineligibility (Ph − ALL), lack of prerequired central diagnostic test, or inappropriate informed consent. The baseline characteristics of 78 eligible patients are listed in Table 2. Their median age was 44.5 years (range, 16–64), with 25 patients (32.1%) age ≥ 55 years. Major-type BCR - ABL1 transcripts were observed in 22 patients (28.2%). Cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs) were noted in 69 patients (88.5%), and 50 (72.5%) had additional CAs.

Patient characteristics

Patient flow and conditions

Patient flow and conditions are shown in Figure 1. Six patients (7.7%) completed the protocol chemotherapies without undergoing HSCT. Fifty-eight patients (73.4%) underwent HSCT in CR1. Five patients (6.4%) discontinued treatment before HSCT because of hematological relapse (n = 4) or CNS relapse (n = 1). Four patients (5.1%) withdrew from the protocol treatments because of severe toxicities (n = 3) or intolerable toxicities (n = 1). Five patients (6.4%) withdrew because of patient decision (n = 1), physician decision (n = 2), or transfer to nonparticipating institution (n = 2).

### A chemotherapy-free regimen for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: are we there yet? [^113U9Eix]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on data from previous ALL studies, the Food and Drug Admisnsitration has accepted an MRD level of less than 0.01% as a surrogate efficacy endpoint for new drugs in ALL. Surprisingly and disappointingly, in the current trial, four of 11 (36%) patients who achieved CMR with the dasatinib- steroid induction eventually relapsed. Three of these relapses were diagnosed early at a molecular level and therefore never fulfilled the former criteria of relapse. This must raise a red flag and a message regarding the complexity of MRD clinical interpretation should be played out loud. MRD negativity is not synonymous to cure but it is rather its biomarker. No matter how sensitive the available tests are, there is still room for residual disease presence at a level below the threshold of detection. Thus, ultimate degrees of disease eradication for patients who achieve MRD negativity following intensive and less intensive induction may be different. A negative MRD result following intensive induction reflects an even deeper response than the sensitivity cutoff of the test used. This should not be extrapolated to the outcome prediction following less intensive protocols when the actual level of response below the MRD negativity cutoff may be lower (Figure 1). Not only the specific induction protocol but also the characteristics of the patient population should be taken into account. For instance, in Ph-negative ALL, achievement of identical laboratory major molecular response levels following treatment with intensive chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, was shown to predict considerably different relapse-free survival rates for newly diagnosed versus relapsed patients (26.1 vs. 12 months, respectively). Notably, progression-free survival for relapsing patients who achieved MRD negativity with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment was as short as 8.6 months. Thus, in different clinical settings, identical laboratory results may be associated with completely different predicted outcomes.

### BCR-ABL1 mutation development during first-line treatment with dasatinib or imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase [^111uocTG]. Leukemia (2015). Low credibility.

Mutational testing is anticipated to become more widely used to select second-line treatment in the community setting, especially with the approval of ponatinib for treatment of patients with CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. Ponatinib has demonstrated activity against T315I/A in preclinical assays, and patients with the T315I mutation respond well to ponatinib, unlike patients with T315I treated with other BCR-ABL1 inhibitors. In addition, with the introduction of generic imatinib into the market in 2016, choosing the most appropriate second-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for patients, based on factors such as mutation status, will become increasingly important. Allowing physicians the option to choose the most suitable second-line therapy may ensure improved outcomes and decreased health-care costs. More sensitive detection methods (for example, next-generation sequencing) may allow mutations that were not evident through conventional sequencing to be detected following a significant rise in BCR-ABL1 levels; however, further data are needed to determine the clinical relevance of low-level mutations for patient outcomes.,

Mutational testing provides arguably the most important measure for treatment selection in patients with CML, especially when selecting an alternative therapy because of current treatment failure. In patients with less-resistant mutations, other factors, such as patient comorbidities, the potential for cross-intolerance and adherence, should also be considered to ensure patients achieve good long-term outcomes.

### Dasatinib and low-intensity chemotherapy in elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL [^114WLT6q]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Prognosis of Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the elderly has improved during the imatinib era. We investigated dasatinib, another potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients older than age 55 years were included in the European Working Group on Adult ALL (EWALL) study number 01 for Ph(+) ALL (EWALL-PH-01 international study) and were treated with dasatinib 140 mg/day (100 mg/day over 70 years) with intrathecal chemotherapy, vincristine, and dexamethasone during induction. Patients in complete remission continued consolidation with dasatinib, sequentially with cytarabine, asparaginase, and methotrexate for 6 months. Maintenance therapy was dasatinib and vincristine/dexamethasone reinductions for 18 months followed by dasatinib until relapse or death. Seventy-one patients with a median age of 69 years were enrolled; 77% had a high comorbidity score. Complete remission rate was 96% and 65% of patients achieved a 3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during consolidation. Only 7 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At 5 years, overall survival was 36% and up to 45% taking into account deaths unrelated to disease or treatment as competitors. Thirty-six patients relapsed, 24 were tested for mutation by Sanger sequencing, and 75% were T315I-positive. BCR-ABL1(T315I) was tested by allele-specific oligonucleotide reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 43 patients and detection was associated with short-term relapses. Ten patients (23%) were positive before any therapy and 8 relapsed, all with this mutation. In conclusion, dasatinib combined with low-intensity chemotherapy was well-tolerated and gave long-term survival in 36% of elderly patients with Ph(+) ALL. Monitoring of BCR-ABL1(T315I) from diagnosis identified patients with at high risk of early relapse and may help to personalize therapy.

2.4 Dose Escalation in Adults with CML and Ph+ ALL, and Pediatric Patients with CML

For adult patients with CML and Ph+ ALL, consider dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase CML) or 180 mg once daily (advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL) in patients who do not achieve a hematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage. For pediatric patients with CML, consider dose escalation to 120 mg once daily (see Table 2 below). Dose escalation is not recommended for pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, where PHYRAGO is administered in combination with chemotherapy.

Escalate the PHYRAGO dose as shown in Table 2 in pediatric patients with chronic phase CML who do not achieve a hematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage.

2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

Myelosuppression

In clinical studies, myelosuppression was managed by dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of study therapy. Hematopoietic growth factor has been used in patients with resistant myelosuppression. Guidelines for dose modifications for adult and pediatric patients are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

For pediatric patients with chronic phase CML, if Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia recurs during complete hematologic response (CHR), interrupt PHYRAGO and resume at a reduced dose. Implement temporary dose reductions for intermediate degrees of cytopenia and disease response as needed.

For pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, if neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia result in a delay of the next block of treatment by more than 14 days, interrupt PHYRAGO and resume at the same dose level once the next block of treatment is started. If neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia persist and the next block of treatment is delayed another 7 days, perform a bone marrow assessment to assess cellularity and percentage of blasts. If marrow cellularity is < 10%, interrupt treatment with PHYRAGO until ANC > 500/μL (0.5 × 10⁹/L), at which time treatment may be resumed at full dose. If marrow cellularity is > 10%, resumption of treatment with PHYRAGO may be considered.

### Low incidence of peripheral arterial disease in patients receiving dasatinib in clinical trials [^114DoG6f]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

The oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) dasatinib, imatinib, ponatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib each target BCR-ABL, yet are structurally distinct from one another. The selection of BCR-ABL TKI treatment for an individual patient is influenced by factors including any previous treatment, likelihood of benefit, risk of toxicities and the potential for end-organ damage resulting from use, particularly as a long-term therapy is expected in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). Despite considerable overlap of safety profiles, there are distinct drug-specific adverse events associated with each TKI.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often associated with claudication, and may result in critical limb ischemia, and increased risks of loss of limb or death. We evaluated safety databases of dasatinib clinical trials in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemias to identify PAD or PAD-related events. We also conducted a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) analysis to evaluate the rate of PAD or PAD-related events in the trials relative to the rate in external reference populations derived from administrative data sets, representing a general adult population in the United States and a CML population that did not receive dasatinib. This retrospective analysis used pooled safety data from 2712 adults with CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with dasatinib in 11 clinical trials, including two first-line trials (n = 324) and nine trials in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients (n = 2388; Supplementary Table S1). The median duration of dasatinib treatment was 19 months (range: 0.03–93 months). The trial enrollment criteria permitted inclusion of patients with myocardial infarction > 6 months prior, congestive heart failure > 3 months prior and previously uncontrolled angina controlled ⩾3 months.

### Pleural effusions due to dasatinib [^1133xEkk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dasatinib is a novel tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of BCR-ABL positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after imatinib failure. Use of dasatinib is frequently complicated by pleural effusions. This review highlights the risk factors for development of effusions as well as characteristics of the pleural fluid. Potential mechanisms involved and a set of management recommendations based on available evidence are also discussed.

Recent Findings

The incidence of dasatinib-associated pleural effusions is approximately 20%. A twice-daily dosing regimen was found to significantly correlate with development of effusions, and therefore once-daily dosing is now approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dasatinib-associated pleural effusions are generally lymphocyte-predominant exudates. The mechanism of occurrence is unknown but may involve an immune-mediated pathway or off-target inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide. Management typically involves dose interruption or reduction, diuretics and short-term corticosteroid therapy.

Summary

Dasatinib is a promising agent for the treatment of refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its use can be complicated by development of exudative pleural effusions of unclear etiology. Incidence is decreasing with once-daily dosing, but when effusions do occur, most can be managed with specific measures without necessitating discontinuation of therapy.

### Optimal approach to treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia: how to best use all the available tools [^112Y9ez5]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of adult and 50% of elderly patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express the t(9;22) chromosome translocation with BCR-ABL rearrangement. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has resulted in higher rates of complete remission (95–100%), and many fit patients are able to receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). TKI-containing induction followed by myeloablative allogeneic HSCT has resulted in long-term survival between 50 and 60% in young adults, and recent reports show promising results in patients submitted to non-myeloablative HSCT. The prognosis of elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL is poor despite a high complete remission (CR) rate with TKIs and minimal chemotherapy, and improvements are clearly needed in this subgroup of patients. This review summarizes and discusses current challenges in the treatment of patients with Ph+ ALL, such as selection of the appropriate induction therapy, minimization of transplant toxicity, correct use of TKIs after transplant, BCR-ABL monitoring, the study of mutations which confer resistance to TKIs and new drugs to overcome this resistance.

2.5 Dose Adjustment for Adverse Reactions

Myelosuppression

In clinical studies, myelosuppression was managed by dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of study therapy. Hematopoietic growth factor has been used in patients with resistant myelosuppression. Guidelines for dose modifications for adult and pediatric patients are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

For pediatric patients with chronic phase CML, if Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia recurs during complete hematologic response (CHR), interrupt SPRYCEL and resume at a reduced dose. Implement temporary dose reductions for intermediate degrees of cytopenia and disease response as needed.

For pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, if neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia result in a delay of the next block of treatment by more than 14 days, interrupt SPRYCEL and resume at the same dose level once the next block of treatment is started. If neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia persist and the next block of treatment is delayed another 7 days, perform a bone marrow assessment to assess cellularity and percentage of blasts. If marrow cellularity is < 10%, interrupt treatment with SPRYCEL until ANC > 500/μL (0.5 × 10⁹/L), at which time treatment may be resumed at full dose. If marrow cellularity is > 10%, resumption of treatment with SPRYCEL may be considered.

Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions

For adults with Ph+ CML and ALL, and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML, if a severe non-hematologic adverse reaction develops with SPRYCEL use, treatment must be withheld until the adverse reaction has resolved or improved. Thereafter, treatment can be resumed as appropriate at a reduced dose depending on the severity and recurrence [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

For pediatric patients with Ph+ ALL, interrupt treatment for cases of grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic adverse reactions with the exception of liver function test abnormalities, and resume at a reduced dose when resolved to grade ≤ 1. For elevated direct bilirubin over 5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), interrupt treatment until improvement to baseline or grade ≤ 1. For elevated AST/ALT over 15 times the institutional ULN, interrupt treatment until improvement to baseline or grade < 1. For recurrent liver function test abnormalities as above, reduce the dose if this adverse reaction recurs after reinitiation of SPRYCEL. Dose reduction recommendations are described in Table 5.

### Randomized phase-II evaluation of letrozole plus dasatinib in hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients [^114TMg9V]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Src is a pleiotropic, membrane-associated, non-receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, as well as the development of resistance to therapy. – In vitro studies have shown that Src interacts with a variety of signaling molecules including growth factor receptors, integrins, and steroid hormone receptors. – In breast cancer cells, membrane-associated estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) has been shown to complex with Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to drive growth and endocrine therapy resistance. – Levels of ERα and Src are inversely correlated in primary breast cancers, and Src has been shown to increase the proteolytic degradation of Erα. Combining Src inhibitors with endocrine agents can reduce the emergence of acquired endocrine resistance in preclinical studies. Further, in a phase-II clinical study of the Src inhibitor bosutinib as monotherapy in 73 patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC), all four responses occurred in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease. Finally, Src is involved in the regulation of osteoclast-mediated bone turnover, and has been implicated in the survival and outgrowth of breast cancer cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.

Dasatinib is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with specificity for a number of related kinases including BCR-ABL, Src, c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and TEC family kinases. Dasatinib has been approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, as well as Ph + CML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) resistant to or intolerant of prior imatinib. In preclinical models of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, dasatinib alone or in combination with tamoxifen or letrozole inhibited tumor growth. In a phase-II clinical trial, dasatinib monotherapy (100 mg or 70 mg BID) produced 2 confirmed partial responses (PRs) and 6 disease stabilizations ≥ 16 weeks in 45 evaluable patients with advanced, pretreated HR-positive breast cancer. Adverse events were similar to those observed in CML, including fatigue, diarrhea, headache, nausea, and pleural effusion. Dasatinib has also demonstrated bone anabolic and anti-resorptive effects in preclinical systems.

### Ponatinib efficacy and safety in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia: final 5-year results of the phase 2 PACE trial [^114Cm2mk]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Ponatinib has potent activity against native and mutant BCR-ABL1, including BCR-ABL1 T315I The pivotal phase 2 Ponatinib Ph + ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial evaluated efficacy and safety of ponatinib at a starting dose of 45 mg once daily in 449 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) resistant/intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, or with BCR-ABL1 T315I This analysis focuses on chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) patients (n = 270) with 56.8-month median follow-up. Among 267 evaluable patients, 60%, 40%, and 24% achieved major cytogenetic response (MCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and 4.5-log molecular response, respectively. The probability of maintaining MCyR for 5 years was 82% among responders. Dose reductions were implemented in October 2013 to decrease the risk of arterial occlusive events (AOEs); ≥ 90% of CP-CML patients who had achieved MCyR or MMR maintained response 40 months after elective dose reductions. Estimated 5-year overall survival was 73%. In CP-CML patients, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were rash (47%), abdominal pain (46%), thrombocytopenia (46%), headache (43%), dry skin (42%), and constipation (41%). The cumulative incidence of AOEs in CP-CML patients increased over time to 31%, while the exposure-adjusted incidence of new AOEs (15.8 and 4.9 per 100 patient-years in years 1 and 5, respectively) did not increase over time. These final PACE results demonstrate ponatinib provides durable and clinically meaningful responses, irrespective of dose reductions, in this population of heavily pretreated CP-CML patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01207440.

### Ponatinib-review of historical development, current status, and future research [^116AWYgM]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ponatinib is a third-generation BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with high potency against Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias, including T315I-mutated disease, which is resistant to first- and second-generation TKIs. Ponatinib was approved for T315I-mutated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), CML resistant/intolerant to ≥ 2 prior TKIs, advanced phase CML and Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) where no other TKIs are indicated, and T315I-mutated CML and Ph-positive ALL. The response-based dosing of ponatinib in chronic phase CML (CP-CML) improved treatment tolerance and reduced the risk of toxicities, including cardiovascular risks. Ponatinib-based therapy also resulted in significantly better outcomes in frontline Ph-positive ALL compared with prior TKIs and is becoming a new standard of care in this setting. As the clinical development of third-generation TKIs and their rational combinations progresses, we envision further transformative changes in the treatment of CML and Ph-positive ALL.

### Dasatinib and nilotinib in imatinib-resistant Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia: a' head-to-head comparison' [^115UqPNy]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Imatinib has revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, some patients may experience resistance or intolerance to imatinib over time. For these patients, two excellent therapeutic options are available. Dasatinib, approved in 2006 for the treatment of patients with CML in all phases who experience imatinib resistance or intolerance, has displayed significant efficacy, with a 2-year follow-up showing durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Nilotinib was approved in 2007 for the treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase or CML in accelerated phase, resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib, based on strong efficacy as well as a favorable safety profile. Several factors, including mutation status, patient history, and existing comorbidities can impact the decision to use dasatinib or nilotinib, or pursue other options such as allogeneic stem cell transplant. The purpose of this review article is to shed light on a further consideration when deciding which agent to use, based on the efficacy and safety of dasatinib and nilotinib. This consideration involves the differences in both the imatinib-resistant and -intolerant patients enrolled in the pivotal studies for each agent, as well as other trial criteria.
