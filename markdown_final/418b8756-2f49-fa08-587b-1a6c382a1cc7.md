## Question

How would you differentiate Lambert Eaton syndrome from myasthenia gravis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) from myasthenia gravis (MG). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology to anchor pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify the clinical phenotype and distribution of weakness. Next, I will review bedside examination clues, especially reflexes and autonomic features. After that, I need to check the electrodiagnostic patterns, including decrement, increment, and optimal cutoffs. Then, I will examine serologic testing and its limitations. I should also consider special entities like overlap syndromes and paraneoplastic associations. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and exceptions that could mislead us, ensuring each step is supported by data and citations.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation because it drives the clinical-electrophysiologic signature. MG is typically postsynaptic with autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor or MuSK, reducing endplate potential amplitude and causing fatigable weakness, whereas LEMS is presynaptic with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies that impair quantal acetylcholine release, producing weakness that often improves transiently with activity and is frequently paraneoplastic, most often with small-cell lung cancer [^87809f85] [^707c4031] [^68726894].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotype before jumping to tests. MG classically begins cranially with ocular and bulbar symptoms and evolves caudally, and at onset extraocular involvement is common, whereas LEMS typically starts with proximal leg weakness and spares the eyes early, with bulbar symptoms less frequent at onset. Importantly, if the first symptom is ocular weakness, LEMS is essentially excluded, and if limb weakness is confined to the arms, that favors MG rather than LEMS [^40787a94]. Hold on, I should double-check the caveat: some LEMS series do report oculobulbar features, so I must not overstate this as an absolute discriminator, but the pattern still strongly favors MG when ocular symptoms are the initial manifestation [^8e3bec02] [^40787a94].

> I will now examine the bedside findings that sharpen the distinction. In MG, deep tendon reflexes are generally preserved despite fatigable weakness, whereas in LEMS, reflexes are diminished or absent and may transiently normalize after brief exercise, so-called post-exercise facilitation. Autonomic symptoms such as dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and orthostatic intolerance are common in LEMS and uncommon in MG, which can be a pivotal clue when present [^26d05de1] [^68726894] [^d2aa92b8]. Let me reconsider whether MG ever lacks reflexes; in severe generalized MG, reflexes may appear reduced, but the combination of low CMAPs with increment and autonomic features should steer me back to LEMS rather than MG [^notfound].

> Next, I should review electrodiagnostics, since this is where the rubber meets the road. In MG, low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation produces a decrement of at least 10% in compound muscle action potential amplitude, reflecting impaired safety factor at the postsynaptic membrane. In LEMS, low-frequency RNS shows a decrement, but the hallmark is a post-exercise or high-frequency increment of CMAP amplitude, historically defined as greater than 100%, which is highly specific but insensitive [^1b7e1048]. Hold on, I should verify the modern threshold: multiple studies show that lowering the increment cutoff to 60% markedly improves sensitivity while maintaining high specificity, so I should use 60% as the operational threshold in clinical practice [^db07113b] [^fefce7e2] [^48af0d39]. I need to ensure technical rigor: allow adequate recovery time between tests to avoid carryover facilitation, typically about 150 seconds after a 10-second exercise, to avoid false increments [^4aa9d528].

> Let me think about serology and its limitations. Anti–P/Q-type VGCC antibodies are present in roughly 85–90% of LEMS and are highly specific when correlated with the clinical picture, but I should confirm that VGCC positivity alone without supportive clinical-electrophysiologic features is insufficient, as low-specificity positivity can occur in other contexts. Thus, serology supports but does not replace electrodiagnostics in LEMS [^68726894] [^cce2b380]. In MG, AChR antibodies are detected in most generalized cases, and MuSK antibodies account for a subset, particularly with bulbar-predominant disease; seronegativity does not exclude MG, so electrophysiology remains essential when antibodies are negative [^87809f85] [^58027a73].

> But wait, what if both MG and LEMS coexist. Overlap syndrome (MLOS) is increasingly recognized, with patients meeting diagnostic criteria for both diseases and demonstrating both decrement and increment on RNS, as well as dual antibody positivity in some cases. I should keep a high index of suspicion when the phenotype straddles both entities or when the response to therapy is atypical for a single disorder [^20fd642b] [^e8abb3c7]. I should double-check that the electrophysiologic protocol includes testing for increment even when MG is suspected, because missing LEMS in this context delays appropriate symptomatic therapy and cancer screening [^699857a6].

> I need to ensure I address the paraneoplastic dimension because it changes urgency and management. Approximately 50–60% of LEMS is paraneoplastic, most often due to small-cell lung cancer, and LEMS can precede tumor diagnosis by months to years. Therefore, newly diagnosed LEMS warrants age-appropriate cancer screening with CT of the chest and abdomen, and consideration of FDG-PET/CT if initial studies are unrevealing but suspicion remains high [^68726894] [^879b6574]. Hold on, I should verify that tumor treatment itself can improve neurologic status in paraneoplastic LEMS, reinforcing the need for timely oncologic evaluation and management [^879b6574].

> Let me integrate a practical diagnostic algorithm and sanity-check each step. Start with history and exam to characterize the distribution of weakness, presence of ocular or bulbar features, reflex status, and autonomic symptoms. If ocular symptoms are the initial manifestation, MG is far more likely and LEMS is essentially excluded, so prioritize AChR/MuSK testing and RNS decrement testing in that scenario [^40787a94]. If proximal leg weakness predominates with hyporeflexia and autonomic features, proceed to RNS with pre- and post-exercise CMAPs, using a 60% increment threshold to maximize sensitivity, and add VGCC antibody testing to support the diagnosis and guide malignancy screening [^db07113b] [^68726894]. If the phenotype is mixed or the response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is suboptimal, consider overlap and perform both decrement and increment testing, and broaden antibody panels accordingly [^20fd642b].

> I should confirm key pitfalls and exceptions so I do not overgeneralize. Although LEMS classically spares the eyes early, oculobulbar features can occur and may mislead clinicians toward MG, so I must correlate with reflexes, CMAP amplitudes, and increment testing rather than relying on cranial involvement alone to exclude LEMS [^8e3bec02]. Conversely, MG can rarely present with hyporeflexia in severe generalized disease, but the absence of increment and autonomic features helps distinguish it from LEMS. Finally, remember that botulism and certain toxic or metabolic neuromuscular junction disorders can mimic these patterns, so exposure history and temporal evolution must be scrutinized before concluding autoimmune NMJ disease [^f63e3ef6].

> In summary, I need to ensure my diagnostic weighting reflects the data: ocular onset strongly favors MG, proximal leg weakness with hyporeflexia and autonomic symptoms favors LEMS, decrement on low-frequency RNS supports MG, and a 60% or greater increment in CMAP after brief exercise supports LEMS, with VGCC antibodies providing strong confirmatory evidence when positive in the right clinical context. Keeping overlap and paraneoplastic associations in mind prevents delays in diagnosis and treatment, including cancer screening and disease-specific symptomatic therapy such as amifampridine for LEMS when indicated [^40787a94] [^db07113b] [^68726894] [^71743fe5].

MG and LEMS are both autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders, but they differ in **pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnostic tests**. MG is **postsynaptic** with AChR or MuSK antibodies, causing fluctuating weakness that worsens with repeated use and improves with rest, and shows a decrement on RNS [^87809f85] [^1b7e1048]. LEMS is **presynaptic** with VGCC antibodies, causing proximal leg weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic symptoms; strength briefly improves after exercise, and RNS shows a decrement with a compensatory increment > 60% after brief exercise [^db07113b] [^68726894]. Key bedside clues: MG has preserved reflexes and ocular/bulbar involvement; LEMS has reduced reflexes and autonomic features. Serology and RNS distinguish them, and LEMS requires cancer screening for SCLC [^879b6574].

| **Feature** | **Myasthenia gravis (mg)** | **Lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome (lems)** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | Postsynaptic AChR or MuSK antibodies reduce endplate potential [^87809f85] | Presynaptic VGCC antibodies reduce ACh release [^707c4031] |
| Clinical weakness | Fluctuating, fatigable; ocular/bulbar common; reflexes preserved [^40787a94] | Proximal legs > arms; hyporeflexia; autonomic symptoms [^68726894] |
| Exercise effect | Weakness worsens with repeated use | Strength briefly improves after exercise [^notfound] |
| RNS | Decrement at 2–5 Hz [^1b7e1048] | Decrement at 2–5 Hz; increment > 60% after 10–30 s exercise [^db07113b] |
| Serology | AChR or MuSK antibodies [^87809f85] | P/Q-type VGCC antibodies [^68726894] |
| Associated disease | Thymoma in ~15% [^notfound] | SCLC in ~50–60% [^68726894] |
| Treatment | Cholinesterase inhibitors, immunotherapy [^e6be7eca] | 3,4-DAP, immunotherapy, cancer treatment [^bb758596] [^879b6574] |

---

In practice, **MG is more likely with ocular/bulbar symptoms and preserved reflexes**, whereas **LEMS is suggested by proximal leg weakness, hyporeflexia, and autonomic features**; confirm with RNS and serology, and screen for SCLC in LEMS [^87809f85] [^879b6574].

Many recent strides have increased our understanding of the immune-mediated diseases of neuromuscular junction transmission. Nevertheless, patients with myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome often present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to clinicians. Both conditions have a wide range of clinical presentations and the number of treatment modalities available to these patients continues to increase. This creates a need for an individualized approach for managing these patients. Other important controversies exist because the benefits of some treatments are not firmly established by clinical trials. After a brief review of the pertinent scientific basis of these diseases, we focus on present issues governing the clinical evaluation and management of myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Background

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is an autoimmune presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Treatments attempt to overcome the harmful autoimmune process, or to improve residual neuromuscular transmission, in order to reverse muscle weakness.

Objectives

The objective was to examine the efficacy of treatment in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group trials register (December 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004) and EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2004), and checked bibliographies and contacted authors to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of adults and children with a diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, with or without small-cell lung cancer, receiving any form of pharmacological or physical treatment. The primary outcome measure was change in muscle strength scale score (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score), or limb muscle strength measured by myometry. The secondary outcome measure was improvement in the mean amplitude of the resting compound muscle action potentials. The mean amplitude used was the mean of all muscles tested.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified three randomised controlled trials.

Main Results

Two controlled trials of the effects of 3,4-diaminopyridine compared with placebo in a total of 38 patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome were eligible, one of which was of crossover design. A third crossover trial compared intravenous immunoglobulin treatment to placebo in nine patients. Two trials of 3,4-diaminopyridine reported a significant improvement in muscle strength score, or myometric limb measurement following treatment, and a significant improvement in resting compound muscle action potential amplitude following 3,4-diaminopyridine, compared with placebo.A meta-analysis of the primary endpoint results was not possible because of marked differences in primary outcome measures. However, a meta-analysis of the secondary endpoint was possible. The overall weighted mean difference was 1.80 mV (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.78), favouring treatment.A crossover trial reported a significant improvement in myometric limb strength and a non-significant improvement in change in the mean resting compound muscle action potential amplitude when patients received intravenous immunoglobulin compared to placebo infusions. Clinical improvement lasted for up to eight weeks.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence from randomised controlled trials showed that either 3,4-diaminopyridine or intravenous immunoglobulin improved muscle strength scores and compound muscle action potential amplitudes in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. There are insufficient data at present to quantify this treatment effect. Other possible treatments have not been tested in randomised controlled trials.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a type of paraneoplastic syndrome that may initially manifest with weakness and gait abnormalities. These symptoms may precede the diagnosis of malignancy by months or years, and morbidity and mortality may be significantly affected by early detection of the malignancy. A case report and review of the diagnosis, management, and treatment of these syndromes are presented, with particular emphasis on the rehabilitation management of these patients, often overlooked in medical treatment.

COVID-19 management in myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)—The MG expert panel suggests that therapy decisions should be individualized and made collaboratively between the person with MG and his/her healthcare provider. No data currently exist on how COVID-19 affects people with MG/LEMS or patients with other diseases on immunosuppressive therapies, and peer reviewed published literature regarding COVID-19 in MG or in immunocompromised patients to date is lacking. Because most patients with MG are on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies and may also have respiratory muscle weakness, there is a theoretical concern that MG/LEMS patients may be at higher risk of contracting the infection or experiencing severe manifestations of COVID-19. The report also notes that there are no known proven treatments for treating this virus and no vaccine to prevent the infection at this time.

### Myasthenia and the neuromuscular junction [^58027a73]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Myasthenic syndromes are distinct disorders at the neuromuscular junction, most often with well characterized autoimmune or genetic pathology. New aspects of the dysfunctions give insight into the normal neuromuscular function in addition to giving therapeutic clues and tailoring the therapy to the pathophysiology in individual patients.

Recent Findings

Patients with myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndromes should be further classified into distinct subgroups. Myasthenia gravis with low-affinity acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and myasthenia gravis with antibodies to the postsynaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 represent new groups, whereas a myasthenia gravis subgroup without any detectable antibodies still persists. Myasthenia gravis with antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is, due to new reports, now as established as AChR-myasthenia gravis regarding disease mechanisms and recommended therapy.

Summary

Myasthenic syndromes and myasthenia gravis are well characterized disorders. The prognosis is generally good, apart from paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. However, patients need long-term symptomatic and immunoactive treatment, this treatment to be balanced against present and potential side effects. New and more selective treatment is needed, especially for severe generalized disease. Well controlled long-term studies of sufficient power are much wanted, but new therapy has often to be tried in patients before high-class evidence of effect on myasthenia gravis has been published.

### Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^d2aa92b8]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission in which an autoantibody is directed against the pre-synaptic calcium channel. It presents with proximal limb weakness, greater in the legs, with or without peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. Bulbar involvement is rare and fatigueability is not a feature.

Management when MG/LEMS patients have already contracted COVID‑19—continue usual care in mild disease; adjust for severe illness. Most patients have mild disease and should continue the current best practice standard of care for MG/LEMS. Corticosteroid doses might need to be increased per standard infection/stress protocols. If symptoms are severe with hospitalization, it may be necessary to consider pausing current immunosuppression temporarily, especially with concurrent infections or sepsis, and immune depleting agents should not be given under such conditions.

### Myasthenia gravis Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome [^20fd642b]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

To assess whether a myasthenia gravis (MG) Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome (MLOS) exists.

Methods

Case reports that met the universally accepted diagnostic criteria for MG and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) were sought through a PubMed search. Fifty-five possible cases of MLOS were identified.

Results

Thirty-nine cases met the diagnostic criteria for MG and LEMS. Analysis of clinical features showed that these patients have common MG and LEMS symptoms: oculo-bulbar paresis and good response to anti-cholinesterase for MG and limb weakness and decreased or absent reflexes for LEMS. All had the classical LEMS pattern in the repetitive nerve stimulation test: low compound muscle action potential amplitude and incremental response > 60% with brief exercise or at high rate of stimulation. Eight patients had combined positive acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR-ab) or muscle-specific kinase-ab and voltage-gated calcium channel- ab tests.

Conclusions

A myasthenia gravis Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome (MLOS) does exist.

Patients on existing therapies for MG/LEMS—continue maintenance treatment, do not stop symptomatic agents, and practice enhanced distancing. MG/LEMS patients should continue their current treatment and are advised not to stop any existing medications unless specifically discussed and approved by their healthcare provider. Symptomatic therapies should not be discontinued unless there are other clinical reasons to do so. For patients already on immunosuppressive medications, it is recommended to practice extra‑vigilant social distancing and use alternatives to face‑to‑face consultations when clinically appropriate. When altering or stopping immunosuppressive therapy, patients and providers should consider specific risks and benefits, including age, comorbid health conditions, and location.

### Nationwide survey of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in Japan [^68726894]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease that targets the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the motor neuron terminal of the neuromuscular junction.The classical triad is proximal muscle weakness, decreased tendon reflexes and autonomic dysfunction.In addition, about 10% of patients show cerebellar signs almost exclusively related to small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC).Historically, Drs Lambert and Eaton described patients having malignant tumours with unique electrophysiological findings.Myasthenia gravis (MG) also represents proximal muscle weakness; however, the targets of autoimmunity are molecules on the postsynaptic membrane.Electrophysiological testing is used to discriminate LEMS from MG.The anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody is a diagnostic biomarker for LEMS and is positive in almost 90% of patients.Moreover, animal experiments found that patients’ IgG was pathogenic to mice’s skeletal muscle.Notably, SCLC is associated with LEMS with a frequency of 60%.

An epidemiological study is a fundamental approach to understanding the aetiology of rare diseases. It also contributes to establishing healthcare policies for rare diseases of unknown aetiology. However, no nationwide survey has been performed for LEMS in Japan. Thus, we conducted a national study following a standard epidemiological protocolto estimate Japanese LEMS prevalence and clinical features.

### Difference in distribution of muscle weakness between myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^40787a94]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) may have a similar distribution of muscle weakness. Deciding on a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis or LEMS on clinical grounds may therefore be difficult.

Objective

To compare the localisation of initial muscle weakness and the distribution of weakness at the time of maximum severity in patients with myasthenia gravis and LEMS.

Subjects

101 patients with myasthenia gravis and 38 patients with LEMS.

Results

In myasthenia gravis, initial weakness involved extraocular muscles in 59%, bulbar muscles in 29%, and limb muscles in 12% of the patients. In LEMS no patient had ocular weakness, 5% had bulbar weakness, and 95% had weakness of the limbs as the first symptom (p < 0.001). At the point of maximum severity, weakness in myasthenia gravis was purely ocular in 25%, oculobulbar in 5%, restricted to the limbs in 2%, and present in both oculobulbar muscles and limbs in 68%. At this point, none of the LEMS patients had weakness restricted to extraocular or bulbar muscles (p = 0.002). The legs were affected in all LEMS patients, whereas in 12 patients with generalised myasthenia gravis limb weakness was restricted to the arms (p = 0.024).

Conclusions

In a patient suspected to have a myasthenic syndrome whose first symptom is ocular weakness, LEMS is virtually excluded. Limb weakness confined to the arms is only found in generalised myasthenia gravis and not in LEMS. Muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis tends to develop in a craniocaudal direction, and in the opposite direction in LEMS.

Starting immune therapy in MG/LEMS during COVID‑19—risk–benefit discussion and possible delay. Before initiating B‑cell depleting therapy such as rituximab, healthcare providers should consider the risks of worsening myasthenia or crisis and of contracting the viral infection. It may be advisable to delay initiation of cell depleting therapies until the regional peak of the outbreak is over. However, in occasional patients the risk of not starting therapy may outweigh the risk of severe COVID‑19 infection and this must be discussed with the patient in detail.

### Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: a diagnostic challenge [^f2290b80]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare neuromuscular junction disorder. Underlying small cell lung cancer is found in more than half of patients. Proximal muscle weakness, autonomic features and areflexia are typical manifestations. However, LEMS is often misdiagnosed. We report a rare case of paraneoplastic LEMS, identified amid admission due to a different diagnosis. Our patient was initially admitted due to aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation revealed clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of LEMS. High clinical suspicion and early diagnostic workup were paramount in the patient outcome. Nevertheless, paraneoplastic aetiology was difficult to confirm and revealed itself a difficult challenge. Clinical awareness is crucial to diagnose LEMS and urge cancer screening and early treatment.

### Epidemiology, diagnostics, and biomarkers of autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders [^87809f85]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders are rare. However, myasthenia gravis is being increasingly recognised in people older than 50 years. In the past 5-10 years, epidemiological studies worldwide suggest an incidence of acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis of up to 29 cases per 1 million people per year. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are about 20 times less common. Several diagnostic methods are available for autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders, including serological antibody, electrophysiological, imaging, and pharmacological tests. The course of disease can be followed up with internationally accepted clinical scores or patient-reported outcome measures. For prognostic purposes, determining whether the disease is paraneoplastic is of great importance, as myasthenia gravis can be associated with thymoma and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with small-cell lung cancer. However, despite well defined diagnostic parameters to classify patients into subgroups, objective biomarkers for use in the clinic or in clinical trials to predict the course of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are needed.

### The use of rituximab in myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^d533ab64]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the treatment effects of rituximab in a population of patients with myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Methods

Data on all treated patients in the UK were collected from referring physicians, with full case ascertainment and follow-up.

Results

Since 2004, 10 patients with generalised myasthenia gravis (three of whom were positive for muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies) and two patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) were treated with rituximab. Using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation America postintervention status, three patients (25%) achieved remission, and a further five (42%) improved clinically over an 18-month period. Only one patient developed worsening symptoms. The probability of achieving remission was unrelated to the duration of neurological symptoms prior to treatment. All LEMS and MuSK antibody patients improved following rituximab treatment.

Conclusion

In a relatively large, unselected group of patients with myasthenia gravis and LEMS, rituximab treatment resulted in a significant clinical improvement in two-thirds of cases. As a selective, B cell targeted therapy, rituximab should be considered as a treatment option for patients with either myasthenia gravis or LEMS for whom standard immunosuppressive treatments have been unsuccessful.

Question 1: what is the differential diagnosis?

This 38-year-old woman likely has a myopathy given the symmetrical pattern of proximal weakness involving legs and arms. The differential diagnosis includes an acquired (e.g. inflammatory or toxic myopathy) or genetic (e.g. muscular dystrophy, late-onset congenital myopathy or metabolic myopathy) myopathic disorder. A neuromuscular junction disorder needs to be considered although the absence of ocular symptoms (which occurs in 90% of patients with myasthenia) and lack of fluctuating symptoms would be atypical for myasthenia gravis, and the lack of autonomic symptoms and intact patella reflexes would be atypical for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. A motor neurone disease such as spinal muscular atrophy type III is unlikely since muscle weakness typically progresses more slowly than in this case.

### Lowering the cutoff value for increment increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^48af0d39]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and increment testing are the most important electrophysiological tests to diagnose Lambert‐Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). 1, 2 Typical findings include a triad of low compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude at rest, decrement upon low‐frequency repetitive nerve stimulation and an increase or “increment” of the CMAP amplitude after 10–30 s of exercise or upon high‐rate stimulation. 2, 3 Historically, 100% increment of this CMAP amplitude has been used as a cutoff for diagnosis of LEMS. 2, 3 Although highly specific, sensitivity using this threshold is limited, dependent on the number of muscles tested. 4, 5, 6 Because making a diagnosis can be challenging, an optimal cutoff value for abnormal increment is highly relevant for improved recognition of this rare disease.

One study reported a 60% cutoff threshold for abnormal increment to increase sensitivity of this test, while maintaining specificity when compared with myasthenia gravis (MG). 4 However, since its publication, several studies have still variably used either a 60% 3, 7 or 100% 8, 9, 10 cutoff in diagnostic criteria. We, therefore, compared diagnostic characteristics of 60% and 100% increment thresholds in the diagnosis of LEMS in a second, independent cohort of patients.

### Treatment of concomitant myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with autologous CD19-targeted CAR T cells [^704662ad]. Neuron (2024). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) are autoimmune disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission. Their combined occurrence is rare, and treatment remains challenging. Two women diagnosed with concomitant MG/LEMS experienced severe, increasing disease activity despite multiple immunotherapies. Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown promise for treating autoimmune diseases. This report details the safe application of anti-CD19 CAR T cells for treating concomitant MG/LEMS. After CAR T cell therapy, both patients experienced rapid clinical recovery and regained full mobility. Deep B cell depletion and normalization of acetylcholine receptor and voltage-gated calcium channel N-type autoantibody levels paralleled major neurological responses. Within 2 months, both patients returned to everyday life, from wheelchair dependency to bicycling and mountain hiking, and remain stable at 6 and 4 months post-CAR T cell infusion, respectively. This report highlights the potential for anti-CD19 CAR T cells to achieve profound clinical effects in the treatment of neuroimmunological diseases.

### Lowering the cutoff value for increment increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^db07113b]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Increment of compound muscle action potential amplitude is a diagnostic hallmark of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Making a diagnosis can be challenging, therefore, a proper cutoff for abnormal increment is highly relevant for improved recognition of this rare disease.

Methods

We determined the sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 100% cutoff values in all consecutive patients who underwent increment testing in our hospital from 1999 to 2016.

Results

We included 156 patients, 63 with LEMS and 93 without LEMS. Sensitivity of a 60% cutoff for increment testing was 77.8% (95% confidence interval 65.5%-87.3%) and 58.7% (45.6%-71.0%) for 100%. Specificity was 98.9% (94.2%-100%) and 100% (96.1%-100%) using a threshold of 60% and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

Lowering the cutoff value for abnormal increment to 60% greatly increases sensitivity to diagnose LEMS without an overt loss in specificity.

### Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: from clinical characteristics to therapeutic strategies [^707c4031]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease that has served as a model for autoimmunity and tumour immunology. In LEMS, the characteristic muscle weakness is thought to be caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) present on the presynaptic nerve terminal. Half of patients with LEMS have an associated tumour, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), which also expresses functional VGCC. Knowledge of this association led to the discovery of a wide range of paraneoplastic and non-tumour-related neurological disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Detailed clinical studies have improved our diagnostic skills and knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms and association of LEMS with SCLC, and have helped with the development of a protocol for early tumour detection.

### Postexercise reflex facilitation in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^26d05de1]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 62-year-old woman had 6 months of proximal weakness, fatigue and occasional diplopia, symptoms normally suggesting myasthenia gravis or inflammatory myopathy. Postexercise reflex facilitation is a bedside clinical sign that points to a diagnosis of the rarer alternative, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). We confirmed this diagnosis using electrodiagnostic short exercise testing and serum assay for voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. Further investigation identified a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder, not previously associated with LEMS. Postexercise reflex facilitation is an important bedside clinical finding that helps clinicians to distinguish LEMS from its mimics.

In about 40% of patients LEMS is not a paraneoplastic phenomenon (NT-LEMS). Several clinical aspects important to these patients remain open, especially the question when a LEMS can definitely be diagnosed as NT-LEMS. Here we describe a series of 25 German NT-LEMS patients regarding their clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, value of serological markers, paraneoplastic antibodies and FDG-PET/CT. Furthermore, we discuss the current diagnostic criteria of NT-LEMS.

Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange in MG/LEMS during COVID‑19—evidence and use. There is currently no evidence to suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin or therapeutic plasma exchange carry additional risk of contracting COVID‑19. The use of IVIG has to be based on individual patient need and indiscriminate use should be avoided, and in general PLEX and IVIG should be reserved for acute exacerbations; some patients on maintenance therapy should continue with extra precautions related to travel. Targeted C5‑complement inhibition with eculizumab has no current evidence of increasing susceptibility to COVID‑19 infection or affecting its outcome.

### IVIg in myasthenia gravis, lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome and inflammatory myopathies: current status [^e2915a9c]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an effective tool for the treatment of diseases with immune pathogenesis. This article reviews the current knowledge of the benefits of treating with IVIg patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Myasthenia gravis: Treatment of MG with IVIg was reported to be beneficial in a number of case series and two randomised controlled trials, in which efficacy was measured by clinical improvement using myasthenic muscle score and decrease in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AchRAb). According to the results, IVIg could be recommended for crisis and severe exacerbation. In many other clinical conditions, such as response to treatment of mild or moderate exacerbation, changes in steroid dosage and before thymectomy, IVIg has also been reported to be helpful, but no controlled trials to confirm its efficacy have been performed. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: A placebo-controlled crossover study reported a significant clinical improvement in the amplitude of the resting CMAP following IVIg treatment. Further experience from case reports also indicates that IVIg is useful in patients with LEMS, both as a short- and long-term treatment, especially when immunosuppressive drugs are not fully effective. Inflammatory myopathies/dermatomyositis: In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial in patients with DM resistant to other treatments, IVIg was shown to produce a significant increase of muscle strength as well as a marked improvement in immunopathological parameters in repeated muscle biopsies (before and after IVIg). Thus, IVIg is an important therapy in patients with DM resistant to other conventional therapies. Polymyositis: No randomised trials have been undertaken. One study showed clinical improvement and a reduction in the need of prednisone in patients with chronic refractory PM. Inclusion body myositis: Three controlled trials showed some muscle strength improvement, although the changes did not reach statistical significance. However improvement in swallowing was repeatedly observed, suggesting that some patients with severe dysphagia may derive a modest benefit from IVIg therapy.

Conclusion

Controlled trials indicate that in MG, LEMS, and DM, IVIg at a total dose of 2 g/kg is a highly useful therapy. Uncontrolled trials and case reports indicate benefit in many different clinical situations, but further clinical investigation is required.

### Myasthenia and related disorders of the neuromuscular junction [^061100ab]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Our understanding of transmission at the neuromuscular junction has increased greatly in recent years. We now recognise a wide variety of autoimmune and genetic diseases that affect this specialised synapse, causing muscle weakness and fatigue. These disorders greatly affect quality of life and rarely can be fatal. Myasthenia gravis is the most common disorder and is most commonly caused by autoantibodies targeting postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. Antibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) are detected in a variable proportion of the remainder. Treatment is symptomatic and immunomodulatory. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is caused by antibodies to presynaptic calcium channels, and approximately 50% of cases are paraneoplastic, most often related to small cell carcinoma of the lung. Botulism is an acquired disorder caused by neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum, impairing acetylcholine release into the synaptic cleft. In addition, several rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have been identified, caused by inherited defects in presynaptic, synaptic basal lamina and postsynaptic proteins necessary for neuromuscular transmission. This review focuses on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

### Low specificity of voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: a call for caution [^cce2b380]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

As testing for neuronal antibodies become more readily available, the spectrum of conditions potentially associated with these autoantibodies has been widening. Voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies (VGCC-Ab) are no exception to this trend. The significance of an elevated VGCC-Ab titer beyond its original clinicopathological correlate, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) remains undetermined. We sought to determine the diagnostic significance of an elevated serum VGCC-Ab titer in a large single-center cohort of 100 patients. The majority of patients (58%) with elevated VGCC-Ab levels lacked an inflammatory or autoimmune etiology of their neurologic diagnosis. Only six cases (6%) of LEMS and two cases (2%) of SCLC (without LEMS) were identified. No significant differences in antibody titers were seen between the autoimmune and non-autoimmune groups. These findings support the notions that: (a) elevated VGCC-Ab titers without clinical correlation must be interpreted with caution, and (b) the clinical and electrodiagnostic criteria for LEMS should remain the mainstay in the diagnosis of LEMS.

### Autoimmune mediated neuromuscular junction defects [^a33fd9ee]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent advances on pathogenesis of antibody-mediated disorders of the neuromuscular junction, and results of studies on clinical assessment and treatments.

Recent Findings

The incidence of myasthenia gravis, particularly in patients older than 50 years, is rising, and this is not solely due to improved disease recognition. It is uncertain how muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis results in neuromuscular transmission failure since MuSK antibodies alter neuromuscular junction morphology without altering acetylcholine receptor numbers or turnover. Clinical tools have been developed that allow rapid and reliable disease assessment. The myasthenia gravis composite score addresses items commonly affected in myasthenia gravis, is sensitive to detect clinical change and helps guide the physician in therapy prescription. Immunosuppression remains the mainstay of myasthenia gravis treatment. Other therapies, such as rituximab, are increasingly prescribed for refractory myasthenia gravis, and drugs that inhibit complement are being explored in myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), SOX antibodies help distinguish between tumour and nontumour LEMS. Ganglioside complexes in GBS and Miller-Fisher syndrome are frequently present and are more pathogenic.

Summary

Developments in serological assays, particularly of cell-based assays, are continuing to improve the diagnosis and investigation of these conditions. Learning more on pathogenicity has helped us to apply newer therapies.

### John newsom-Davis: clinician-scientist and so much more [^edfe50db]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome

One of JND's talents was to recognize an autoimmune disease on the basis of clinical hints—not unlike the autoimmune associations in patients with myasthenia and/or their relatives that first convinced Iain Simpson that myasthenia gravis was mediated by antibodies. In the early 1980s, JND started to see patients with the Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which is often associated with small cell lung cancer. First characterized by), it was associated with a marked decrease in the presynaptic release of the acetylcholine packets (;). Indeed Nick Murray and JND had begun to treat patients with 4-aminopyridine, a drug that increases acetylcholine release but resulted quite frequently in seizures or other CNS disturbances ; with Jackie Palace, JND later popularized 3,4-diaminopyridine for both CMS and Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Back then, the cause of Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome was unknown; paraneoplastic aetiologies were only just beginning to be studied in detail and some held cancer-related neurotoxic factors responsible for reducing transmitter release, although an immune basis was also suggested, and had been for the non-tumour cases. On a speculative basis, JND plasma-exchanged three patients. All showed relatively short-lived clinical improvements, which took 15–20 days to reach maximum (versus 3–5 days in myasthenia gravis). That encouraged him to start using prednisolone and azathioprine, achieving a remarkable improvement and successive increase in the muscle action potential in one patient.

These successes clearly supported the idea that Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome was antibody-mediated, but the offending factor could still have been a biologically active peptide or other circulating substance that was susceptible to immunosuppression. To justify the effort needed to identify the target and establish an antibody test, it was important to show that IgG antibodies were involved. Bethan Lang was cajoled into injecting 10 mg of purified Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome IgG intraperitoneally into mice every day (including weekends) for 37–77 days! The quantal content of neuromuscular transmission studied by Dennis Wray was significantly reduced in all test animals versus controls, but with no effect on miniature endplate potential amplitudes or AChR numbers, strongly indicating that the presynaptic defects in patients were IgG-mediated.

The strengths of our study are the matched-pair analysis, a comprehensive multidimensional approach aiming for inclusion of all-encompassing data, and a representative cohort. Furthermore, the comparison of LEMS not only to genP but also another group of diseased people i.e. MG patients is a strength of this study. To our knowledge, there have been no previous analyses of anxiety and depression in LEMS.

### Oculobulbar involvement is typical with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^8e3bec02]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Oculobulbar symptoms and/or signs were present in 18 of 23 (78%) of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) patients evaluated at the Lahey Clinic (Table). Sixty-five percent (15 of 23) of our patients had ptosis and/or diplopia, each present in 11 individuals. Bulbar signs and symptoms, including dysarthria in 10 and dysphagia in 8 patients, also were observed among our LEMS population. More than one prereferral oculobulbar feature occurred in 13 of our LEMS patients. Prereferral diagnostic considerations included myasthenia gravis, myopathies, and psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that these atypical characteristics served to dissuade some colleagues from a diagnosis of LEMS. Thus, the presence of oculobulbar symptoms and signs cannot be used to exclude LEMS from the differential diagnosis.

### Atypical presentation of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome associated with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma [^572c7dc9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorder which is categorised as either paraneoplastic or primary autoimmune. In both forms, auto-antibodies target voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic level of the NMJ. Paraneoplastic LEMS is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), but it can also be caused by other malignancies. We report a rare case of paraneoplastic LEMS associated with oesophageal carcinoma. Over the course of a year, the patient presented with a range of unclear and evolving symptoms, leading to an initial diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and subsequently Myasthenia Gravis. The diagnosis of LEMS was confirmed serologically, after the discovery of oesophageal cancer, at a stage where treatment options were limited, leading to an unfavourable outcome. This case emphasises the importance of diagnosing LEMS before tumour detection, maintaining suspicion for LEMS in atypical presentations, and thoroughly investigating for malignancies, including extrapulmonary sites.

### Repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fiber electromyography in the evaluation of patients with suspected myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: review of recent literature [^576cdaa3]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Our aim in this study was to provide an updated literature review of electrodiagnostic testing in myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

Methods

A systematic review of the recent literature was performed using the following key words: myasthenia gravis (MG); Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS); electromyography (EMG); repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS); single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG); nerve conduction study; and normative values.

Results

Several articles supported testing of facial, bulbar, and respiratory muscles in the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders, including muscle-specific kinase antibody (MuSK)-seropositive MG. Several articles supported use of concentric needle EMG as an alternative to SFEMG jitter in disorders of neuromuscular transmission. A limited number of articles addressed measurement of area (vs. amplitude) decrement in RNS and decreasing the threshold of post-exercise facilitation.

Conclusions

Electrodiagnostic testing continues to be useful for diagnosis of MG and LEMS, although the quality of the evidence is not great. This literature review summarizes RNS and jitter measurement of facial and respiratory muscles and use of concentric needle EMG for SFEMG.

### Lambert-Eaton syndrome antibodies target multiple subunits of voltage-gated Ca2 + channels [^d520cef0]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune presynaptic neuromuscular disorder. Autoantibodies against subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) associated with acetylcholine release are thought to cause LEMS.

Methods

HEK293 cells expressing specific individual recombinant subunits of α(1A), α(1B), α(1C), and α(1E); β(3); and α(2)δ of human neuronal VGCCs were exposed to antibodies from 3 LEMS patients, 1 patient with small-cell lung carcinoma, and 1 with myasthenia gravis.

Results

All LEMS patient antibodies bound to cells containing any of the α(1) or β(3) subunits alone or combined with α(2)δ subunits, but not α(2)δ alone. Autoantibodies from the patient with small-cell lung carcinoma but not the myasthenia gravis patient targeted the same VGCC subunits.

Conclusions

Autoantibodies from LEMS patients bind directly to multiple VGCC α(1) subunits as well as the β(3) subunit. Thus, multiple components of the presynaptic VGCC complex are prospective targets for antibodies in LEMS.

### Neuromuscular junction disorders beyond myasthenia gravis [^699857a6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To give an overview of the recent data on three autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders with the recent Food Drug Administration (FDA) approval of amifampridine [3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) and 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate (3,4-DAPP) for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).

Recent Findings

In LEMS, the most important recent development is the introduction of FDA approved amifampridine for the symptomatic treatment. Randomized controlled studies showed an extremely effective improvement with amifampridine with daily dose of ≤ 80mg with minimal side reactions. The next important development is in the electrodiagnostic criteria. Now 10s exercise and an incremental response ≥ 60% either after 10s exercise or at the high-rate stimulation in the repetitive nerve stimulation test are recommended as the standard tests.In 2016, myasthenia-gravis Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome (MLOS) was coined as new syndrome for patients with myasthenia gravis and LEMS combined symptoms in same patients.In Isaacs syndrome, voltage gated calcium channel antibody order is no longer recommended because of low specificity for immunotherapy responsive disorders. Instead, ' leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated like-2 (CASPR2) autoantibody tests' are recommended.

Summary

In LEMS, amifampridine (3,4 DAP and 3,4-DAPP) is approved by the FDA as an effective symptomatic treatment. MLOS is coined as new syndrome recently. In Isaacs syndrome, LGI1 and CASPR2 antibody tests are recommended.

### Lowering the cutoff value for increment increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^18bf74e8]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patients

We retrospectively studied all consecutive patients who underwent RNS as well as increment testing from 1999 to 2016 at the Leiden University Medical Center, during a diagnostic evaluation of patients in whom LEMS was part of the differential diagnosis.

2.2 Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis of LEMS is usually based on fluctuating muscle weakness, decreased tendon reflexes and autonomic symptoms, supported by either presence of antibodies to voltage‐gated calcium channels (VGCC) or abnormal decrement and increment upon RNS. 2 Because abnormal increment is the subject of the current study, this criterion cannot be used. Therefore, for this study, diagnosis was based on fluctuating muscle weakness, decreased tendon reflexes, and abnormal decrement, supported by either presence of antibodies to VGCC or prominent autonomic symptoms.

### Long-term follow-up, quality of life, and survival of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^9bb8e283]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study survival and to characterize long-term functional impairments and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS).

Methods

In this observational study, survival of patients with LEMS, separately for nontumor (NT) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), was compared to that of the Dutch general population and patients with SCLC. Disease course in patients with LEMS was recorded retrospectively. Several scales for functional impairments and health-related quality of life were assessed.

Results

We included 150 patients with LEMS. Survival was similar to that of the general population in 65 patients with NT-LEMS. Tumor survival was significantly longer in 81 patients with SCLC-LEMS compared to patients with non-LEMS SCLC (overall median survival 17 vs 7.0 months, p < 0.0001). At diagnosis, 39 (62%) of 63 patients with complete follow-up data were independent for activities of daily living, improving to 85% at the 1-year follow-up. The physical HRQOL composite score (55.9) was significantly lower than in the general population (76.3, p < 0.0001) and comparable to that of patients with myasthenia gravis (60.5). The mental HRQOL composite score was 71.8 in patients with LEMS, comparable to that of the general population (77.9, p = 0.19) and patients with myasthenia gravis (70.3).

Conclusions

This study shows that patients with NT-LEMS have normal survival. Patients with SCLC-LEMS have an improved tumor survival, even after correction for tumor stage. A majority of patients with LEMS report a stable disease course and remain or become independent for self-care after treatment.

### Asymptomatic Lambert-Eaton syndrome [^97a67bb7]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

All descriptions of the Lambert-Eaton syndrome are based on symptomatic patients. We incidentally encountered electromyographic evidence of this syndrome in a patient being studied for another reason.

Methods

Detailed electrophysiological and serological evaluations were undertaken in this study.

Neuromuscular transmission tests were consistent with a presynaptic disorder. Autoantibodies specific for P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) were detected in the serum and persisted throughout 7 years of follow-up. Multiple IgG markers of thyrogastric autoimmunity also were detected.

Conclusions

This demonstration of asymptomatic Lambert-Eaton syndrome persisting for 8 years provided novel insight into the natural history of the disorder. It is plausible that patients with a subclinical syndrome would have abrupt neuromuscular decompensation when challenged with medications that compromise the safety factor for synaptic transmission.

### The epidemiology of myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and their associated tumours in the Northern part of the province of south holland [^ed32c202]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the epidemiology of myasthenia gravis (MG) and the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), and their association with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and thymoma, in a well defined region of the Netherlands. Available data on all the patients with MG, LEMS, thymoma or SCLC living between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1999 in the northern region of South Holland, with a population of 1.7 million inhabitants, were evaluated. A total of 202 patients with MG (20 with thymoma) and ten patients with LEMS (seven with SCLC) were identified. LEMS was 46 times less prevalent (2.32 x 10(-6)) than MG (106.1 x 10(-6)), whereas the annual incidence rate of LEMS was 14 times lower (0.48 x 10(-6)) than of MG (6.48 x 10(-6)), reflecting the poor survival of LEMS patients with SCLC. SCLC was diagnosed in 1593 patients, seven (0.44 %) of whom developed LEMS. Mean age at diagnosis of SCLC was significantly lower in SCLC patients with LEMS (p = 0.006). A thymoma was diagnosed in 32 patients, of whom the ten patients with MG (31 %) had a younger age at diagnosis of thymoma than the patients without MG (p = 0.27). This study confirms the increasing prevalence of MG over the last few decades as reported by others, and underscores the relative rarity of LEMS. The frequency of LEMS in our patients with SCLC was lower than reported in previous studies. In patients with a SCLC or thymoma, the tumour was diagnosed at younger age in those who had the associated myasthenic syndrome.

Neuromuscular complications of HIV are related to immunodeficiency, direct cytotoxicity of the virus or side effect of the treatments. Autoimmune disorders involving the nervous system, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, myositis and vasculitis, have been described in association with HIV. Neuromuscular junction autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis have been occasionally reported in patients with HIV, whereas the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) has never been described. We report an unusual case of paucisymptomatic LEMS in a patient with HIV infection.

### Classically described, paradoxically underrecognized: a case of proximal weakness, hyporeflexia / areflexia, and dysautonomia [^d8b2f7d6]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We present a case of chronic, progressive proximal weakness with dysautonomia and hyporeflexia/areflexia ultimately diagnosed with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. An approach to neuroanatomical localization is discussed leading to the appropriate selection of electrodiagnostic studies. The electrophysiologic triad of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is demonstrated with diffusely reduced motor amplitudes, decrement with low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation, and increment of motor amplitudes after maximum voluntary contraction. Subsequent serologic testing for P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies are markedly elevated. We highlight the clinical features and pitfalls of examining a patient with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome when suspecting this challenging diagnosis. The neurophysiological underpinning of the electrodiagnostic results is explained, and the diagnostic utility of single-fiber electromyography is briefly discussed.

### Fatigue and associated factors in myasthenia gravis: a nationwide registry study [^511b1348]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Sirs,

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which immunoglobulin G autoantibodies (Abs) bind to acetylcholine receptors (AChR) or to functionally related molecules at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, leading to localized or general fatigable muscle weakness. In recent years, several studies have shown that MG patients are also affected by excessive mental and physical exhaustion, that differs from muscle fatigability, commonly referred to as fatigue. While fatigue is a symptom in many chronic diseases, previous studies reported particularly high prevalence rates, up to 80%, in MG patients. Here, we studied a large real-world representative German registry cohort to assess fatigue and fatigue-associated factors in patients with MG.

The German National MG registry (MyaReg) is a multicenter prospective observational study comprising detailed assessment of patients diagnosed with a myasthenic syndrome using a standardized protocol across 19 certified German MG Centers, accredited by the German Myasthenia Society (Deutsche Myasthenie Gesellschaft, DMG). Certified centers fulfill patient-centered quality requirements and form a network for the continuous improvement of management and treatment standards in MG. In this study, only patients with confirmed diagnosis of autoimmune MG (excluding patients with Lambert–Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome or Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome) were included (n = 1464). Diagnostic criteria were adhering to the current German guidelines: The diagnosis of MG is based on the history and physical findings of fatigable and fluctuating muscle weakness. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive findings in auto-Ab diagnostics and/or electrophysiology and/or pharmacological testing. MyaReg is registered in the German clinical trial registry (, DRKS00024099, first patient enrolled: February 4th, 2019). This cross-sectional study was approved by the ethics committee of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany (EA1/214/18), and subsequently by all local ethics committees of the participating centers. It was conducted in accordance with the STROBE guidelines, with the checklist provided in Suppl. 3. All patients provided written informed consent. Data were retrieved on April 12, 2023. Detailed information on physician-assessed and patient-reported MG-specific outcome measures used in this study are provided in Suppl. 1.

### Repetitive nerve stimulation test in myasthenic crisis [^43354589]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herein we report our experience with the repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test in myasthenia gravis (MG) crisis.

Methods

The various parameters of the RNS tests in 26 patients with MG crisis were analyzed.

Results

In 18 (69%) patients, MG crisis is the first manifestation of MG. RNS tests were abnormal in 24 (92%) patients by decrement at low-rate stimulation in any of 4 tested muscles. Three patterns of abnormality were found: MG pattern (decrement at low-rate stimulation) in 23 patients; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome pattern in 1 patient; and cholinergic crisis pattern in 1 patient.

Discussion

During MG crisis, the RNS test can serve as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool for MG in a majority of patients. Muscle Nerve 59:544-544, 2019.

Introduction

The clinical triad of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) consists of proximal muscle weakness, autonomic symptoms and reduced tendon reflexes. Presentation with severe respiratory failure has been described, although it is uncommon.Sluggish pupillary reflexes are common but dilated fixed pupils are rare.Additionally, articles regarding the differential diagnosis of bilateral mydriasis do usually not list LEMS.

We present a case of a conscious patient with both respiratory failure and dilated fixed pupils after cardiac resuscitation, ultimately diagnosed with LEMS.

### Literature review of the usefulness of repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG in the electrodiagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^1b7e1048]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

A retrospective literature review of the electrodiagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert--Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) through July 1998 was performed for the purpose of generating evidence-based practice parameters. There were 545 articles identified, of which 13 articles met at least three of the six criteria set previously by the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM). An additional 21 articles were identified from review articles or the references of these first 13 articles leading to a total of 34 articles. Results of studies utilizing repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showed that a 10% decrement in amplitude from the first to fourth or fifth intravolley waveform while stimulating at 2--5 HZ is valid for the diagnosis of MG. The degree of increment needed for the diagnosis of LEMS is at least 25% but most accurate when greater than 100%. Abnormal jitter or impulse blocking are the appropriate criteria for diagnosis of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorders when using single fiber electromyography (SFEMG). SFEMG is more sensitive than RNS for the diagnosis of disorders of neuromuscular transmission, but may be less specific and may not be available. Therefore, RNS remains the preferred initial test for MG and LEMS.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^c097cd1c]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, resulting from binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most commonly the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The incidence ranges from 0.3 to 2.8 per 100,000,and it is estimated to affect more than 700,000 people worldwide.

The increasing use of immunomodulating therapies has been a major factor in improving the prognosis for patients with MG in recent years.The various treatment options must be weighed in the context of individual patient factors.

2: GROUP‐SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

In addition to the general recommendations summarized above, this section gives disease‐specific recommendations concerning the six groups of NMDs.

Neuromuscular junction disorders

Disorders of the neuromuscular junction may be caused by pathogenic antibodies, genetic defects, specific drugs, and/or toxins that interfere with the normal signalling between the presynaptic nerve ending and the postsynaptic muscle membrane.

Acquired autoimmune disorders of the neuromuscular junction are the most common and include myasthenia gravis and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is frequently associated with an underlying malignancy or another autoimmune process.

Congenital myasthenic syndromes are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders due to a variety of genetic defects resulting in impaired neuromuscular transmission. Muscle weakness typically begins in early childhood, but presentation may be delayed until adolescence or adulthood. Facial muscles, including (extra)ocular and bulbar muscles, are the most consistently affected. Due to muscle weakness, affected infants may have feeding difficulties. Motor development may be delayed. The severity of the myasthenia varies greatly, ranging from an inability to walk to only minor weakness. Weakness may be exacerbated by fever or infection. Specific anaesthesia considerations for patients with neuromuscular junction disorders are summarized in Table 1.

Methods

Study design and data collection

This multicenter national cohort study analyzed data from the German Myasthenia gravis Registry (MyaReg), which was established in February 2019 by the national patient support organization for patients with MG (German Myasthenia gravis Society; DMG). MyaReg is assessing longitudinal clinical data on diagnostics, therapy, adverse events, socioeconomic status, and patient-reported outcome parameters of patients with myasthenic syndromes including MG and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), which were diagnosed based on the current German guidelines.

Patients were followed up with entry into the registry in specialized MG clinics on an ongoing basis until June 2021. Socio-demographics (age, sex), MG disease duration, current MG-specific medication, which includes cholinesterase inhibitors, first-line IST (corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclosporine), escalation therapy (rituximab, eculizumab), history of thymectomy, and comorbidities were collected in an electronic database (asthesis ®). SARS-CoV-2 infection-related data encompassed COVID-19 severity (hospitalization, stay on intensive care unit, invasive/non-invasive ventilation, myasthenic exacerbation/crisis, exacerbation therapies, change of preexistent IST, antiviral therapy), and outcome (death, rehabilitation, nursing home, discharge to home). Exclusion criteria were missing information on COVID-19 diagnosis (by polymerase chain reaction or antibody testing), MG disease duration, comorbidities, and current MG-specific medication.

Outcome

Endpoints were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 of any severity) and severity of COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 course was classified as mild (defined as outpatient treatment), moderate (defined as hospitalization without ICU treatment), and severe (defined as ICU treatment and deceased). We analyzed whether a current IST use was associated with (1) a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (2) with a worse course of COVID-19 defined by hospitalization or death.

### Lowering the cutoff value for increment increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^8cbb4866]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Increment testing was performed in 164 patients during the study period, of whom 156 were ultimately analyzed, including 63 LEMS patients (Table 1 ; Supporting Information Figure S1 flowchart for inclusion and disease groups, which is available online). The hypothenar muscle was tested in all but four patients (97.5%). The nasalis muscles were tested in 19 patients (11.7%), while tibialis anterior, trapezius, and abductor pollicis brevis muscles were tested in one patient each.

TABLE 1 
Baseline characteristics

Sensitivity and specificity are reported in Table 2, showing increased sensitivity for the 60% as compared to the 100% cutoff. Exclusion of three seronegative LEMS patients with typical clinical symptoms (including prominent autonomic symptoms) resulted in a sensitivity of 80.0% (67.7%–89.2%) for a 60% increment threshold and 61.7% (48.2%–73.4%) using a 100% threshold. Limiting the control group only to 23 patients with myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndromes, specificity was 95.7% for the 60% threshold and 100% for the 100% threshold. The single false positive patient had a normal initial CMAP amplitude, 56% decrement and 68% increment in the hypothenar muscle. She had generalized MG with acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies and a severe axonal polyneuropathy.

TABLE 2 
Sensitivity and specificity for 60% and 100% cut‐off value for diagnosis of Lambert‐Eaton myasthenic syndrome

Sensitivity was higher in the 18 untreated LEMS patients, and in LEMS patients without associated lung cancer for the 60% cutoff (Supporting Information Table S1). Of three seronegative LEMS patients with typical clinical symptoms who were already treated symptomatically, one had a clinically meaningful increment (95%) in the hypothenar muscle.

Increment in nasalis muscles was mainly tested in patients with ocular or facial weakness (in 11 of 17 patients) or low CMAP amplitude of the nasalis muscle (10/17). This resulted in detection of >100% increment in two patients without increment in the hypothenar muscle.

### An interesting collection of paraneoplastic syndromes in a patient with a malignant thymoma [^176ccbbb]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are conditions that manifest as the remote effects of cancer. These are very rare, occurring in 1/10000 patients with a malignancy, and include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, limbic encephalitis, subacute cerebellar ataxia, opsoclonus-myoclonus, Stiff-Person Syndrome, retinopathies, chronic gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction and sensory neuropathy. This report describes a case of 41-year-old man who presented with elements of multiple paraneoplastic syndromes, including chronic gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction, myasthenia gravis-Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome and polymyositis, and who was subsequently found to have a malignant thymoma. There are only three reported cases in the literature describing cases of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in association with a thymoma, and only one case of a myasthenia gravis-Lambert-Eaton overlap syndrome in a patient with thymoma. However, there are no documented cases in the literature of this constellation of syndromes in a patient with a malignant thymoma.

### Nationwide survey of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in Japan [^df05c857]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Our diagnostic criteria for LEMS followed Titulaer et al,modifying the 60% increment rate of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) after maximum voluntary contraction or at high frequency (50 Hz), as Oh et al proposed a 60% increment of CMAP as the diagnostic criteria to include seronegative LEMS.Sixty per cent increment of CMAP includes false-positive diagnosis; however, a cut-off of 100% improves specificity at the expense of sensitivity. Therefore, we have to consider the appropriate cut-off for increment. The proximal muscle weakness in AI-LEMS was 81.3% in initial symptoms. However, we did not exclude 18.7% of patients from the diagnosis of LEMS. This diagnostic policy is because we could not see the patients nor check every patient’s medical record. Therefore, we admit that the diagnostic process allows individual biases of physicians. According to our diagnostic criteria, the definite LEMS was 16, and the probable LEMS was 4 out of 30 patients.

Our study did not find any differences between P-LEMS and AI-LEMS in frequencies of initial symptoms, current symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies and electrophysiological findings. In the present study, the two groups shared similar clinical and laboratory findings; thus, our findings suggest the necessity of radiological examinations to identify tumours in patients with LEMS. On the other hand, the sex ratio and onset ages differed between P-LEMS and AI-LEMS; thus, there may be some aetiological differences between these two conditions.

There were no statistical differences in the selection of medicines between the LEMS with tumour and without tumour groups. However, overall usage of 3,4-DAP was limited compared with previous reports.In Japan, there is no available medicine for 3,4-DAP. Therefore, we must use a chemical reagent of 3,4-DAP to treat LEMS after a particular application and approval. The lack of commercially available medicine prevents physicians from subscribing to 3,4-DAP for patients with LEMS. Therefore, we have to change this situation. We also noticed that the use of PSL and immunosuppressant is few in P-LEMS. We think that was because of the reported improved survival of SCLC with LEMS compared with SCLC alone.As P-LEMS was more severe symptoms than AI-LEMS, we could treat P-LEMS more aggressively.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^7b22f919]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^f63e3ef6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Challenges in the Diagnosis of Botulism

Although the progression of paralysis in patients with botulism is described as unique and recognizable, in practice, when a patient is first seen by the health care provider, the neurologic symptoms and the sequence of progression both are sometimes misdiagnosed. The reasons for initial failure to diagnose botulism in subsequently confirmed cases has been investigated most productively in outbreaks, in which cases initially misdiagnosed were eventually identified by outbreak investigators. Outbreak investigations in which some botulism cases were only identified after the patients had been discharged with alternative diagnoses highlight the potential for delayed or missed diagnoses (CDC, unpublished data, 2016). The critical initial treatment and management decisions for patients with suspected botulism must be made based on clinical findings. Botulinum antitoxin, the only specific therapy for botulism, should be administered as quickly as possible. Laboratory confirmation can take several days, and delaying administration of antitoxin to a patient with a high or medium likelihood of botulism while awaiting laboratory results can worsen the patient’s outcome. The diagnostic challenges resulting from the variations in the spectrum of signs and symptoms of botulism were highlighted in the delayed recognition of a large foodborne botulism outbreak, in which some patients initially received diagnoses of myasthenia gravis, stroke, or psychiatric disorders. Most of the affected patients were reported to have had the classic signs and symptoms of botulism. In recent literature reviews and a classical case series, botulism was most commonly misdiagnosed as myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. A wide variety of common and unusual etiologies have been included in differential diagnoses of individual cases (e.g. cerebrovascular accident, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and tick paralysis). In a review of 332 patients with possible botulism for which CDC consulted during 1980–2016, the treating physician provided alternate diagnostic considerations for 274 cases (83%); for these, treating physicians reported a range of zero to six illnesses other than botulism as possible diagnoses at the time of emergency public health consultation. The most common differential diagnoses were Guillain-Barré syndrome (99 cases) and myasthenia gravis (76 cases). For 160 botulism cases that occurred during 2009–2015, treating physicians who consulted with the CDC botulism clinical consultation service listed botulism first for 90% (144) of cases, second for 6% (10), third for 3% (five), and fourth for <1% (one).

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^5853e5b8]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Panel constitution and method of expert consensus.

In October 2013, a Task Force of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) convened a panel of 15 international experts in MG to develop treatment guidance statements based on formalized consensus. The panel was chosen to represent the breadth of knowledge and experience and a wide variety of opinions from MG experts internationally.

Table 3 
Neuronal Autoantibody Confidence Scale*

This scale has a 77% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 87% positive predictive value and 89% negative predictive value for clinical relevance of the positive NAAs. If the score is greater than 1, it is likely that the antibody is clinically relevant. Conversely, if the score is less than 1, it is likely that the antibody is clinically irrelevant, whereas a score of 1 is not predictive. If an alternative diagnosis was found during workup (eg, neurosarcoidosis, nutritional deficiency) then the positivity of one of these less specific antibodies should be considered a clinically irrelevant result not necessitating repeat cancer screening or addition or change of immunotherapy.It is to be noted that the clinical relevance of some of these antibodies is higher for peripheral neurological disorders as in the case of VGCC antibody with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and ganglionic AChR antibody with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Therefore, it is important to always correlate the clinical presentation to the positive antibody and question the clinical relevance of the test result if there is clinical-serological discordance. More recent NAAs panels emphasise the importance of clinical correlation and are based on clinical presentation (movement disorders vs epilepsy vs encephalopathy, etc) as opposed to aetiology (paraneoplastic vs idiopathic). As our knowledge and understanding of autoimmune neurology expands, antibodies with limited clinical relevance are expected to become obsolete or limited to specific panels.

### Update on paraneoplastic syndromes [^860e30be]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the varied clinical spectrum of neurologic paraneoplastic disorders, describes recent advances in our understanding of autoimmunity in these disorders, and outlines a practical clinical approach to patient management.

Recent Findings

Paraneoplastic disorders may affect any part of the central or peripheral nervous system. Although relatively uncommon, these disorders are a significant cause of severe and permanent neurologic disability. Syndromes such as limbic encephalitis or opsoclonus-myoclonus should always raise suspicion of a paraneoplastic condition, but any paraneoplastic syndrome can also occur in patients without a neoplasm. Most neurologic paraneoplastic disorders are thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction directed against 'onconeural' antigens expressed by neurons and tumor cells. Some syndromes such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and neuromyotonia are clearly mediated by autoantibodies. Much less is known about the immunopathogenesis of syndromes that affect the central nervous system, although a growing body of evidence implicates cellular immune effectors in causing neuronal injury. Many patients have circulating antineuronal antibodies, which can be useful in identifying a neurologic disorder as paraneoplastic and in finding the associated neoplasm. Early diagnosis of the neurologic disorder and prompt initiation of tumor treatment probably increase the likelihood of neurologic improvement.

Summary

Neurologists must be able to recognize the clinical manifestations of neurologic paraneoplastic disorders, and to distinguish them from other causes of neurologic dysfunction in cancer patients. Early diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndromes maximizes the likelihood of a favorable oncologic and neurologic outcome.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome: a comprehensive review [^77a0e2d2]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular junction disorders

Myasthenia gravis (MG), the most common neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorder, causes fatigable weakness with diurnal fluctuations, preserved reflexes, and decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation on electrophysiology. Bulbar‐onset MG and MG with positive anti‐muscle‐specific kinase (anti‐MuSK) antibodies may mimic the pharyngeal‐cervical‐brachial variant of GBS (and vice versa). Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is often paraneoplastic, causing weakness that improves with exercise, loss of reflexes, and incremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation. Although MG, LEMS, and GBS all cause muscle weakness, diurnal fluctuations and exercise‐induced effects are not typical of GBS, where reflexes are characteristically absent. Botulism, another NMJ disorder, presents with acute paralysis and can mimic GBS, with distinct features including descending paralysis and mydriasis. Organophosphate intoxication causes flaccid paralysis with a constellation of cholinergic symptoms such as diarrhoea, increased urinary frequency, lacrimation, excessive sweating and salivation, with myosis and bradycardia.

Myelopathies

Acute spinal cord disorders can mimic GBS in the first few days following onset. Both acute transverse myelitis (inflammatory or infective) and GBS can present with acute flaccid paraparesis, sphincter disturbance with or without back pain, and reflexes can be absent in early myelopathies. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein‐associated disease (MOGAD) may present with conus medullaris syndrome mimicking GBS, usually with prominent sphincter disturbance at onset which is uncommon in GBS. However, a cord disorder will have a sensory level whereas GBS will usually not, and MRI (and serology where appropriate) will aid differential diagnosis.

### FDA approves first treatment for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder (...) [^d8e291fd]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

- For Immediate Release: The U. S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Firdapse tablets for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in adults. LEMS is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between nerves and muscles and causes weakness and other symptoms in affected patients. This is the first FDA approval of a treatment for LEMS. “There has been a long-standing need for a treatment for this rare disorder, ” said Billy Dunn, M. D. , director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Patients with LEMS have significant weakness and fatigue that can often cause great difficulties with daily activities. ”. In people with LEMS, the body’s own immune system attacks the neuromuscular junction and disrupts the ability of nerve cells to send signals to muscle cells.

LEMS may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, but more commonly occurs in patients with cancer such as small cell lung cancer, where its onset precedes or coincides with the diagnosis of cancer. The prevalence of LEMS is estimated to be three per million individuals worldwide. The efficacy of Firdapse was studied in two clinical trials that together included 64 adult patients who received Firdapse or placebo. The studies measured the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score and the Subject Global Impression. For both measures, the patients receiving Firdapse experienced a greater benefit than those on placebo.

The most common side effects experienced by patients in the clinical trials were burning or prickling sensation, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated liver enzymes, back pain, hypertension and muscle spasms. Seizures have been observed in patients without a history of seizures. Patients should inform their health care provider immediately if they have signs of hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, hives, itching, fever, swelling or trouble breathing. The FDA granted this application Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Firdapse also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted the approval of Firdapse to Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

### Assessment of the compound muscle action potential amplitude return time between exercises or tests in the repetitive nerve stimulation test for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [^4aa9d528]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When performing postexercise facilitation (PEF) as part of the repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), it is important to avoid any influence of the previous exercise or RNS test on the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude.

Methods

To measure the CMAP amplitude return time (ART) to that at rest, a single CMAP was obtained every 30seconds until the amplitude was within 5% of that at rest in three exercise periods (10, 20, and 30seconds) and in 10-second postexercise (PE) 3-Hz RNS testing with 17 tests in 10 LEMS patients.

Results

Adequate ART between tests is 150seconds for 10-second exercise (Ex) and 10-second PE 3-Hz RNS test, 120seconds for 20-second Ex, and 90seconds for 30-second Ex.

Discussion

We recommend 150seconds as adequate ART between the PEF test and the next test when performing RNS test in LEMS.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^9aad5f8e]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

AANEM updated consensus on intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) in neuromuscular disorders categorizes recommendations as Class I-IV. Based on Class I evidence, IVIG is recommended in the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in adults, multifocal motor neuropathy, dermatomyositis, stiff-person syndrome and myasthenia gravis exacerbations but not stable disease. Based on Class II evidence, IVIG is also recommended for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and pediatric GBS. In contrast, based on Class I evidence, IVIG is not recommended for inclusion body myositis, post-polio syndrome, IgM paraproteinemic neuropathy and small fiber neuropathy that is idiopathic or associated with tri-sulfated heparin disaccharide or fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 autoantibodies. Although only Class IV evidence exists for IVIG use in necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, it should be considered for anti-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase myositis given the risk of long-term disability. Insufficient evidence exists for the use of IVIG in Miller-Fisher syndrome, IgG and IgA paraproteinemic neuropathy, autoimmune neuropathy, chronic autoimmune neuropathy, polymyositis, idiopathic brachial plexopathy and diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy.

### Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis: a spine consultation [^2eaba04d]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a patient with acute extremity weakness, the spine surgeon's differential diagnoses should not only be limited to compressive spinal pathology but also include other etiologies, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and metabolic. Although spine surgeons may be confident in diagnosing some causes of weakness, mostly compressive in nature, they may not be comfortable with less commonly encountered conditions that may present without obvious compression on imaging. TPP is one such metabolic condition that presents with acute extremity weakness. Other conditions to be considered are myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and botulism.

Certain findings can help differentiate TPP from other conditions presenting with acute-onset weakness. In contrast to compressive causes of weakness, imaging studies in patients with TPP are normal. In TPP, proximal muscles are typically more severely affected than distal muscles. Mentation remains intact in patients with TPP, the respiratory muscles are spared, and the cranial nerves are not affected. Another important finding is that sensation is unaffected in TPP. Guillain-Barré syndrome is another cause of weakness that can be differentiated from TPP by its classic presentation of ascending paralysis and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings.Botulism is a toxin-mediated condition that presents as descending flaccid paralysis where the muscles of the head and neck are initially affected.In contrast to TPP, both Guillain-Barré syndrome and botulism can affect the respiratory system and lead to respiratory distress. Although neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome can present with extremity weakness, these are the result of an autoimmune reaction affecting the neuromuscular junction and do not typically present with electrolyte abnormalities. TPP is often misdiagnosed as familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHPP) in Western countries because of similarities in precipitating factors and the clinical pattern of paralysis.However, TPP usually presents later in life with thyrotoxic symptoms and abnormal thyroid function tests. In contrast to FHPP, patients with TPP typically lack a family history of paralysis. In unclear cases, a urine calcium to phosphate ratio of >1.7 is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing TPP and differentiating it from FHPP.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^932cf127]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

### Comprehensive analysis of paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome and PNS-CARE diagnostic criteria in clinical practice [^8c674d74]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common presenting syndromes were rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome (29%), brainstem encephalitis (14%), and limbic encephalitis (8%, Figure 2C). In our PNS+ cohort, 16 patients were diagnosed with multiple syndromes. Three patients were diagnosed with both brainstem encephalitis and limbic encephalitis, 7 patients were diagnosed with rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome and another syndrome (2 encephalomyelitis, 3 brainstem encephalitis, 1 limbic encephalitis and sensory neuronopathy, and 1 stiff-person syndrome), 5 patients had GI pseudo-obstruction with another syndrome (2 Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome [LEMS], 1 brainstem encephalitis, 1 myeloneuropathy, and 1 sensory neuronopathy), and 1 additional patient had cerebellar ataxia/LEMS. We also found 17 patients with other syndromes in low frequencies including motor neuron disease (n = 2), autonomic neuropathy (n = 2), LEMS (n = 2), cranial neuropathy (n = 1), Morvan syndrome (n = 1), neuromyotonia (n = 1), and others. Gender stratification revealed that women most commonly had rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome while men most commonly had brainstem encephalitis (Figure 2C). Further details of our cohort stratified by the presenting syndrome are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 
Detailed Descriptions of Our Cohort Stratified by Presenting PNS

Comparison of the 2004 and 2021 PNS Criteria

We looked at our whole cohort of 484 patients, with disease positive as patients who were deemed PNS+ based on our evaluation (Methods section provides further details on how patients were determined to be PNS+). For the 2004 criteria, we defined “definite” as a test positive, yielding a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 99%. For the 2021 criteria, when we used “definite” as a test positive, the sensitivity was 55% with 100% specificity. When we combined “definite” and “probable” as test positive, the sensitivity was 93% and the specificity continued to be 100%. The area under the curve for the 2021 criteria was 0.99 (95% CI 0.992 to 0.999) by ROC analysis when both “definite” and “probable” were combined as test positive. Because of difficulty in comparing 2-level criteria (2004 criteria) with 3-level criteria (2021 criteria), we calculated other permutations of categorizing test positives and test negatives, outlined in eTable 2.

### High κ free light chain is a potential biomarker for double seronegative and ocular myasthenia gravis [^dd8ee8de]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients

The distribution of patients according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinical classification was Class I = 24 patients, Class IIA = 20 patients, Class IIB = 4 patients, Class IIIA = 9 patients, Class IIIB = 6 patients, Class IVA = 4 patients, and Class IVB = 2 patients. The classification of 4 patients was equivocal. Class I, which is ocular MG (O-MG), was diagnosed in patients with pure ocular involvement lasting over 2 years because 90% of them will be presumed to remain with ocular MG throughout their illness.The disease duration among these patients was between 2 and 3 years in 2 patients, between 3 and 5 years in 6 patients, and above 5 years in 16 patients.

The diagnosis of patients with SN-MG was based on fluctuating muscular weakness in a typical distribution for MG with supportive positive diagnostic tests of single-fiber EMG and/or repetitive stimulation EMG and/or positive edrophonium tests in addition to ruling out other relevant medical conditions that may present with the same type of weakness (such as thyroid ophthalmopathy, congenital myasthenia, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, myositis, mitochondrial syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and CNS demyelinating diseases) by the clinical presentation and course, relevant blood tests, EMG, and brain MRI in patients who had negative tests for anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibodies. Patients were treated according to the accepted guidelines.

The exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasia disorders, a diagnosis or suspicion of another chronic inflammatory condition known to be associated with increased serum levels of FLC (such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus),, a glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and treatment with plasmapheresis for the past 3 months. We recruited healthy individuals to serve as the control group to test whether FLC levels are high in the sera of patients with MG. The data collection was planned before the tests for FLCs were performed.

### Clinical reasoning: a 43-year-old man with subacute onset of vision disturbances, jaw spasms, and balance and sleep difficulties [^7ca71b06]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 2

The onset and progression leading to significant disability within 6–12 weeks is consistent with a subacute disorder.The age at onset and progression rate is atypical for hereditary disease and degenerative CNS diseases (except for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, where ataxia could be prominent and progress rapidly).

While the gait and balance difficulties and extremity weakness do not localize well, the bilateral horizontal gaze palsies with opsoclonus, jerk see-saw nystagmus, laryngospasm, jaw dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and probable REM sleep behavior disorder assist in brainstem syndromic localization. Jerk see-saw nystagmus localizes to either medulla or mesodiencephalon, whereas pendular see-saw nystagmus localizes to the brainstem-mesodiencephalic junction.A possible seizure suggested CNS multifocality, although this event could have represented hyperekplexia or generalized dystonic posturing with brainstem localization. While subacute peripheral nervous system disorders such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, and Miller Fisher syndrome were considered, they were excluded because of the presence of CNS signs and absence of fatigable weakness and autonomic and neuropathic signs. A brainstem disorder was the appropriate localizing syndrome. Differential diagnostic considerations for subacute onset brainstem disorders include toxic, infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, and autoimmune causes (Table). Opsoclonus (with or without myoclonus) is rarely encountered beyond immune-mediated etiologies.

### A synaptic laminin-calcium channel interaction organizes active zones in motor nerve terminals [^521c85cd]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Synapse formation requires the differentiation of a functional nerve terminal opposite a specialized postsynaptic membrane. Here, we show that laminin beta2, a component of the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction, binds directly to calcium channels that are required for neurotransmitter release from motor nerve terminals. This interaction leads to clustering of channels, which in turn recruit other presynaptic components. Perturbation of this interaction in vivo results in disassembly of neurotransmitter release sites, resembling defects previously observed in an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. These results identify an extracellular ligand of the voltage-gated calcium channel as well as a new laminin receptor. They also suggest a model for the development of nerve terminals, and provide clues to the pathogenesis of a synaptic disease.

Autoimmune neuromuscular disease—Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is mediated by autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs); more than 90% of LEMS have antibodies against VGCC type P/Q, which is the etiology for LEMS, and the prevalence of LEMS in SCLC is 1% to 1.6%. Diagnosis of LEMS generally is by clinical characteristics, electromyography, and anti-VGCC antibodies, with craniocaudally progressive proximal muscle weakness that occurs predominantly at the hip girdle; in the absence of clinical features of LEMS, routine measurement of VGCC antibodies is not recommended. IVIg is a potential treatment of LEMS, and guidelines for using IVIg for LEMS have been proposed.

### Vecuronium bromide [^82b655fa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

VECURONIUM SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSAGE BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING ITS USE. THE DRUG SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED UNLESS FACILITIES FOR INTUBATION, ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION, OXYGEN THERAPY, AND REVERSAL AGENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. THE CLINICIAN MUST BE PREPARED TO ASSIST OR CONTROL RESPIRATION. TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF PROLONGED NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE AND OTHER POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT OCCUR FOLLOWING LONG-TERM USE IN THE ICU, VECURONIUM OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED IN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED DOSES BY OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH ITS ACTIONS AND WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH APPROPRIATE PERIPHERAL NERVE STIMULATOR MUSCLE MONITORING TECHNIQUES (see PRECAUTIONS - Long-Term Use in ICU).

In patients who are known to have myasthenia gravis or the myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome, small doses of vecuronium may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of value in monitoring the response to administration of muscle relaxants.

Anaphylaxis

Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including vecuronium bromide, have been reported. These reactions have in some cases been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs.

Risk of Death due to
Medication Errors

Administration of vecuronium bromide for injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.
