## Question

What antiemetics are safe in pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiemetics are safe to use during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "safe" in pregnancy and what outcomes matter most. Then, I should verify which agents are considered first-line versus second-line in contemporary guidelines. Next, I will examine the safety data for each class, especially H1 antihistamines, dopamine antagonists, and 5-HT3 antagonists. After that, I need to check special cautions, dosing, and route considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note what to avoid or reserve for refractory cases, anchoring to RCOG, ACOG, SOGC, and high-quality cohort data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definition of "safe". In pregnancy, safety must balance maternal benefit against fetal risk, with attention to major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and maternal adverse effects; importantly, undertreatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum carries meaningful risks, including dehydration, weight loss, hospitalization, and even termination of wanted pregnancies, so I need to ensure I'm not overweighing theoretical risks at the expense of real maternal harm [^82926efd] [^87a2bb82].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: multiple guidelines converge on H1 antihistamines and doxylamine/pyridoxine as foundational first-line options, with decades of accumulated safety data and no signal for increased major malformations. Phenothiazines such as promethazine and prochlorperazine are also considered first-line in many guidelines and have reassuring safety profiles when used appropriately [^b80b2bbe] [^25db0d5b] [^2f7ebc73].

> I will now examine doxylamine/pyridoxine specifically. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory status and magnitude of evidence: the combination is FDA-approved for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, supported by randomized trials and large observational datasets showing no increase in major malformations; ACOG gives this a Level A recommendation, and RCOG includes H1 antihistamines as first-line, which aligns with best practice for initial pharmacotherapy in NVP [^b80b2bbe] [^25db0d5b].

> For phenothiazines, let me consider the class effects and practical cautions. Promethazine and prochlorperazine have long-standing obstetric use and are generally considered safe in pregnancy; I should confirm maternal sedation and, in late pregnancy, potential neonatal effects, but overall teratogenic risk has not been demonstrated in the literature, supporting their first-line role in many protocols and their utility when combined with other agents in refractory cases [^25db0d5b] [^2f7ebc73].

> Now, I need to check dopamine antagonists, especially metoclopramide. The NEJM cohort of over 3,000 first-trimester exposures found no increased risk of major congenital malformations, low birth weight, preterm delivery, or perinatal death; however, I should double-check maternal adverse effects and duration limits, as extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia risks rise with prolonged use, prompting many guidelines to position metoclopramide as second-line and to limit courses when possible [^f7b5b532] [^4a92f135] [^9efc7161].

> Ondansetron is the most debated, so I should review the highest-quality comparative data. Large multinational cohorts comparing ondansetron to other antiemetics show no increased risk of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or major congenital malformations overall; however, I need to acknowledge a small, debated signal for orofacial clefts in some analyses, with an absolute risk on the order of about 14 per 10,000 versus 11.4 per 10,000, which RCOG frames as a very small absolute increase to be balanced against the risks of undertreated HG [^0c19dc80] [^84ad727e] [^175b8c10] [^0258cf79].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ondansetron timing. I initially thought to avoid it entirely in the first trimester, but wait, I should correct that: RCOG explicitly states ondansetron is safe during pregnancy and should not be discouraged if first-line agents fail, with counseling about the very small absolute cleft risk; ACOG and SOGC position ondansetron as an adjunct for severe NVP/HG when other combinations fail, and contemporary cohorts using active comparators mitigate confounding by indication, strengthening reassurance when clinically indicated [^0258cf79] [^ea068d27] [^6cd1442c].

> I should confirm what to avoid or reserve. Corticosteroids are generally reserved for refractory cases after standard therapies fail, and if used, many guidelines advise avoiding first-trimester exposure when possible due to a small possible increase in oral clefts; NK1 antagonists like aprepitant lack sufficient pregnancy safety data and should not be used routinely; domperidone has limited safety data in pregnancy and is not recommended; and while ginger is a reasonable nonpharmacologic option for mild symptoms, it should not replace guideline-directed pharmacotherapy when symptoms are moderate to severe or persistent [^82a96c77] [^432d3d8f] [^3def52eb] [^f66e027f].

> Next, I should review practical administration and monitoring. When oral intake is unreliable, transdermal, rectal, or parenteral routes can improve absorption; for metoclopramide, slow IV administration reduces extrapyramidal effects; combination therapy from different classes is reasonable in refractory cases; and I need to ensure we screen for and treat dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and thiamine deficiency in prolonged vomiting to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy, with thiamine supplementation during IV rehydration when vomiting has persisted beyond three weeks [^f9c5bb34] [^4a92f135] [^a63aa342] [^ce3be8f8].

> Let me synthesize a risk–benefit hierarchy. First-line: doxylamine/pyridoxine and H1 antihistamines such as promethazine or dimenhydrinate are preferred for their strong safety record and effectiveness. Second-line: metoclopramide is reasonable when first-line agents are inadequate, with counseling on maternal adverse effects and attention to duration. Third-line: ondansetron is appropriate when prior therapies fail, with shared decision-making about the very small absolute cleft risk and the substantial maternal and fetal risks of untreated HG. Corticosteroids are last-resort for refractory cases, ideally after the first trimester when possible [^b80b2bbe] [^25db0d5b] [^4a92f135] [^0258cf79] [^82a96c77].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Safe, evidence-based antiemetics for pregnancy include H1 antihistamines and doxylamine/pyridoxine as first-line; phenothiazines as additional first-line options; metoclopramide as a second-line alternative with maternal monitoring; and ondansetron as a third-line option with reassuring comparative safety data and a very small, debated cleft signal that should be weighed against the harms of undertreatment; avoid routine first-trimester corticosteroids and agents with inadequate pregnancy safety data, and tailor route and combinations to severity and tolerance [^b80b2bbe] [^25db0d5b] [^f7b5b532] [^0c19dc80] [^0258cf79].

---

In pregnancy, **first-line antiemetics** (doxylamine/pyridoxine, H1 antihistamines, and phenothiazines) are safe and effective [^b80b2bbe] [^2f7ebc73]. Metoclopramide is a **second-line option** with no increased risk of major malformations, but limit use to ≤ 5 days due to extrapyramidal effects [^f7b5b532] [^4a92f135]. Ondansetron is **reasonable when first-line agents fail**, with a very small absolute risk of orofacial clefts (about 3 per 10,000) [^0258cf79] [^fd39e46c]; large comparative cohorts show no increase in major malformations or fetal death [^0c19dc80] [^175b8c10]. Avoid corticosteroids in the first trimester and reserve them for refractory cases after 10 weeks [^432d3d8f] [^82a96c77]. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor for adverse effects, and tailor therapy to symptom severity and patient preference [^a756e31c].

## First-line antiemetic therapies

First-line antiemetics have the most robust safety data and are recommended by major guidelines [^b80b2bbe] [^25db0d5b].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxylamine/pyridoxine | Diclegis (10 mg/10 mg or 20 mg/20 mg) | - FDA-approved for NVP <br/> - No increased risk of major malformations <br/> - Preferred first-line therapy [^b80b2bbe] [^2f7ebc73] |
| H1 antihistamines | - Dimenhydrinate <br/> - Diphenhydramine <br/> - Meclizine <br/> - Promethazine | - Safe and effective <br/> - No increased risk of major malformations <br/> - First-line therapy [^25db0d5b] [^2f7ebc73] |
| Phenothiazines | - Prochlorperazine <br/> - Chlorpromazine | - Safe and effective <br/> - No increased risk of major malformations <br/> - First-line therapy [^25db0d5b] [^2f7ebc73] |

---

## Second-line antiemetic therapies

Second-line agents are considered when first-line therapies are ineffective or not tolerated [^4a92f135].

| **Medication** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | - No increased risk of major malformations <br/> - Extrapyramidal effects limit use to ≤ 5 days <br/> - Second-line therapy [^f7b5b532] [^4a92f135] |
| Ondansetron | - Small absolute risk of orofacial clefts (≈3 per 10,000) <br/> - No increased risk of major malformations or fetal death in large cohorts <br/> - Use when first-line agents fail [^0258cf79] [^0c19dc80] [^175b8c10] |

---

## Adjunctive and alternative therapies

Adjunctive therapies may be considered for refractory cases or as alternatives when standard therapies are contraindicated [^9f989a08].

- **Ginger**: Non-pharmacologic option with some evidence of benefit; safe in moderation [^f66e027f] [^9f989a08].
- **Corticosteroids**: Reserve for refractory cases after 10 weeks; avoid in the first trimester due to cleft risk [^432d3d8f] [^82a96c77].
- **Thiamine**: Essential for prolonged vomiting to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy [^ce3be8f8].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Timing**: Most antiemetics are initiated in the first trimester when NVP is most severe; early treatment prevents progression to hyperemesis gravidarum [^a756e31c].
- **Dosing**: Use the lowest effective dose; monitor for adverse effects, especially with metoclopramide and ondansetron [^a756e31c].
- **Patient preference**: Engage in shared decision-making, especially for second-line agents like ondansetron [^0258cf79].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Doxylamine/pyridoxine, H1 antihistamines, phenothiazines.
- **Second-line**: Metoclopramide (≤ 5 days), ondansetron (if first-line fails).
- **Reserve**: Corticosteroids after 10 weeks for refractory cases.
- **Avoid**: First-trimester corticosteroids; prolonged metoclopramide use.

---

Overall, **first-line antiemetics are safe and effective** in pregnancy, and second-line options like metoclopramide and ondansetron are supported by reassuring safety data when used appropriately [^b80b2bbe] [^0c19dc80].

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^2b1aff49]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study provides much-needed information regarding women's experiences with anti-nausea medication during pregnancy. Our study and prior studies have shown that many women want and need symptom relief to function at home and work. Women in our study had a wide range of perceptions about the potential risks of these medications. This heterogeneity may be partly due to the lack of rigorous evidence about whether these medications are safe in pregnancy. There is no meaningful information about risks available from randomized trials and there is ongoing debate about the quality and findings of prior observational (epidemiologic) studies.

Some women in our study expressed a desire for greater information about risks and benefits of anti-nausea medication use during pregnancy, including about outcomes in diverse populations such as women from different racial and ethnic groups. Future research is needed to clarify the potential risks and effectiveness of widely used anti-nausea medications, including ondansetron, as was highlighted by a recent Cochrane systematic review. More broadly, research is needed to find safe options for managing nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and this research needs to include women with diverse backgrounds and characteristics.

Our research also sheds light on how women interpret evidence and what kinds of information they find meaningful and compelling. Future qualitative research is needed to understand the ways in which women utilize knowledge and weigh evidence in their decision-making. Such research could help clinicians better understand how to communicate evidence to women in ways that are meaningful and helpful to them.

### The teratogenicity of drugs for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: perceived versus true risk [^6449fd9f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Women and health care providers commonly overestimate the teratogenic risk of medications in pregnancy. With regard to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, this leads to an underutilization of pharmacologic therapy. Pregnancy termination has even been elected in some circumstances when safe and effective alternatives for nausea have not been attempted. The misperception of teratogenic risk is partly the result of the way data on safety are presented. An awareness of this can lead to more balanced patient and physician educational materials. To facilitate rational use of medicinal and nonmedicinal therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, we have developed an algorithm based on a recent systematic review of safety and efficacy in management of the problem. The hierarchical use of medication is based on strength of evidence of fetal safety.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^1c284942]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Despite signals of harm in some studies, in particular for congenital malformations, evidence regarding the safety of ondansetron in pregnancy remains inconsistent and inconclusive. Health Canada submitted a query (Q16-08) regarding ondansetron and malformations to Canada's Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network, for which the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) undertook a large, multicenter analysis of ondansetron and various adverse pregnancy outcomes. Ondansetron-exposed women in previous studies were largely compared with women who did not use antiemetics, including a studythat reported a protective association between ondansetron and spontaneous abortion. Further research on ondansetron vs other antiemetics in adverse fetal outcomes is thus warranted given that NVP has been associated with a decreased risk of spontaneous abortion.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^84ad727e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Ondansetron is frequently used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Although some studies reported important safety signals, few studies have been sufficiently large to assess rare pregnancy outcomes.

Objective

To study the association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and the risks of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and major congenital malformations.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a cohort study conducted in 3 countries, with a meta-analysis. Participants included women and girls aged 12 to 55 years who experienced spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, or live birth between April 2002 and March 2016, as recorded in administrative data from 5 Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario), the US IBM MarketScan Research Databases, and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The statistical analysis was completed in October 2020.

Exposures

Exposure to ondansetron during pregnancy was compared with exposure to other commonly used antiemetics to minimize confounding by indication.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was fetal death, defined as either spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Secondary outcomes were the 2 components of the primary outcome and major congenital malformations identified during the year after a live birth. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent drug exposures and were adjusted using high-dimensional propensity scores. For major congenital malformations, adjusted odds ratios were estimated from logistic models. Site-level results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses considered second-line antiemetic exposure and exposure specifically during 4 to 10 weeks of gestation.

Results

Data from 456 963 pregnancies were included in this study of fetal death (249 787 [54.7%] in Canada, 197 913 [43.3%] in the US, and 9263 [2.0%] in the UK; maternal age, ≤ 24 years, 93 201 patients [20.4%]; 25–29 years, 149 117 patients [32.6%]; 30–34 years, 142 442 patients [31.2%]; and ≥ 35 years, 72 203 patients [15.8%]). Fetal death occurred in 12 907 (7.9%) of 163 810 pregnancies exposed to ondansetron, and 17 476 (5.7%) of 306 766 pregnancies exposed to other antiemetics. The adjusted hazard ratios were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.67–1.23) for fetal death with time-dependent ondansetron exposure during pregnancy, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.64–1.04) for spontaneous abortion, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.79–1.20) for stillbirth. For major congenital malformations, the estimated odds ratio was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.91–1.22). Results of sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with those of the primary analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large, multicenter cohort study, there was no association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and increased risk of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or major congenital malformations compared with exposure to other antiemetic drugs.

### Effectiveness and safety of ginger in the treatment of pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting [^939d1c12]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Conventional antiemetics are burdened with the potential of teratogenic effects during the critical embryogenic period of pregnancy. Thus, a safe and effective medication would be a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire. This systematic review was aimed at assessing the evidence for or against the efficacy and safety of ginger (Zingiber officinale) therapy for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

Data Sources

Systematic literature searches were conducted in 3 computerized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library), and the reference lists of all papers located were checked for further relevant publications.

Methods Of Study Selection

For the evaluation of efficacy, only double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. All retrieved clinical data, including uncontrolled trials, case reports, observational studies, and RCTs, were included in the review of safety.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Six double-blind RCTs with a total of 675 participants and a prospective observational cohort study (n = 187) met all inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of 4 of 5 RCTs was high. Four of the 6 RCTs (n = 246) showed superiority of ginger over placebo; the other 2 RCTs (n = 429) indicated that ginger was as effective as the reference drug (vitamin B6) in relieving the severity of nausea and vomiting episodes. The observational study retrieved and RCTs (including follow-up periods) showed the absence of significant side effects or adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes. There were no spontaneous or case reports of adverse events during ginger treatment in pregnancy.

Conclusion

Ginger may be an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. However, more observational studies, with a larger sample size, are needed to confirm the encouraging preliminary data on ginger safety.

### Evidence-based view of safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) [^07a3f00b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to review the safety and effectiveness of available antiemetics for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Study Design

We performed a quantitative and qualitative overview of observational controlled studies for drug safety in pregnancy and randomized controlled trials for drug effectiveness for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Results

All of the following are safe and effective for treatment of varying degrees of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy: Bendectin/Diclectin (doxylamine, pyridoxine, dicyclomine), antihistamine (H(1)) blockers, and phenothiazines; however, the magnitude of effect, particularly for phenothiazines, is in question and may differ among individual agents. Pyridoxine and vitamin B(12)are safe and may be effective. Metoclopramide, droperidol, and ondansetron may be effective, but safety data are insufficient to recommend them as first-line agents. Corticosteroids may not be as beneficial as first thought, and there may be a small teratogenic risk. The relative effectiveness of various agents is largely unknown.

Conclusion

Many medications, particularly H(1)-antagonists and phenothiazines, are safe and effective for treatment of varying degrees of NVP.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^6de24410]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several important strengths. First, the use of ondansetron for NVP is rare in Canada. CNODES was able to combine data from multiple provinces and 2 international databases to obtain one of the largest studies thus far on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy. Second, the broad capture of patients who used antiemetics for NVP from multiple countries also contributes to the generalizability of our results. Third, antiemetic therapy choices for NVP are subject to variable patient and physician preferences, local guidelines, and drug availability. This means that pregnancy studies cannot safely assume that the timing and duration of antiemetic exposures is nondifferential between drugs or between drug-exposed and nonexposed person-time. Use of time-dependent exposure modeling, therefore, also represented an important contribution of our study. Fourth, the use of a reference group of patients using other antiemetics minimized confounding by indication.

Several limitations of our analyses merit mention. The analysis of major congenital malformations lacked power to evaluate certain specific types of malformations, such as oral clefts and ventricular septal defects, for which concerns have been raised elsewhere. Although the number of specific types of malformations precluded precise comparison between ondansetron and the other antiemetics, the total number of pregnancies analyzed suggests that any such malformations attributable to ondansetron were exceptionally rare. Confounding by indication is a common threat to validity in studies of drug safety. Women who experience spontaneous abortion or have children with fetal malformations may have a reduced odds of NVP. To address confounding by indication as a source of bias, we adjusted our analyses for coded hospitalizations and ambulatory visits for nausea and/or vomiting. Furthermore, we used a reference group who received alternative antiemetic medications during pregnancy. Although we anticipate these measures successfully addressed confounding by indication, it remains a possibility that imperfect NVP diagnostic coding and variable antiemetic choice and efficacy resulted in some residual bias.

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^cfe9eaad]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 80% of pregnant women experience nausea and/or vomiting during pregnancy — over 3 million women each year in the US. These symptoms can profoundly affect women's lives. Consequences can include decreased ability to function at work and at home; depression; concern for the health of the baby; emergency department visits and hospitalizations; and significant economic burden. Many women consider taking a medication for their symptoms. Yet this decision can be difficult because there is little evidence about the safety or effectiveness of most medications that are currently used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, as was concluded by a recent Cochrane review. Only one medication, Diclegis (doxylamine/pyridoxine) is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy; it is very expensive and often not covered by insurance. The most commonly used medication in the US, ondansetron, is not FDA-approved, but is currently used by about one in four pregnant women. Its safety remains controversial. Few relevant randomized clinical trials have been conducted, and most were very small and had very short follow up. Thus, most of the evidence about these medications' safety currently comes from retrospective epidemiologic studies. Two epidemiologic studies have suggested that ondansetron may increase the risk of birth defects; one found a higher risk of cleft lip/palate while the other found higher risk of heart defects. A third study found no association overall but lacked power to examine individual birth defects. The findings of these studies have been questioned, and the role of ondansetron in treatment remains somewhat controversial. Overall, because of inadequate evidence about medication safety in pregnancy, women with nausea and vomiting face a dilemma when making decisions about treatment. Little is known about women's perspectives and decision-making process when confronting this difficult decision.

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^fd39e46c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Antiemetics used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

Metoclopramide and ondansetron are considered second‐line antiemetic treatments for HG. Metoclopramide is considered safe and effective; however, due to a risk of extrapyramidal effects, a prescription should be provided with information on the potential side effects, and treatment should be discontinued if such side effects arise. Ondansetron should be considered as a second‐line treatment. One study found a slightly increased risk of orofacial clefting in babies born to individuals using ondansetron during the first trimester. However, due to extremely low absolute incidence (14 per 10 000 pregnancies compared with 11.4 per 10 000 pregnancies) some guidelines, including the RCOG guideline, state that use should not be discouraged if first‐line antiemetics are insufficiently effective. Individuals should be informed of potential side effects, which should be weighed against the risks of poorly managed HG (including termination of pregnancy), and healthcare professionals should not avoid ondansetron as a second‐ or third‐line treatment in the first trimester.

If symptoms cannot be adequately contained with (combination) antiemetic treatment, corticosteroids should be considered. Corticosteroids may reduce the frequency of vomiting and need for readmission. Due to well‐known side effects of corticosteroids, which include their effect on immune, metabolic, and adrenal function as well as fetal growth, this therapy is reserved for cases in which other antiemetics have not provided sufficient relief. Individuals using corticosteroids should have their blood pressure monitored and should be screened for gestational diabetes mellitus. Fetal growth monitoring should be considered in cases with prolonged use.

Combination of drugs should be used in individuals who have not responded to single antiemetic treatment. Despite the fact that there is an absolute dearth of studies comparing multi‐drug combination antiemetic treatment in HG, synergism of antiemetics from different classes has been the established best practice in other conditions, including postoperative nausea and vomiting or chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. It is also important to consider the route of administration of drugs for people with HG, as oral medication is often poorly tolerated due to frequent vomiting. For individuals with HG, antiemetic formulations, including buccal melts, transdermal patches, and rectal administrations, should be considered, if possible. In severe cases, parenteral or intramuscular route of administration may be necessary.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 189 — evidence grading and recommendation categories for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are defined as follows: The MEDLINE database, the Cochrane Library, and ACOG resources were used to identify English-language articles published between January 2000 and September 2017; abstracts at symposia were not included, and when reliable research was not available, expert opinion was used. Studies were reviewed according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force method with levels I (evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial), II-1 (evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization), II-2 (evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case–control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group), II-3 (evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention; dramatic results in uncontrolled experiments also could be regarded as this type of evidence), and III (opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees). Based on the highest level of evidence, recommendations are graded as Level A (based on good and consistent scientific evidence), Level B (based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence), and Level C (based primarily on consensus and expert opinion).

### Ondansetron use in pregnancy [^50469662]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy to stop progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum typically occur during the first trimester, the sensitive time for exposure to teratogens because organogenesis is occurring in the embryo. An efficacious treatment used widely across the United States for both nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron. Recent studies have provided conflicting findings on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy. There are numerous limitations in the current literature on ondansetron safety including exposure to the medication is not limited to sensitive windows of organogenesis, there is a lack of information on dosing and compliance, self-reports of exposure are commonly used, an inadequate accounting exists for other factors that may explain the relationship between ondansetron exposure and the adverse outcome, and there exists a lack of biologic plausibility by which ondansetron might cause harm. It is the authors' opinion that current data do not support a reluctance to treat women with ondansetron in clinical practice.

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^8e859755]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have examined women's experiences with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, more broadly. One study conducted focus groups with women and clinicians in Norway and found that women felt their experiences of nausea and vomiting were not taken seriously. Pregnant women and clinicians were reluctant to consider medication use because of concerns about harm to the baby. In Norway, women and clinicians relied heavily on the option of graded sick leave (part-time work), which is less available in the US. A study in Canada interviewed women calling a telephone counseling line to learn about treatment options for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy; the authors found that despite detailed counseling about Diclegis (doxylamine and pyridoxine), a medication widely regarded as safe in pregnancy, many women remained fearful and continued to believe it caused birth defects. This study took a quantitative approach, reporting survey results but not foregrounding women's voices or providing details of their experience. Finally, Locock et al. conducted qualitative interviews with 73 women from the UK. While this paper provides a rich and detailed view of women's experiences with nausea and vomiting more broadly, little information was provided about women's opinions and choices regarding medication use. No study has examined the perspectives of women in the US. The only study about women's perspectives came from Norway, where attitudes and practices may be very different from the US because of greater access to paid sick leave and part-time work. This paper will examine the perspectives of U.S. women who chose to fill an anti-nausea medication prescription to understand how they made decisions about whether to take anti-nausea medication during pregnancy, including their attitudes regarding medication use, how they weighed risks, what evidence they considered, and their experiences using anti-nausea medication.

Regarding medical management for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, more specifically with respect to setting of care, RCOG 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering inpatient care if there is at least one of the following:

- continued nausea and vomiting and inability to keep down oral antiemetics

- continued nausea and vomiting associated with clinical dehydration or weight loss (> 5% of body weight) despite oral antiemetics

- confirmed or suspected comorbidity, such as UTI and inability to tolerate oral antibiotics

- comorbidities, such as epilepsy, diabetes, HIV, adrenal insufficiency, or psychiatric disease where symptoms and inability to tolerate oral intake and medication could present further complications.

### Prescription medication use during pregnancy in the United States from 2011 to 2020: trends and safety evidence [^f51d9c7b]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication use during pregnancy has increased in the United States despite the lack of safety data for many medications.

Objective

This study aimed to inform research priorities by examining trends in medication use during pregnancy and identifying gaps in safety information on the most commonly prescribed medications.

Study Design

We identified population-based cohorts of commercially (MarketScan 2011–2020) and publicly (Medicaid Analytic eXtract/Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files 2011–2018) insured pregnancies ending in live birth from 2 health care utilization databases. Medication use was based on filled prescriptions between the date of last menstrual period through delivery, as well as the period before the last menstrual period and during specific trimesters. We also included a cross-sectional representative sample of pregnancies ascertained by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011–2020), with information on prescription medication use during the preceding month obtained through maternal interviews. Teratogen Information System was used to classify the available evidence on teratogenic risk.

Results

Among over 3 million pregnancies, the medications most commonly dispensed at any time during pregnancy were analgesics, antibiotics, and antiemetics. The top medications were ondansetron (16.8%), amoxicillin (13.5%), and azithromycin (12.4%) in MarketScan, nitrofurantoin (22.2%), acetaminophen (21.3%; mostly as part of acetaminophen-hydrocodone products), and ondansetron (19.5%) in Medicaid Analytic eXtract/Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files, and levothyroxine (5.0%), sertraline (2.9%), and insulin (2.9%) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey group. The most commonly dispensed suspected teratogens during the first trimester were antithyroid medications. The use of antidiabetic and psychotropic medications has continued to increase in the United States during the last decade, opioid dispensation has decreased by half, and antibiotics and antiemetics continue to be common. For one-quarter of medications, there is insufficient evidence available to characterize their safety profile in pregnancy.

Conclusion

There is a need for more drug research in pregnant patients. Future research should focus on anti-infectives with high utilization and limited level of evidence on safety for use during pregnancy. Although lack of evidence is not evidence of safety concerns, it does not indicate risk either. In many instances, the benefits outweigh the risks when these medications are used clinically, and some of the medications with no proven safety may be necessary to treat patients.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^ce3be8f8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — medication approvals, counseling, and supplementation — notes that "Some antiemetic medications have only been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in nonpregnant patients; however, off-label use is common", and clinicians "should counsel patients and document such discussions accordingly". It cautions, "Care should be exercised if multiple antiemetic medications are used simultaneously. Parallel use of some medications (see text) may result in an increased risk of adverse effects". Practical dosing guidance includes, "In the United States, doxylamine is available as the active ingredient in some over-the-counter sleep aids; one half of a scored 25-mg tablet can be used to provide a 12.5-mg dose of doxylamine". For prevention of Wernicke encephalopathy during rehydration, "Thiamine, intravenously, 100 mg with the initial rehydration fluid and 100 mg daily for the next 2–3 days (followed by intravenous multivitamins), is recommended for women who require intravenous hydration and have vomited for more than 3 weeks".

4.4 Supportive and other treatments

Supportive medical treatment, with or without additional psychological support, is an integral part of cancer management during pregnancy. Antiemetics such as metoclopramide and serotonin receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron) are commonly used and considered safe during pregnancy. The safety of neurokinin‐1 receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant, has not been established. The use of betamethasone or dexamethasone as premedication is discouraged due to transplacental passage; instead, steroids with minimal placental transfer, such as methylprednisolone, prednisolone, or hydrocortisone, are recommended. Growth factors, including granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor and erythropoietin, are safe during pregnancy. Most analgesics, antacids, antihistamines, and anti‐microbial agents are considered safe and recommended as per non‐pregnancy drug choices, in consultation with the local pharmacy policies. Bone marrow transplant is contraindicated during pregnancy.

4.5 Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

Active malignancy is associated with a significantly increased risk of VTE in pregnancy, with the odds of VTE being nearly seven times higher than those in pregnant women without malignancy. Nearly 30% of women who died from cancer in pregnancy in the UK (2000–2022) experienced thrombosis or thromboembolism. All pregnant women with active cancer should be prescribed VTE prophylaxis using LMWH until 6 weeks postpartum, unless contraindicated. Previous studies have recommended initiating prophylaxis in the first trimester if additional risk factors are present. Our recommendations regarding VTE are summarized in the best practice advice table below.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^30e3ab5a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline — persistent headache in pregnancy states that ACOG recommends metoclopramide 10 mg (intravenous or enteral), alone or in combination with diphenhydramine 25 mg (intravenous or enteral) as additional treatment for persistent headache in pregnancy (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Use of metoclopramide is particularly helpful for women with migraine-associated nausea, and although metoclopramide is preferred because of its better safety profile, other common antiemetics can also be used. Oral diphenhydramine 25 mg may be co-administered with metoclopramide to counter akathisia, and the sedating effects of the antihistamine may also help with migraine resolution.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 — breast cancer during pregnancy systemic chemotherapy and FAC outcomes — Chemotherapy should "not be administered at any point during the first trimester of pregnancy", and if systemic therapy is initiated, "fetal monitoring prior to each chemotherapy cycle is appropriate". In later pregnancy, fetal malformation risk is low, with "approximately 1.3%" in the second and third trimesters, and timing restrictions apply: chemotherapy "should not be given after week 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery". A single-institution prospective study indicates FAC "(5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV day 1) may be given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy", with reported outcomes that the "median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks, more than 50% of the patients had a vaginal delivery, and there were no fetal deaths", and an update describing "57 patients" with "57 live births" and a survey on "40 children". For supportive care, "Ondansetron, lorazepam, and dexamethasone can be used as part of the pre-chemotherapy antiemetic regimen".

### Over-the-counter medications in pregnancy [^b53cce14]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Many pregnant women take over-the-counter (OTC) medications despite the absence of randomized controlled trials to guide their use during pregnancy. Most data come from case-control and cohort studies. In 1979, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began reviewing all prescription and OTC medications to develop risk categories for use in pregnancy. Most OTC medications taken during pregnancy are for allergy, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or skin conditions, as well as for general analgesia. Acetaminophen, which is used by about 65% of pregnant women, is generally considered safe during any trimester. Cold medications are also commonly used and are considered safe for short-term use outside of the first trimester. Many gastrointestinal medications are now available OTC. Histamine H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have not demonstrated significant fetal effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally not recommended in pregnancy, especially during organogenesis and in the third trimester. There are even fewer data regarding use of individual herbal supplements. Ginger is considered safe and effective for treating nausea in pregnancy. Topical creams are considered safe based on small studies and previous practice. All OTC medication use should be discussed with patients, and the effects of the symptoms should be balanced with the risks and benefits of each medication. Because of the expanding OTC market, formalized studies are warranted for patients to make a safe and informed decision about OTC medication use during pregnancy.

### Ondansetron in pregnancy and risk of adverse fetal outcomes [^4bb3fbd3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Ondansetron is frequently used to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but the safety of this drug for the fetus has not been well studied.

Methods

We investigated the risk of adverse fetal outcomes associated with ondansetron administered during pregnancy. From a historical cohort of 608,385 pregnancies in Denmark, women who were exposed to ondansetron and those who were not exposed were included, in a 1:4 ratio, in propensity-score-matched analyses of spontaneous abortion (1849 exposed women vs. 7396 unexposed women), stillbirth (1915 vs. 7660), any major birth defect (1233 vs. 4932), preterm delivery (1792 vs. 7168), and birth of infants at low birth weight and small for gestational age (1784 vs. 7136). In addition, estimates were adjusted for hospitalization for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (as a proxy for severity) and the use of other antiemetics.

Results

Receipt of ondansetron was not associated with a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, which occurred in 1.1% of exposed women and 3.7% of unexposed women during gestational weeks 7 to 12 (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.91) and in 1.0% and 2.1%, respectively, during weeks 13 to 22 (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.21). Ondansetron also conferred no significantly increased risk of stillbirth (0.3% for exposed women and 0.4% for unexposed women; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.10 to 1.73), any major birth defect (2.9% and 2.9%, respectively; prevalence odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.82), preterm delivery (6.2% and 5.2%; prevalence odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.25), delivery of a low-birth-weight infant (4.1% and 3.7%; prevalence odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.13), or delivery of a small-for-gestational-age infant (10.4% and 9.2%; prevalence odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.44).

Conclusions

Ondansetron taken during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. (Funded by the Danish Medical Research Council.).

### The pregnant patient: managing common acute medical problems… [^c977d048]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Prescribed antiemetics such as metoclopramide and trimethobenzamide are reserved for severe or refractory cases. 9, 10 However, there are safety concerns with some prescribed antiemetics, such as promethazine, which has a risk of neonatal respiratory depression near term or during labor, and ondansetron, which physicians should consider avoiding in the first trimester because of conflicting data on the risk of teratogenicity. 9–11. 13 Initial therapies for gastroesophageal reflux of pregnancy include low-risk lifestyle interventions such as eating frequent small meals and avoiding smoking, caffeine, peppermint, and chocolate. Next choices generally include over-the-counter antacids that do not contain salicylates and over-the-counter cimetidine, famotidine, or ranitidine.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which causes pruritus without a rash, has been associated with increased fetal mortality, warranting antenatal surveillance in consultation with a primary maternity care clinician. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is treated with ursodiol in consultation with a primary maternity care clinician, although the therapy leads to only slightly better fetal and maternal outcomes than placebo. Cholestyramine has been used, but it only reduces pruritus. 28 Delivery by 35 to 37 weeks estimated gestational age may be warranted if bile acid levels are more than 16. 3 mcg per mL.
29. The choice of an appropriate oral antibiotic is based on known drug risks during pregnancy, patient drug allergies, and bacterial resistance patterns.

35 Nitrofurantoin is not used at term because of the risk of severe hemolytic anemia following birth. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is generally not recommended for use in pregnancy because of risks of neural tube defects in early pregnancy, as well as kernicterus in the newborn and permanent neonatal neurologic damage. A systematic review found that of the nonantibiotic measures taken to prevent urinary tract infections during pregnancy, only genital hygiene can be recommended in practice. 52.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^d878b37f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 80% of women experience nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), and approximately 20% to 25% of pregnant women use the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist ondansetron off label to treat NVP. Several studies have considered adverse outcomes of ondansetron in pregnancy, but few have considered rarer outcomes such as stillbirth. A notable exception is a study by Pasternak and colleagues, which reported a nonsignificant reduction in stillbirth among women exposed to ondansetron compared with nonexposure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.10–1.73). In addition, little is known about the safety of ondansetron for treating NVP compared with other prescription antiemetics.

More research is available for ondansetron and congenital malformations; however, studies to date have been comparisons of ondansetron exposure to nonexposure and have shown somewhat conflicting results. Among studies, that investigated major congenital malformations overall, odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.57 (95% CI, 0.13–2.49)to 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83–1.30). Oral-facial clefts and cardiac defects have also been studied in association with ondansetron exposure compared with nonexposure. Estimates in those studies ranged from a risk ratio of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63–1.43)to an OR of 2.37 (95% CI, 1.18–4.76). In studies, that examined cardiac defects, estimates ranged from a risk ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.86–1.10) for cardiac malformationsto a risk ratio of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1–4.0) for ventricular septal defects.

### Prevention of nausea and vomiting during termination of pregnancy [^3477082d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common in women undergoing dilatation and curettage under general anesthesia for pregnancy termination, and many studies suggest treating these women prophylactically for PONV.

Objectives

Reviewing the antiemetics used over the past 20 years for this indication and comparing their efficacy.

Search Strategy

We performed MEDLINE and EMBASE searches for articles published from January 1980 through June 2009. The search terms were complications, nausea, vomiting, antiemetics, anesthetics, surgery, dilatation, curettage, pregnancy, and women.

Selection Criteria

We selected the studies of the antiemetics droperidol, metoclopramide, hydroxyzine, propofol, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and ramosetron when used for the stated indication. When assessing drug efficacy, we compared the antiemetics used at the time the article was written.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reviewed the selected studies, presented the reported incidence rates of PONV for each drug, and presented and interpreted the P values reported for the different comparisons.

Main Results

Although all antiemetics assessed decreased the incidence of PONV, the combination of dexamethasone and droperidol seems to be the most effective in preventing PONV.

Conclusions

All antiemetics used in the last 20 years to prevent PONV are effective (some more than others) in women undergoing dilatation and curettage for pregnancy termination. However, there is a need for benefit and risk analyses of the different treatments.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^ea068d27]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum. The drug ondansetron PO is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^fee3647b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

While pregnancy-related malignancies are quite rare, their incidence is increasing and thus affecting more and more women nowadays. Their management, however, with both chemotherapy and supportive agents remains quite challenging and it seems crucial to define the optimal treatment for this special population. Concerning supportive medication, it is clinically significant to determine whether commonly used agents, including Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factors, Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, Bisphosphonates, Anticoagulation agents, Antiemetics and Glucocorticoids are indeed effective in ameliorating chemotherapy side effects. Meanwhile, it is of great importance that the administration of any of these agents is safe for both mother and fetus. This review aims to provide a précis of the current literature regarding both safety and efficacy of all categories of supportive medication during pregnancy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^c62a97ee]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer during pregnancy — systemic chemotherapy indications, timing, and regimen data indicate that chemotherapy should not be administered at any point during the first trimester of pregnancy and that fetal malformation risks in the second and third trimester are approximately 1.3%, not different than that of fetuses not exposed to chemotherapy during pregnancy; if systemic therapy is initiated, fetal monitoring prior to each chemotherapy cycle is appropriate. Chemotherapy during pregnancy should not be given after week 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery to avoid potential hematologic complications during delivery. Data from a single-institution prospective study indicate that FAC chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV day 1) may be given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with a median gestational age at delivery of 38 weeks, more than 50% vaginal delivery, and no fetal deaths; an update reported 57 patients treated with FAC and 57 live births, with survey data on 40 children including one child with Down syndrome and two with congenital abnormalities. Ondansetron, lorazepam, and dexamethasone can be used as part of the pre-chemotherapy antiemetic regimen.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1, 064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^6b01fb77]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Women suffering from severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum, have poor quality of life and increased risk of potentially fatal maternal and fetal complications. There is increasing and reassuring knowledge about safety of antiemetics in pregnancy. In 2013, the European Medical Agency (EMA) issued a warning on metoclopramide limiting treatment to maximum five days. Metoclopramide was the most used antiemetic in pregnancy at the time the warning was implemented in the Norwegian hyperemesis guidelines (2014). We aimed at describing changes in the treatment of hyperemesis over time, including changes associated with the EMA warning.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all women hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum with metabolic disturbances between 01/Jan/2002 and 31/Dec/2019 at a university hospital serving nearly 10% of the pregnant population in Norway. Time-series analysis described changes over time and interrupted time series analysis quantified changes in treatment and clinical outcomes related to the EMA warning.

Results

In total, 1,064 women (1.2% of the birthing population) were included. The use of meclizine, prochlorperazine, and ondansetron increased during 2002–2019. This led to a yearly increase in the percentage of women using any antiemetic of 1.5% (95%CI 0.6; 2.4) pre-hospital, 0.6% (95%CI 0.2; 1.1) during hospitalization, and 2.6% (95%CI 1.3; 3.8) at discharge. Overall, only 50% of the women received antiemetics pre-hospital. Following the EMA warning, prehospital use of metoclopramide dropped by 30% (95%CI 25; 36), while use of any antiemetic pre-hospital dropped by 20% (95%CI 5.7; 34). In timely association, we observed a decrease in gestational age (-3.8 days, 98.75%CI 0.6; 7.1) at first admission, as well as indication of increased rate of termination of pregnancy with an absolute increase of 4.8% (98.75%CI 0.9; 8.7) in 2014.

Conclusion

During 2002–2019, the overall use of antiemetics in treatment of hyperemesis increased. The EMA-warning on metoclopramide in 2013 temporarily limited pre-hospital antiemetic provision associated with hospitalization at lower gestational length and indication of an increase in termination of pregnancy.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^99a673b2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 32 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; corticosteroids; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; prochlorperazine; promethazine; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^823c09d4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to September 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, metoclopramide, ondansetron, phenothiazines, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^2f7ebc73]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — antiemetic therapy recommendations specify that H1-receptor antagonists, such as doxylamine, promethazine, and dimenhydrinate, are considered safe first-line pharmacologic antiemetic therapies, if needed. Doxylamine is US Food and Drug Administration–approved and recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for persistent NVP refractory to nonpharmacologic therapy. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are available in 10 mg/10 mg and 20 mg/20 mg combinations and are safe and well tolerated. Early intervention and treatment of NVP may help prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

### The safety of metoclopramide use in the first trimester of pregnancy [^f7b5b532]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

In various countries, metoclopramide is the antiemetic drug of choice in pregnant women, but insufficient information exists regarding its safety in pregnancy.

Methods

We investigated the safety of metoclopramide use during the first trimester of pregnancy by linking a computerized database of medications dispensed between January 1, 1998, and March 31, 2007, to all women registered in the Clalit Health Services, southern district of Israel, with computerized databases containing maternal and infant hospital records from the district hospital during the same period. We assessed associations between the use of metoclopramide in pregnancy and adverse outcomes for the fetus, adjusting for parity, maternal age, ethnic group, presence or absence of maternal diabetes, smoking status, and presence or absence of peripartum fever.

Results

There were 113,612 singleton births during the study period. A total of 81,703 of the infants (71.9%) were born to women registered in Clalit Health Services; 3458 of them (4.2%) were exposed to metoclopramide during the first trimester of pregnancy. Exposure to metoclopramide, as compared with no exposure to the drug, was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations (5.3% and 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 1.21), low birth weight (8.5% and 8.3%; odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14), preterm delivery (6.3% and 5.9%; odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.34), or perinatal death (1.5% and 2.2%; odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.38). The results were materially unchanged when therapeutic abortions of exposed and unexposed fetuses were included in the analysis.

Conclusions

In this large cohort of infants, exposure to metoclopramide in the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of any of several adverse outcomes. These findings provide reassurance regarding the safety of metoclopramide for the fetus when the drug is given to women to relieve nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^82982fa2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Focus group 2, Participant 7: Some days I had to miss school because I couldn't get out of bed. I wasn't eating. So I had to get on the pills to eat at school. Sometimes I had to go home from school because I couldn't stomach watching everyone eat.

Focus Group 2, Participant 3: I was taking public transportation and I had to stop because every time I would be on the bus I would throw up.

Other women described not knowing when nausea and vomiting would occur and how this uncertainty limited their ability to move through their days. Treatment allowed them to regain their confidence and enjoy the experience of being pregnant.

Focus Group 1, Participant 6: To me, there was so much stress and misery with not knowing what — if you were going to be able to go to work or do I have to call out or can I go to the grocery store? I just wanted my pregnancy to have a — to be jovial. I just wanted, like, an overall good juju with the pregnancy, so I just wanted there to be a happy spirit the whole time. So that to me was really important.

What evidence matters to women

We sought to understand how women weighed and interpreted different kinds of evidence. Women got their information from a variety of sources. Many sought information by reviewing the published literature or consulting websites. Others were reassured by their doctors, by the length of time the drug has been on the market or by the experiences of their friends and family.

Focus Group 1, Participant 7: I just looked up Wikipedia, and it said it was safe. I think it's Class A or B, so it's relatively safe. So I just decided to try it.

Focus Group 2, Participant 4: For Zofran [ondansetron], there's few studies, a handful, about heart defects in the baby, but I think that the percentage was from 0.8% or it could have happened anyway from 0.2%, so it wasn't that much of a difference.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^87a2bb82]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish a woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because morning sickness is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric care providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about the safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms. Treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases, and mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

Table 2.
Characteristics of Pregnant Patients Exposed to an Antiemetic Medication During Pregnancy a

Abbreviations: CPRD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink; NA, not applicable.

Counts of the primary and secondary outcomes are provided in Table 3. There were 30 383 fetal deaths during follow-up, most of which (26 519 deaths [87%]) were spontaneous abortions. Fetal death occurred in 12 907 (7.9%) of 163 810 pregnancies exposed to ondansetron, and 17 476 (5.7%) of 306 766 pregnancies exposed only to other antiemetics. There were 233 696 pregnancies in our study of congenital malformations, of which 69 605 (29.8%) were exposed to ondansetron. Crude rate ratios for the time-to-event outcomes were, in Canada and the CPRD combined, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) for fetal death, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87–1.13) for spontaneous abortion, and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.10–1.78) for stillbirth. In the MarketScan database, crude rate ratios were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.54–0.59) for fetal death, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54–0.58) for spontaneous abortion, and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75–0.92) for stillbirth. Adjusted HRs from the time-dependent Cox models are shown in the Figure. After combining results from each database using random-effects meta-analysis, ondansetron use in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of fetal death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.67–1.23), spontaneous abortion (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64–1.04), stillbirth (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79–1.20), or major congenital malformations (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.22). In a subgroup analysis of cardiac malformations, the adjusted ORs for malformations were 1.31 (95% CI, 0.75–2.31) in the British Columbia database and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69–0.96) in the MarketScan database. The risks of other types of major malformations were not modeled separately because of a paucity of events in the Canadian databases.

### Treating morning sickness in the United States – changes in prescribing are needed [^c87886b5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Presently, 97.7% of prescriptions for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in the United States are with medications not labeled for use in pregnancy, not indicated for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, and not classified as safe in pregnancy by the Food and Drug Administration. The use of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has increased from 50,000 monthly prescriptions in 2008 to 110,000 at the end of 2013, despite unresolved issues regarding fetal safety and Food and Drug Administration warnings about serious dysrhythmias. In April 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine, specifically for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy symptoms. Now that a safe and effective drug is available in the United States, there is no reason for women to be exposed to a drug of unproven maternal and fetal safety.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1, 064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^7b00f8c1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

By reviewing the patient files of women with hyperemesis gravidarum in nearly 10% of the pregnant population in Norway between 2002 and 2019, we found an overall increase in use of antiemetics both prior to, during, and after hospitalization. Following the EMA warning in 2013, restricting use of metoclopramide, we found a dramatic, but temporary, drop in the proportion of HG-patients provided antiemetics prehospitally, most notably for metoclopramide. During hospitalization, metoclopramide was persistently replaced by prochlorperazine. In timely association to the restrictions in use of metoclopramide, we observed a shift of hospitalization earlier in pregnancy, and a worrying indication of an increased proportion of HG-patients terminating their pregnancy.

Use of antiemetic medication 2002–2019

Despite an increasing trend in use of antiemetics prior to hospitalization, 4 out of 10 women hospitalized with HG in 2019 had not used antiemetics before the condition required in-patient treatment. Among pregnant women in the UK 1998–2014, higher rates of antiemetic use were registered in women exclusively treated in primary care compared to patients hospitalized for HG, implying that pre-hospital antiemetic treatment prevents hospitalization. HG treatment guidelines from the US and Canada advocate early treatment initiation to reduce need for hospital inpatient treatment, health care visits, and to alleviate the disease burden for the affected women. In line with European HG treatment guidelines, we found that dopamine antagonists and antihistamines constituted nearly all pre-hospital antiemetic treatment. Metoclopramide was used by 60% of those receiving pre-hospital treatment despite not being the dopamine antagonist of choice.

The steady increase in the use of ondansetron pre-, per-, and post-hospitalization complies with the accumulating body of evidence on safety of ondansetron in pregnancy. The systematic inpatient use of combinations of antiemetics including meclizine, prochlorperazine, and/or ondansetron increased in line with the Norwegian treatment guideline recommendations updated in 2014. Combinations of antiemetics with different pharmacological mechanisms of action can have synergistic effects, and are recommended also in UK guidelines for women who do not respond to monotherapy.

### Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^f6c7f868]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea, retching and vomiting are very commonly experienced by women in early pregnancy. There are considerable physical, social and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms. This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy previously published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy, up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (27 April 2013).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy. We excluded trials of interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum, which are covered by another Cochrane review. We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors, in pairs, reviewed the eligibility of trials and independently evaluated the risk of bias and extracted the data for included trials.

Main Results

Thirty-seven trials involving 5049 women, met the inclusion criteria. These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, lemon oil, mint oil, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs. We identified no studies of dietary or other lifestyle interventions. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited. Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy. The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent, though two recent studies support ginger over placebo. There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting. There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes. We were unable to pool findings from studies for most outcomes due to heterogeneity in study participants, interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, women and health professionals need clear guidance about effective and safe interventions, based on systematically reviewed evidence. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support any particular intervention. This is not the same as saying that the interventions studied are ineffective, but that there is insufficient strong evidence for any one intervention. The difficulties in interpreting and pooling the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^453ac803]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

The main analysis of fetal death included 456 963 pregnancies exposed to ondansetron or a comparator antiemetic (249 787 pregnancies [54.7%] in Canada, 197 913 pregnancies [43.3%] in the US, and 9263 pregnancies [2.0%] in the UK; maternal age ≤ 24 years, 93 201 patients [20.4%]; 25–29 years, 149 117 patients [32.6%]; 30–34 years, 142 442 patients [31.2%]; and ≥ 35 years, 72 203 patients [15.8%]). Pregnancies exposed to ondansetron or a comparator were identified from a source population of 4 116 424 pregnancies (Table 1), composed of live births (2 733 517 pregnancies [66.4%]), spontaneous abortions (842 112 pregnancies [20.5%]), induced abortions (501 165 pregnancies [12.2%]), and stillbirths (39 630 pregnancies [1%]). A detailed analysis of drug utilization in our study will be provided in a future publication. In brief, the period prevalence of exposure during pregnancy was 4.5% (185 086 pregnancies) for ondansetron and 11.4% (466 693 pregnancies) for other antiemetics. As expected, most antiemetic exposures were during the first trimester. Although the overall prevalence of antiemetic use was similar in the US (16.2% [296 995 pregnancies]) and Canada (19.3% [340 928 pregnancies) by the end of the study period, it was less in the CPRD database (3.6% [13 856]). In Canada and the UK, 3.0% of antiemetic exposures (10 592 pregnancies) involved ondansetron compared with 58.8% (174 494 pregnancies) in the MarketScan database.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum. The drug ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: a pilot study [^91e6f978]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of all pregnant women. Although NVP is most common during the first trimester of pregnancy, as many as 20% of pregnant women are affected beyond 12 weeks of gestation and throughout the day (vs. isolated to the morning hours). Of the women affected, 1 to 3% experience a severe form of NVP called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) which includes weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. In mild cases, NVP causes discomfort and inconvenience; however, HG can pose significant risks to the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus — often necessitating hospitalization. Even the milder cases of NVP can have a significant impact on the quality of a woman's life and contribute significantly to health care costs and time lost from work. Termination of otherwise wanted pregnancies has been reported in women suffering from severe, prolonged NVP. However, because NVP is rarely life-threatening, the goal of pharmacologic treatment is typically improvement in the quality of life for affected pregnant women.

Several dopamine antagonist antiemetics commonly used in pregnancy also act as weak serotonin receptor antagonists. These include promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. Additionally, the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is an often used antiemetic in pregnancy. These antiemetics have been studied extensively and all seem to be safe for use in pregnancy. However, response to these medications in the treatment of NVP is highly variable. While pharmacologic intervention may ameliorate symptoms in many women, some women improve dramatically while others continue to experience severe NVP despite treatment. As such, pharmacogenetic polymorphisms become an important consideration in evaluating variability in responsiveness to pharmacologic intervention. Many antiemetics are substrates for serotonin receptors and transporters — which are known to have clinically relevant genetic polymorphisms. Previous studies have shown that variations in the HTR3B gene predict the efficacy of antiemetics in cancer patients and the occurrence of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced nausea. However, there have been limited studies which have investigated the effects of the serotonin receptor gene polymorphisms on the efficacy of antiemetics used in the treatment of NVP.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of serotonin receptor subunit HTR3A and HTR3B genotype with NVP severity and antiemetic efficacy.

### Trends in the prevalence and pharmacological management of migraine during pregnancy in the UK, 2000–2018 [^4d96dff1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

The increase in the prevalence of migraine seen in this study might reflect a true increase in prevalence or an increase in the number of women accessing general practice for management of migraine. The increase in prescription rates may therefore partly reflect an increase in the need for migraine treatment and guidance becoming less precautionary around prescribing certain medications during pregnancy. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance has advised that triptans can be considered in the management of migraine during pregnancy since 2012. Amitriptyline and beta-blockers are thought to be safe at low doses and have been recommended in pregnancy. On the other hand, guidance for the use of NSAIDs during pregnancy has become more precautionary over this time period. In 2002, the British Society of Rheumatology and British Health Professionals in Rheumatology advised that NSAIDs were considered safe in the first trimester, but in 2016 advised that they be used with caution. Due to concerns that NSAIDs were associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, it has recently been advised that they should not be taken after 20 weeks of pregnancy (having previously been thought to be safe until 32 weeks). Despite this, an increase in the prevalence of prescribing was seen over the study time period.

If, over time, women have been encouraged to book early with their GP or maternity services to ensure antenatal care is commenced in a timely way, this would increase the number of women seeking care earlier in pregnancy when pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, or migraine episodes are more likely. This may have contributed to the increasing trends in prescriptions for antiemetics and pain relief.

Prescriptions were found to be more likely in women who are already at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Women aged 45–49 years were at a 40% increased risk of being prescribed medications. Advanced maternal age is associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, preterm birth and stillbirth. In England, being of black or South Asian ethnicity or living in a socioeconomically deprived area has been found to be associated with increased risk of stillbirth, preterm births and births with fetal growth restriction. Women with obesity and comorbidities in addition to migraine had higher rates of prescription. Maternal obesity is associated with gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and large for gestational age babies (weight > 90th centile for gestational age), and pre-pregnancy multimorbidity is also associated with increased rates of maternal morbidity and mortality. Any harms associated with these medications will therefore contribute to the risk of adverse outcomes in these groups.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^c60c0b16]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment, because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially when ondansetron was taken in the first trimester. Consequently, it is recommended as second-line therapy. Phenothiazines are another first-line treatment option, including prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and perphenazine. Studies have not shown increased risk for major malformations. Finally, metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, can also be safely prescribed. However, it crosses the placenta and is considered a second-line treatment option, given its potential extrapyramidal effects on both the fetus (third trimester) and the mother (first trimester).

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^fcede069]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Variations were found across countries and regions in the prevalence of nausea, treatment rates, and types of treatment used against nausea during pregnancy. Cultural differences reflected in different treatment traditions, differences between countries with respect to the women's and general practitioners' willingness to treat, and variations in access to prenatal care and treatments and their relative costs may explain several of our findings. Among respondents suffering from nausea, less than one in three used any form of treatment, and only 18% had used any medicine against this complaint. We do not have data on the severity of nausea, and the respondents may generally suffer from mild symptoms that are sufficiently managed by non-pharmacological treatments, such as dietary changes. However, the low prevalence of treatment may also be explained by a reluctance of many general practitioners to treat these women, or by an overestimation of the risk of medicines among pregnant women with nausea. The overall prevalence of nausea (73.5%) in this study is in accordance with a recent meta-analysis of NVP including 59 studies from various countries.

Canada, followed by France, Switzerland and Sweden, had the highest prevalence of conventional medicines use against nausea. This finding may be due to the clear and well known guidelines in this country and the antiemetic Diclectin®, which is approved for use against NVP. Therefore, simplifying the identification of safe and effective treatments may possibly increase the use of treatment. Among the European countries, medicine use was highest in France, which is in line with the results of a study of drug utilisation in pregnancy that included six European Registries of Congenital Anomalies in four European countries: France, Great Britain, Italy, and the Netherlands. The authors of the study found that the two centres in France had the highest prevalence of medicine use (80.8% and 74.2%), and that antinauseants were the most frequently consumed drugs in this country (20.9% and 15.0%). We found that several French respondents used metopimazine, a dopamine antagonist, which was not reported in any of the other countries. This finding is in accordance with a comparative study by Einarson and colleagues in 1998 in which France was the only country to list metopimazine as a treatment option. In Sweden, antihistamines were the most frequently used medicines against nausea, which is also in line with previous findings.

### Knowledge and practice of community pharmacists regarding the safety of drugs during pregnancy: a cross-sectional study from a developing country [^4184f50a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inappropriate drug use during pregnancy poses considerable risks to both the mother and the fetus, causing maternal complications and adverse fetal outcomes. Assessment of potential fetal harm resulting from drugs is challenging due to ethical considerations. Pregnancy-related data on most available drugs are derived from observational studies. In the premarketing stage, data on medication safety are based on experimental animal studies, as new drugs do not include pregnant women in clinical trials. However, the reliability of establishing a pregnancy safety profile at that stage is limited due to difficulties in extrapolating from these animal studies.

Medical regulatory authorities worldwide have developed risk classification systems that categorize medications based on the associated risks and benefits while recognizing the limitations of such classifications and the importance of case-by-case clinical evaluation. Indeed, evaluating drug safety is complex. The teratogenic risk of drugs, for example, depends on several factors, such as drug dosage, route of administration, treatment duration, and gestational age during which the drug is used. Moreover, physiological changes during pregnancy may alter the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs.

Drugs may be used during pregnancy to manage preexisting health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes; treat medical complications of pregnancy such as preeclampsia; and alleviate pregnancy-induced symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The most frequently used medications during pregnancy include antibiotics, antifungal agents, iron tablets, analgesics, antiemetics and antacids. This is in addition to self-medicating with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbs, which are more difficult to assess. While global estimates of drug use during pregnancy vary across different settings, most studies indicate a high utilization rate. A large web-based survey showed that more than 80% of pregnant women in the Americas, Australia and Europe used at least one medication, either prescribed or OTC. Regionally, a study from Saudi Arabia reported that almost 40% of women used medicines or herbs during pregnancy. In Palestine, the utilization of drugs during pregnancy is common. A study of pregnant women revealed that more than two-thirds of participants reported taking prescription-only medications, while most took vitamins, iron, and calcium supplements. Another study investigated the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) among pregnant women. Most participants (87.7%) used nonherbal, biologically based drugs, including vitamins and supplements. In addition, the use of herbs during pregnancy was found to be prevalent, ranging between 77.1% and 88.4%.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^81468162]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. The ACOG and SOGC guidelines suggest ondansetron as an adjunctive therapy for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy when other antiemetic combinations have failed. The RCOG guidelines suggest reassuring pregnant women about the very small increase in the absolute risk of orofacial clefting with ondansetron use in the first trimester, while also considering the risks of poorly managed hyperemesis gravidarum. The drug ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1, 064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^d2556269]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are common pregnancy complaints, affecting nearly 70% of pregnant women to some degree, from mild to severe. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is the most severe form of pregnancy sickness which inhibits normal fluid and/or food intake and strongly limits activities of daily living. A global meta-analysis and a large UK population study found a prevalence of HG of 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Secondary to persisting nausea and vomiting, HG can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and metabolic disturbances, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. In addition to maternal risk of anemia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and preeclampsia, HG is associated with low fetal birth weight and preterm birth. HG-sufferers report symptoms that can be nearly unbearable, illustrated by the findings that half of the HG-patients in a large UK survey considered to terminate the pregnancy, and one in four experienced occasional suicidal ideation. Additionally, there is a considerable risk of recurrent HG in future pregnancies and many who have had HG are reluctant to become pregnant again.

First-line antiemetics for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP)/HG have traditionally included antihistamines (meclizine, promethazine, and cyclizine), and dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine, and chlorpromazine) as these have reassuring evidence of safety in pregnancy. None of these has been demonstrated as significantly better in reducing NVP. If moderate NVP-symptoms persist despite complementary treatment, guidelines in general recommend these first-line antiemetics to be offered to reduce need for health care visits, hospital inpatient treatment, and to alleviate the disease burden for the affected women. For severe NVP or HG, ambulatory or inpatient hospital care are usually required to provide fluid and nutritional treatment. The serotonin antagonist ondansetron is a second line antiemetic option due to suspicion of a small increased risk of orofacial clefts. Prednisolone can be used as an antiemetic in refractory cases. Antiemetics are commonly prescribed off label, as many countries, including Norway, do not have NVP/HG as licensed indication.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^f2e83cec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Antiemetics

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) constitute important adverse effects of treatment and the probability of its occurrence corresponds directly to the intrinsic emetogenicity of the agents used. Thus, in order to guide the choice of antiemesis agents or combination thereof, the various regimens are classified into high (> 90%), moderate (30–90%), low (10–30%), and minimal emetic risk (< 10%). Yet, the time of onset of nausea and vomiting is also of clinical importance, because drugs may differ in their ability to prevent bouts, whether emesis is acute, delayed or anticipatory. Although there is a wide variety of agents with antiemetic properties, the set used in patients receiving chemotherapy is rather specific and consists of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (ondansetron, palonosetron etc.), neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant etc.), glucocorticoids and olanzapine. Dopaminergic antagonists like prochlorperazine and metoclopramide have also been used in the past, while nowadays they are reserved as rescue therapy due to their relatively limited efficacy and the adverse effects from dopaminergic blockade associated with prolonged administration.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^9efc7161]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Another agent which has been examined sufficiently as to its compatibility with pregnancy and its potency against nausea and vomiting is metoclopramide. In utero exposure to metoclopramide during the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations, LBW, pre-term delivery or perinatal death. In addition, a very large study comparing pregnancy outcomes between exposed and un-exposed mothers discovered no link between exposure and 20 individual major congenital malformation categories, spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Despite unanimity regarding metoclopramide's safety during pregnancy, there are some serious issues concerning maternal side-effects. Although comparable to ondansetron, metoclopramide is associated with increased frequency of drowsiness and dry mouth. What is far more important though, is that prolonged administration -beyond 12 weeks- is correlated with the development of irreversible tardive dyskinesia (FDA black box warning), especially in females.

Table 1.
Pregnancies in Included Databases, by Pregnancy Outcome a

Abbreviation: CPRD, Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

Baseline characteristics of the study cohort for the primary outcome are presented in Table 2 according to the first antiemetic received, which was ondansetron for 150 197 pregnancies and was another antiemetic for 306 766 pregnancies. There were 13 613 of 163 810 ondansetron-exposed patients overall who received ondansetron after another antiemetic. Treatment time for those pregnancies was counted proportionately in both exposure categories, but events were counted only in the ondansetron category. Ontario was excluded from the analysis of fetal death because of an insufficient number of exposed events. Patients exposed to ondansetron were slightly older than those exposed to a comparator, with those younger than 25 years noticeably less likely to use ondansetron (16.5% of ondansetron-exposed pregnancies) than another antiemetic (22.3% pregnancies exposed only to other antiemetics). Use of ondansetron increased during most of the study period, from 28 pregnancies between 2001 and 2004 to 75 576 pregnancies between 2011 and 2013, before becoming less prevalent between 2014 and 2016, with 23 787 pregnancies. There was a marked difference in pregnancy history between the exposure groups, with patients exposed to ondansetron being less likely to have a history of live birth (2.1% of ondansetron-exposed pregnancies vs 37.4% of pregnancies exposed to other antiemetcis) or history of spontaneous abortion (9.9% of ondanestron-exposed pregnancies vs 19.5% of pregnancies exposed to other antiemetics). This association was attributable primarily to the MarketScan data where, generally, less medical history data were available. The use of various prescription drugs and medical services was variable and at least partly attributable to inclusion of US data, where ondansetron is much more commonly used and patterns of health care utilization are unlike those in Canada.

8. Use in Specific Populations

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron use and major birth defects have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations that preclude conclusions about the safety of ondansetron use in pregnancy (see Data). Available postmarketing data have not identified a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered during organogenesis at approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area, respectively (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriages, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Available data on ondansetron use in pregnant women from several published epidemiological studies preclude an assessment of a drug-associated risk of adverse fetal outcomes due to important methodological limitations, including the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, recall bias, and other unadjusted confounders.

Our results were robust to the exclusion of the large MarketScan database and remained robust after sensitivity and subgroup analysis (Table 4). In general, restricting exposure assessment to the first trimester and to second-line exposures resulted point estimates closer to the null. The exception to these overall findings was the results for exposure during 4 to 10 weeks gestation, which suggested an increased risk of stillbirth in the Canadian databases (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01–2.66) and a protective association in the US data (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42–0.66). The analysis in the British Columbia database, which allowed for bidirectional switching between ondansetron and a comparator, yielded an HR for the primary outcome of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.71–1.18), which was close to the HR of 0.90 in the main British Columbia analysis.

### Hyperemesis gravidarum [^82926efd]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum describes nausea and vomiting in pregnancy severe enough to cause weight loss, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and nutritional deficiencies. The condition can render women so physically and mentally unwell that they are at increased risk of terminating a wanted pregnancy and experiencing suicidal ideation. Concerns regarding prescribing in pregnancy and inaccurate assumptions that the condition is self-limiting result in women being dismissed and having difficulty accessing appropriate care. Over the past decade, a wealth of literature has been published that gives new insights into the causes of hyperemesis gravidarum, the safety of antiemetic therapy, and short-term and long-term consequences for women with the condition and their children. This Review summarises the findings of this literature with the aim of informing decisions about the care of these women and future research priorities.

In 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a warning regarding licensed use of the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide due to risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects limiting treatment duration to up to five days and reducing dose recommendations. These recommendations were issued as a general precaution for metoclopramide by the Norwegian Medicines Agency in July 2013. Even though risk and benefit associated with use of metoclopramide for NVP/HG was not a part of the EMA safety review, the five-day limit was implemented in the Norwegian HG treatment guidelines in the 2014 update and UK green top guidelines in 2016. Subsequently, despite a very good fetal safety profile, metoclopramide was considered a second-line option due to risk of maternal adverse effects. The dopamine antagonists prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine were preferred. Between 2004 and 2017, 60% of all antiemetic prescription fills during pregnancy in the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) were for metoclopramide, but changes in treatment provision for patients with HG related to the metoclopramide warning has not previously been investigated.

The aim of this study was to describe the antiemetic treatment provided for patients hospitalized for HG at a Norwegian university hospital and elucidate changes in patient characteristics and outcomes over time, including the impact of the EMA-warning on treatment and outcomes in patients with HG.

The standard recommendation to take prenatal vitamins for 1 month before fertilization may reduce the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The appropriate management of abnormal maternal thyroid tests attributable to gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, or hyperemesis gravidarum, or both, includes supportive therapy, and antithyroid drugs are not recommended.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^828f8c51]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Respondents who had a lower education were more likely to use medicines against nausea. This finding is in accordance with a Swedish study. Respondents working as health care professionals were also more likely to use medicines against nausea, which can be explained by this group being aware of safe and effective treatment options for nausea. Multiple pregnancy was associated with the use of medicines. This may indicate that use of medicines may act as a marker of severe forms of nausea, as it is previously found that multiple pregnancy increase the risk of nausea. In addition, the severity of NVP symptoms has been associated with the use of antiemetics.

We found a high burden of co-morbidity among respondents experiencing nausea during pregnancy. The association with symptoms of depression and sick leave in particular warrants attention. Women who suffer from any pregnancy-related complaint may tend to seek information on the internet to a greater extent than women who feel well. Therefore, the respondents may be seeking information and responding at the peak of their discomfort. However, symptoms of depression have also been associated with nausea during pregnancy. Similarly, the association with heartburn and reflux problems is in agreement with previous studies. Clinicians should be aware of the high degree of co-morbidity with nausea and routinely ask women with nausea whether they have reflux problems or other pregnancy-related ailments.

Exposure Measurement

We studied patients who used prescription ondansetron or a comparator antiemetic from a community pharmacy during pregnancy. Eligible comparator drugs were diclectin (doxylamine with pyridoxine), metoclopramide, or promethazine. For fetal death and stillbirth, exposure to antiemetic medications was assessed any time during gestation. For spontaneous abortion, exposure was assessed from the beginning of gestation until the occurrence of an outcome or 140 days gestation (20 weeks), whichever occurred first. For major congenital malformations, exposure was assessed during the first 84 days of gestation (12 weeks) only. In sensitivity analyses, exposure for all outcomes was between 29 and 70 days (4 to 10 weeks) of gestation, an assumed period of maximal susceptibility of the fetus to teratogenic effects.

For the primary outcome and for the secondary outcomes of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, exposure was defined as a time-dependent variable to avoid immortal time bias; this was particularly important given the likelihood that ondansetron would be second-line therapy for NVP in Canada, and hence prescribed later during pregnancy than comparators. Using this approach, follow-up began with first use of ondansetron or a comparator drug, and patients were considered exposed until the end of pregnancy, regardless of the quantity or days supply of medication dispensed. Patients who were dispensed a comparator drug followed by ondansetron could contribute person-time to both exposure categories, as defined by the first dispensing dates of the comparator and ondansetron. Once a patient was exposed to ondansetron, she was considered ondansetron-exposed until the end of follow-up. A patient who received only a comparator antiemetic was considered comparator-exposed until the end of follow-up. For major congenital malformations, exposure was defined using a time-fixed approach, in which patients dispensed only a comparator medication were assigned to the comparator group, and those dispensed ondansetron were assigned to the ondansetron group, regardless of whether they also received a comparator. Details of exposure ascertainment methods are provided in eAppendix 4 in the Supplement.

### Comparison of antiemetics for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in an emergency department setting [^53332045]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare time from medication administration to disposition from the Emergency Department (ED) between women treated for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with different antiemetic agents.

Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study of women 13 weeks gestation or less treated in our Women and Infants Hospital ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy between 2009 and 2011. Data was collected on patient demographics, antiemetics used, and time to disposition. We analyzed time of administration of the antiemetic used first line (ondansetron versus metoclopramide versus promethazine or prochlorperazine) to time the discharge order was placed.

Results

We analyzed data from 439 women treated in the ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Forty-four percent received ondansetron alone, 47% received any other antiemetic alone, and 9% received more than one agent first line. Antiemetic agent selected did not differ by patient age, parity, current treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, orthostatics, ketonuria or disposition. We found no difference in time from medication administration to disposition between women who received ondansetron and women who received any other antiemetic (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine or promethazine). Adjusting for potential confounders, compared to patients who received any other first line therapy, patients who received ondansetron had 2.09 times the odds of having a time to disposition at or above the 75th percentile (95% CI 1.31–3.34).

Conclusions

The use of ondansetron in the ED for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was associated with similar mean time from administration to disposition as other antiemetics.

### Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of patients treated with ondansetron vs alternative antiemetic medications in a multinational, population-based cohort [^c0fe3bc6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The stillbirth sensitivity analyses showed associations with ondansetron exposure during 4 to 10 weeks of gestation: harmful in Canada and protective in the US. These associations, which were closer to the null in the main analysis, are likely to be spurious and may be a consequence of selection bias from excluding women from the sensitivity analysis who used antiemetics before 4 weeks of gestation. In Canada, such patients were more likely to have used a reference antiemetic other than ondansetron, and in Canada ondansetron tends to be used after other antiemetics have been tried. Exclusion of patients in Canada using antiemetics in the first few weeks of pregnancy thus excluded more patients treated with a comparator than with ondansetron. The opposite was true in the US, where ondansetron is more likely to be used as first-line therapy for NVP.

Identification of some pregnancy outcomes in our claims databases was subject to misclassification. We assumed such misclassification was nondifferential between ondansetron-exposed patients and those who received an active comparator drug. However, this may be a strong assumption given the pattern of use of ondansetron as first-line therapy in the US and as second-line therapy in Canada. GA will also have been estimated with error because it was imputed in some instances in the Canadian data and in all records in the MarketScan database. Our databases generally lacked nonprescription and over-the-counter therapies used in pregnancy. Our inability to assess inpatient use of ondansetron, which comprised important proportions of exposures in the studies by Zambelli-Weiner et aland Lemon et al, could introduce immeasurable time bias by misclassifying exposure in some patients with severe NVP, thus diluting the association with ondansetron in studies comparing users with nonusers, unlike our study that used a comparator. We expect this posed minimal threat to the validity of our analyses because hospitalization with hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in approximately 1% of all pregnanciesand because of evidence from Huybrechts and colleagues, who reported that intravenously administered ondansetron was not associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac malformations, oral clefts, or congenital malformations overall.

In the same spirit, glucocorticoids have been studied as to their antiemetic values and their possible effect on pregnancy outcomes. Glucocorticoids have been used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum with rather mixed results. Nonetheless, they are appropriate as monotherapy in low-emetogenicity regimens, while they appear to have a synergistic effect with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and are thus part of the antiemetic treatment indicated for higher emetogenicity schemes. Similarly to metoclopramide, they have been associated with oral cavity abnormalities, but the risk seems to be elevated only when exposure has occurred during the first trimester of gestation.

Finally, NK-1 receptor antagonists and olanzapine have been scrutinized as to their ability to prevent nausea and vomiting, as well as their compatibility to pregnancy. Both these agents are very effective antiemetics when used in combination with the aforementioned drugs, as they significantly decrease the chance of acute and delayed emesis, associated with highly emetogenic regimen. Unfortunately, there is not a great amount of data regarding the safety of NK-1 receptor antagonists during pregnancy, but the 1st generation agent aprepitant has been classified as "Pregnancy Class B" by the FDA. On the other hand however, olanzapine has been thoroughly studied in the context of gestation. Olanzapine has a 72% placental passage ratio, but in utero exposure even during the first trimester was not correlated to increased rates of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and major congenital malformations. Nonetheless, there are indications that exposure to second generation antipsychotics may be linked to elevated incidence of atrial and ventricular septal defects of the newborn. There are also studies investigating the effect of these drugs on birth weight and psychokinetic development; more research is needed however and the available body of evidence is inconclusive.

Despite the rather reassuring profile of aprepitant and olanzapine, the present guidelines on supportive medication for gynecologic cancer in pregnancy have approved for use only 5-HT3 antagonists, metoclopramide, methylprednisolone, prednisolone or hydrocortisone and only when necessary.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^a756e31c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — pharmacologic therapies and delivery modalities emphasize early initiation, alternative routes when oral therapy is not tolerated, and limited support for subcutaneous pumps. Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is recommended to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum, and in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) initiating antiemetic therapy before symptom onset was associated with reduced severity compared with starting a combination of doxylamine and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) after onset. When oral medications are not tolerated, other administration modalities may be beneficial: some phenothiazines (promethazine, prochlorperazine) are available as rectal suppositories, and serotonin 5‑hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5‑HT3) receptor antagonists are available as an oral dissolvable tablet (ondansetron) or a transdermal patch (granisetron). Evidence for continuous subcutaneous microinfusion pumps to deliver metoclopramide or ondansetron is limited, adverse effects were seen in 11–31% of selected patients, and these pumps do not appear to be cost effective compared with conventional alternatives including periodic hospitalization.

### Nausea, vomiting and poor appetite during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in rural Nepal: an observational cohort study [^907e7579]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, the results suggest nausea, vomiting or poor appetite during pregnancy in this limited resource setting have a significant impact on birth outcomes, particularly in the second and third trimesters. These symptoms are often considered to be normal in pregnancy given that they are so common and generally self-limiting, but the effects of such symptoms in settings where resources and access to health care are limited need to be examined. Several studies have shown that women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy tend to change their diet during pregnancy and steer away from certain foods. Limited resources may affect the woman's ability to adjust her diet accordingly. These results challenge the notion that nausea and vomiting are harmless symptoms of pregnancy, which can be used to raise awareness among pregnant women and health care workers in these settings. Of note, limited resource settings are not confined to rural areas of developing countries, which is where this study took place. Attention should be given as well to these issues in urban parts of developing countries and potentially in certain areas of higher income countries, which may be highly affected by poverty and health disparities as well.

While the evidence for efficacy is currently limited, there are several accepted treatments for nausea and vomiting that are considered safe in pregnancy. These include pre-conception vitamin supplementation, dietary changes, pharmacologic treatment with antiemetics or vitamin B6, and intravenous fluid replacement. In addition, studies have shown that treatment of early symptoms may prevent later complications. In terms of pharmacologic treatment, several medications are considered safe and effective. These include vitamin B6 supplementation with or without doxylamine, which is considered first line pharmacologic treatment in the United States, and dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide. While some of these interventions may not be suitable for low resource settings, nutritional support, pre-conception vitamin supplementation, and oral rehydration therapy could be considered relatively inexpensive interventions in terms of reducing the impact of nausea and vomiting in these settings. Micronutrient deficiencies and limited access to adequate nutrition is a significant concern in developing countries. Given this, targeted interventions in low resource settings may have an even greater benefit on reducing the impact of nausea, vomiting and poor appetite in pregnancy, including reducing the impact of milder symptoms that would not have been medically treated in a high income setting.

### Re-analysis of safety data supporting doxylamine use for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^db949404]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). We re-analyzed the 24 primary studies cited in a 1997 meta-analysis that concluded antihistamine use for NVP was safe as they had been studied in more than 200,000 participating women and the pooled odds ratio for congenital malformations was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60–0.94). Our analysis of this meta-analysis showed that 139,414 women were included in 22 original studies involving antihistamines, 129,108 of which were in studies involving doxylamine. In these studies, 23,485 women were exposed to antihistamines, 14,624 of which were exposed to doxylamine. The summary relative risk (cohort studies) and odds ratio (case-control studies) for congenital malformations from antihistamine exposure were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01–1.18) and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91–1.19), and for doxylamine exposure, the summary relative risk and odds ratio were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.80–1.10) and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.93–1.23), respectively. Although not a new systematic review, our re-analysis demonstrates that the safety data for antihistamines, and doxylamine in particular, are based on many fewer than 200,000 participating women and exposures, and that doxylamine use is not associated with a decreased risk of malformations as previously reported.

Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses

Several sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed. First, the MarketScan database and the CPRD were excluded from the meta-analyses to generate Canada-only estimates. Further analyses were repeated under the following scenarios: (1) examining only antiemetic exposures occurring during the first 4 to 10 weeks of GA; (2) when a patient became pregnant more than once, restricting the analyses to only the first pregnancy; (3) comparison of second-line ondansetron exposure to second-line comparator exposure, as measured by the second class of antiemetic taken by patients who took more than 1 antiemetic; (4) a matched-pair cohort analysis of siblings to examine potential confounding by genetic and environmental factors; (5) an analysis of cardiac malformations; and (6) an analysis that permitted bidirectional switching between ondansetron and comparator drugs. The sibling analysis was conducted in the British Columbia database, which was the only database where a combination of cohort size and longitudinal mother-infant linkage would permit such an analysis. The sibling cohort included pairs of siblings who were born during the study period and for whom the mother was exposed to ondansetron during 1 pregnancy but not the other. For patients with parity of 3 or higher, priority was given to discordant ondansetron-comparator matches. If more than 1 ondansetron-comparator pair occurred, then 1 was selected at random. Analysis of cardiac malformations was limited to the British Columbia and MarketScan databases because only those databases contained sufficient sample sizes. A model with bidirectional switching was estimated in the largest Canadian database (British Columbia) as a check of our approach in the main analysis that once a patient was exposed to ondansetron, she was considered exposed until the end of pregnancy.

### Treating pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting with ginger [^8a70b23c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature assessing the safety and efficacy of the use of ginger to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Data Sources

Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-September 2004), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1971-September 2004), MEDLINE (1966-September 2004), and EMBASE (1966-September 2004) were searched. Key terms included ginger, nausea, vomiting, emesis, and pregnancy.

Data Synthesis

Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ginger in the management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy were reviewed. Various doses and forms of ginger were used to treat women during their first and second trimesters of pregnancy. Ginger has been shown to improve the symptoms of nausea and vomiting compared with placebo in pregnant women.

Conclusions

While data are insufficient to recommend ginger universally and there are concerns with product quality due to limited regulation of dietary supplements, ginger appears to be a fairly low-risk and effective treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy. In low doses, this may be appropriate for patients not responding to traditional first-line therapies.
