## Question

What are idsa recommendations for antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about IDSA recommendations for antibiotics in aspiration pneumonia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration pneumonia. Then, I should verify the current guideline stance on routine anaerobic coverage. Next, I will review the evidence base supporting limited versus extended anaerobic coverage. After that, I need to define the specific exceptions where anaerobic therapy is warranted. Then, I will outline empiric regimens for community-acquired versus healthcare-associated or severe presentations. I should also confirm duration, stewardship, and de-escalation principles. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach with citations integrated throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction, because I need to ensure we are not conflating sterile chemical pneumonitis with bacterial infection. Aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury from gastric contents that often resolves within 24–48 hours with supportive care and does not require antibiotics, whereas aspiration pneumonia is an infectious process warranting antimicrobial therapy; many hospitalized aspiration events are pneumonitis rather than pneumonia, so I should be cautious not to overtreat with antibiotics when the presentation is purely chemical inflammation [^1168zSU9] [^1167XRej].

> Next, I should review the current guideline position on anaerobic coverage. The 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline issues a conditional recommendation against routinely adding anaerobic coverage for suspected aspiration pneumonia unless there is concern for lung abscess or empyema, reflecting very low-quality evidence and contemporary data showing anaerobes are infrequently isolated in aspiration pneumonia cohorts [^1168zSU9] [^117XDemK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the evidence base supporting that stance. Large observational comparative studies show no mortality benefit for extended anaerobic coverage versus limited anaerobic coverage, but do demonstrate a higher risk of Clostridioides difficile with extended anaerobic therapy; these findings align with earlier smaller studies and reinforce the guideline's caution against routine anaerobic coverage in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [^113bfzA8] [^1151ZYmX] [^113TjUoK].

> I will now examine the exceptions where anaerobic coverage is appropriate, because missing these would be a mistake. I need to ensure I add anaerobic therapy when there is clinical or radiographic evidence of lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, or empyema, and I should also consider it in severe presentations with septic shock, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation where polymicrobial infection is more likely; in these scenarios, agents like amoxicillin–clavulanate, piperacillin–tazobactam, or a beta-lactam plus metronidazole or clindamycin are reasonable choices guided by local epidemiology and severity [^1168zSU9] [^1169m5ie] [^112qM9Uc].

> Let me think about empiric therapy for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia without severe features or abscess/empyema. For nonsevere inpatient CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk, standard regimens such as a beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy are recommended; ceftriaxone or levofloxacin monotherapy is acceptable in many cases, and I should avoid adding routine anaerobic coverage unless the exception criteria are met, consistent with stewardship principles and the 2019 guideline [^113bfzA8] [^1168zSU9].

> But wait, what if the patient has healthcare-associated risk factors, severe illness, or is in the ICU. In those cases, I should confirm risk for MRSA and Pseudomonas and broaden empiric therapy accordingly, using MRSA-active agents when indicated and considering antipseudomonal coverage with attention to local antibiograms; for severe HAP/VAP phenotypes, combination antipseudomonal therapy may be warranted initially in high-risk settings, with prompt de-escalation once cultures return, and I must remember that routine anaerobic coverage is still not indicated unless abscess or empyema is suspected [^116e7UWk] [^11411vru] [^111bvyr5] [^1168zSU9].

> I should double-check duration and stewardship steps, because overtreatment is common. A 5–7 day total course is generally sufficient for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia, with 5 days reasonable in many patients if they are clinically improving; I need to obtain cultures when feasible, reassess at 48–72 hours, and de-escalate or stop antibiotics if the clinical trajectory supports noninfectious pneumonitis or if cultures do not support bacterial infection, aligning with CAP and stewardship guidance [^116N89Kk] [^1121NzV4] [^117DLH1Y].

> Let me consider special populations, since nuances matter. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and practice varies; shorter courses appear noninferior and stewardship interventions can safely reduce duration without increasing failure, so I should individualize therapy and avoid unnecessary anaerobic coverage in the absence of abscess or empyema. In older adults, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion for aspiration and recognize that systemic inflammatory responses may be blunted, which can delay recognition and influence antibiotic decisions and supportive care planning [^111pfRjw] [^111hhGA7] [^1123LRoC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought anaerobes were the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia based on older teaching, but I should correct that assumption. Contemporary data show anaerobes are uncommonly isolated in aspiration pneumonia cohorts, and routine anti-anaerobic therapy does not improve outcomes while increasing C. difficile risk; therefore, my default should be limited anaerobic coverage with escalation only when specific complications or high-risk features are present [^117XDemK] [^113bfzA8] [^1168zSU9].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia and withhold antibiotics for pure chemical pneumonitis; for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia without severe features or abscess/empyema, use standard CAP regimens without routine anaerobic coverage; add anaerobic therapy when abscess, empyema, necrotizing pneumonia, or severe presentations with shock/ICU/ventilation are present; tailor empiric breadth for healthcare-associated risks including MRSA and Pseudomonas; keep total duration short with 5–7 days when improving; and apply stewardship with early reassessment, cultures when feasible, and de-escalation to minimize harm and resistance [^1168zSU9] [^117DLH1Y] [^116e7UWk] [^116N89Kk].

IDSA recommends **standard CAP regimens** for aspiration pneumonia [^1168zSU9] and advises **no routine anaerobic coverage** unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111TRU1E]. For nonsevere cases, use a **β-lactam plus macrolide** or a **respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^117DLH1Y]; for severe cases, use a **β-lactam plus macrolide** or a **β-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^112LnUKE]. Add **anaerobic coverage** only if abscess or empyema is present [^1168zSU9]. Treat for 5–7 days, extending to 10–14 days if complications occur [^notfound]. Avoid **prophylactic antibiotics** for aspiration pneumonitis [^114UiLH5].

---

## Clinical context and definitions

Aspiration pneumonia is a **subset of CAP** [^113TjUoK] that occurs when oropharyngeal or gastric contents are aspirated into the lower respiratory tract, leading to infection. It is essential to distinguish aspiration pneumonia from aspiration pneumonitis, which is a **chemical injury** from gastric contents and does not require antibiotics [^1168zSU9].

---

## IDSA recommendations for antibiotic therapy

The IDSA provides **clear recommendations** for managing aspiration pneumonia:

- **Standard CAP regimens**: IDSA recommends using standard CAP regimens for aspiration pneumonia, as anaerobic bacteria are not routinely identified as primary pathogens in aspiration pneumonia [^117XDemK].

- **No routine anaerobic coverage**: Routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended unless there is clinical suspicion of lung abscess or empyema [^1168zSU9].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Empiric therapy should be guided by the severity of illness, patient-specific risk factors, and local epidemiology [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

The IDSA recommends the following **antibiotic regimens** for aspiration pneumonia:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|
| Nonsevere aspiration pneumonia | - β-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) plus macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) [^notfound] <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) alone [^111PC2Cb] |
| Severe aspiration pneumonia | - β-lactam (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus macrolide (azithromycin) [^notfound] <br/> - Or β-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) [^notfound] |
| Suspected lung abscess or empyema | Add anaerobic coverage (clindamycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin-clavulanate) [^1168zSU9] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The IDSA recommends a **duration of antibiotic therapy** of 5–7 days for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia [^notfound]. If complications such as lung abscess or empyema are present, extend therapy to 10–14 days.

---

## Special considerations

- **Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP)**: In patients with HCAP or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), antibiotic selection should consider local resistance patterns and risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) [^1169hd3S].

- **Pediatric patients**: Pediatric patients with aspiration pneumonia should receive age-appropriate CAP regimens, with antibiotic selection guided by local epidemiology and patient-specific factors [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: IDSA emphasizes the importance of antibiotic stewardship, including de-escalation of therapy based on culture results and clinical response [^111oX58p].

---

## Summary of IDSA recommendations

- **Use standard CAP regimens** for aspiration pneumonia [^117XDemK].

- **Do not routinely add anaerobic coverage** unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected [^111TRU1E].

- **Treat for 5–7 days**, extending to 10–14 days if complications arise [^notfound].

- **Consider local resistance patterns** and patient-specific factors when selecting antibiotics [^11346AWb].

Antibiotic therapy is an essential part of management for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been debated and changed over time. Historically, anaerobic bacteria were thought to be the predominant pathogen in aspiration pneumonia. However, in more recent prospective studies, anaerobes were isolated in only 0.5% cases of aspiration pneumoniaand 16% of isolated bacteria.

Thus, the 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on CAP recommend to not routinely add anaerobic coverage in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and to treat with first-line antibiotics for CAP such as ceftriaxone or levofloxacin. This recommendation also considered the potential harmful consequences of broader empiric antibiotic coverage that increase risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis and select for antimicrobial resistance.

Very little evidence is available on the comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotic therapy with limited or extended anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. A recent systematic review found three relevant studies (two observational studies and one randomized controlled trial). All three studies did not show a significant difference in mortality or clinical cure rate with extended anaerobic coverage. However, the small sample sizes that ranged from 117 to 637 patients led to imprecise estimates with large CIs that cannot exclude clinically important differences.

A large multicenter study of aspiration pneumonia that compares first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage is needed to conclude if any clinically important differences exist in effectiveness and adverse effects. To this end, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia to compare first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of C difficile colitis.

Discussion

In this retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia across 18 hospital sites, in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between EAC and LAC groups (adjusted risk difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%). The lower CI limit of –1.7% excluded a clinically important difference of 3% mortality reduction. Thus, extended anaerobic coverage seemed unlikely to lead to a clinically important improvement in mortality. However, extended anaerobic coverage was associated with a significantly increased risk of C difficile colitis (adjusted risk difference, 1.0%; 95% CI 0.3%-1.7%). These findings suggest that extended anaerobic antibiotic coverage did not offer any additional benefit for aspiration pneumonia and could have increased the risk of harm.

Our study findings are consistent with those from a small randomized controlled trialand three prior observational studies. Similar to these four studies, our study did not show a significant difference between LAC and EAC groups in terms of mortality. Unlike the prior three studies, our study included only patients receiving first-line antibiotic agents for CAP. In addition, our study showed a much larger sample size that was more than four times the sample size of all four studies combined. This allowed for a more precise estimate with a narrow 95% CI to exclude a clinically important difference.

Our study findings have important implications. This study adds strong real-world clinical evidence to the ATS and IDSA 2019 CAP guidelines recommendation of not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. Patients with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia can be treated with ceftriaxone or levofloxacin without adding another antibiotic for anaerobic coverage. The avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic administration can decrease the risk of antibiotic adverse effects, especially C difficile colitis. On a larger scale, limiting unnecessary antibiotic use may lower antibiotic selective pressure and may result in less antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, antimicrobial stewardship programs can implement targeted interventions to de-escalate antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^111PC2Cb]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician's intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines. The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111abrfR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pulmonary infections are one of the most common causes of fever in critically ill patients, affecting an estimated 25%–33% of ICU patients, this is more common in trauma and the risk is increased in certain injury patterns and with increased injury severity. Neither fever nor leukocytosis, nor the combination are associated with positive respiratory cultures, but they are frequently obtained even in the absence of X-ray findings or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Respiratory cultures may help support the diagnosis, but the presence of bacteria on culture is not diagnostic of a pneumonia because a majority of intubated patients will have colonization of the endotracheal tube — this is especially true if tracheal aspirates are used, although the use of bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) does not eliminate false positives or false negatives. Unfortunately, a positive culture is often routinely managed with antibiotics regardless of the diagnostic impression.

The clinical determination or strong suspicion of the syndrome of pneumonia should guide whether or not cultures are initiated. Information for this determination includes imaging findings (chest X-ray, ultrasound or CT), new or acutely worsened oxygenation deficit, the onset of purulent secretions, with concomitant new fever or white count that is not otherwise explained. We find that the clustering of factors in the correct clinical setting is more useful than a single score or numerical cut-off.

There is no strong data to support BAL, mini-BAL, or protected specimen brushing over non-invasive methods of tracheal aspiration or for semi-quantitative over qualitative cultures. An argument can be made for or against either. The joint guideline from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) weakly recommends non-invasive sampling based on low-quality evidence, while in trauma patients the utility of mini-BAL has been demonstrated specifically in its ability to parse the diagnosis of pneumonia from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We recommend institutional multidisciplinary review of accepted practices and verification of correct interpretation based on techniques used.

Question

When is it appropriate to hold antibiotics in cases of fever in the ICU?

Recommendation

Due to significant harm associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, it is important to evaluate the likelihood of infection when deciding for or against empiric antibiotic initiation. Once started, de-escalation or stoppage should occur in a timely manner with decision-support by multidisciplinary evaluation and local protocols. Procalcitonin can be used in the context of a multidisciplinary institutional protocol, however, the utility is limited in critically injured patients and certain surgical populations.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^116PUCd6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 3,999 patients included in the study, 2,683 patients (67.1%) and 1,316 patients (32.9%) were in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively (Fig 1). The antibiotics used in each group are described in e-Table 1. The median duration of receiving antibiotics was 5 days (IQR, 3–7 days) and 7 days (IQR, 4–8 days) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. The excluded patients treated with only oral antibiotics are described in e-Table 2. These patients were younger and showed less severe illness based on ICU admission as well as mLAPS, leading to a much lower in-hospital mortality.

Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. Of note, the proportion of patients in each group differed significantly across hospital sites and admission year. The proportion of patients with LAC steadily increased from 2015 to 2021, which likely reflected the increasing adoption of the ATS and IDSA guidelines. Other patient baseline characteristics were well balanced even before propensity score adjustment. The organisms causing aspiration pneumonia based on ICD-10-CA codes were specified in only 17 patients (0.4%). Organisms included Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, other gram-negative bacilli, and Staphylococcus aureus, which were all identified in fewer than five patients.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults: management principles to improve outcomes [^111Vy5ui]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1). Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure".

### Aspiration pneumonia in older adults [^1169m5ie]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to an infection of the lung parenchyma in an individual that has inhaled a bolus of endogenous flora that overwhelms the natural defenses of the respiratory system. While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^111hhGA7]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### Treatment of aspiration in intensive care unit patients [^1167XRej]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Aspiration is a common event, but the clinical consequences are variable. The primary determinants are the nature of the aspirated material and the host response to it. The purpose of this paper is to present treatment algorithms that should be employed in critically ill patients who experience aspiration.

Methods

Expert review of the available literature was done to provide background information to support the logic of 3 treatment algorithms: (1) treatment of acute aspiration pneumonitis; (2) pulmonary care for acute aspiration; and (3) treatment of aspiration pneumonia.

Results

The discussion of aspirations is separated into 2 clinical scenarios: (1) aspiration pneumonitis (sterile inflammation) versus (2) aspiration pneumonia (an infectious process). Aspiration pneumonitis should be treated by aggressive pulmonary care to enhance lung volume and clear secretions. Intubation should be used selectively. Early corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. Treatment of aspiration pneumonia requires diligent surveillance for the clinical signs of pneumonia. Treatment decisions are based on 3 factors: (1) clinical diagnostic certainly (definite versus probable), (2) time of onset [early (< 5 days) versus late (≥ 5 days)], and (3) host factors (high risk versus low risk). There is no ideal antibiotic regimen. Unit-specific resistance patterns and known frequency pathogens should direct broad spectrum empiric therapy. Invasive diagnostic techniques (such as bronchoalveolar lavage) should be used when the diagnosis is not certain. Antibiotic coverage should be narrowed once sputum culture results become available.

Conclusions

Aspiration is common in critically ill patients and should be aggressively treated by these treatment algorithms.

### Is a strategy based on routine endotracheal cultures the best way to prescribe antibiotics in ventilator-associated pneumonia? [^115JFZYy]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate if a strategy based on routine endotracheal aspirate (ETA) cultures is better than using the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) guidelines to prescribe antimicrobials in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

This was a prospective, observational, cohort study conducted in a 15-bed ICU and comprising 283 patients who were mechanically ventilated for ≥ 48 h. Interventions included twice-weekly ETA; BAL culture was done if VAP was suspected. BAL (collected at the time of VAP) plus ETA cultures (collected ≤ 7 days before VAP) (n = 146 different pairs) were defined. We compared two models of 10 days of empirical antimicrobials (ETA-based vs ATS/IDSA guidelines-based strategies), analyzing their impact on appropriateness of therapy and total antimicrobial-days, using the BAL result as the standard for comparison.

Results

Complete ETA and BAL culture concordance (identical pathogens or negative result) occurred in 52 pairs; discordance (false positive or false negative) in 67, and partial concordance in two. ETA predicted the etiology in 62.4% of all pairs, in 74.0% of pairs if ETA was performed ≤ 2 days before BAL, and in 46.2% of pairs if ETA was performed 3 to 7 days before BAL (P = 0.016). Strategies based on the ATS/IDSA guidelines and on ETA results led to appropriate therapy in 97.9% and 77.4% of pairs, respectively (P < .001). The numbers of antimicrobial-days were 1,942 and 1,557 for therapies based on ATS/IDSA guidelines and ETA results, respectively (P < .001).

Conclusions

The ATS/IDSA guidelines-based approach was more accurate than the ETA-based strategy for prescribing appropriate, initial, empirical antibiotics in VAP, unless a sample was available ≤ 2 days of the onset of VAP. The ETA-based strategy led to fewer days on prescribed antimicrobials.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) non-VAP — We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with HAP who subsequently requires mechanical ventilation. Evidence cited includes one randomized trial in which Sixty-eight patients with HAP were randomly assigned to undergo bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing vs noninvasive management, where expectorated sputum samples were not obtained so noninvasive management resulted in empiric therapy; there was no difference in clinical cure at 28 days or hospital length of stay, and lower 28-day mortality in the empirically treated group was not statistically significant (10% vs 21.9%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, .13–1.61), with fewer patients in the invasive group receiving antibiotics than in the noninvasive group (76% vs 100%). Despite limited evidence, the panel agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain respiratory samples for culture and that respiratory specimens should be obtained noninvasively rather than invasively, noting opportunities to de-escalate antibiotic coverage and that routine invasive sampling via bronchoscopy would be associated with increased cost and increased risks to the patient, including rarely life-threatening complications and temporary worsening of gas exchange that could result in the need for respiratory support.

Introduction

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) aims to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials by selecting the right drug, dose and duration for the appropriate indication, resulting in maximum benefit and minimising adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance. While AMS interventions may appear to be at odds with practice in the intensive care unit (ICU), they can improve quality of care without compromising patient outcomes. This study assessed if empiric antimicrobial therapy aligned with guideline recommendations for critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^1151ZYmX]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage are used commonly to treat aspiration pneumonia, which is not recommended by current guidelines.

Research Question

In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) vs antibiotic therapy with extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022. Patients were included if the physician diagnosed aspiration pneumonia and prescribed guideline-concordant first-line community-acquired pneumonia parenteral antibiotic therapy to the patient within 48 h of admission. Patients then were categorized into the LAC group if they received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin. Patients were categorized into the EAC group if they received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incident C difficile colitis occurring after admission. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance baseline prognostic factors.

Results

The LAC and EAC groups included 2,683 and 1,316 patients, respectively. In hospital, 814 patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups died, respectively. C difficile colitis occurred in five or fewer patients (≤ 0.2%) and 11 to 15 patients (0.8%-1.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. After overlap weighting of propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference of EAC minus LAC was 1.6% (95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%) for in-hospital mortality and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) for C difficile colitis.

Interpretation

We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no additional mortality benefit, only an increased risk of C difficile colitis.

### How important are anaerobic bacteria in aspiration pneumonia: when should they be treated and what is optimal therapy [^112qM9Uc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria are infrequent pulmonary pathogens, and, even then they are, they are almost never recovered due to the need for specimens uncontaminated by the upper airway flora and failure to do adequate anaerobic bacteriology. These bacteria are relatively common in selected types of lung infections including aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia and emphyema. Preferred antibiotics for these infections based on clinical experience are clindamycin and any betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis: a spectrum of infectious / noninfectious diseases affecting the lung [^117QrQ9u]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our purpose is to describe aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis as a spectrum of infectious/noninfectious diseases affecting the lung. We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration.

Recent Findings

Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted.

### Evaluation of the treatment of aspiration pneumonia in hospitalized children [^111pfRjw]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration pneumonia (AP) treatment is variable with limited available guidance on optimal antibiotic choice and duration. This study evaluated the impact of antibiotic regimen and duration on treatment failure for AP in children and correlated the effects of antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) interventions on treatment duration.

Methods

Hospitalized children who received antibiotics for AP were identified through an existing ASP repository. Diagnosis was confirmed through ASP documentation with either an international classification of diseases 9/10 code or physician diagnosis of AP. Incidence of treatment failure (necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, or retreatment) was compared between patients receiving shorter (≤ 7 days) vs longer (> 7 days) course of antibiotics and between various empiric/final antibiotic regimens utilized. Duration of treatment was evaluated in patients with or without an ASP intervention.

Results

Four hundred and nineteen treatment courses for AP were included. Nineteen episodes (4.5%) of treatment failure were identified. No difference in treatment failure was observed between shorter vs longer courses (8 vs 11 episodes). An aminopenicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor was most frequently utilized for both empiric (47.2%) and final treatment (67.5%). Treatment failure rates did not differ with length of intravenous therapy nor empiric/final antibiotic regimen chosen. ASP interventions targeting duration were associated with significantly shorter courses (6.28 vs 7.46 days; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Shorter courses of antibiotics did not result in more treatment failure for AP when compared to longer courses. Neither antibiotic choice nor route impacted treatment failure rates. ASPs may optimize the treatment of pediatric AP.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^113TjUoK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage and extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Results: In this retrospective cohort study of 3,999 patients, the extended anaerobic coverage group showed similar in-hospital mortality and a higher risk of C difficile colitis when compared with the limited anaerobic coverage group.

Interpretation: We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no mortality benefit and an increased risk of harm.

Aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial lung infection that results from a large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents. It accounts for 5% to 15% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)cases and is associated with high mortality. In a cohort study of 4,263 hospitals, the 30-day mortality rate was 29.4% in 192,814 patients with aspiration pneumonia and 11.6% in 909,078 patients with other pneumonia. In a systematic review of 19 studies, aspiration pneumonia was associated with a relative risk of 3.62 (95% CI, 2.65–4.96) for in-hospital mortality when compared with pneumonia without aspiration risk factors.

Mucosal Leishmaniasis

XVII. What are the treatment options for American (New World) mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)?

Recommendations
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the goals of preventing morbidity (e.g. disfigurement) and mortality (e.g. from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruction) [Strong, low].
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic implications [Strong, moderate].
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as indicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic examinations, because of the potential for inflammatory reactions after initiation of antileishmanial therapy [Strong, low].
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of therapy for persons with ML should be individualized (Table 3) [Strong, moderate]. Remarks: The traditional options for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimonial (Sb V) compound (20 mg Sb V /kg daily, IV or IM, for 28–30 days) or with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg per dose, IV, daily or every other day, for a cumulative total of ∼20–45 mg/kg). More recently, on the basis of comparatively limited data, the armamentarium has expanded to include lipid formulations of amphotericin B (typically, liposomal amphotericin B [L-AmB], with a cumulative total dose ranging widely from ∼20–60 mg/kg), as well as the oral agent miltefosine (∼2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^1111UMy7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines as the first-line antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, which of these antibiotics is more effective for treating non-aspiration CAP remains unclear.

Methods

This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, quasi-randomized controlled trial. Patients with adult CAP without risk for aspiration were allocated to either a CTRX or ABPC/SBT group based on the date of hospital admission. Macrolide was added to patients in each group. The primary outcome was the clinical response in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population at end of treatment (EOT). The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment and at end of study (EOS) in the VPP population, and mortality rate at day 30 in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population.

Results

Of 696 screened patients, 433 patients were excluded and 263 patients were allocated to receive either of the treatments. Males comprised 54% of patients and mean age and PSI were 62.1 ± 19.8 years and 69.3 ± 30.0, respectively, with 124 patients allocated to the CTRX group and 138 patients allocated to the ABPC/SBT group. The clinical effectiveness rate for the VPP population at EOT was 90% in the CTRX and 96% in the ABPC/SBT group (p = 0.072, 95% confidence interval [CI] of risk difference [RD]: − 12.6–0.8%). No significant difference in effectiveness at day 4 was observed between the CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups (p = 0.079, 95%CI of RD: − 12.1–0.4%), but at day 7, ABPC/SBT was significantly more effective than CTRX in the VPP population (p = 0.047, 95%CI of RD: − 13.3–-0.4%). No significant difference in late response at EOS was seen between CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups: cure (89 [86%] and 102 [94%]), relapse (5 [5%] and 1 [1%]) and failure (10 [10%] and 5 [5%]; p = 0.053). Deaths within 30 days in MITT population was higher in CTRX group (4 [3%]) than in ABPC/SBT group (0 [0%]) (p = 0.048, 95%CI of RD: 0.1–6.3%).

Conclusion

No significant difference in effectiveness was found between ABPC/SBT and CTRX at EOT. However, ABPC/SBT might be more effective in the early phase of treatment.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115dAYy6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, we were able to capture new C difficile colitis diagnosed only in hospital, so diagnoses made after discharge were not captured. The risk of C difficile colitis is estimated to be highest within 3 to 14 days from the first antibiotic dose, and then decreases over time. Thus, our study would have captured the highest risk period during a patient's hospital stay.

Fourth, as is the case for any observational study, residual confounding may still be present. It is plausible that clinicians' empiric antibiotic choice depended on illness severity, where sicker patients were more likely to receive additional anaerobic coverage. This did not seem to be the case in this study based on baseline characteristics between the two groups with similar proportion of ICU admissions and mLAPS (Table 1). We had also balanced many prognostic factors using propensity score overlap weighting.

Fifth, a bacterial pathogen was not identified in the vast majority of study patients. ICD-10-CA codes likely are highly insensitive for specific bacterial pathogens. As well, the microbiological yield in aspiration pneumonia is low, because it is reasonable to treat moderately severe aspiration pneumonia without microbiological workup based on the current guidelines. Furthermore, even with a full microbiological workup, anaerobes are difficult to grow in cultures. Our study reflects the real-world clinical practice in which almost all cases of aspiration pneumonia are treated with antibiotics empirically without available microbiological data to tailor antibiotic therapy.

### Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for acute aspiration pneumonitis [^114UiLH5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is frequently prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis, with the intent of preventing the development of aspiration pneumonia. However, few clinical studies have examined the benefits and harms of this practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare outcomes of patients with aspiration pneumonitis who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with supportive care only during the initial 2 days following macroaspiration. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care and antimicrobial therapy received between days 3 and 14 following macroaspiration including escalation of therapy and antibiotic-free days.

Results

Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for acute aspiration pneumonitis, including 76 (38%) who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 (62%) who received supportive management only. After adjusting for patient-level predictors, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mortality (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–1.7; p = 0.7). Patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy were no less likely to require transfer to critical care (5% vs 6%; p = 0.7) and subsequently received more frequent escalation of antibiotic therapy (8% vs 1%; p = 0.002) and fewer antibiotic-free days (7.5 vs 10.9; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit and may generate antibiotic selective pressures that results in the need for escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop aspiration pneumonia.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:
The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

NMBAs could be used in the appropriate setting for trauma patients, but should be limited to bolus dosing for a maximum of 48 h duration. All patients should have BIS monitoring, if available, when paralyzed to ensure adequate depth of sedation.

Aspiration Pneumonia

Aspiration of gastric contents, due to regurgitation and vomiting, the presence of nasoenteric tubes or loss of airway reflexes (resulting from low level of consciousness) is a distinct risk during the initial assessment phase, operative induction phase, and during ICU care. Brain trauma is a particular risk factor over and above the other risk factors in trauma ICU patients. Furthermore, patients with acute abdomen, major truncal trauma, and those who require emergency surgical intervention have a higher risk. Aspiration is common with an incidence between 30% and 40%, much of which is subclinical. Early antibiotic therapy for simple gastric aspiration is unnecessary, with no benefit shown and the potential for generating resistant organisms. Early bronchoscopy will allow for correct classification between fluid and particulate aspiration, allowing removal of particulate matter and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures can guide therapy, both for aspiration and unexpected early (non‐VAP) pneumonia. Early antibiotic therapy for "sterile" gastric aspiration is not advocated, and selective antibiotics should be deescalated within 72 h if cultures are negative. It remains challenging to distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia. When managed acutely, the morbidity and mortality are lower than other pneumonias in ICU. Where antimicrobials are used, there does not seem to be an outcome difference between baseline first choice and escalated level of antibiotic therapy in this pathology. Short courses of antibiotics, covering community acquired organisms but not anaerobes, may be indicated in cases with aspiration of stasis‐type enteric contents from beyond the stomach or where the aspiration occurs in the fed ICU patient.

Future directions

The BTS Standards of Care Committee will, at a later date, decide on the timing and scope of a future update of the BTS CAP Guideline building on the excellence of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline. Topics to be considered for inclusion in future BTS CAP Guideline include the management of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens, specifically influenza, and aspiration pneumonia.

The relative lack of major differences between the NICE and BTS guidelines might be viewed positively as demonstrating coherence and consistency in guidelines. However, it also highlights the relative lack of substantial innovation and advancement over recent years in the evidence base related to the clinical management of CAP. More attention to translational and clinical research is merited if further improvements in the care of patients with CAP are to be gained.

Background

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis or viruses such as influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0% and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8, 100 and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected on the basis of presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has compared ABPC/SBT with CTRX in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia patients. However, that study was a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis and whether this result is applicable to aspiration pneumonia in clinical practice remains unclear.

Some reports have described CAP excluding aspiration pneumonia, but most previous studies of antibiotic treatments for CAP have included patients with aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, no reports have compared CTRX and ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP in patients without risk factors for aspiration. We therefore carried out the present study with the aim of investigating whether CTRX might be more effective than ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP, after excluding cases of aspiration pneumonia.

### Aspiration risk factors, microbiology, and empiric antibiotics for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^1125UkiM]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration community-acquired pneumonia (ACAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients with aspiration risk factors (AspRFs) are infections associated with anaerobes, but limited evidence suggests their pathogenic role.

Research Question

What are the aspiration risk factors, microbiology patterns, and empiric anti-anaerobic use in patients hospitalized with CAP?

Study Design and Methods

This is a secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of adults hospitalized with CAP. Patients were stratified into three groups: (1) ACAP, (2) CAP/AspRF+ (CAP with AspRF), and (3) CAP/AspRF- (CAP without AspRF). Data on demographics, comorbidities, microbiological results, and anti-anaerobic antibiotics were analyzed in all groups. Patients were further stratified in severe and nonsevere CAP groups.

Results

We enrolled 2,606 patients with CAP, of which 193 (7.4%) had ACAP. Risk factors independently associated with ACAP were male, bedridden, underweight, a nursing home resident, and having a history of stroke, dementia, mental illness, and enteral tube feeding. Among non-ACAP patients, 1,709 (70.8%) had CAP/AspRF+ and 704 (29.2%) had CAP/AspRF-. Microbiology patterns including anaerobes were similar between CAP/AspRF-, CAP/AspRF+ and ACAP (0.0% vs 1.03% vs 1.64%). Patients with severe ACAP had higher rates of total gram-negative bacteria (64.3% vs 44.3% vs 33.3%, P = 0.021) and lower rates of total gram-positive bacteria (7.1% vs 38.1% vs 50.0%, P < .001) when compared with patients with severe CAP/AspRF+ and severe CAP/AspRF-, respectively. Most patients (> 50% in all groups) independent of AspRFs or ACAP received specific or broad-spectrum anti-anaerobic coverage antibiotics.

Interpretation

Hospitalized patients with ACAP or CAP/AspRF+ had similar anaerobic flora compared with patients without aspiration risk factors. Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent in patients with severe ACAP. Despite having similar microbiological flora between groups, a large proportion of CAP patients received anti-anaerobic antibiotic coverage.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^117QEo5G]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Strategies

Patients were classified into a limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) group and extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) group based on the initial antibiotic they received within 2 days of admission. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and levofloxacin were defined as having LAC because they cover some oral anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, and clindamycin were defined as having EAC because they cover most oral and gut anaerobes including the Bacteroides fragilis group. Thus, patients in the LAC group received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin monotherapy. Patients in the EAC group received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with an EAC antibiotic such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Using a target trial approach, the index time was the time when the patient received the first dose of antibiotic regimen, which would be analogous to randomization in a trial.

Outcomes

Patients were followed up until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality that occurred after the index time. A mortality difference of 3% was considered the minimally important difference based on the noninferiority margin of 3% for mortality in published CAP antibiotic trials. Secondary outcomes included incident diagnoses of C difficile colitis after admission, time to being discharged alive, and readmission to the medical or intensive care services of participating hospitals within 30 days of discharge. Exploratory outcome included 30-day attributable mortality, which was defined as death within 30 days after initially being admitted for aspiration, pneumonia, or both. This also would include patients who were discharged and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site with aspiration, pneumonia, or both and subsequently died. This would not have captured deaths outside the hospital.

Assignment Procedures

Covariates were prognostic factors before index time, which included the following: demographics, including age, sex, and residence in a long-term care home; hospital admission, including hospital site, admission year, and admission meteorological season; comorbidities, including updated Charlson Comorbidity Index; and illness severity, including ICU admission within 48 h of admission, modified Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score (mLAPS) within 24 h of admission based on laboratory parameters (sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, hematocrit, WBC count, arterial pH, arterial Pa 2, arterial Pa 2, glucose, and bilirubin). Higher mLAPS signified higher illness severity. In a prior study, mLAPS performed as well as CURB-65 score in predicting mortality for CAP.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — specimen collection and quantitative culture thresholds: The 2016 IDSA and ATS guidelines recommend noninvasive sampling of the respiratory tract for both HAP and VAP. In non-ventilated patients, specimens may include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, or nasotracheal suction, and in ventilated patients, endotracheal aspirates are preferred. Quantitative assessment of newly obtained samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and protected specimen brush (PSB) specimens is often performed, and quantities of bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia while quantities below that threshold are more consistent with colonization, with generally accepted thresholds of endotracheal aspirates, 10⁶ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL; BAL, 10⁴ CFU/mL; and PSB, 10³ CFU/mL.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: new principles guiding empiric antibiotic therapy [^116iFzwv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious event in critically ill patients. We aim to review the most recent evidences about VAP, including its cause, the main differences between the American and European guidelines in the definition of risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens, the main principles guiding empirical antibiotic treatment, and the potential role of molecular diagnostic tests.

Recent Findings

The 2016ATS/IDSA and the 2017ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT guidelines provide different approaches for the management of VAP. Both guidelines highlight the need to use local epidemiological data for antibiotic choice; however, they identify different risk factors that can assist with decision making when local data are not available. Nevertheless, validation studies of the American guidelines suggest that empiric antibiotic therapy based on risk factors may lead to an overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Rapid diagnostic tests may allow a faster identification of VAP cause, resulting in more adequate antimicrobial therapy and reduced exposition to broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Summary

Clinical studies should be conducted to evaluate the benefits of implementing guidelines and new approaches such as combinations of clinical data with rapid diagnostic tests; meantime adaptations of guidelines to local settings should be carried out by a local multidisciplinary expert team.
