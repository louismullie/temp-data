## Question

What are the current guidelines for managing hypertension in elderly patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about current guidelines for managing hypertension in elderly patients, including how guidelines differ, what to do for specific populations like those 65–79, those ≥ 80, and the frail, how to monitor safely, and how to apply a practical decision framework at the bedside. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how different societies define "older adults" and what thresholds they use to start treatment. Then, I should verify age-specific blood pressure targets and reconcile differences between US, European, and specialty guidelines. Next, I will consider the very old and frail, and whether targets should be relaxed. After that, I need to check drug class selection and combination strategies in the elderly. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, orthostatic hypotension, and a stepwise decision framework that respects patient preferences and tolerance [^11354SU4] [^112t2sif] [^112RfEMp].

> Let me first confirm the definitional framework so I don't misapply recommendations: ACC/AHA often focuses on adults ≥ 65 years, ESH/ESC historically separated "old" as ≥ 65 and "very old" as ≥ 80, and many Asian guidelines have used ≥ 75 as a key threshold; this matters because targets and thresholds vary by category, so I need to be explicit about which age band and frailty status I'm discussing before choosing a target or initiating therapy [^11626Cow] [^111RYVnq] [^114tq9sj].

> Now, treatment thresholds: I should double-check the most debated range, which is 60–79 years. JNC 8 and ACP/AAFP recommended initiating pharmacotherapy at SBP ≥ 150 mmHg and treating to < 150/90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years, based largely on RCTs like SHEP and JATOS; hold on, I initially thought SPRINT itself set the ≥ 60 threshold, but wait, let me verify — SPRINT enrolled ≥ 50 years and used automated office BP, which explains its lower achieved pressures and event reduction signal, and its relevance to older adults without directly dictating the ≥ 60-year initiation threshold, so I should not conflate SPRINT's population with JNC 8's threshold logic [^115CjvEw] [^112XqMSk] [^1173Daym].

> In contrast, contemporary European guidance recommends treatment for most adults ≥ 65 years at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, with ESH 2023 explicitly targeting < 140/80 mmHg initially and considering < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; ESC 2024 similarly endorses treating confirmed hypertension at ≥ 140/90 mmHg, and then applying age-specific ranges thereafter, so the modern trend is earlier initiation at 140/90 in older adults rather than waiting for 150 mmHg [^111yiHyr] [^113a1pp9] [^113vwMGX].

> For ages 65–79, let me consider targets carefully: ACC/AHA 2017 recommends < 130/80 mmHg for community-dwelling older adults if tolerated, citing SPRINT and related data; ESH 2023 advises < 140/80 mmHg as the primary goal, with consideration of < 130/80 mmHg if well tolerated, and ESC/ESH 2018 supported 130–139 mmHg in older adults; hold on, I should verify that this range was indeed 130–139 mmHg for those ≥ 65 — yes, that's correct, which aligns with a more intensive but individualized approach in this age group [^111RYVnq] [^111yiHyr] [^116Zo9hx].

> For those ≥ 80, I need to ensure I'm not over-aggressive: HYVET showed benefit treating to an achieved SBP near 144 mmHg, and both ESH 2023 and ESC 2024 converge on a pragmatic primary target of 140–150 mmHg for most octogenarians, with the option to individualize lower only if tolerated; ESC 2024 further recommends lenient targets or deferring therapy in ≥ 85 or in moderate-to-severe frailty, and it emphasizes not withdrawing treatment solely due to age if it remains well tolerated, which I should remember when families ask to "stop everything" at age 90 [^112hdz3V] [^1155uwuZ] [^116RZYXB] [^1122qTDP].

> Frailty and limited life expectancy change the calculus, so I should confirm guidance there: ESH 2023 and ESC 2024 advise screening for frailty, assessing orthostatic blood pressure, and individualizing thresholds and targets; for moderate-to-severe frailty or very limited life expectancy, a more lenient target such as < 140 mmHg or even deferring treatment can be appropriate, and clinicians should consider down-titration if persistent SBP < 120 mmHg or symptomatic orthostasis emerges; wait, I should verify that ESC 2024 also supports starting only at ≥ 140/90 mmHg under close monitoring in ≥ 85 or frail — yes, that's accurate, reinforcing shared decision-making in this group [^112t2sif] [^115SbQBN] [^1155uwuZ] [^114ogPHK].

> I will now examine medication selection and strategy, and I need to ensure I avoid reflex beta-blockade in the elderly unless there is a compelling indication: European guidance favors starting with two drugs at low doses in most older adults to overcome the steep SBP-DBP gradient, typically a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB and a RAS blocker, adding a low-dose thiazide-like diuretic if needed; in ≥ 85 or frail patients, they specifically recommend avoiding beta-blockers and alpha-blockers up front unless there is a compelling reason, which helps mitigate bradycardia, fatigue, and falls; start low, titrate slowly, and reassess frequently to prevent hypotension and renal injury [^111yornR] [^115kUczg] [^112RfEMp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety boundaries, because older adults are vulnerable to iatrogenic harm: assess for orthostatic hypotension even without symptoms, use home or ambulatory BP to guide control, and avoid pushing SBP below 120 mmHg or DBP below 70 mmHg during active treatment; hold on, I should verify that ESH explicitly discourages targeting below these lower bounds — yes, ESH 2023 advises against aiming for office SBP < 120 mmHg or DBP < 70 mmHg during drug therapy, which aligns with clinical prudence in the elderly [^11354SU4] [^113jJnHm].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check alignment with evidence: confirm accurate diagnosis with repeated measurements and out-of-office BP when feasible; categorize by age band and frailty; for fit 65–79-year-olds, initiate at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and target 130–139 mmHg if tolerated; for fit ≥ 80-year-olds, initiate at ≥ 140/90 mmHg and target 140–150 mmHg, considering lower only if clearly tolerated; for frail or ≥ 85-year-olds, consider initiating only at ≥ 140/90 mmHg with a lenient target or deferral, reassessing autonomy, cognition, and preferences; choose two-drug combinations preferentially, start low, and titrate slowly with frequent review of orthostatics, renal function, electrolytes, and falls risk; never stop effective, tolerated therapy solely due to age, and use shared decision-making throughout [^113siSg8] [^111yiHyr] [^1155uwuZ] [^112t2sif].

> Finally, I should acknowledge the controversy and evolving evidence: higher versus lower targets remain debated, but updated meta-analytic data suggest lower SBP targets reduce stroke and serious cardiovascular events in older adults without clear excess withdrawals, while frail individuals remain underrepresented; this supports intensification when tolerated but reinforces caution and individualization in the frail or very old, which I will continue to communicate transparently with patients and caregivers during goal-setting discussions [^114EkVCh] [^1122ZJKN] [^113vwMGX].

Hypertension in older adults should be managed with **individualized targets** and **careful monitoring** to balance benefits and risks [^115SbQBN]. Initiate pharmacotherapy at **≥ 140/90 mmHg** for most ≥ 65 years [^111yiHyr], with a **primary target of < 140/80 mmHg**; consider < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, but avoid < 120/70 mmHg [^113jJnHm]. In ≥ 80 years or frail patients, use **higher, individualized targets** and start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for orthostatic hypotension and falls [^112tWhSR] [^112RfEMp] [^11354SU4]. Combination therapy is often required [^111yornR]; avoid beta-blockers unless indicated [^115kUczg]. Lifestyle measures are essential, and regular reassessment is needed to adjust therapy as tolerance and comorbidities change [^113wcQvb] [^112JCKBz].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate **blood pressure measurement** is critical; use standardized office measurement [^11151uSJ], and confirm with home or ambulatory monitoring when feasible [^113wtwkq]. Also assess **frailty, cognitive function, and functional status**, as these affect treatment decisions and targets [^112t2sif] [^111j1N1w].

---

## Treatment thresholds and targets

| **Age group** | **Treatment threshold** | **Primary target** | **Consider lower target if tolerated** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 65–79 years | ≥ 140/90 mmHg | < 140/80 mmHg | < 130/80 mmHg |
| ≥ 80 years | ≥ 160 mmHg (consider 140–160 mmHg) | 140–150 mmHg | Individualize; avoid < 130 mmHg if frail |
| Frail or limited life expectancy | Individualize | Higher, individualized | Avoid aggressive targets |

---

Avoid targeting **< 120/70 mmHg** because of increased risk of hypotension, falls, and renal impairment [^113jJnHm] [^1137rdXU].

---

## Pharmacological management

- **Initial therapy**: Start with low doses and titrate slowly to minimize adverse effects [^112RfEMp].

- **Combination therapy**: Most older adults require ≥ 2 agents; single-pill combinations can improve adherence [^1169vq6x].

- **Preferred agents**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-like diuretics are first-line; beta-blockers are reserved for compelling indications (e.g. CAD, heart failure) [^115CjvEw].

- **Special considerations**: In ≥ 85 years or with moderate-to-severe frailty, prefer long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or RAS inhibitors; avoid beta-blockers and alpha-blockers unless indicated [^115kUczg].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Assess at each visit; adjust therapy if present [^11354SU4].

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor regularly, especially with diuretics or RAS inhibitors.

- **Adverse effects**: Watch for dizziness, falls, cognitive changes, and electrolyte disturbances.

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions include **sodium restriction** with a **Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)** dietary pattern, weight management, regular aerobic and resistance exercise, moderation of alcohol intake, and smoking cessation; these measures meaningfully lower blood pressure and enhance antihypertensive efficacy [^113wcQvb].

---

## Individualized care and shared decision-making

Individualized care emphasizes aligning treatment with patient preferences, comorbidities, and functional status [^1137rdXU]. Shared decision-making involves discussing **benefits, harms, and targets** to ensure adherence and satisfaction [^112JCKBz].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate therapy**: ≥ 140/90 mmHg for most ≥ 65 years; individualize for ≥ 80 or frail [^111yiHyr] [^115SbQBN].

- **Targets**: < 140/80 mmHg for most; consider < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; avoid < 120/70 mmHg [^111yiHyr] [^113jJnHm].

- **Therapy**: Start low, titrate slowly; use combination therapy; avoid beta-blockers unless indicated [^111yornR] [^115kUczg].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess orthostatic hypotension, renal function, electrolytes, and adverse effects [^11354SU4].

- **Lifestyle**: Implement sodium restriction, DASH, weight management, exercise, alcohol moderation, and smoking cessation [^113wcQvb].

---

Management of hypertension in older adults requires **individualized targets**, careful monitoring, and a combination of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions. The approach should be tailored to patient-specific factors, with regular reassessment to ensure optimal outcomes.

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^113a1pp9]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### Management of hypertension in the elderly [^112JWsw7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension is highly prevalent among older adults (≥ 65 years), and aging of the population will substantially increase the prevalence of this condition. Age-related endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness contribute to the increased prevalence of hypertension, particularly systolic hypertension, among the elderly. The incidence of some forms of secondary hypertension also increases with age, mainly owing to the use of drugs (especially NSAIDs that have pressor effects) and the presence of chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and renal artery stenosis. Guidelines differ in thresholds and goals for antihypertensive drug therapy in the elderly because of a paucity of high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials and inconsistencies in the definition of 'elderly'. Medical treatment of hypertension reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly, and all guidelines recommend lifestyle modifications and medical treatment for elderly patients whose blood pressure exceeds prescribed thresholds and who are at moderate or high cardiovascular disease risk. In the absence of comorbidities, which constitute 'compelling indications' for the use of specific antihypertensive drugs or drug classes, no clear evidence exists to support recommendations for the use of particular antihypertensive-drug classes in older adults.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^113f1nZY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are many local, national and international guidelines produced by different organisations that give recommendations for the management of hypertension. Studies comparing these guidelines have shown variation in recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and treatment targets for patients with hypertension. However, these studies compared a small number of guidelines, mainly from HICs and offered only a brief insight into their similarities and differences. Hence, scope exists to compare hypertension guidelines on a far larger scale and, importantly, across income settings.

As a condition for which the affected population predominantly live in LMICs, knowledge of variation in recommendations made to clinicians treating patients with hypertension in these settings remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this deficiency by examining the extent of variation across clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension internationally. The primary aim is to determine whether variation exists between CPGs for the management of hypertension through analysis of national and international guidelines from different income settings. Specifically, this study aims to compare the following:
Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension and staging of hypertension
Recommended treatment strategies for uncomplicated primary hypertension (in the absence of comorbidities)
Target BP for patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension
Whether different targets are recommended for the elderly and other at-risk subpopulations

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guideline scope — These guidelines 'are designed for adults with hypertension, i.e. aged ≥ 18 years'. The update's purpose 'was to evaluate and incorporate new evidence into the Guideline recommendations', and fundamental principles include 'to base recommendations on properly conducted studies, identified from an extensive review of the literature' and 'to give the highest priority to data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)'.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^11626Cow]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — older adults with grade 1 hypertension: For the purposes of this guideline, the 'old' are defined as ≥ 65 years and the 'very old' as ≥ 80 years, and prior evidence in older patients was obtained when baseline SBP was ≥ 160 mmHg with strong evidence that these patients should be offered BP-lowering drug treatment. The evidence supports the recommendation that older patients (> 65 years, including patients over 80 years) should be offered BP-lowering treatment if their SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg, and there is also justification to now recommend BP-lowering treatment for old patients (aged ≥ 65 but not > 80 years) at a lower BP (i.e.g.rade 1 hypertension: SBP = 140–159 mmHg). BP-lowering drugs should not be withdrawn on the basis of age alone, and in patients aged > 80 years, CV risk reduction was greatest in those who continued treatment rather than in those whose treatment was discontinued; as stated, these recommendations relate to relatively fit and independent older patients.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, BP targets, elderly, AAFP/ACP 2017 guidelines recommend to consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target SBP of < 140 mmHg with the goal of reducing the risk for stroke or cardiac event in selected ≥ 60 years old patients at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate antihypertensive therapy in 65–79 years old patients with ≥ 140/90 mmHg office BP. Lower BP to < 140/80 mmHg as the primary goal of treatment.
Consider lowering BP to < 130/80 mmHg if treatment is well tolerated.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^111df3yT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Do we AGREE on the targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults: a systematic review of guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^114crCvZ]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the worldwide leading predisposing condition for disease burden, and as the most important modifiable risk factor, its management forms an essential pillar of primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Globally, hypertension is prevalent in roughly one in four adults and steadily rises with age. For example, data from the Framingham Heart Study showed that more than 90% of the normotensive participants between 55 and 65 years developed hypertension, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful treatment strategy. Nevertheless, an international analysis of health surveys estimated that the proportion of hypertensive adults between 35 and 85 years receiving antihypertensive drug therapy ranges from 29.0% to 80.5%.

Only during the last three decades randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that pharmacological treatment of hypertension in older adults is beneficial. Although those studies included octogenarians, frail older adults are largely underrepresented as many of them are excluded from trials due to their comorbidities. To date, no interventional studies specific to antihypertensive treatment in older frail individuals have been conducted. Several population-based cohort studies, in contrast, have shown that low blood pressure (BP) under antihypertensive drug treatment, especially in older adults with frailty or other complex health problems, is associated with higher all-cause mortality rates. Despite the high quality of the available evidence, translation into clinical guidance for the heterogeneous population of older adults is challenging.

In the current discussion on hypertension management in older adults, the clinical problem is not only when to start, but predominantly how low the target BP needs to be. This intensity and thereby numerical target of antihypertensive drug therapy is set on the balance between cardiovascular risk reduction and chance of side effects. Recent trial evidence favours intensive treatment for most patients; however, frail older adults seem to be at higher risk for both cardiovascular events and severe side effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, resulting in an unclear net benefit.

Because translation of the available evidence concerning primary cardiovascular prevention into clinical guidance for older adults is challenging, insight into the actual guidelines about hypertension management will contribute to the present debate. Therefore, the primary aim of this review was to provide a systematic, cross-continental and present-day overview of the thresholds and targets of antihypertensive drug treatment in older adults recommended in the currently used guidelines. A secondary aim was to explore the potential relationships between the advised targets and guideline characteristics, including methodological quality, continent of origin, intended users and the guideline committee's selection of evidence supporting the recommended targets.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^1172u7if]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Many CPGs recommended different management strategies for elderly patients, with most opting for a higher BP target of < 150/90 mmHg. Higher targets may result from a trade-off between achieving adequate BP control and minimising adverse drug effects, which are more common in elderly patients. There was a significant variation in the definition of the term "elderly", ranging from age ≥ 55 to ≥ 80 years between CPGs. No clear correlation to income settings was seen between the age definitions chosen by guidelines. It may partly be attributed to variation in life expectancy across the countries from which CPGs were identified, and some CPGs explicitly mention their populations' life expectancy when determining the cut-off age. In addition to differing thresholds for the elderly, many guidelines also included specific thresholds for comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. There was a general consensus towards lower target BPs in these groups (BP < 130/80 mmHg) which could reflect the need for more stringent BP control in these high-risk patients.

ESC/ESH 2018 older patients — treatment thresholds: BP-lowering drug treatment and lifestyle intervention is recommended in fit older patients (> 65 years but not > 80 years) when SBP is in the grade 1 range (140–159 mmHg), provided that treatment is well tolerated; previously, antihypertensive drug treatment may be considered in the elderly (at least when younger than 80 years) when SBP is in the 140–159 mmHg range, provided that antihypertensive treatment is well tolerated.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets in older adults: In older patients (65–80 years), an SBP target of between 140–150 mmHg is recommended, whereas in older patients (> 65 years), it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg. In people older than 80 years with an initial SBP ≥ 160 mmHg, an SBP target between 140–150 mmHg should be considered provided that they are in good physical and mental condition, while an SBP target range of 130–139 mmHg is recommended for people older than 80 years, if tolerated.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) jointly developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations based on the benefits and harms of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for the treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published randomized, controlled trials for primary outcomes and observational studies for harms only (identified through EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov), from database inception through January 2015. The MEDLINE search was updated through September 2016. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity and mortality related to stroke, major cardiac events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), and harms. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes all adults aged 60 years or older with hypertension.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 2

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

Current guidelines on BP-lowering goals

Current hypertension guidelines have recommended the appropriate BP-lowering strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in older patients. The target is 130–139 mmHg in the European guideline and < 130 mmHg in the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association guideline.

The major features and themes of the Asian guidelines are similar to European and US guidelines, but there are several subtle differences. For example, the 2018 Chinese Hypertension Guideline recommended that SBP should be targeted to < 150 mmHg, and further < 140 mmHg, if tolerated; in elderly patients aged over 80 years old, a SBP target of < 150 mmHg is recommended. The Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019) recommends that the office BP goals for most hypertensive adults with comorbidities are at < 130/80 mmHg, and for the patients over 75 years old, the optimal office BP target is < 140/90 mmHg, if tolerated. In the 2018 Korean Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension, a target BP of < 130/80 mmHg is recommended for high-risk patients with 10-year CVD risk of > 15% or for patients with cardioasular disease over 50 years old, and in contrast, a target BP of < 140/90 mmHg is recommended for hypertensive patients at low-to-moderate risk.

Guidelines on BP-lowering goals

There are no overall guidelines for the management of hypertension in Asia. Therefore, local country guidelines or standard clinical practice guide the management of hypertension throughout Asia. The major features and themes of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese hypertension guidelines are similar to European and US guidelines, but there are a number of subtle differences between the Asian guidelines. For example, 120–139/80–89 mm Hg range is termed 'prehypertension' in Korea and Taiwan, 'normal high BP' in China, and defines both 'normal BP' and 'high-normal BP' in Japan. The current Japanese hypertension guidelines recommend a BP target of < 150/90 mm Hg for elderly patients aged ⩾75 years, whereas in the Chinese guidelines, the same BP target is recommended for elderly patients aged ⩾65 years.

Local guidelines give limited guidance specifically on the management of systolic hypertension, although some experts acknowledge its higher prevalence in the elderly population. Antihypertensive treatment is recommended in elderly patients but it is advised that BP reduction should be more gradual in this patient population. The Japanese and Taiwanese guidelines recognize that lowering elevated SBP is important even in patients who have low DBP. However, the Japanese guidelines recommend that in the presence of coronary artery disease, changes in DBP be monitored while lowering SBP to the target level.

Awareness and implementation of local guidelines is generally inadequate in many Asian regions. Development of Asian hypertension guidelines based on evidence from studies conducted in patients in the region would help to provide practical guidance on how best to achieve BP goals. The guidelines could also be adapted and translated according to the local needs, which would help to provide clear terminology and defined treatment goals.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^114EkVCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^116auiTu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas of improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people > 60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that > 6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences. 29

While the previous BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg could be liberalized for patients who are frail or > 80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets, but the new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults > 60 years of age by; for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg based on a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116oZq7q]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1173Daym]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Older patients with hypertension (defined as aged ≥ 65 years) — trial evidence and treatment target recommendations are as follows: The SPRINT trial included a high proportion of patients over the age of 75 years (n = 2636) and with more intensive BP-lowering treatment (mean achieved BP = 124/62 mmHg) significantly reduced major CV events, heart failure, and all-cause death (all by > 30%) compared with standard treatment targeting SBP to < 140 mmHg; because automated office BP measurement was used, the SBP of 124 mmHg most probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of 130–139 mmHg. The HYVET trial suggested benefit when treating to an SBP target of < 150 mmHg (achieving a mean SBP of 144 mmHg) in the very old (> 80 years). Based on these data, we recommend that in older patients treated for hypertension, BP should be lowered to < 140/90 mmHg, but not below an SBP of 130 mmHg, and the impact of BP-lowering on the well-being of the patient should be closely monitored.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112j6vuh]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

### Changing concepts in hypertension management [^111i4Bfn]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and lowering blood pressure with anti-hypertensive drugs reduces target organ damage and prevents cardiovascular disease outcomes. The recent trials SPRINT and HOPE-3 will lead to changes in the way we manage hypertension and impact on clinical practice guidelines. These studies also demonstrate the shift toward automated blood pressure measurements. We have reviewed these studies and others to put them in context with the guidelines that have come before and to describe how they will impact on hypertension treatment thresholds and targets, the treatment of hypertension in the elderly, and changing approaches to the management of hypertension including resistant hypertension.

### Treating hypertension in the very elderly [^11595RuS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for strict blood pressure (BP) management in the very elderly, defined as patients aged 80 years and older.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using PubMed (1950 through November 2010) for the MeSH terms hypertension and elderly; subterms of identified MeSH terms (ie, explosion) for the elderly were also searched. A broader search was conducted of PubMed articles published in the past 4 years. Searches were conducted for additional primary literature referenced in identified articles; an updated Cochrane Database review was also performed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified studies that specifically included very elderly patients and BP were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The BP goal established in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is less than 140/90 mm Hg, regardless of age, unless a compelling indication exists. Although evidence suggests that lowering BP will lower the risk of stroke, lower BP in the very elderly may result in higher mortality. Many physicians are reluctant to treat BP in accordance with the JNC 7 goal in very elderly patients for a variety of reasons, including concerns about fall risk, lack of benefit in mortality reduction, and concerns about drug interactions and adverse effects. Results from a randomized controlled trial and meta-analysis have demonstrated reductions in stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events in the very elderly. The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association recently published guidelines for elderly patients that suggest treating the very elderly carefully and with different BP goals than previously recommended.

Conclusions

Optimal management of hypertension in the very elderly remains a concern. Few studies have evaluated hypertension in this population, and studies that included patients over 80 enrolled too few to draw conclusions. Although the HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) study did have adequate power to evaluate the very elderly, because this study was stopped early because of significant findings in mortality, unanswered questions remain regarding optimal BP targets.

### Guidelines for hypertension management in primary care: is local adaptation possible? [^113Nm5Kj]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypertension affects more than one billion people worldwide. There has been much discussion about clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) following the proposal of lower thresholds for starting pharmacological treatment. Some smaller groups or institutions could benefit from adapting CPGs to their local context, a process that requires high-quality CPGs with few points of conflict in their recommendations. To address this issue, we have compared high-quality hypertension CPGs and highlighted conflicting recommendations.

Methods

CPGs were searched in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, as well as specific websites. Only CPGs published between 2016 and 2019 were included. We defined CPGs as high-quality if the 'rigor of development' and 'editorial independence' AGREE II domains were scored at least 60%. We compared recommendations made by high-quality CPGs and highlighted areas of conflict (defined as disagreements between more than two CPGs).

Results

Nineteen CPGs were identified. The highest scoring domain was 'scope and purpose' (74.3%) and the lowest scoring was 'applicability' (40.0%). Eight CPGs were rated as high quality. Most CPG recommendations on the management of hypertension were consistent. Conflicting recommendations were regarding blood pressure (BP) levels to initiate pharmacotherapy and therapeutic goals, particularly in patients with low cardiovascular risk and older patients.

Conclusion

It is possible to adapt hypertension CPGs once high-quality documents have been identified with agreement between most recommendations. Guideline developers can focus on the adaption process and concentrate efforts on implementation.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^111UNTsb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

BP grade classifications and definitions did not change between the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guideline and updated 2023 ESH guideline. As a result, significant differences in BP classification and definition of hypertension between guidelines remain, with ACC/AHA using "stages" and ESH using "grades" for BP categorization (Figure 1). ESH defines hypertension as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, while ACC/AHA uses a threshold of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. ESH classifies systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic ranges between 85 and 89 mm Hg as "high-normal" BP, while ACC/AHA guideline defines this as "stage 1" hypertension.

Recommendations on BP treatment targets also differ. For most patients, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating to a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. The ESH, on the other hand, recommends tailoring treatment based on age, clinical comorbidities, and patient-specific tolerance. For adults between ages 18 and 64 years, the ESH guideline recommends a BP target < 130/80 mm Hg, similar to what is recommended by the ACC/AHA guideline. However, the ESH guideline recommends higher targets for older patients. For adults aged 65 to 79 years, ESH recommends targeting BP < 140/80 mm Hg, but notes that if tolerated by the patient, a target of < 130/80 mm Hg should be used. The threshold for very old patients (≥ 80 years old) is even higher, targeting SBP between 140 and 150 mmHg. For special populations including hypertensive patients with CKD, the ESH guideline recommends treatment to a higher BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg compared to the recommended ACC/AHA BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. For other comorbidities including diabetes, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, both guidelines recommend the same BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. While significant differences still exist between the guidelines, for high-risk patients and individuals between ages 18 and 79 years old, there is consensus to achieve BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^11548Gcg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

While this approach still needs to be externally validated, we suggest that the new AHA/ACC guideline committee consider a risk‐based approach for adults > 60 years of age; initiating treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg if their 10‐year ASCVD risk score is > 7.5% based on the pooled cohort equations. 32 Persons with ASCVD risk < 7.5% appear less likely to benefit from this more‐aggressive BP target and may not require treatment until their SBP is ≥ 150 mm Hg. We note, however, that, given the substantial influence of age in the ASCVD risk calculator, the vast majority of men and many women > 60 years old who have an SBP of > 140 mm Hg would qualify for more‐aggressive BP treatment based on this 7.5% threshold. Thus, future research may identify a more‐optimal ASCVD risk cut‐point (perhaps, for example, > 15% [the risk cutoff for SPRINT]), below which a more lenient SBP goal of 150 mm Hg could be targeted in adults between 60 and 80 years old.

The 2014 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence cardiovascular risk assessment guidelines suggest starting BP treatment in adults with a CVD risk score ≥ 10% based on the QRISK2 calculator. 33 It is worth noting that estimation of CVD risk is also now a critical part of the cholesterol treatment guidelines and, hence, could also be used to enhance the treatment of hypertension in high‐risk adults. Further research will be needed to explore the optimal ASCVD risk score to initiate BP treatment for men and women and to determine the potential role, if any, of cardiac biomarkers such as coronary artery calcium in guiding risk‐based allocation of hypertension therapy.

To reiterate, with CVD risk being heavily influenced by age, the absolute benefit of BP treatment for risk reduction is greatest in the elderly. However, despite the JNC 8 recommendations, none of the trials on which these recommendations are based were conducted in elderly hypertensive patients with an initial SBP between 140 and 150 mm Hg. Thus, it is not possible to be entirely sure what BP target to use without more evidence from RCTs, which is why the results from SPRINT will be critical for the new guideline committee.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) / international society of hypertension (ISH) statement on management of hypertension [^114XfzxB]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypertension is estimated to cause 4.5% of current global disease burden and is as prevalent in many developing countries, as in the developed world. Blood pressure-induced cardiovascular risk rises continuously across the whole blood pressure range. Countries vary widely in capacity for management of hypertension, but worldwide the majority of diagnosed hypertensives are inadequately controlled. This statement addresses the ascertainment of overall cardiovascular risk to establish thresholds for initiation and goals of treatment, appropriate treatment strategies for non-drug and drug therapies, and cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Conclusions

Since publication of the WHO/ISH Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 1999, more evidence has become available to support a systolic blood pressure threshold of 140 mmHg for even 'low-risk' patients. In high-risk patients there is evidence for lower thresholds. Lifestyle modification is recommended for all individuals. There is evidence that specific agents have benefits for patients with particular compelling indications, and that monotherapy is inadequate for the majority of patients. For patients without a compelling indication for a particular drug class, on the basis of comparative trial data, availability, and cost, a low dose of diuretic should be considered for initiation of therapy. In most places a thiazide diuretic is the cheapest option and thus most cost effective, but for compelling indications where other classes provide additional benefits, even if more expensive, they may be more cost effective. In high-risk patients who attain large benefits from treatment, expensive drugs may be cost effective, but in low-risk patients treatment may not be cost-effective unless the drugs are cheap.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^117H73sr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendation 1

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

This first recommendation is based on several RCTs evaluating treatment of SBP to < 140 mm Hg versus a more liberal target (140–160 mm Hg) in patients > 65 years of age. 9, 10 In the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), 4418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to SBP treatment goal < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. Despite the fact that the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary end point of combined CVD and renal failure did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

One limitation of this trial, however, is that it was only powered to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary end point. While a 10/3–mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not be sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Also, these patients were followed for only 2 years and the main treatment drug was a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first line along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. 7, 11, 12, 13 While not reaching statistical significance, subgroup analysis suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in patients < 75 years old while adopting a more liberal strategy may be safer in those ≥ 75 years old. 10

### Characteristics of populations excluded from clinical trials supporting intensive blood pressure control guidelines [^1122ZJKN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The majority of younger adults and older adults diagnosed with hypertension and recommended additional antihypertensive treatment by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would not have been eligible from the clinical trials underlying more intensive BP treatment thresholds. Clinical trials studying the outcomes of intensive BP treatment in younger adults at low cardiovascular risk and in older adults with multimorbidity are urgently needed, and, until these data are available, a patient‐centered approach that tailors treatments and targets by degree of BP elevation, comorbidity, and likelihood of benefit is likely preferable to universal adoption of intensive treatment targets.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

### Hypertension in older adults: assessment, management, and challenges [^1137rdXU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3 CURRENT EVIDENCE AND GUIDELINES

Treatment of ISH in older adults was somewhat unclear until randomized studies such as the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), 8 the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial (Syst‐Eur), 42 and the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) 43 showed significant CV benefits on lowering SBP in patients with ISH. All these four trials defined ISH as SBP ≥ 160 and DBP < 90 mmHg. Based on the data mainly from HYVET study, the 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology Guidelines 44 for the management of HTN stated that there is evidence for benefits of lowering the SBP to < 150 mmHg in older adults with initial SBP of > 160 mmHg. Recently, SPRINT trial added to this evidence base and showed the benefits of a lower BP goal of SBP < 120 mmHg in patients aged over 75 years. 25 Despite this convincing evidence of the benefit of antihypertensive treatment in older adults with HTN, the optimal BP target has remained unclear in this population. This mostly derives from the higher vulnerability of older adults to develop complications from the antihypertensives such as orthostasis, falls and renal dysfunction due to their burden of comorbidities, advanced age and frailty. This was studied in a post hoc analysis of both HYVET 45 and SPRINT, 25 however, these studies did not show a relationship between the benefits of antihypertensive treatment and patient frailty. Both studies concluded that antihypertensive treatment goals in frail older patients should be similar to treatment strategies used in the fittest patients. These results were then incorporated in the 2017 Canadian guidelines that proposed to target an SBP of < 120 mm Hg for all individuals aged over 75 years. 46, 47 The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend that a BP < 130/80 mm Hg should be targeted after the age of 65 years. 47 However, more recently, the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines proposed a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for individuals older than 65 years. 2 The 2017 American College of Physicians/American Association of Family Physicians guidelines propose to target a BP < 150/90 mm Hg. 48 Based on these different recommendations regarding the target BP in older adults, it seems clear that there is still debate on optimal BP targets. For most patients, recent evidence suggests that "the lower the better" concept should be considered. However, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) defined a higher BP target of 150/90 for people above the age of 60 years. This recommendation was not accepted by all committee members who then published a "minority report" outlining their views of the evidence. It is important to note that there is increased vascular stiffness in older adults that results in higher systolic pressure, lower diastolic pressure and higher pulse pressure. This would probably require different BP lowering strategies compared with younger patients. We recommend the physicians to critically assess the evidence as there are strengths and weaknesses of discussions on BP targets in older adults. Overall, choosing a target blood pressure in older adults with hypertension requires discussion between physician and the patient taking into consideration several factors such as the burden of comorbidity, life expectancy, clinical judgment, and patient preference.

### Hypertension guidelines in elderly patients: is anybody listening? [^115h6KPN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous guidelines for the management of uncomplicated hypertension in elderly patients have recommended diuretic agents and then beta-blockers. We examined trends in the initial treatment choice for elderly people with hypertension and the effects of a government-sponsored program to publish and disseminate a simplified version of the national guidelines for the treatment of hypertension to all physicians in Ontario, Canada.

Subjects and Methods

Linked administrative databases containing information on the more than 1.2 million elderly residents in Ontario were used. Time series analysis was performed to determine prescribing trends from 1993 to 1998 for patients who began antihypertensive medication for the treatment of hypertension and to examine the effects of the simplified guidelines that were distributed in July of 1995.

Results

Diuretic agents were the most commonly prescribed medications, with annual rates from 35% to 38% (P = 0.59) throughout the study. Beta-blocker prescribing rose from 12% to 16% (P < 0.01), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescribing rose from 27% to 32% (P < 0.01). Prescriptions for calcium channel blockers dropped significantly, from 23% to 14% (P < 0.01). However, the publication and dissemination of the Ontario hypertension guidelines had no statistically significant effects on the proportion of patients who began treatment with a diuretic agent (P = 0.55), beta-blocker, (P = 0.32), ACE inhibitor (P = 0.09), or calcium channel blocker (P = 0.07).

Conclusion

The dissemination of simplified practice guidelines for hypertension did not have notable effects on prescribing patterns in Ontario.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 2 to 5

In all persons < 60 years or in persons > 18 years (and either those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

There is broader agreement between the professional societies on how to treat younger patients with hypertension. While most studies examined adults > 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. 34 This trial randomized 18 790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into 3 groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these 3 target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the 3 groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the 2 lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the 3 groups. 34

While all 3 groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg and the lowest rate of CVD events was seen at 82.6 mm Hg. Based on this trial, everyone with hypertension under the JNC 8 guidelines has a DBP goal of < 90 mm Hg. There is less evidence supporting an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg in this group of patients. However, in trials like HOT, even though DBP was being targeted, SBP also fell at least 25 mm Hg in all 3 groups. 34 Indeed, given SPRINT suggests clinical benefit for an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among higher risk persons < 60 years, it is likely that forthcoming guidelines may even reduce this SBP target to a threshold lower than 140. However, the DBP values in the intensive therapy arm of SPRINT are not currently known.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^117CTMRt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations for treatment of hypertension in older persons — For noninstitutionalized ambulatory community-dwelling adults (≥ 65 years of age) with an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher, treatment to a SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg is recommended (COR I, LOE A). For older adults (≥ 65 years of age) with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, using clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions on BP-lowering intensity and antihypertensive drug choice (COR IIa, LOE C-EO).

### The results of a survey of physicians about the Japanese society of hypertension guidelines for the management of hypertension 2014 and its clinical use [^1124BoPR]. Hypertension Research (2016). Low credibility.

The current study investigated physicians' awareness and use of the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension 2014 (JSH2014) and is based on the results of a survey performed by the Publicity and Advertisement Committee of JSH. A questionnaire was used to survey physicians' awareness of the JSH2014, their recommended target blood pressure for hypertensive patients with complications and their use of antihypertensive drugs. Physicians who downloaded a PDF version of JSH2014 during the 6 months after its publication (April-September 2014) were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Of the 7872 respondents, 91% were aware of the JSH and complied partially, mostly or completely with it in their practice. With reference to hypertensive patients, ∼70% of physicians who completed the questionnaire recommended a target blood pressure (BP) of 140/90mmHg for an office BP value, and 40% recommended 135/85mmHg for a home BP value. Physicians recommended target BP levels of 130/80mmHg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (50–63% of physician surveyed) and for elderly patients with diabetes or kidney disease (45–55% of respondents), whereas they recommended 140/90mmHg for elderly patients with low cardiovascular disease risk (56–60% of physician surveyed) and for patients with chronic-phase stroke (40–47% of respondents). The most commonly prescribed combination of antihypertensive drugs was angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with calcium channel blocker. In addition, physicians' first choice of drug for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease was most often ARB. Overall, the survey results showed that the new recommendations from the JSH2014 accurately reflect daily clinical practices for hypertension management used by Japanese physicians.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^113wcQvb]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

I. INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is the single most significant modifiable risk factor for all-cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Approximately 33% of the global population of 8 billion live with hypertension. Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of prevention and treatment of hypertension and both governments and industry are fundamental to endorse and implement these changes. Moreover, lifestyle changes may not only reduce blood pressure (BP) and improve hypertension control but also improve cardiovascular and general health. Patients also often view lifestyle changes as their highest priority area in their hypertension management. Consequently, lifestyle modifications are the first-line recommendation in all major hypertension management guidelines to reduce the risk of CVD. The importance of lifestyle changes in both treatment and prevention of hypertension is further emphasized in the ISH's Hypertension Zero Declaration and the Society's public campaigns championing healthy lifestyle. In addition to direct benefits, lifestyle modifications can also amplify the effect of the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, if needed. Of importance, the well known lifestyle interventions such as change in diet, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation and aerobic exercise, have now been extended to less obvious strategies such as stress reduction, isometric exercise and reducing exposure to pollution. Although lifestyle changes are effective, they remain difficult to implement and maintain long-term because many people live in environments that are not conducive to achieving and then sustaining a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, clinicians are often poorly trained in assisting patients to engage in healthy behaviours. This is further compounded by the paucity of information about lifestyle changes in people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and their health literacy and cultural beliefs concerning hypertension prevention and management. In this position paper, we discuss the updated evidence supporting the use of lifestyle interventions in patients with hypertension or people at risk of developing hypertension. Importantly, we also aim to provide unique global perspectives on ways to implement these changes, taking into consideration different ethnicities and age groups, to aid healthcare providers and the scientific community to navigate and apply the current knowledge.

The 2021 WHO hypertension guidelines are focused on management in routine, primary care settings (primary care health care providers, family physicians, cardiologists, nephrologists, and any providers who manage hypertension) and do not address the treatment of hypertensive emergencies or urgencies, secondary forms of hypertension, or resistant hypertension.

### Targeting a systolic blood pressure of… [^11324dSk]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intensive BP control (SBP, < 130 mmHg) in patients with hypertension aged ≥ 75 years. Our findings argue against the use of higher BP targets in the absence of compelling contraindications, and support a more unified approach to BP management across age groups. Future guidelines should consider retiring arbitrary age thresholds in favor of individualized, risk-based decision making that acknowledges the growing heterogeneity of the older adult population. Further studies are warranted to define optimal BP targets in frail, institutionalized, or cognitively impaired individuals, who remain underrepresented in the existing evidence.

In the INVEST sub‐study, the adjusted hazard ratio for primary outcomes showed a J‐shaped relationship between each age group with on‐treatment SBP and DBP. The SBP at the hazard ratio nadir increased with aging, highest for the elderly (140 mmHg). Nevertheless, DBP at the hazard ratio nadir was slightly decreased for the very old (70 mmHg). 54

This evidence has been synthesized into recent guidelines and expert consensus recommendations. The Seventh Joint National Committee (JNC 7) 55 focused on expert consensus recommendations, whereas later on the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) 56 was convened with the intent on generating recommendations based on the best available evidence, prospective randomized trials. The document was commissioned by the NHLBI in 2008, but was not endorsed by AHA, ACC or any of the 41 organizations that endorsed JNC 7, primarily due to the controversial recommendation that the threshold for initiation of therapy and the target of that therapy be set at 150/90 mmHg to avoid overtreatment of the older population. This was criticized by 5 of the writing group's members. 57

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension, 2 the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 1 and the American Society of Hypertension/International Society of Hypertension 58 have also issued their own documents with differences in targets and management. (Table 1 and Figure 1). Current recommendation from the American College of Physicians and the American Association of Family Practitioners recommend a systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mmHg despite the findings from SPRINT, which represents a 20‐mmHg difference from other societies. Discrepancies like this truly represent a challenge for clinicians.
