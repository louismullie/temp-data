## Question

Why topic steroids don't work in hand eczema and what to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why topical steroids might "not work" in hand eczema and what to do when they fail, including safer and more effective next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and subtypes of hand eczema. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence that topical corticosteroids do work and under what conditions. Next, I will examine the common reasons they appear to fail. After that, I should outline subtype-specific strategies to salvage response, including nonsteroidal topicals and occlusion. Then, I will consider when to escalate to phototherapy and systemic therapy. Finally, I need to synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and close with counseling points on adherence, potency selection, and monitoring for adverse effects, while keeping in mind that emerging data are rapidly changing the landscape of hand eczema care.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its heterogeneity. Hand eczema is highly prevalent, frequently chronic, and often multifactorial, with major contributors including irritant exposures, allergic contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis, which means "hand eczema" is not a single disease but an umbrella that demands subtype-directed care, including identifying and avoiding triggers and using emollients alongside anti-inflammatory therapy when needed [^1166PmWU] [^113eUAiQ].

> Wait, let me verify the assumption that topical steroids "don't work" at all. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; evidence from randomized trials shows topical corticosteroids can be effective in hand eczema, with clobetasol foam outperforming vehicle for participant-rated control at 15 days and intermittent mometasone regimens maintaining remission in longer-term use, although adverse effects like atrophy increase with repeated cycles, and many trials are small and short, limiting certainty and generalizability [^116Tmmy1] [^111EMgHm]. Guidelines still list potent topical glucocorticoids as a mainstay alongside emollients for acute and chronic hand eczema, underscoring that steroids often do work when used correctly, albeit not universally or indefinitely in all phenotypes [^113eUAiQ] [^1166PmWU].

> I will now examine why topical steroids might fail despite appropriate use. Let me consider pathophysiology and skin site first: palmar and volar surfaces have thick stratum corneum, so penetration and therapeutic concentration at the dermis can be limited, and potent agents may be required on palms, while also recognizing that chronic use can impair barrier repair and contribute to steroid-induced atrophy or even tachyphylaxis in some cases, particularly with repeated courses [^112K4zrQ] [^111EMgHm]. I should double-check for modifiable drivers such as ongoing irritant or allergen exposure, inadequate emollient use, and adherence issues, including steroid phobia, underapplication, or misaligned potency selection, all of which can blunt apparent steroid efficacy and lead to apparent treatment failure [^116xVfhh] [^113LBWjF] [^115dncxy].

> Next, I should review the quality and heterogeneity of evidence, because this shapes expectations. Many hand eczema trials are small, short, and compare steroids to vehicle rather than to each other, with heterogeneity in outcomes and high risk of bias, so the apparent "failure" of steroids may partly reflect study design rather than pharmacologic impotence, while still acknowledging that real-world steroid-refractory chronic hand eczema is a recognized phenotype that warrants escalation strategies [^116Tmmy1] [^112UdB4J] [^1166PmWU].

> Let me think about how to rescue a failing steroid response with nonsteroidal topicals. Calcipotriol has randomized data showing comparable efficacy to desoximetasone over 8 weeks, which is helpful when steroid-sparing is desired, although sample sizes are modest and confirmatory studies are needed [^111Wnwvo]. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are reasonable steroid-sparing options; small studies and occupational hand dermatitis cohorts suggest tacrolimus can reduce steroid requirements and improve induration and scaling, albeit with transient burning or itching and with the caveat that data in hand eczema are less robust than in atopic dermatitis [^112gpYZ8] [^116tYanw] [^1166PmWU].

> But wait, what if topical steroids still underperform despite good adherence and appropriate potency? I should confirm whether intermittent or enhanced delivery strategies have been tried. Once remission is achieved, thrice-weekly mometasone can modestly outperform twice-weekly in maintaining control with only rare reports of mild atrophy, suggesting an intermittent maintenance approach can reduce cumulative steroid exposure while preserving benefit, though data are limited and require shared decision-making [^111EMgHm]. Occlusion can meaningfully increase penetration; a time-limited trial of occluded low- to mid-potency steroid for 7–14 days can rescue localized recalcitrant lesions when standard applications fail, provided infection is excluded and duration is strictly controlled [^115UYDQc] [^1144i1xD].

> I need to ensure we are not missing an atopic component or allergic contact dermatitis, because subtype guides therapy. In atopic hand eczema, biologic and systemic therapies developed for atopic dermatitis, such as dupilumab or JAK inhibitors, have emerging or established roles, with observational and randomized data demonstrating improvement in hand involvement, though not all agents are labeled specifically for hand eczema and patient selection matters [^116gLKCP] [^114KYYZg]. For hyperkeratotic phenotypes, alitretinoin remains the only approved systemic in some regions and has supportive RCT data, with recent head-to-head data suggesting topical delgocitinib may rival or exceed alitretinoin in some outcomes, while traditional systemic immunosuppressants remain off-label options for severe, steroid-refractory disease [^112dzHcc] [^116Tmmy1] [^116Fpmm3].

> Hold on, I should verify where phototherapy fits. Local PUVA and narrowband UVB are guideline-supported options for chronic hand eczema unresponsive to optimized topical therapy, with modest evidence and favorable safety when delivered in controlled settings, though availability and access vary and data are mostly from small studies [^116Tmmy1] [^1166PmWU] [^116EXTne].

> Next, I should review a practical stepwise approach. First, confirm the diagnosis and subtype, and reinforce trigger avoidance, protective strategies, and frequent emollients to repair the barrier. Second, optimize steroid technique: use a potent or very potent agent on thick palmar skin for induction, consider short-course occlusion for recalcitrant plaques, and taper to intermittent maintenance rather than continuous use. Third, if response is inadequate after 2–4 weeks of optimized topical steroid, layer in or transition to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory such as calcipotriol or a calcineurin inhibitor, or combine with intermittent steroid pulses. Fourth, if still uncontrolled, escalate to phototherapy or systemic therapy based on subtype, comorbidities, and patient preference, incorporating newer options like delgocitinib or dupilumab where appropriate and available, and monitor closely for adverse effects and treatment response [^1166PmWU] [^113eUAiQ] [^112dzHcc].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring. With potent or very potent steroids, limit continuous use on the hands to avoid atrophy. Once-daily application is probably as effective as twice daily for many patients, which can reduce cumulative exposure, and weekend proactive therapy after induction can reduce flares with low adverse event rates in trials, though long-term steroid safety data remain limited and largely low certainty, warranting individualized risk–benefit discussions and periodic skin checks for atrophy or infection [^115UxMcC] [^111ieYqq] [^116wwvUA] [^112hUYpn].

> Finally, let me reconsider patient-centered factors that drive perceived failure. Education on fingertip-unit dosing, potency selection by site and severity, and clear expectations for maintenance reduces underuse and fear-driven nonadherence, which are common, well-documented contributors to poor control in hand eczema and eczema more broadly, and can be as critical to success as the molecule chosen [^116xVfhh] [^113LBWjF] [^115dncxy].

Topical steroids often fail in hand eczema because of **barrier dysfunction** [^1166PmWU] from repeated wet work and irritants, which limits steroid penetration and permits ongoing inflammation [^116QzrNY]. Additional factors include **steroid phobia** (leading to underuse), incorrect potency or vehicle, and persistent allergen/irritant exposure [^111izKw9] [^113LBWjF] [^115GUQfy] [^116Fpmm3]. When steroids are inadequate, use potent agents with occlusion, add calcineurin inhibitors, or escalate to phototherapy or systemic options such as alitretinoin [^116Tmmy1] [^112dzHcc], dupilumab, or JAK inhibitors [^114KYYZg] [^1155iNeX]. Emollients, trigger avoidance, and patient education are essential adjuncts [^11715kZF] [^113eUAiQ].

## Reasons for topical steroid failure in hand eczema

Several factors contribute to **topical steroid failure** in hand eczema:

- **Barrier dysfunction**: Repeated wet work and irritants disrupt the stratum corneum, reducing steroid penetration and allowing persistent inflammation [^116QzrNY] [^1112naRi].

- **Steroid phobia**: Fear of side effects leads to underuse or premature discontinuation, undermining efficacy [^115bYdnC] [^113LBWjF].

- **Incorrect potency or vehicle**: Low-potency steroids or unsuitable vehicles may be ineffective on thick, hyperkeratotic palms; potent agents with appropriate vehicles are often needed [^115GUQfy] [^112K4zrQ].

- **Persistent allergen or irritant exposure**: Continued exposure to triggers perpetuates inflammation despite steroid use [^1112naRi] [^113eUAiQ].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive treatments

When topical steroids fail, **consider the following**:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) | Immunomodulation | Effective steroid-sparing options | Local burning/itching; avoid in active infection [^116Tmmy1] [^111EMgHm] |
| Phototherapy (PUVA, narrowband UVB) | Immunosuppression | Effective for chronic, refractory cases | Skin cancer risk; requires specialized equipment [^notfound] |
| Systemic agents (alitretinoin, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine) | Immunosuppression | Effective for severe, refractory cases | Systemic side effects; regular monitoring required [^112dzHcc] [^116Tmmy1] |
| Biologics (dupilumab) | IL-4/IL-13 inhibition | Effective for atopic hand eczema | Injection site reactions; rare hypersensitivity [^notfound] |
| JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, abrocitinib) | JAK-STAT pathway inhibition | Rapid improvement in refractory cases | Systemic side effects; monitoring required [^notfound] |

## Practical strategies to improve steroid efficacy

To optimize steroid use in hand eczema, **consider the following**:

- **Correct potency and vehicle**: Use potent steroids (e.g. betamethasone, clobetasol) with occlusive vehicles (ointments) for thick, hyperkeratotic palms [^112K4zrQ].

- **Occlusion**: Apply steroids under occlusion (plastic wrap, gloves) to enhance penetration and efficacy [^115UYDQc] [^1144i1xD].

- **Patient education**: Address steroid phobia, ensure adherence, and teach proper application techniques (fingertip units, frequency) [^113LBWjF] [^111izKw9].

- **Trigger avoidance**: Identify and avoid allergens and irritants through patch testing and occupational modifications [^116QzrNY] [^113eUAiQ].

- **Adjunctive emollients**: Regular use of emollients improves barrier function and steroid efficacy [^1112naRi].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent advances include **topical JAK inhibitors** (e.g. delgocitinib), which show promise in clinical trials for refractory hand eczema [^113iEYyw] [^112dzHcc], and **biologics** such as dupilumab, effective for atopic hand eczema [^116gLKCP] [^1166PmWU]. These therapies offer new options for patients unresponsive to traditional treatments.

---

Topical steroids often fail in hand eczema due to barrier dysfunction, steroid phobia, incorrect use, and persistent triggers. Optimize steroid use with correct potency, occlusion, and education; escalate to calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, or systemic therapies when needed [^116EXTne] [^113eUAiQ].

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1165ve7z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of 104 trials and 8443 participants were included in this review. These covered a wide range of clinically plausible strategies for using topical corticosteroids in treating eczema, which fell into three broad categories:

which topical corticosteroid to use;
how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for; and
how best to apply the topical corticosteroid.

Summary of main results

The main findings, for which we have drawn up summary of findings tables, address 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, and 2. how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for.

Which topical corticosteroid to use

See: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

Our review focused on four comparisons of topical corticosteroid of one potency with another topical corticosteroid of a different potency (moderate versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus moderate topical corticosteroid, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid) for treating eczema flare‐ups, which reflects clinical practice decision making based on a stepped approach. In mainly moderate to severe eczema, potent and moderately potent topical corticosteroid probably result in an increased number of participants achieving clinician‐reported treatment success compared to mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence), with insufficient data to determine whether this applied to people with mild disease. There was also insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroid compared to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence). Again, the trials were mainly in moderate to severe eczema but perhaps more representative of the population that may be offered these higher‐potency topical corticosteroids There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroid, with only three small trials included in the meta‐analysis (low‐certainty evidence). These trials usually included more children than adults. The number of reported cases of skin thinning was very low, with a relatively even spread across groups but tending towards more events with increasing potency of topical corticosteroid. Most trials were of short duration so may not detect longer‐term adverse events (low‐certainty evidence for local adverse events, except for the comparison of very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid which we assessed as very low‐certainty.)

In six trials involving 188 participants, 16 participants had levels of cortisol outside of the normal range (very low‐certainty evidence). There were minimal data on whether the levels returned to normal once the topical corticosteroids were stopped, minimal data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression, and no data regarding impact on growth (see: Completeness of outcomes; safety).

Prevention methods are important for patients with hand eczema (HE), especially those with risk factors. Frequent use of moisturizers is encouraged. Few drugs have been approved specifically for HE. Topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay treatment. Several new topical and systemic drugs are currently in development for HE. Dupilumab has recently been shown effective for chronic HE. Established criteria can be used to help determine causality for occupational HE, which is important for worker's compensation. The second article of this CME series discusses prevention, management, treatment and worker's compensation for HE.

### Effect of dupilumab on hand eczema in patients with atopic dermatitis: an observational study [^116gLKCP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic treatment options are limited for chronic hand eczema patients. Currently, alitretinoin is the only approved systemic treatment option for all clinical subtypes of severe chronic hand eczema. The European guidelines recommend alitretinoin as a secondary treatment option for severe chronic hand eczema in patients with inadequate response to topical corticosteroids, 1 but the drug shows variable efficacy. Alitretinoin is primarily effective in the clinical subtype of hyperkeratotic hand eczema; in other subtypes, its effect is less profound. 2 For patients who are unresponsive to or intolerant of alitretinoin, remaining treatment options are scarce. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting interleukin (IL)‐4 and IL‐13 signaling. 3 Having shown its efficacy and safety in several large trials, 4 this biologic has now become widely available for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). So far, only three case studies have been published on the effect of dupilumab on (isolated) hand eczema. 5, 6, 7 Hand eczema is common in patients with AD 8 and various hand eczema classification systems exist which include the etiological subtype atopic hand eczema. 9, 10 This subtype is characterized as a hand eczema seen in patients with AD (previous or current) according to the UK Working Party criteria. 11 In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on hand eczema in a cohort of patients treated for AD.

### Hand eczema and steroid-refractory chronic hand eczema in general practice: prevalence and initial treatment [^115myKyh]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The self-reported annual prevalence of hand eczema (HE) in adults is about 10%. Incidence and prevalence data for HE, chronic HE (CHE) and steroid-refractory CHE (SR-CHE) in physician-attended populations are lacking.

Objectives

To estimate the prevalences of HE, CHE and SR-CHE in a primary-care population using a cross-sectional design; and to estimate the incidence of each and describe initial therapy using a cohort approach.

Methods

The population was all patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink for 2000–10, 2005–10 and 2010–11. HE was defined as any of 12 diagnoses (six specific to the hand, six for contact dermatitis). HE became CHE if any of these 12, or three additional diagnoses, occurred 90–365 days after the first HE, and if the patient was prescribed at least one course of potent topical steroids. A patient with CHE was classified as having SR-CHE if they were (i) referred to a dermatologist and/or (ii) prescribed phototherapy, systemic immunomodulators, oral corticosteroids, alitretinoin or acitretin.

Results

The 1-year adult prevalence of HE was 0.4%. The period prevalences of SR-CHE for 1, 5 and 10 years in adults were 0.008%, 0.036% and 0.072%, respectively; lifetime estimates were 0.071%, 0.080%, 0.098%. About one-half of cases of CHE were steroid refractory. All conditions were more common in female than in male patients. One-third of HE diagnoses were specific for the hand, the remainder were for contact dermatitis. The majority (62%) of newly diagnosed patients with HE were not prescribed treatment in the 12 months after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Although the prevalence of HE could be 2–3 times higher than reported herein, the proportion of adults seeking medical care for HE is a fraction of those who self-report HE. SR-CHE is rare.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116QcV4r]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This systematic review and NMA was conducted using standard Cochrane methodology, and according to its own pre‐published protocol and statistical analysis plan. In brief, we included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials evaluated people of any age with a clinical diagnosis of eczema (also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity. Specific, non‐atopic forms of eczema such as contact dermatitis, hand eczema or seborrheic eczema and clinically infected eczema were excluded. Eligible interventions included any well‐characterised topical anti‐inflammatory treatment. Emollients alone, topical antibiotics alone, complementary therapies, wet wraps, systemic treatment and phototherapy were excluded. In general, non‐licensed or non‐standard treatment regimens were excluded — for example application less than once daily or more than twice daily, or treatment durations of under 1 week. Comparison was to other topical anti‐inflammatory treatments, placebo/vehicle/emollient or no treatment. TCS were classified as mild, moderate, potent or very potent, as previously described. Outcomes and outcome measures were prioritised according to the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative; and informed by patient and public involvement during preliminary surveys and workshops as part of trial protocol development. Outcomes evaluated are summarised below:

2.1 Primary Outcomes

Patient‐reported symptoms of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly a visual analogue scale of pruritus.
Clinician‐reported signs of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was considered separately from other clinician‐reported signs of eczema, since the construct of IGA as a single global assessment is emphasised by some regulatory authorities and may differ from other measures of eczema signs.

### Treatment of severe, chronic hand eczema: results from a UK-wide survey [^116Gqwu4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of severe hand eczema (HE) that is resistant to topical potent corticosteroid treatment is challenging. In 2013, we surveyed 194 UK dermatologists to obtain information about their usual treatment pathways to inform the choice of the comparator in a trial of alitretinoin in severe HE (ALPHA trial); the results indicated that the treatment approaches favoured by UK dermatologists differ. Psoralen combined with ultraviolet A (PUVA) and alitretinoin were identified as the most frequent first-line treatment options for hyperkeratotic HE, whereas oral corticosteroids were identified as the most frequent first-line treatment for vesicular HE, followed by PUVA and alitretinoin. In terms of potential adverse effects of long-term or repeated use, oral steroids and ciclosporin A were reported to cause most concern. There is uncertainty about which treatment gives the best short and long-term outcomes, because of a lack of definitive randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of different treatment pathways in severe HE.

### Summary of research: efficacy and safety of delgocitinib cream in adults with moderate to severe chronic hand eczema (DELTA 1 and DELTA 2): results from multicentre, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials [^113iEYyw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This is a summary of the original article: "Efficacy and safety of delgocitinib cream in adults with moderate to severe chronic hand eczema (DELTA 1 and DELTA 2): results from multicentre, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trials". Chronic Hand Eczema (CHE) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial, fluctuating, and chronic inflammatory disease associated with pain, itch, and a significant quality-of-life burden for patients. The phase 3 DELTA 1 and DELTA 2 trials assessed the efficacy and safety of twice-daily delgocitinib cream 20 mg/g, a pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, compared with cream vehicle in adults with moderate to severe CHE. Delgocitinib cream demonstrated superior efficacy versus cream vehicle in outcomes reported by clinicians (e.g. Investigator's Global Assessment for CHE [IGA-CHE] treatment success [IGA-CHE 0 (clear)/1 (almost clear)] and ≥ 75/90% improvement in Hand Eczema Severity Index) and patients (e.g., itch, pain, and Dermatology Life Quality Index). Delgocitinib cream exhibited a favorable safety profile in both trials. These results suggest that delgocitinib cream is a treatment option for the relief of clinical signs and symptoms among patients with moderate to severe CHE for whom topical corticosteroids are inadequate or inappropriate.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^112hUYpn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

We GRADE assessed almost all clinician‐reported effectiveness outcomes as moderate, with only one judged very low. The reason for downgrading the effectiveness outcomes was due to issues identified by the risk of bias assessment and in the comparison classed as low, imprecision. Only half of the comparisons from the summary of findings table reported complete numerical data for the most reported patient‐reported outcome; patient global assessment. Of those that did, one provided moderate‐quality evidence, one low, and one very low. The reason for downgrading the data obtained from this analysis was again issues from the risk of bias assessment, and in the trials assessed as low, unexplained heterogeneity. In the comparison classed as very low, small numbers of events and participants meant we downgraded the comparison twice for this outcome in addition to the risk of bias concerns.

We judged all but one comparison low with regards to the data concerning skin thinning. This was again due to issues highlighted by the risk of bias assessment and imprecision. The comparison in which we classed the skin thinning data as very low was downgraded twice for imprecision due to low numbers of events and participants.

In all assessments of the evidence associated with abnormal cortisol assessment, we judged the certainty of the evidence as very low. This was due to risk of bias issues and low numbers of events and participants. One comparison also demonstrated inconsistency.

Where we sought further information from authors relating to risk of bias assessments, our requests for further data did not always get a response (see Table 10). In many cases, this is likely owing to the age of the included trials.

We did not downgrade any GRADE assessments due to publication bias. However, only two analyses that included assessment of short‐term IGA from the potent versus moderate and twice or more versus once daily topical corticosteroid comparisons, included enough trials to allow the generation of valid funnel plots. Both showed no clear asymmetry (Figure 5 relating to Analysis 3.1; Figure 6 relating to Analysis 7.1).

### Overview of studies of treatments for hand eczema-the EDEN hand eczema survey [^112UdB4J]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hand eczema is a major cause of morbidity and lost earnings. Many interventions ranging from topical steroids to oral ciclosporin are used, but their evidence base and the best methods to assess their efficacy are uncertain.

Objectives

As part of a long-term project to improve standards of design and reporting in hand eczema trials, we sought to describe the prevalent study designs and comment on the quality of reporting of such studies. METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane, Medline, Embase, Pascal, Jicst-Eplus, Amed) were searched from January 1977 to April 2003 using all possible variants of the terms hand and eczema/dermatitis. In addition, four general medical and 17 specialist dermatology journals were hand-searched by pairs of researchers for all possible therapeutic studies.

Study Selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they dealt with hand eczema as diagnosed by a physician irrespective of the aetiology, and if they described the results of a study of a therapeutic intervention in humans. Single case reports and reviews were excluded, but case series and nonrandomized studies were considered alongside randomized studies. Data selection For each study, two researchers independently assessed the type of study, outcome measures, enrolment criteria, randomization, masking of interventions and how losses to follow-up were dealt with.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of studies according to type of intervention and study type. Proportion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that adequately reported eligibility criteria, randomization generation and concealment, masking and intention-to-treat analysis.

Results

A total of 90 studies reported in 87 papers dealt with 11 different classes of interventions. Around 80% of the studies dealt with just four interventions: ultraviolet light, topical steroids, radiation and systemic immunosuppressives. Of the 90 studies, 44 were case series, 15 were nonrandomized controlled trials, and the remaining 31 were RCTs. Of the 31 RCTs, 16 were parallel (one with cross-over design) and 15 self-controlled. Only 11 of the RCTs adequately reported eligibility criteria. The randomization method was described in 10, and there was adequate concealment of allocation in eight. Masking the treatment allocation from both the study assessors and patients was done in 11 RCTs, and intention-to-treat analysis was reported in four. Only 13 RCTs were 4 months or longer in duration. No study reported a rationale for the sample size, and in only one study had the outcome variable been validated.

Conclusions

Most 'trials' in hand eczema are not RCTs. Internally controlled (left/right) studies were common. Based on the poor overall quality of reporting, most RCTs of hand eczema trials are not adequate to guide clinical practice. Future trials of hand eczema should be randomized, using a parallel group or self-controlled design. Research is needed to develop validated and clinically relevant outcome measures. Most of the remaining issues relating to poor quality of existing evidence can be relatively easily dealt with by following the CONSORT guidelines.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2019. part 2: treatment [^115zmxKG]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual evidence updates on atopic eczema (AE), and provides a summary of key findings from systematic reviews (SRs) published or indexed in 2019 related to AE treatment. Several SRs assessed the efficacy of topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and topical Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway inhibitors. However, there is a lack of good-quality trials comparing topical treatment agents with TCS, which remain the standard of care for patients with AE. Most of the included trials lack meaningful comparisons as they used vehicle as a comparator. There is also lack of harmonization of outcome measures for AE across studies. Large, well-designed RCTs are needed to further determine whether any specific emollients offer superior benefit. There is evidence highlighting limited benefit of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment of eczema. Mycophenolate mofetil may have a role in patients with refractory AE. Among biologic therapies, most of the efficacy data relate to dupilumab. Furthermore, there is growing evidence for the efficacy and safety of systemic JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors, but the existing data are of low quality.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induced skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

Description of the intervention

Topical corticosteroids were first introduced in the 1950s when topical hydrocortisone was found to improve various dermatoses (Sulzberger 1952). Since then, a huge number of topical corticosteroids of increased potency have been developed, and are available in various formulations such as creams and ointments. Mometasone furoate is one of the newer generation of products developed with the intention of producing a safer, potent topical corticosteroid (Prakash 1998). Topical corticosteroids are all classified by their potency from mild through to very potent, although the classification of potency varies around the world (British National Formulary 2018; WHO 1997). The choice of potency to be used is based on age, body site to be treated and severity of eczema. Low‐ to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids are usually sufficient for mild eczema and are also used on sensitive skin such as the face and flexural areas. Potent or very potent topical corticosteroids are usually used in severe, thick eczematous plaques over thicker skin sites, such as limbs and palmoplantar surfaces. The advice is to use topical corticosteroids, of appropriate potency, once a day until the eczema is controlled, then 'as required' (NICE 2007).

Treatment

Treating HE depends on the severity, etiology, morphology, and location of HE, comorbidities, and, if possible, identification and avoidance of causal exogenous factors such as allergens and irritants (Table 3). Acute HE should be treated immediately to avoid chronicity, using topical anti-inflammatory agents and emollients. Full regeneration of the epidermal barrier takes several weeks or months. Patients must be advised to avoid re-exposing the skin before complete healing and stabilization of HE, and that prolonged exposure to potent topical corticosteroids may further impair the skin barrier function. The skin barrier on the palms needs more time for recovery compared with palmar locations. Treating CHE means a multimodal treatment concept including topical and systemic treatment together with general measures such as continuing use of emollients. Patients tend not to use topicals when receiving a systemic treatment, and not to use emollients when topical treatment is started with glucocorticoids and immunomodulators. A Cochrane review identified 60 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a considerable heterogeneity in the use and duration of treatments, outcome measures, and long-term control. Only 24 studies included a follow-up period.

c Off-label topical treatment, except for HE of atopic etiology

Topical Treatments

Emollients/moisturizers are used for the treatment of HE but evidence of their efficacy is limited. A Cochrane review included two small studies on the protective use of emollients but no conclusions were drawn on efficacy. Three additional studies showed that emollients may reduce severity and itch. There is no evidence that supports the use of any specific moisturizers in HE, however emollients are used in HE to maintain and/or improve skin barrier function. The preference of the patient as well as existing (contact) allergies must be considered. Use, acceptance, and compliance with emollients/moisturizers can be improved when easy accessibility (for example, in a dispenser in an easily accessible place) along with clear instructions on how, when, and which product to choose are provided.

Depending on national practices, tanning substances (lotion, cream, bath, e.g. Tannolakt ®, Tannosynt ®) and topical antipruritic substances such as menthanol and urea (preferentially in hyperkeratotic CHE) complement topical treatment modalities.

### Management of chronic hand eczema [^113RWjap]. Contact Dermatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Hand eczema (HE) is one of the most frequent skin diseases and has often a chronically relapsing course with a poor prognosis resulting in a high social and economic impact for the individual and the society. In this article, we highlight the results of an expert workshop on the 'management of severe chronic hand eczema' with the focus on the epidemiology, the burden of severe HE, its classification and diagnostic procedures, and the current status of treatment options according to an evidence-based approach (randomized controlled clinical trials, RCTs). We conclude that despite the abundance of topical and systemic treatment options, disease management in patients with severe chronic HE is frequently inadequate. There is a strong need for RCTs of existing and new treatment options based on clearly diagnosed subtypes of HE and its severity.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^114HBu2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

Objectives

To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence). When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.

### Consensus statement on the management of chronic hand eczema [^116EXTne]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of chronic hand eczema is often inadequate. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines specifically for the management of chronic hand eczema, and evidence for established treatments for hand eczema is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. This consensus statement, based on a review of published data and clinical practice in both primary and secondary care, is intended to guide the management of chronic hand eczema. It describes the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hand eczema, its diagnosis and its effect on patients' quality of life. Management strategies include a skin education programme, lifestyle changes, and the use of emollients, barriers and soap substitutes. Topical drug therapy includes topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Treatment with psoralen ultraviolet A and systemic therapies may then be appropriate, although there is no strong evidence of efficacy. Alitretinoin has been shown to be effective in a randomized controlled trial, and is currently the only treatment specifically licensed for the treatment of hand eczema. Recommendations for management are summarized in a treatment algorithm.

### Strategies for topical corticosteroid use in children and… [^111Jg9Cy]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer High- and medium-potency topical corticosteroids increase treatment success compared with low-potency topical corticosteroids, but there is no difference in effectiveness between high- and medium-potency topical corticosteroids. Application of topical corticosteroids once daily is probably as effective as twice daily. Weekend therapy likely prevents eczema relapses without an increased risk of adverse effects.

1. Practice Pointers Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is common worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of life. It affects up to 20% of children and 5% of adults.

1 Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed treatment, and prescribing patterns vary widely in the United States. 2 The authors of this review sought to identify the most effective strategies for topical corticosteroid use to treat eczema in adults and children, including different potencies, frequencies, and techniques of application. They also identified potential adverse effects. Medium-potency topical corticosteroids were more effective than low-potency corticosteroids. No adverse effects were reported in either group. High-potency topical corticosteroids were more effective than low-potency corticosteroids. When reported, low-certainty evidence demonstrated that the rates of local and systemic adverse effects were low across all comparison groups.

For the secondary outcome of patient-reported symptoms, there were few data for meta-analysis; few studies reported this outcome, but data generally favored high- and medium-potency topical corticosteroids over low-potency topical corticosteroids. The authors compared weekend therapy with no topical corticosteroid use or a reactive application when a flare-up was present for the prevention of eczema relapses following a two- to four-week stabilization phase. Clinician-reported data showed a lower risk of relapse with weekend therapy.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^111vkvTP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta‐analysis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria

We included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti‐inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti‐inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient‐reported eczema symptoms, clinician‐reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, long‐term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application‐site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high‐income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry‐funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) was only possible for short‐term outcomes.

Patient‐reported symptoms

NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE‐4 inhibitors.

NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25 to ‐0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐1.57, 95% CI –2.42 to ‐0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI.

A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Clinician‐reported signs

NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE‐4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness.

NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐2.69, 95% CI ‐3.36, ‐2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.87, 95% CI ‐2.69, ‐1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class‐level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI.

A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Investigator Global Assessment

NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE‐4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI.

Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta‐analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants).

Local adverse effects

NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application‐site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions.

NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%.

NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term (median 3 weeks, range 1‐16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE‐4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application‐site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term TCS but an increase with longer‐term TCS.

Topical Glucocorticoids

Along with emollients, topical glucocorticoids are the topical treatment of choice for HE. A Cochrane review on HE included nine studies on topical glucocorticoids, with six studies of very short duration (≤ 3 weeks), and mostly compared two glucocorticoids or compared the same glucocorticoids in different vehicles, dosages, or application frequency. All showed a reduction in disease severity. Clobetasol foam yielded favorable participant-rated disease control versus vehicle after 15 days, but skin atrophy is frequent, especially when treatment cycles are repeated. The only study with a longer duration (36 weeks) assessed disease control with mometasone twice per week versus thrice per week versus no mometasone, after having reached remission. Thrice-weekly mometasone may work slightly better than twice-weekly, with only a few reports of mild atrophy.

Potent topical glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit repair of the stratum corneum, in part due to filaggrin degradation, and may cause skin atrophy in long-term use. The therapeutic index describes the ratio between desired and non-desired effects, especially skin atrophy, and should be considered particularly in long-term use topical glucocorticosteroids. Mometasone appears to be moderately potent with fewer adverse effects, and once-daily treatment is sufficient and may even be superior to twice-daily application. Intermittent dosing may reduce the risk of skin atrophy but there is little evidence to support this. Clinical experience indicates that alternating or combining a topical glucocorticoid with a topical calcineurin inhibitor may be considered in an attempt to reduce adverse effects, although the long-term safety of this approach is unknown. The addition of topical glucocorticoids increased the efficacy of systemic treatment with alitretinoin.

Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors

The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are licensed for the treatment of AD but not for HE of other etiologies. A Cochrane review on HE included four small studies on tacrolimus and five larger studies on pimecrolimus (duration ≤ 8 weeks). Burning or itching may occur in initial tacrolimus treatment and when erythema and vesicles are dominating. Data for pimecrolimus 1% are conflicting and there were no significant differences in efficacy between pimecrolimus and placebo. As the skin barrier on the palms differs from that on the back of the hands, the large calcineurin inhibitor molecules may penetrate better on the back of the hands, potentially resulting in better efficacy.

### Economic burden of chronic hand eczema: a review [^111KNwPu]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been no extensive synthesis of studies evaluating the cost of chronic hand eczema (CHE). This review evaluated the societal costs, healthcare resource utilisation, missed work time and job loss due to CHE. MEDLINE and 16 other databases and websites were searched in October 2020 for studies meeting prespecified inclusion criteria. Studies conducted in Europe, Australia, New Zealand or the Americas were included. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, and full-text papers published in English between 2000 and 2020, for relevance. Data extraction was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. All data were based on costs between 2001 and 2013 but have been inflated to 2020 prices and converted to US dollars and Euros. A total of 30 studies (reported in 33 publications) were included in the synthesis. Mean total societal costs per year per patient ranged from $2549 (€1813) to $10,883 (€7738). Pharmacological therapy was, on average, $28.34 (€20.15) per month in Italy and $36.49 (€25.94) per month for emollients in Switzerland. Yearly treatment costs were $599.05 (€425.92) for drugs, including topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, other topical treatments and oral treatments, and $178.40 for emollients, in Germany. CHE was associated with hospitalisation costs ranging from $81.86 (€58.20) per patient per month (US) to $105.04 (€74.68) per patient per month (Italy) and $639.59 (€454.75) per year (Germany). Up to 57% of patients took sick leave and up to 25% reported job loss/job change due to CHE. This review confirms the significant cost burden of CHE. Given the paucity of studies estimating the monetary costs of absenteeism, presenteeism and job loss associated with CHE, current mean societal costs are likely underestimated. Uncontrolled disease may also lead to increased costs to patients and society.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^1135NE3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles altering the potency and giving the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, area of involvement, age of the patient, and most importantly, severity of the condition. Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers such risk for side effects, and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^112AcXAP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Other strategies examined

Newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate, are probably more effective than older topical corticosteroids; use of second‐generation topical corticosteroid is approximately two and a half times more likely to result in cleared or marked improvement on IGA compared to older topical corticosteroid in adults and children with moderate or severe eczema when used in the short term for treating a flare. Most trials tested once daily application of the second‐generation topical corticosteroid in line with the marketing strategy compared to twice‐a‐day use of the older topical corticosteroid, supporting the conclusion that these newer topical corticosteroids are probably more effective. However, given many of these trials were industry funded, an independent trial would be beneficial.

Whether a cream or ointment preparation of the topical corticosteroid is used may have little to no effect on clinical signs of eczema, but the evidence is very uncertain with a high degree of imprecision. Similarly, the data from three trials that compared different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroid was not conclusive. We found no evidence comparing the branded versus a generic version of the same topical corticosteroid.

The frequency that topical corticosteroid is applied each week (i.e. every day or less frequently) may have little to no effect on clinical signs of eczema and safety, but the evidence is very uncertain. Substituting an evening application of topical corticosteroid with a topical calcineurin inhibitor may have little to no effect on effectiveness in children with moderate to severe eczema compared to applying topical corticosteroid twice a day, but the evidence is very uncertain from only one very small trial, with no data on skin thinning or adrenal suppression.

Using topical corticosteroid under wet wraps may have little to no effect on investigator‐assessed signs, but the evidence is very uncertain with a high degree of imprecision, and when we addressed the heterogeneity in the limited meta‐analysis, the results favoured topical corticosteroid without wet wraps. Minimal safety data meant that we could not draw firm conclusions, however, skin infections did occur with wet wraps without corresponding events reported in the participants who did not use wet wraps. The time of day that the topical corticosteroid is applied, whether topical corticosteroid is applied to wet or dry skin, or order of application of topical corticosteroid and emollients may have little to no effect on clinician‐reported signs of eczema or implications for safety, but the evidence is very uncertain from only one or two small trials for each comparison. No trials looked at the optimum time to leave between emollient and topical corticosteroid application.

Pooled analyses: potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid

Investigator global assessment (IGA) We pooled IGA, as a short‐term outcome (range 1 to 4 weeks), from nine trials (Gentry 1973; Giannetti 1981; Handa 1985; Kirkup 2003a; Mali 1976; Ryu 1997; Savin 1976; Veien 1984; Wortzel 1975), that included 392 participants; 326 from the parallel‐group trials and 66 from the within‐participant trials. Most trials used a 4‐, 5‐, or 6‐point scale and we pooled data from categories corresponding to 'cleared or marked improvement' where possible. In the parallel‐group trials, 131 of 165 participants who used potent topical corticosteroid achieved cleared or marked improvement compared to 73 of 161 who used mild topical corticosteroid. In the within‐participant trials, 25 of 66 participants achieved cleared or marked improvement on the side treated with potent topical corticosteroid compared to 16 of 66 on the side treated with mild topical corticosteroid (OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; P < 0.00001; I² = 39%; 9 trials, 458 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.1), indicating that potent topical corticosteroid is more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid. This corresponds to a need to treat 3.2 people with potent topical corticosteroid to achieve an additional treatment success compared to mild topical corticosteroid (95% CI 2.4 to 5.7). We observed this effect in analyses of trials of a single strategy only, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.1; Analysis 2.1.2), as well as in multiple strategies including a second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.3), and a second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid applied once daily versus twice daily application of mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.4). The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for over half of the trials; therefore, we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. We were unable to perform subgroup analyses of adults and children owing to the lack of trials in adults only, so we restricted the previous short‐term IGA analyses to three trials in children (Giannetti 1981; Kirkup 2003a; Veien 1984). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement in the short term was 2.21 (95% CI 1.39 to 3.51; P = 0.0008; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 245 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.2), in favour of potent topical corticosteroid, consistent with the overall finding. We then pooled IGA as a short‐term outcome from three trials that included participants with moderate to severe eczema (Kirkup 2003a; Savin 1976; Veien 1984). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement was 2.69 (95% CI 1.34 to 5.39; P = 0.005; I² = 35%; 3 trials, 232 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.3.1), in favour of potent topical corticosteroid. Two trials included participants with mild to moderate eczema (Giannetti 1981; Ryu 1997). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement was 4.84 (95% CI 0.33 to 71.44; P = 0.25; I² = 80%; 2 trials, 63 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.3.2). We observed no difference between the two groups when we pooled only trials in mild‐ to moderate‐severity eczema, however, the test for subgroup differences for Analysis 2.3 was not statistically significant, with a P value of 0.68, suggesting that potent topical corticosteroids are more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroids regardless of baseline severity of eczema.
Investigator assessment of clinical signs We pooled investigator assessment of clinical signs as a short‐term outcome (day 5 to 6) from two parallel‐group trials in 46 children with severe eczema (Lebrun‐Vignes 2000; Queille 1984). The SMD was a decrease of 0.63 (95% CI −0.95 to 2.21; P = 0.43; I² = 82%; 2 trials, 46 participants; Analysis 2.4) and therefore did not reflect the difference between potent and mild‐potency topical corticosteroid seen in the main pooled IGA analysis. The statistical heterogeneity is high; Queille 1984 favours potent topical corticosteroid while Lebrun‐Vignes 2000 shows no difference, but the number of participants is small, and the confidence intervals do overlap. The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for one of the trials, therefore we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. Both trials included in SMD Analysis 2.4 included children with severe eczema only, therefore no further restricted analyses were required.
Number of participants with a greater IGA compared to the other group We pooled IGA, in the form of the number of participants for whom each topical corticosteroid was judged to be better than the other, as a short‐term outcome (week 1), from three within‐participant trials in 67 participants (Cahn 1961; Roth 1973; Yasuda 1976). Roth 1973 included participants aged 18 months to 59 years with moderate to severe eczema; Cahn 1961 and Yasuda 1976 did not specify age and severity. The clinician‐reported potent topical corticosteroid to be superior to mild in 39 participants and mild to be superior in six (OR 11.70, 95% CI 5.67 to 24.15; P < 0.00001; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 67 participants; Analysis 2.5) in favour of potent topical corticosteroid. The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for two of the trials, therefore we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. None of the trials included in Analysis 2.5 were in either adults or children only, and only one trial reported participants' baseline severity (Roth 1973; moderate to severe eczema); therefore, no further subgroup or restricted analyses were possible.
Data not included in the meta‐analyses We could not include nine trials in the meta‐analyses, either because we could not pool the instrument used to measure clinician‐reported signs of eczema alongside those included (Thomas 2002), because the duration was too long relative to the short‐term outcomes pooled (Prado de Oliveira 2002), or because the numerical data were incomplete (Fadrhoncova 1982; Kaplan 1978; Kirkup 2003a; Marten 1980; Noren 1989; Sanabria‐Silva 1991; Vernon 1991), and are summarised in Analysis 2.6. Five trials suggest potent topical corticosteroid to be more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid in line with the meta‐analyses favouring potent topical corticosteroid, but most are difficult to interpret with any certainty due to lack of information about the scale used or lack of dispersion data. The remaining four trials did not show any difference between the two potencies, including Thomas 2002, which compared mild topical corticosteroid used daily with short, three‐day bursts of potent topical corticosteroid. One trial (Sanabria‐Silva 1991), looked for 'rebound', defined as "reactivation of lesions with greater intensity than their pre‐treatment state" in the 10 days after the cessation of topical corticosteroid treatment (end of treatment was 4 weeks). No participants in either the potent topical corticosteroid group (assumed 15 participants) or mild topical corticosteroid group (assumed 15 participants) were reported as having experienced rebound.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^117BryDh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Key differences with NICE guidance.

NICE says use once or twice a day. This review suggests there is no evidence of additional effectiveness of application of potent topical corticosteroids once a day over twice a day (we GRADE‐assessed the evidence as moderate certainty). For mild or moderate topical corticosteroids there is a lack of evidence regarding once‐ or twice daily application.
NICE says there is limited evidence on strategies to prevent flares. This review provides moderate‐certainty evidence for use of weekend (proactive) therapy.
This review suggests that newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than older topical corticosteroids; this is not included in NICE guidance. We did not GRADE‐assess the evidence within this analysis as it was not one of the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables.

We found limited or no evidence to support some of the recommendations in NICE.

NICE says occlusion strategies should not be used as first‐line treatment in children, should only be initiated by a healthcare professional trained in their use, and should only be used for 7 to 14 days without specialist dermatological advice.
NICE says do not use potent topical corticosteroids in children under 12 months without specialist dermatological supervision.
NICE says to start treatment of moderate eczema with moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid and severe eczema with potent topical corticosteroid. Whilst this review supports the notion that stronger topical corticosteroids probably have increased effectiveness, there was insufficient data in participants with mild to moderate eczema to fully support this stepped approach.
NICE says, in children over 12 months, to use potent topical corticosteroids for as short a time as possible and in any case for no longer than 14 days.
NICE says to use mild potency for the face and neck, except for short‐term use of moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids for severe flares, and to use moderate or potent preparations for short periods only in the axillae and groin.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CfdL9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and topical anti-inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. The relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments is uncertain.

Design

Network meta-analysis performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory eczema treatments.

Data Sources

Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries to June 2023.

Eligibility Criteria For Selected Trials

Included trials were within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema or hand eczema. Interventions were topical anti-inflammatory treatments but not complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy or systemic treatments. Comparators were no treatment/vehicle or another topical anti-inflammatory.

Results

We identified 291 trials (45,846 participants), mainly in high-income countries. Most were industry-funded with median 3weeks treatment duration. Risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was high in 89% of trials, mainly due to risk of selective reporting. Network meta-analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1% and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient-reported symptoms (40 trials, all low confidence) and clinician-reported signs (32 trials, all moderate confidence). For investigator global assessment, the Janus kinas inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% or 0.25%, very potent/potent topical steroids and tacrolimus 0.1% were ranked as most effective (140 trials, all moderate confidence). Continuous outcome data were mixed. Local application site reactions were most common with tacrolimus 0.1% (moderate confidence) and crisaborole 2% (high confidence) and least common with topical steroids (moderate confidence). Skin thinning was not increased with short-term use of any topical steroid potency (low confidence) but skin thinning was reported in 6/2044 (0.3%) participants treated with longer-term (6–60 months) topical steroids.

Conclusion

Potent topical steroids, Janus kinase inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as among the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1117nAWA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first-line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician-reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main Results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty-five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data. Stronger-potency versus weaker-potency topical corticosteroids Sixty-three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician-reported signs of eczema. We pooled four trials that compared moderate- versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate-potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence). Twice daily or more versus once daily application We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks. Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare-up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher-potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low-certainty evidence. Longer versus shorter-term duration of application for induction of remission No trials were identified. Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare-ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe). Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty. Other comparisons Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare-ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare-ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low- or very low-certainty, short-term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer-term trials, in people with mild eczema.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — proactive topical therapy versus reactive use: In patients with atopic dermatitis and a relapsing course, the JTF panel recommends use of proactive therapy with a topical calcineurin inhibitor or mid‑potency topical corticosteroid (US classes 3–5) over applying treatments only in reaction to flares (strong recommendation, moderate‑certainty evidence). A topical treatments systematic review and meta‑analysis including 1964 patients across 14 RCTs, 4 to 12 months in duration, found proactive therapy reduced incidence of flare (69 per 100 vs 38 per 100, RD −31 [−40 to −20], relative risk: 0.55 [95% CI, 0.42–0.71]) with little to no adverse effects (24% vs 27%; RD 3 [−2 to 9]). After inducing remission, proactive therapy was best studied as application once per day on 2 consecutive days of per week for several months to maintain AD control, and once‑daily mid‑potency topical medications may help facilitate proactive therapy. Values and preferences emphasized high value on safe and effective therapies and preference of self‑efficacy, and contextual factors note proactive therapy is widely accessible and uses less overall topical medication compared with a reactive strategy.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115bYdnC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

It is well established that some patients, parents and clinicians have considerable concerns about using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema (Charman 2000; Li 2017; Teasdale 2017). As a result, topical corticosteroids are often under‐used in Western countries, resulting in poorly controlled disease (Lundin 2018). Conversely, in other areas of the world, such as India, potent topical corticosteroid use is often unregulated and patients are able to obtain these steroids over the counter. Subsequent inappropriate use of potent topical corticosteroids can lead to an increase in adverse events (Coondoo 2014).

This situation is exacerbated by the lack of clarity as to how the different ways of using topical corticosteroids — such as once‐a‐day or twice‐a‐day application, increasing topical corticosteroid potency in response to a flare, or twice‐a‐week use to proactively prevent flares — affect both effectiveness and safety profile. The British National Formulary (BNF) provides little reassurance, describing adrenal suppression as rare but providing no quantification of other side effects (British National Formulary 2018). Concerns and uncertainties around topical corticosteroids were highlighted in the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for eczema, in which the following two topics relating to topical corticosteroid safety were identified by patients and healthcare professionals as priority areas for research (Batchelor 2013).

"What is the best and safest way of using topical corticosteroids?"
"What is the long‐term safety of topical corticosteroids?"

This comprehensive systematic review is needed to summarise the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids to support patients and clinicians in making informed treatment choices. However, since most eczema trials have a relatively short follow‐up, this review will primarily address the first of these two questions.

The strategies included in this review will refer to different methods of using topical corticosteroids to improve effectiveness or safety, or both, and hence achieve the best outcomes for patients. A strategy may aim to improve the long‐term control of eczema, for example, in the case of proactive topical corticosteroid treatment. This strategy involves weekly application of topical corticosteroid, for two consecutive days, to previously affected or new sites of eczema, to reduce the risk of flares (Schmitt 2011). Alternatively, a strategy such as reducing the frequency of application may be designed to improve the safety of the drug whilst maintaining effectiveness (Green 2004; Williams 2007).

Table II — Certainty of evidence categories and implications: High certainty evidence indicates being very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty evidence indicates being moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty evidence indicates confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty evidence indicates the estimate of effect is very uncertain; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Cost and quality of life in patients with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to standard therapy with topical potent corticosteroids [^114vc7FA]. Contact Dermatitis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the socio-economic burden of severe chronic hand eczema in patients refractory to treatment with potent corticosteroids.

Objectives

To estimate the socio-economic burden of severe chronic hand eczema refractory to potent topical corticosteroids, and to establish an algorithm for the estimation of the health-related quality of life EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) utility index from the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) summary score.

Methods

A multicentre cost of illness study was conducted, adopting the societal perspective. Adult patients with severe and refractory chronic hand eczema were enrolled. Direct (e.g. drug treatment and travel) and indirect (i.e. loss of productivity) mean costs/patient-month were estimated. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D and DLQI questionnaires. An ordinary least square regression model was used to investigate relationships between health-related quality of life scores.

Results

One hundred and four valid patients (mean age 44.5years, 39.4% male) participated. Overall mean costs were €418.3/patient-month: loss of productivity contributed 43.7%, followed by hospitalization (16.1%) and travel (10.3%). Health-related quality of life scores were, on average, 0.50 (EQ-5D utility) and 11.3 (DLQI). Utility and DLQI summary were significantly related to each other.

Conclusions

Wellbeing and loss of productivity are the most important consequences in these patients. Appropriate treatment is necessary to improve patient health and productivity, which will contribute to reducing societal costs.

### Novel treatment of chronic severe hand dermatitis with bexarotene gel [^112g2E85]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hand dermatitis is an eczematous inflammation of the hands that is related to occupation or to routine activities. It often becomes chronic, and in some patients may become severe and disabling. Topical corticosteroids are effective treatment, particularly for milder forms, but they often lose effectiveness with time and can produce skin atrophy.

Objectives

To evaluate bexarotene gel topical therapy for safety, tolerability and efficacy in patients with chronic hand dermatitis.

Methods

A phase I-II open-label randomized clinical study of bexarotene gel, alone and in combination with a low- and a mid-potency steroid, was conducted in 55 patients with chronic severe hand dermatitis at two academic clinics.

Results

Patients using bexarotene gel monotherapy reached a 79% response rate for ≥ 50% clinical improvement and a 39% response rate for ≥ 90% clearance of hands. Adverse events possibly related to treatment in all patients were stinging or burning (15%), flare of dermatitis (16%) and irritation (29%). Thirteen patients (24%) withdrew early, including two for related adverse events and five for inadequate response.

Conclusions

Bexarotene gel appears to be safe, tolerated by most patients, with useful therapeutic activity in chronic severe hand dermatitis.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) — topical corticosteroids (also called topical steroids) are the mainstay of therapy for AD, and in patients with uncontrolled AD refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a TCS with high-certainty evidence. In randomized clinical trials mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, TCS probably did not importantly increase adverse effects. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged continuous periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin); continuous and prolonged use of lower potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects. After addressing active disease, TCSs are strongly recommended for continued intermittent therapy to prevent future flares.

### Hand dermatitis: review of etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^116QzrNY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is a common condition seen in the primary care setting. Occupational exposures and frequent hand washing often lead to symptoms that are irritating and may cause discomfort. Irritant dermatitis, atopic hand dermatitis and contact hand dermatitis account for at least 70% of all diagnoses. A unifying feature in most cases is an underlying disruption in the stratum corneum, altering its barrier function. Transepidermal water loss increases with barrier disruption and is exacerbated by additional exposure to water. Precise diagnosis and subsequent treatment present a considerable challenge, and hand dermatitis often becomes chronic. Initial treatment should be aimed at controlling inflammation and restoring the skin's natural barrier. Common management recommendations include the avoidance of irritants and potential allergens along with the use of emollients and topical corticosteroids to decrease inflammation. Simple petroleum-based emollients are very effective at restoring hydration and repairing the stratum corneum. Referral to a Dermatologist or an Allergist may be necessary for patients who require patch testing or those with refractory symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of topical delgocitinib in patients with chronic hand eczema: data from a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase IIa study [^117TK6Ww]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of chronic hand eczema (CHE) remains a challenge; effective topical treatment is limited to corticosteroids.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of a novel, pan-Janus kinase inhibitor (delgocitinib) in patients with CHE.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, phase IIa study, patients with CHE received delgocitinib ointment 30 mg g⁻¹ or vehicle ointment for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving treatment success ['clear'/'almost clear' skin with ≥ 2-point improvement in the Physician's Global Assessment of disease severity (PGA)] at week 8. Secondary end points included Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score changes and the proportion of patients achieving treatment success on the Patient's Global Assessment of disease severity (PaGA).

Results

Ninety-one patients were randomized. More patients receiving delgocitinib (46%) than vehicle (15%) [odds ratio 4.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49–16.09; P = 0.009] achieved treatment success (PGA). Adjusted mean HECSI score at week 8 was lower with delgocitinib (13.0) than with vehicle (25.8) (adjusted mean difference -12.88, 95% CI -21.47 to -4.30; P = 0.003). More patients receiving delgocitinib than vehicle achieved treatment success by PaGA, but this did not reach statistical significance. The incidence of adverse events was similar with delgocitinib and vehicle; none led to discontinuation of delgocitinib.

Conclusions

Delgocitinib ointment was efficacious and well tolerated. As a plateau of efficacy was not observed, a longer treatment period may lead to increased efficacy. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm these findings in patients with CHE. What's already known about this topic? Chronic hand eczema (CHE) has a significant burden. Few randomized controlled studies have evaluated current treatments for CHE; only limited data are available to inform and guide clinical practice decisions. There is currently an unmet need for efficacious and well-tolerated topical treatment options for patients with CHE. What does this study add? Delgocitinib is a novel, pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor specific for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2. Topical use of delgocitinib ointment resulted in clearance of CHE after 8 weeks of treatment in a significantly greater number of patients than vehicle; delgocitinib was also well tolerated. Results from this proof-of-concept clinical study suggest that topical delgocitinib may provide therapeutic benefit to patients with CHE with inadequate responses to topical corticosteroids.

### Topical tacrolimus 0.1% improves symptoms of hand dermatitis in patients treated with a prednisone taper [^116tYanw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hand dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder for which systemic immunosuppressive therapy is often needed. Topical treatments could complement the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Objective

To evaluate symptoms of hand dermatitis in subjects treated with a prednisone taper combined with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment versus vehicle.

Methods

Thirty-two subjects with moderate to severe hand dermatitis were enrolled in a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Subjects received a 3-week taper of prednisone and was randomized 2:1 to apply topical tacrolimus or its vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks. Disease severity was evaluated at baseline and at 5 follow-up visits (weeks 1–14). Any occurrence of relapse was recorded by patients.

Results

Twenty-two of the 32 subjects (69%) had relapse of their disease. The mean time to recurrence for tacrolimus versus vehicle was 48 versus 39 days, respectively (P = 0.78). A greater improvement of induration (P = 0.003) and scaling (P = 0.003) for patients with tacrolimus compared to vehicle was detected, as well as subjective improvement (%) from week 1 to week 12 (P = 0.04) compared to vehicle. Improvement in erythema (P < .0001), fissuring (P = 0.0003), pruritus (P = 0.06), and investigator's global assessment (P < .0001) with tacrolimus was not found to exceed improvement with vehicle.

Limitations

Small sample size provides limited power to detect differences in response.

Conclusions

Topical tacrolimus improves induration and scaling, and there is a trend suggesting it prolongs the time to recurrence.

### Treating chronic hand eczema with upadacitinib: insights from clinical trials and real-world experience [^114KYYZg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic hand eczema (CHE) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the hands and wrists causing itching, dryness, cracking, and pain. It often affects people with atopic dermatitis (AD) and can interfere with work and daily life. Topical therapies may have limited utility from ineffectiveness, poor adherence, or poor tolerability. Here, we evaluate oral upadacitinib (UPA) as a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with AD and refractory CHE.

Methods

This narrative review analyzed studies from PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE evaluating CHE treatments. Eligible studies utilized the Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI), a validated clinician-reported outcome measure assessing CHE severity. HECSI-75 is the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% improvement in clinical severity. Cases of three CHE patients from diverse demographics are presented.

Results

In two phase 3 randomized controlled trials of UPA for moderate-to-severe AD, 94.8% (803/847) and 92.6% (774/836) of patients had CHE with HECSI assessments at baseline. Rapid improvement in CHE was observed in patients who received either dose of UPA (15 mg or 30 mg) as early as week 1 (P ≤ 0.001 vs placebo). By week 8, up to 83% of UPA-treated patients achieved a statistically significant improvement in CHE (HECSI 75; P ≤ 0.001 vs placebo). These benefits were sustained through week 16. Real-world clinical cases showed CHE patients experienced marked symptom relief within days of initiating UPA.

Conclusion

UPA-treated patients experienced rapid and sustained relief from CHE lesions, making it a promising therapeutic option for CHE patients for whom topical therapies are ineffective.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^112ccag2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Dealing with missing data

Where possible we conducted an intention‐to‐treat analysis, including all randomised participants where data were provided. If data were missing, we contacted trial authors and produced a table in the review detailing such contact (e.g. dates, information requested, whether they replied; Table 10). If it was not possible to obtain clarification, we discussed whether to assume the number randomised or an otherwise similarly sensible estimate. We have indicated clearly where we have done this, or we have reported the ambiguous data narratively.

We conducted sensitivity analyses, removing trials at high risk of attrition bias (see Table 13) and we also considered attrition bias when undertaking our quality assessments (Schünemann 2013).

6
Sensitivity analyses: effect of studies with high risk of bias

For dichotomous data, we performed any calculations necessary to pool data divided by a similar threshold, for example, we combined results from multiple subclasses, or calculated exact numbers from reported percentages (rounding sensibly).

For continuous data, we attempted to calculate any missing statistics (e.g. standard deviations) using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2021). Where it was necessary to assume an ICC of 0.5 in our calculations we undertook sensitivity analyses using 0.25 and 0.75 to explore this choice (see: Table 14).

7
Sensitivity analyses: effect of imputing missing SD using a range of ICC* (0.25, 0.5, 0.75)

For time to event data, we performed calculations of missing HR from the statistics that were available according to Parmar 1998.

Assessment of heterogeneity

When pooling trials in a meta‐analysis, we considered any methodological and clinical differences between trials, and only included trials in the same meta‐analysis where it was considered appropriate. We assessed heterogeneity through forest plot inspection and the I² statistic (Higgins 2003), using the thresholds defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions: 0% to 40% might not be important; 30% to 60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90% may represent substantial heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% represents considerable heterogeneity (Deeks 2021). If we identified substantial or considerable statistical heterogeneity, we attempted to determine reasons for this by examining the trial characteristics and performing subgroup and sensitivity analyses where appropriate.

### CHEMIN-results from the national practice survey in chronic hand eczema therapeutic management [^112UdRNn]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Results

Respondents reviewed two clinical cases: one with moderate CHE and another with severe CHE (Table 1). Despite prior topical corticosteroids (TCS) failure in both cases and differing disease severities, the proposed therapeutic approach for each patient mainly relied on topical treatments (Figure 1A), such as TCS, emollients, or moisturisers (Figure 1B). Therapeutic education was recommended for both patients, although the focus varied (Figure 1A). Biological treatments were considered for both patients, with a similar proportion for each (Figure 1A). For the severe patient, respondents favoured conventional systemic treatments (Figure 1A) including acitretin (74% moderate, 85% severe), methotrexate (15% moderate, 14% severe), and cyclosporine (15% moderate, 6% severe). Quality of life (QoL) was a key factor in treatment selection for most respondents, whilst lesion severity was specifically emphasised for severe CHE. Other factors, such as clinical signs and symptoms, or the frequency of flare‐ups or persistence of lesions, were also reported (Figure 1C).

### Use and abuse of topical corticosteroids in infections of the skin and related structures [^112Qihr2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids have improved the management of many inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. However, these medications are associated with certain adverse effects that are potentially serious. The potent anti-inflammatory actions of these drugs increase susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections, and therefore may preclude them from use when infection is the known cause of the disease. In addition, children may be more vulnerable than adults to systemic effects of topical corticosteroids because percutaneous absorption is proportionately greater. These are important considerations, and physicians need to weigh and compare the risks and benefits associated with these medications before initiating treatment. This involves an appreciation of which patient populations are at high risk, which skin conditions are incompatible with topical corticosteroid therapy, and which alternative nonsteroidal medications are effective in treating inflammatory skin diseases.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^113nm1YC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis topical therapy — clinical questions, outcomes, and study scope focus on efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic topical treatments, the relative efficacy and safety of individual topical agents, and combination topical therapies; outcomes of interest include change in clinical signs/symptoms assessed by clinician, prevention of flares, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, infection, and patient-reported outcomes such as change in signs/symptoms, quality of life, and itch severity; inclusion criteria specify adults (≥ 18 y of age) with a clinical diagnosis of AD and published randomized controlled trials, with interventions limited to topical agents available and approved for use in the United States, while exclusion criteria include immunocompromised patients, contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, varicose eczema, discoid eczema and infected AD, treatments not available or approved in the United States, and unpublished research, observational studies, case series, case reports, modeling studies, and narrative reviews.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^116a2pou]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Incomplete outcome data

We assessed 42 out of 104 trials as being at low risk of bias in this domain, 19 at high risk of bias and 43 trials as unclear. Trials were likely to have been marked as at high risk of bias in this domain because a large proportion of the participants were unaccounted for in the results of the trial, in some cases because participants were dropped from the trial when they achieved clearance of their eczema symptoms.

Selective reporting

Out of the 104 trials included in the review, we judged 84 at unclear risk of reporting bias. We judged only three trials to be at low risk and 17 at high risk. This was usually because, if there was not a trial protocol available for the trial, we were not able to compare the a priori outcomes, and so again we judged this domain as unclear. As around 80% of the trials included in this review were from before 2005, when registration was required for publication by a consensus statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (De Angelis 2004), this is probably the reason for this issue.

Other potential sources of bias

We judged most of the trials at low risk of bias in this domain (86 trials). For the eight trials that we judged at high risk of bias, the reasons were differences in co‐interventions in the two groups (Foelster‐Holst 2006), problems with selection of an unrepresentative population (Giannetti 1981), violations in the trial protocol (Hanifin 2002), trial potentially stopped prematurely (Munro 1967), mismatches in baseline severity (Pei 2001), and lack of information about methodologies (Sefton 1984a; Sefton 1984b; Sefton 1984c). We judged the 10 remaining trials to be unclear.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) potency classification and safe-use considerations — TCS are classified in multiple ways, with 1 to 7 in the US system and 1 representing the most potent; the US system is best used in research but in clinical practice there are effectively 4 classes of potency of topical treatments, so both systems must be known to interpret and apply the literature. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin), and continuous and prolonged use of low-potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects.

### Effectiveness of topical anti-inflammatory drugs for eczema… [^1154Sjqf]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Which topical anti-inflammatory drugs are most effective for the treatment of eczema. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Low- to moderate-confidence evidence shows that select topical anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective treatment for eczema. These potent and very potent drugs include corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Alternatively, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors are among the least effective. Adverse effects are more likely with topical calcineurin inhibitors and PDE4 inhibitors and less likely with topical corticosteroids.

1. PRACTICE POINTERS Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin condition. Patients often have concomitant allergic rhinitis and asthma.

2 Although it affects up to 25% of children, prevalence decreases with age; only 7. 3% of adults reported eczema symptoms in the 2021 National Health Interview Survey. 2, 3 The authors of this Cochrane review investigated the most effective and safest topical anti-inflammatory drugs for eczema.

### Tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of occupationally induced chronic hand dermatitis [^112gpYZ8]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Occupational hand dermatitis (OHD) is a common and often chronic condition. Usage of topical corticosteroids is limited in long-term therapy because of potential side-effects. New treatment options are highly appreciated.

Objective

To study efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in patients suffering from OHD.

Patients and Methods

In a prospective, open, multicentre study, 29 patients with OHD of predominantly mild-to-moderate severity were treated with tacrolimus ointment (Protopic 0.1%) during a 4-week active treatment period with twice daily application followed by a 2-month optional treatment period. Efficacy was evaluated by the use of a standardized hand eczema score and by clinical severity rating, conducted on all study visits (screening, baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 12). Adverse events were recorded for safety evaluation.

Results

The hand eczema score declined significantly after 2 weeks of treatment compared with baseline and further declined until the end of the study. Finally, 12 (44%) patients were clear of hand eczema. Worsening of the dermatitis occurred in 2 patients (7%). Clinical grading indicated improvement too. Overall tolerability was good.

Conclusion

Topical tacrolimus might be an efficacious treatment option for chronic OHD. Blinded and randomized controlled studies are necessary to confirm the results of this pilot study.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114axaz3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. The relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments is uncertain.

Design

Network meta‐analysis performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory eczema treatments.

Data Sources

Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries to June 2023.

Eligibility Criteria for Selected Trials

Included trials were within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema or hand eczema. Interventions were topical anti‐inflammatory treatments but not complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy or systemic treatments. Comparators were no treatment/vehicle or another topical anti‐inflammatory.

Results

We identified 291 trials (45,846 participants), mainly in high‐income countries. Most were industry‐funded with median 3 weeks treatment duration. Risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was high in 89% of trials, mainly due to risk of selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1% and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient‐reported symptoms (40 trials, all low confidence) and clinician‐reported signs (32 trials, all moderate confidence). For investigator global assessment, the Janus kinas inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% or 0.25%, very potent/potent topical steroids and tacrolimus 0.1% were ranked as most effective (140 trials, all moderate confidence). Continuous outcome data were mixed. Local application site reactions were most common with tacrolimus 0.1% (moderate confidence) and crisaborole 2% (high confidence) and least common with topical steroids (moderate confidence). Skin thinning was not increased with short‐term use of any topical steroid potency (low confidence) but skin thinning was reported in 6/2044 (0.3%) participants treated with longer‐term (6–60 months) topical steroids.

Conclusion

Potent topical steroids, Janus kinase inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as among the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema.

### Corticosteroids: options in the era of steroid-sparing therapy [^111tkvzf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly used topical treatments for inflammatory dermatoses, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles-creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and, more recently, foam. The vehicle used can substantially affect the individual agent's clinical action, potency, and acceptability to the patient. Moreover, some vehicles are better suited for specific body areas. Selection of the appropriate product should be determined by area of usage, physician experience, cost, and patient preference, particularly regarding vehicle. Although topical corticosteroids are associated with several side effects, including skin atrophy, telangiectases, purpura, and striae formation, appropriate usage can minimize these occurrences. Judicious use includes short-term, appropriate application as initial monotherapy or in combination strategies with other therapeutic agents that ideally possess complementing mechanisms of action. Examples include pulsing with high-potency topical corticosteroids and combination regimens with other topical agents such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, or tazarotene. Appropriate education of patients and caregivers alike will facilitate the optimal use of these medications.

### Effectiveness of the healthy skin clinic – a randomized clinical trial of nurse-led patient counselling in hand eczema [^11715kZF]. Contact Dermatitis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hand eczema is a common disease, and continuous preventive skin protection and skin care must be adopted to prevent a chronic course. Hand eczema is not a uniform disease, and counselling must therefore be individually tailored.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led counselling programme, the Healthy Skin Clinic, emphasizing the patient's self-management, resources, and risks.

Patients and Methods

Patients (n = 306) referred for diagnostic work-up and treatment of hand eczema were randomized and allocated either to the programme or to usual care. The primary outcome was clinical disease severity at follow-up. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, burden of disease, skin protective behaviours, and self-reported medication adherence.

Results

Patients in the intervention group had greater reductions in clinical severity and reported more beneficial behavioural changes at follow-up than those in the usual-care group. This was especially true of patients who were treated solely with topical corticosteroids and who had a primarily exogenous aetiology of hand eczema. However, the effect was very dependent on baseline disease severity. No differences in quality of life or burden of disease were found between the two groups.

Conclusion

A tailored nurse-led programme of skin protection counselling may be recommended as an essential part of hand eczema treatment.

### Management of atopic hand dermatitis [^113AQdcT]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of clinical aspects of hand eczema in patients with atopic dermatitis. Hand eczema can be a part of atopic dermatitis itself or a comorbidity, for example, as irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. When managing hand eczema, it is important to first categorize the subtype and identify potential culprit allergens or irritants. First-line therapy should be a combination of emollients and topical corticosteroids; possible alternatives include topical calcineurin inhibitors or coal tar. Second-line therapy includes UV therapy and systemic therapy, including azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Prednisolone should only be very infrequently used.

### Current and emerging therapies for hand eczema [^112fUbVu]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Although hand eczema (HE) and chronic hand eczema (CHE) are common conditions with significant disease burden, they traditionally have had limited treatment options beyond topical and short-term systemic corticosteroids. We reviewed published and preliminary evidence on the current and emerging topical and systemic therapeutic agents for HE and CHE. The etiologies of various HE subtypes are discussed, and remaining knowledge and practice gaps are highlighted to encourage further investigations. A comprehensive search of ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed was completed for clinical trials that utilized known and emerging treatment options for HE and CHE. Several agents that target IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, keratinocyte proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production, bacterial protein synthesis, and inflammatory mediator (TNF-α, JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3) proliferation are shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of CHE. Systemic agents include dupilumab, alitretinoin, acitretin, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and probiotics. Topical agents include delgocitinib, retapamulin, halometasone/triclosan, calcipotriol/betamethasone, tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus. These modalities have demonstrated varying degrees of clinical efficacy, evaluated by subjective assessments and scoring indexes. Targeted therapies are emerging for HE, but options are still limited, partially due to our narrow understanding of this heterogeneous condition. Additional and targeted therapeutic options are needed to match the rising prevalence and burden of HE. KEYPOINTS: Hand eczema (HE) is a heterogenous dermatosis with limited therapeutic options due to a lack of international guidelines regarding classification of HE subtypes and treatment. This review discusses current and emerging topical and systemic agents and their efficacies in the treatment of different types of hand eczema.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^114zRFJS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

While eczema often improves during early childhood or puberty, a significant proportion of individuals still require treatment in adult life (Abuabara 2018), and in others, eczema does not start until adulthood. Eczema is managed with long‐term treatments. For the majority of people, treatment is topical. Emollients (bland moisturisers) are a mainstay of eczema treatment, but predominantly have a preventative role through hydrating the skin and improving the skin barrier; they are inadequate to reduce inflammation, except in very mild cases. To treat actively inflamed areas, topical anti‐inflammatory agents are needed (NICE 2007).

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first‐line topical anti‐inflammatory treatment for eczema (NICE 2007; Wollenberg 2020). TCS are typically applied once or twice daily to actively inflamed areas of skin for seven to 14 days, or until resolution. Prolonged, continuous use of TCS is not usually advised. However, 'weekend therapy' (i.e. the proactive regular twice‐weekly application of treatment) is used, and can improve long‐term control in people with frequent flares (Williams 2004). TCS preparations can be classified into different potency groups based on vasoconstriction assays (Eichenfield 2014), and different potencies are used for treatment depending on the individual's age, site of application, and disease severity. Antimicrobials and salicylic acid may also be added to TCS preparations. TCS agents have a very well‐established safety profile as they have been used extensively since the 1950s. Despite this, research suggests that many people with eczema and their carers have a number of concerns about TCS (Teasdale 2021), including skin thinning (Charman 2000). Although such adverse effects are typically associated with inappropriate use of more potent TCS agents (Charman 2000; Hajar 2015), people with eczema and their carers also have concerns when using mildly potent agents (Bos 2019; Charman 2000). These concerns can have important implications for treatment adherence and, consequently, disease control.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113Z6uwP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety

Extraction of individual adverse events was restricted to known adverse events of topical corticosteroid, which are well‐established drugs, identified from the Summary of Product Characteristics and prioritised with patient and clinician input. Although reported in this review where finer detail was unavailable, the overall number of adverse events gives no information on the type of adverse event and is not generally helpful in clinical decision making.

Data on individual adverse events were limited and often poor quality. Two of the key adverse events that are of concern to patients and parents are skin thinning and adrenal suppression, however trial authors rarely specified how they had measured skin thinning and there was little information on resolution of adverse events after stopping the topical corticosteroid.

Clinically relevant adrenal suppression was rarely looked for in the included trials; an exception being Kohn 2016, that compared topical corticosteroid application to wet versus dry skin. Some trials did measure and report cortisol levels, but the certainty of this evidence was consistently very low. Trials used different methods for measuring cortisol, often with little or no interpretation regarding whether the levels were abnormal and without specifying the reference ranges used. Some trials only tested a small subset of participants and reporting was often poor, lacking key numerical data. Furthermore, there were minimal data on whether this biochemical measurement returned to normal levels when topical corticosteroid was stopped, which would have provided an indication of the clinical relevance of such measurements. Additionally, the relatively small size of most trials (median 44.5 participants; range 3 to 409) means they are unlikely to be able to detect all but the most common adverse events. As a result, we are unable to draw conclusions from these data.

### Efficacy of a 3% K ā nuka oil cream for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eczema: a single blind randomised vehicle-controlled trial [^115jVAsd]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eczema typically presents as a chronic, relapsing, pruritic rash affecting children and adults. In a 2010 global burden of disease survey, eczema ranked second in disability-adjusted life-years when compared to other common skin conditions. Patients and their families experience significant quality of life impact and financial burden from eczema. Patients often experience significant sleep disturbance caused by itching as well as limitations to their social life and everyday activities. A study assessing out of pocket cost for eczema patients across nine European countries found an average out of pocket cost of 927 euros (1,585 New Zealand Dollars) per year per patient with the primary cost purchase of emollients and moisturisers.

Eczema lesions develop due to an impaired skin barrier, leading to exposure to environmental allergens which triggers a heightened cutaneous T-helper cell mediated immune response. There is no known cure for eczema and current treatments focus instead on long term symptom management, and disease control. Treatment is often based on the cyclical nature of the disease, with maintenance use of emollients and moisturisers to maintain skin integrity. Topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, are typically used to dampen the inflammation that occurs during exacerbations, but they can also be used as a maintenance therapy. If topical anti-inflammatory treatments prove ineffective then phototherapy and systemic immune modulating therapies may be considered. Eczema lesions are also prone to secondary infection potentially resulting in the need for antiseptic or antibiotic therapy. Poor treatment adherence is a key reason for treatment failure in eczema, a particular issue for topical corticosteroids due to a negative patient perception around side effects. Providing patients with novel non-steroidal options may be viewed more favourably, and lead to improved treatment adherence.

### Hand dermatitis: a review of clinical features, prevention and treatment [^112bqEJS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hand dermatitis is a socially significant health problem. This review provides a discussion on the clinical features and patterns as well as the differential diagnosis of hand dermatitis, because these are essential for proper diagnosis in clinical practice. The morphology, however, is poorly related to the etiology in chronic cases. In all cases of chronic hand dermatitis, a full diagnostic examination should be undertaken and the etiology should be clarified and addressed in the treatment concept, instead of just moving directly from a morphological diagnosis to therapy. Preventive measures should be included in the treatment concept according to etiology. A stepwise approach for escalating therapy is advised, including basic topical therapy, topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, as well as phototherapy and systemic therapy with corticosteroids, alitretinoin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, and others.

### Hand eczema is common and multifactorial [^114f6EuN]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians agree that hand eczema is multifactorial, although there are many uncertainties regarding causative factors. Atopic dermatitis is assumed to be a major risk factor, whereas the role of allergies is overestimated. Twin studies may shed light on the contribution of other endogenous, possibly genetic factors versus the role of exposure to environmental agents, with the latter being amenable to prevention and intervention.

### New topical and systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis [^115BY5nL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Delgocitinib cream 2% was approved in 2024 in the United Kingdom for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic hand eczema and is currently under review with the FDA. Delgocitinib cream 2% showed promising results for the treatment of chronic hand eczema in two phase III RCTs with a vehicle control and in a phase III RCT versus oral alitretinoin. Currently, there are no published clinical trials of delgocitinib cream 2% in atopic dermatitis.

A network meta‐analysis found that, compared to a vehicle control, delgocitinib ointment 0.5% was among the most effective topical therapies when assessing clinician‐reported outcomes (OR 7.61, 95% CI [3.72–15.58]), slightly below topical ruxolitinib 1.5% (9.34 [4.8–18.18]). The RCTs of delgocitinib in atopic dermatitis limited use to ≤ 30% BSA and a maximum dose of 5 g per application; it is currently unclear if there are safety concerns beyond these parameters. Moreover, some patients had detectable plasma levels of delgocitinib, and it will be important to determine if there are any associated long‐term implications. While delgocitinib cream 2% has shown to be a promising alternative to oral alitretinoin in chronic hand dermatitis, its efficacy and safety have not yet been reported in atopic dermatitis.

### Adult-onset atopic dermatitis: fact or fancy? [^116bktAq]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis therapy can be a challenge in many cases. Persistence into adulthood often reflects the more severe cases and such patients have the added problems of hand eczema and thick nummular lesions that resist topical medications. Within this group are patients labeled as having adult-onset atopic dermatitis, a designation that is hard to define and probably represents those whose childhood eczema was simply forgotten. Management is difficult for most adult cases and should not be diverted by questionable labels.

### Innovative management of severe hand dermatitis [^117Q4Mbh]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

The successful treatment of hand dermatitis (HD) depends less on the selection of the proper topical steroid or a particular systemic agent than on addressing any underlying cause or perpetuating factor. Thus, innovative treatment is based on comprehensively addressing the patient's problem. Aggressive approaches may be required for the most severe forms of HD.

### Guidelines for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of hand eczema [^116Fpmm3]. Contact Dermatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand eczema is a common inflammatory skin disorder. Health care providers need continuously updated information about the management of hand eczema to ensure best treatment for their patients.

Objectives

To update the European Society of Contact Dermatitis guideline on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment on of hand eczema.

Method

The Guideline Development Group (GDG) was established on behalf of the ESCD. A call for interest was launched via the ESCD website and via the ESCD members' mailing list. Appraisal of the evidence for therapeutic and preventive interventions was applied and a structured method of developing consensus was used and moderated by an external methodologist. The final guideline was approved by the ESCD executive committee and was in external review on the ESCD webpage for 1 month.

Results

Consensus was achieved for several statements and management strategies.

Conclusion

The updated guideline should improve management of hand eczema.

### Topical steroids for atopic dermatitis in primary care [^115dncxy]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is very common. In most instances, the condition is relatively mild and can be managed in primary care. Topical corticosteroids are the standard therapy for controlling acute 'flares' of dermatitis. However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of topical delgocitinib cream versus oral alitretinoin capsules in adults with severe chronic hand eczema (DELTA FORCE): a 24-week, randomised, head-to-head, phase 3 trial [^112dzHcc]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic hand eczema is a heterogeneous, fluctuating, and long-lasting disease affecting the hands and wrists that substantially affects quality of life. For severe chronic hand eczema, topical corticosteroids are often unsatisfactory and systemic treatment can be required. The aim of the head-to-head, phase 3 DELTA FORCE trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical delgocitinib cream versus oral alitretinoin, the only currently approved systemic drug for severe chronic hand eczema.

Methods

This randomised, assessor-masked, trial was conducted at 102 trial centres in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and the UK. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with severe chronic hand eczema were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive response technology system to delgocitinib cream 20 mg/g (twice daily) or alitretinoin 30 mg (once daily) for up to 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) score from baseline to week 12. Efficacy of delgocitinib cream versus alitretinoin was assessed in all eligible randomly assigned patients who had available data at baseline, and safety was assessed in all patients exposed to trial treatment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05259722) and is complete.

Findings

Between June 15, 2022, and Dec 5, 2023, 513 (334 [65%] female and 179 [35%] male) patients were randomly assigned to receive delgocitinib cream (n = 254) or alitretinoin (n = 259). Ten patients were excluded after randomisation due to not meeting eligibility criteria, so the full analysis set consisted of 250 patients in the delgocitinib group and 253 in the alitretinoin group. One patient in the delgocitinib group and three in the alitretinoin group were excluded from the primary analysis as they had missing HECSI data at baseline. A significantly greater least squares mean change in HECSI score from baseline to week 12 was observed with delgocitinib cream (-67.6 [SE 3.4]; n = 249) versus alitretinoin (-51.5 [3.4]; n = 250; difference -16.1 [95% CI -23.3 to -8.9], p < 0.0001). Fewer patients reported adverse events in the delgocitinib group (125 [49%] of 253 patients) than in the alitretinoin group (188 [76%] of 247). The most frequent adverse events were headache (ten [4%] in the delgocitinib group vs 80 [32%] in the alitretinoin group), nasopharyngitis (30 [12%] vs 34 [14%]), and nausea (one [< 1%] vs 14 [6%]).

Interpretation

Delgocitinib cream showed superior efficacy and a more favourable safety profile versus oral alitretinoin over 24 weeks. These results support the benefit of delgocitinib cream in patients with severe chronic hand eczema.

### Interventions for hand eczema [^116Tmmy1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand eczema is an inflammation of the skin of the hands that tends to run a chronic, relapsing course. This common condition is often associated with itch, social stigma, and impairment in employment. Many different interventions of unknown effectiveness are used to treat hand eczema.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical and systemic interventions for hand eczema in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following up to April 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, LILACS, GREAT, and four trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared interventions for hand eczema, regardless of hand eczema type and other affected sites, versus no treatment, placebo, vehicle, or active treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were participant- and investigator-rated good/excellent control of symptoms, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included 60 RCTs, conducted in secondary care (5469 participants with mild to severe chronic hand eczema). Most participants were over 18 years old. The duration of treatment was short, generally up to four months. Only 24 studies included a follow-up period. Clinical heterogeneity in treatments and outcome measures was evident. Few studies performed head-to-head comparisons of different interventions. Risk of bias varied considerably, with only five studies at low risk in all domains. Twenty-two studies were industry-funded. Eighteen trials studied topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors; 10 studies, phototherapy; three studies, systemic immunosuppressives; and five studies, oral retinoids. Most studies compared an active intervention against no treatment, variants of the same medication, or placebo (or vehicle). Below, we present results from the main comparisons. Corticosteroid creams/ointments: when assessed 15 days after the start of treatment, clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam probably improves participant-rated control of symptoms compared to vehicle (risk ratio (RR) 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 3.91; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 8; 1 study, 125 participants); the effect of clobetasol compared to vehicle for investigator-rated improvement is less clear (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.40). More participants had at least one adverse event with clobetasol (11/62 versus 5/63; RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 6.06), including application site burning/pruritus. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. When assessed 36 weeks after the start of treatment, mometasone furoate cream used thrice weekly may slightly improve investigator-rated symptom control compared to twice weekly (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.61; 1 study, 72 participants) after remission is reached. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Some mild atrophy was reported in both groups (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.83; 5/35 versus 3/37). This evidence was rated as low certainty. Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light: local combination ultraviolet light therapy (PUVA) may lead to improvement in investigator-rated symptom control when compared to local narrow-band UVB after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.16; 1 study, 60 participants). However, the 95% CI indicates that PUVA might make little or no difference. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Adverse events (mainly erythema) were reported by 9/30 participants in the narrow-band UVB group versus none in the PUVA group. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Topical calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus 0.1% over two weeks probably improves investigator-rated symptom control measured after three weeks compared to vehicle (14/14 tacrolimus versus 0/14 vehicle; 1 study). Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Four of 14 people in the tacrolimus group versus zero in the vehicle group had well-tolerated application site burning/itching. A within-participant study in 16 participants compared 0.1% tacrolimus to 0.1% mometasone furoate but did not measure investigator- or participant-rated symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated when assessed at two weeks during four weeks of treatment. Evidence from these studies was rated as moderate certainty. Oral interventions: oral cyclosporin 3 mg/kg/d probably slightly improves investigator-rated (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.99; 1 study, 34 participants) or participant-rated (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.27) control of symptoms compared to topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% after six weeks of treatment. The risk of adverse events such as dizziness was similar between groups (up to 36 weeks; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.86, n = 55; 15/27 betamethasone versus 19/28 cyclosporin). The evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Alitretinoin 10 mg improves investigator-rated symptom control compared with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.07; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6.3 to 26.5; 2 studies, n = 781) and alitretinoin 30 mg also improves this outcome compared with placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.43; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 2 studies, n = 1210). Similar results were found for participant-rated symptom control: alitretinoin 10 mg RR 1.73 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.40) and 30 mg RR 2.75 (95% CI 2.18 to 3.48). Evidence was rated as high certainty. The number of adverse events (including headache) probably did not differ between alitretinoin 10 mg and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; 1 study, n = 158; moderate-certainty evidence), but the risk of headache increased with alitretinoin 30 mg (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.81; 2 studies, n = 1210; high-certainty evidence). Outcomes were assessed between 48 and 72 weeks.

Authors' Conclusions

Most findings were from single studies with low precision, so they should be interpreted with caution. Topical corticosteroids and UV phototherapy were two of the major standard treatments, but evidence is insufficient to support one specific treatment over another. The effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is not certain. Alitretinoin is more effective than placebo in controlling symptoms, but advantages over other treatments need evaluating. Well-designed and well-reported, long-term (more than three months), head-to-head studies comparing different treatments are needed. Consensus is required regarding the definition of hand eczema and its subtypes, and a standard severity scale should be established. The main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. Small sample size impacted our ability to detect differences between treatments.

### Topical pimecrolimus for eczema [^111WjpEs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pimecrolimus was developed as an alternative to topical corticosteroids for treating eczema (atopic dermatitis) but its efficacy and safety compared with existing treatments remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pimecrolimus for treating eczema.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to October 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (from 2003 to October 2006), and EMBASE (from 2005 to October 2006). We also contacted researchers and manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of 1.0% topical pimecrolimus used twice daily compared against other topical comparators for treating eczema.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently examined each retrieved study for eligibility and extracted data for efficacy, tolerability and safety. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

Main Results

We included 31 trials (8019 participants) in the analysis. In short-term (≤ 6 weeks) trials, pimecrolimus cream was significantly more effective and well-tolerated than vehicle (cream base, but not containing pimecrolimus). In long-term trials (≥ 6 months), pimecrolimus was significantly better than vehicle in preventing flares (9 trials, 3091 participants, RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.64 at six months) and in improving quality of life. Pimecrolimus was significantly less effective than two topical corticosteroids, i.e. 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide for investigators' global assessment (1 trial, 658 participants, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and 0.1% betamethasone valerate for participants' global assessment (1 trial, 87 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.81) at three weeks. Pimecrolimus was also associated with significantly more overall withdrawals and skin burning. None of the trials reported on key adverse effects such as thinning of skin. Pimecrolimus was significantly less effective than 0.1% tacrolimus for investigators' global assessment at six weeks (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.74) and led to more withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.08) based on two trials involving 639 participants, but there was no significant difference in proportions of participants experiencing any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical pimecrolimus is less effective than moderate and potent corticosteroids and 0.1% tacrolimus. The therapeutic role of topical pimecrolimus is uncertain due to the absence of key comparisons with mild corticosteroids.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^113sQUET]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient
Time between application of emollient and steroid

We also included combinations of any of the strategies above (e.g. short burst of potent topical corticosteroids versus longer duration of mild topical corticosteroids).

Since the focus of this review was to compare different strategies of using topical corticosteroids, we excluded the following comparisons.

Topical corticosteroid compared with either no treatment, vehicle or placebo (unless it was specifically assessing an alternative regimen such as weekend (proactive) therapy)
Topical corticosteroid compared with another topical corticosteroid of the same potency and preparation but no differences in how they were used. We developed a hierarchy of sources to assign potency to each topical corticosteroid (Table 9). Potencies were most frequently determined using the British National Formulary 2018 and WHO 1997. If we could not establish the potency using these sources, we reviewed regional guidelines and the wider scientific literature, and consulted regional experts until we could reach a decision.
Topical corticosteroid compared with different topical treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors or emollients
Topical corticosteroid compared with systemic treatments
Topical corticosteroid treatment in conjunction with an eczema treatment used for the most severe cases of eczema as defined by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); that is, phototherapy and systemic therapy (NICE 2018). This was because it would have been difficult to detect any differences in efficacy or safety between the topical corticosteroid strategies when such treatments were also used.

Classification of topical corticosteroid potency

Types of outcome measures

We assessed both effectiveness and safety to reflect the overall aim of this review.

The effectiveness outcomes of interest for this review were focused on the two domains for which the international Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative recommended core outcome measurement instruments, that is, clinician‐reported signs and patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (HOME).

There is currently no agreed standardised timing for effectiveness outcome assessments for eczema trials. Therefore, to assess treatment effects in a consistent way, we focused on short‐term effectiveness outcomes reported between one and four weeks (taking the earliest available time point within that range), medium‐term effectiveness outcomes between 12 and 16 weeks (taking the closest time point to 12 weeks), and long‐term effectiveness as the longest time point longer than 16 weeks.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^114WrPkL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first‐line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician‐reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty‐five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data.

Stronger‐potency versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroids

Sixty‐three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician‐reported signs of eczema.

We pooled four trials that compared moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low‐certainty evidence).

Twice daily or more versus once daily application

We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks.

Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare‐up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher‐potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low‐certainty evidence.

Longer versus shorter‐term duration of application for induction of remission

No trials were identified.

Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare‐ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application

Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe).

Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty.

Other comparisons

Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare‐ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare‐ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low‐ or very low‐certainty, short‐term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer‐term trials, in people with mild eczema.

UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

Key areas where this review supports NICE guidance (NICE 2007).

NICE says do not use very potent preparations in children without specialist dermatological advice. Most cases of skin thinning collated into this review were in participants using very potent steroids. We assessed the evidence found within this review relating to the rates of skin thinning using GRADE as low or very low certainty.
NICE says start with mild steroids for those with mild eczema. Within the potent versus mild topical corticosteroid comparison, there was no difference between mild and potent topical corticosteroid in participants with mild to moderate eczema, suggesting that mild steroids may work well enough for this group, however this only considered 43 participants from two trials and the confidence interval was wide compared to the data in moderate to severe eczema, which favoured potent topical corticosteroid. Furthermore, as there were more reports of skin thinning in more potent steroids, the trade‐off of more effectiveness from higher potency does not seem necessary for this group unless it fails to control the flare. The evidence for potency in relation to specific disease severities was not GRADE‐assessed independently from the overall analysis of potency.
NICE says healthcare professionals should discuss risks and benefits, emphasising that the benefits outweigh possible harms when topical corticosteroid are applied correctly. Most participants had a good response to topical corticosteroids, these results were taken from within trials usually GRADE‐assessed to be of moderate certainty. Rates of adverse events such as skin thinning were generally very low, though we GRADE‐assessed this evidence as low or very low certainty.
NICE says prescribe according to lowest acquisition cost. We did not find any data that compared generic and branded topical corticosteroids.
NICE says healthcare professionals should consider treating problem areas of atopic eczema with topical corticosteroids for two consecutive days per week to prevent flares, instead of treating flares as they arise, in children with frequent flares (2 or 3 per month) once the eczema has been controlled. This strategy should be reviewed within three months to six months to assess effectiveness. This review supports weekend (proactive) therapy for the prevention of eczema flares, including in children, however more trials are needed to verify for how long this should be continued (effectiveness evidence for weekend (proactive) therapy GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty).
This review confirms the research gap identified by NICE regarding a lack of good, long‐term data on topical corticosteroid safety. For example, we GRADE‐assessed the safety data reported for the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables as low or very low certainty.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### Calcipotriol ointment shows comparable efficacy to topical steroids in chronic hand eczema [^111Wnwvo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical potent corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for chronic hand eczema (CHE). However, there are numerous adverse effects associated with the chronic use of topical corticosteroids. Calcipotriol has been widely used in psoriasis and has been reported to achieve beneficial effects in several inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcipotriol ointment compared to desoximetasone ointment in the treatment of CHE. Patch testing was performed in all recruited subjects. Then, each hand of the patient was randomly allocated for the application of either calcipotriol ointment or desoximetasone ointment twice daily for 8 weeks. Recurrence was assessed 4 weeks after discontinuation of the treatment. The Hand eczema severity index (HECSI) scores, quartile grading assessments and digital photographs were evaluated. Adverse reactions were also monitored. A total of 13 participants completed the protocol. Mean HECSI scores revealed up to a 75% reduction in both treatments (p < .001) without significant differences between the groups (p > .05). Approximately 70% of the subjects reported more than 75% improvement with calcipotriol at the end of the treatment. Mild scaling and mild dryness were the most common reactions found with calcipotriol and desoximetasone, respectively. In conclusion, calcipotriol ointment is safe and as effective as desoximetasone ointment. Calcipotriol ointment may be an alternative treatment option for CHE.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Once-daily versus twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) — in patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis using mid-to-high-potency topical treatments, the JTF panel suggests applying the medication once per day over twice per day application (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence); evidence from Nine RCTs comprising 1507 participants showed high-certainty evidence for a small difference between regimens (MD −3.33 [−4.28 to −2.39] on SCORAD scale 0–103; RD to improve by 50% from baseline 5 more per 100 [1–9 more]), which is just above the a priori threshold of 3 per 100 set by the guideline panel, and harms were no different between groups; patient-centered considerations include that patients who value a simpler treatment routine and using less overall medication may prefer once per day application, whereas patients with a more severe flare or who might value resolving it more quickly may prefer twice per day application, and once per day application would use less overall TCS and TCI and could lead to less resource use compared with twice per day application.

Participants of any age and gender with a diagnosis of eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity by a healthcare professional, or using established diagnostic criteria for eczema, e.g. the standardised diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (Hanifin 1980) or the UK Working Party diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis (Williams 1994). We also accepted modified versions of standard diagnostic criteria. Where it was unclear whether a trial included participants with atopic eczema, a senior clinician (HCW) made a judgement as to whether the trial was to be included. This was primarily based upon the pattern of symptoms described in the paper.

We included trials that included participants with other types of eczema such as contact dermatitis, varicose eczema, and seborrhoeic eczema, or other inflammatory or 'steroid‐responsive' skin conditions such as psoriasis, only if the trial also included people with eczema and the data were reported separately.

Types of interventions

The intervention was any topical corticosteroid of any preparation and potency in a trial where one strategy of using the topical corticosteroid was compared to a different strategy. This included the following strategies (see Figure 1).

### The efficacy of a transdermal hydrogel patch containing betamethasone dipropionate for treatment of chronic hand eczema: a single-blind, randomized and controlled trial [^116JGZUq]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids under occlusion have been used to enhance the treatment of eczema. However, no study has investigated the efficacy of a steroid-containing transdermal patch for the treatment of chronic hand eczema.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial to determine the efficacy of a transdermal patch containing betamethasone dipropionate compared to topical betamethasone dipropionate ointment in the treatment of mild to moderate chronic hand eczema. The patients were included and assigned to receive either the transdermal patch once daily at night or the ointment twice daily for a period of 8weeks. The outcomes were assessed using the Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI), Physical Global Assessment (PGA) score, self-reported compliance, level of patient satisfaction, quality of life, and side effects.

Results

Fifty-six patients completed this study. At 8weeks, there was a significant reduction in the HECSI scores in both the transdermal patch and topical ointment groups compared to those measured at baseline (14.61 to 1.86, p < 0.001; 18.46 to 3.43, p < 0.001, respectively) without a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, the two groups did not show any significant difference in the PGA scores, quality of life and side effects. However, the transdermal patch group reported better compliance and a higher level of patient satisfaction than the topical ointment group.

Conclusion

The transdermal corticosteroid patch has proven to be a safe and effective treatment, comparable to topical corticosteroids, after 8weeks of use. Its sustained-release properties, along with once-daily use, can improve patient satisfaction and promote greater adherence to the treatment.

Trial Registration

This study was registered with the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (www.

### Efficacy of alitretinoin depending on the concomitant use of topical corticosteroids in chronic hand eczema patients [^113eTaa5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Alitretinoin is the only systemic agent approved for the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema (CHE) unresponsive to potent topical corticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of oral alitretinoin with topical emollients for CHE treatment, but most studies have failed to reach a therapeutic success rate of 50%. Reasonably, we thought it would be more effective to combine topical corticosteroids with oral alitretinoin, but the concomitant use of topical corticosteroids has not been studied yet. One-hundred and seven Korean patients diagnosed with CHE were recruited. The participants were divided into two groups depending on the concomitant use of topical corticosteroids. Comparative analysis was performed between the combined therapy (alitretinoin and topical corticosteroids) and monotherapy groups (alitretinoin only) by using physician global assessment (PGA), patient's global assessment (PaGA), modified total lesion symptom score (mTLSS), and recurrence rates. The combined therapy group showed a significantly higher treatment success rate than the alitretinoin monotherapy group for all efficacy parameters (PGA: P < 0.001, PaGA: P < 0.001, mTLSS changes: P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the groups (P = 0.266). Combined use of topical corticosteroids is recommended for CHE patients being treated with oral alitretinoin due to clinically rapid and superior effectiveness.

### A review of hand eczema subtypes: clinical features, biomarkers and treatment strategies [^116SS4MZ]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Hand eczema is a common dermatological condition that significantly impairs quality of life. The classification of hand eczema has been considered an essential step for its management. The diagnosis of hand eczema relies on the aetiological and clinical features of hand lesions, a process complicated by the heterogeneous presentations and the considerable overlap among its subtypes. However, the investigation of hand eczema biomarkers and the advent of targeted therapies have shed light on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review adopts a subtype-specific approach to hand eczema, addressing clinical, pathogenic and therapeutic factors, with the aim of providing a comprehensive understanding of this heterogeneous condition from the perspective of its subtypes.

### Hand eczema [^1166PmWU]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hand eczema is a highly prevalent skin disease and one of the most common work-related disorders. In up to two-thirds of individuals affected by hand eczema, the disease becomes chronic and results in substantial personal and occupational disability. Manifestations of chronic hand eczema vary in severity and appearance over time, and people with eczema typically experience itch, pain, and a burning sensation. The pathophysiology of chronic hand eczema is multifactorial. Major risk factors are current or past atopic dermatitis and excessive or prolonged exposure to irritants or allergens. Based on the suspected main causes, chronic hand eczema is commonly classified into irritant, allergic, and atopic hand eczema. Diagnosis and assessment can be complex, and management is often challenging. Strategies include structured education, avoidance of trigger factors, primary to tertiary prevention, topical anti-inflammatory treatment with glucocorticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or januskinase inhibitors, phototherapy, systemic retinoids, and off-label use of immunosuppressive drugs. Topical and systemic immunomodulatory therapies approved for atopic dermatitis could be used in severe atopic hand eczema and some of them are under clinical development for chronic hand eczema. Additional research is needed to better understand chronic hand eczema subtypes and underlying mechanisms, and the comparative effectiveness and safety of therapies. This Review combines established knowledge with ongoing changes in our understanding of the disease and their implications for prevention, management, and future research.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^111MCLKz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroid alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitor versus topical corticosteroid alone

We included only one trial (Sikder 2005), that compared topical corticosteroid alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitor (15 participants) versus topical corticosteroid alone (15 participants). This parallel‐group, short‐term trial in children aged 7 to 15 years old with moderate to severe eczema compared a moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid in the morning and 0.03% tacrolimus ointment in the evening (alternating group) versus a moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid applied twice daily. Treatment for continued for four weeks, with two weeks' follow‐up.

Effectiveness: changes in clinician‐reported signs of eczema (primary outcome)

This trial combined EASI (scale of 0 to 72, increase represents worsening eczema) with a patient assessment of itching. Both groups showed significant improvement in eczema at week 4 in this composite outcome; median reduction (representing an improvement) in modified EASI from baseline was 98.7% in the alternating group (15 participants) compared to 95.1% in the group who received topical corticosteroid alone (14 participants). Median increase in adjusted EASI score at two weeks after treatment was stopped was 7.9% in the alternating group (14 participants) compared to 20.6% in the group who received topical corticosteroid alone (14 participants).

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Sikder 2005 incorporated the patient‐reported outcome of itch into the clinician‐reported adjusted EASI score above and did not report it separately.

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Two cases of burning were identified in the alternating group (15 participants) compared to one in the topical corticosteroid alone group (15 participants). One case of itching was reported in the alternating group (15 participants) compared to two in the topical corticosteroid alone group (15 participants).

Safety: number of relevant systemic adverse events (secondary outcome)

There was one case of fever in each group and the trial authors stated, "This event did not suggest a relationship with treatment regimes". No other systemic adverse events were reported over the six‐week trial period.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^116a2u2o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1–16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' Conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^115UxMcC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How often to apply topical corticosteroid?

See: Table 5; Table 6; and Table 7.

Applying topical corticosteroid twice daily probably does not increase the proportion of participants (adults and children) who achieve clinician‐reported treatment success for treating a flare (1 to 4 weeks) compared to once daily application (moderate‐certainty evidence). This still applied when restricting to trials where the same topical corticosteroid was used in both arms; however, most of those trials were in participants with moderate to severe eczema, using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid. It also applied in the trials that spanned more than one strategy, comparing higher‐potency, often newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroid applied once a day with lower‐potency topical corticosteroid applied more frequently.

The evidence suggests that frequency of application results in little to no difference between strategies in the risk of developing skin thinning (low‐certainty evidence). The number of reported cases was low, and more than three‐quarters of cases were seen in participants using very potent topical corticosteroid. The evidence addressing whether using topical corticosteroids more than once daily affects cortisol levels is very uncertain and there were no data on clinically relevant effects.

No trials looked at longer‐ versus shorter‐term duration of treatment for induction of remission from a flare.

Weekend, or 'proactive' therapy, in which topical corticosteroids are applied twice a week for two consecutive days in between flares, aims to prevent rather than treat eczema flares. Weekend therapy likely results in a large decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a new flare compared to no topical corticosteroid application, with moderate‐certainty evidence. This effect was seen in children and adults and across all eczema severities, although most evidence was in moderate to severe eczema. With regard to safety, no cases of skin thinning, or new cases of abnormal cortisol levels were reported (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence), but there were no data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression or impact on growth. The trials of weekend therapy were significantly longer in duration (16 weeks to 12 months) than trials identified for other strategies, primarily because of the need to detect the number of new flares rather than treating the existing flare. Whilst these trials may be better designed to detect adverse events that take longer to manifest, such as skin thinning, it should be noted that the data are not necessarily comparable with the other strategy comparisons as the topical corticosteroid use was intermittent (two days per week) rather than daily as is normal for treating a flare.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^1123HyEP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Trials using the following comparators: different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments, placebo/vehicle/emollient, or no treatment were included. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. The primary focus of this review was the NMA since Cochrane Reviews and other systematic reviews are already available for direct comparisons of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments versus placebo or no treatment. Trials where the comparator was the same topical treatment but with a different method of application were excluded, as this has been evaluated for TCS in a separate Cochrane Review (Lax 2022). In the NMA, a single control node of 'placebo/vehicle/emollient' was used. 'No treatment' will be included as a separate node, but where trials using 'no treatment' allow emollient in both arms of the trial, the control group was included in the 'placebo/vehicle/emollient' node.

Classifications of potencies of TCS vary between different countries. To standardise potency classifications of TCS in our study, a classification we established as part of a separate Cochrane Review (Lax 2022) was used (mild, moderate, potent, or very potent ‐ see Table 11). In brief, we prioritised the potency classification used in the BNF, followed by the WHO Classification 2018; and, if neither source assigned a potency, relevant guidelines, advice from clinicians in the relevant country, and available trial documents were considered. For TCI, different nodes were assigned for different potencies of tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. For other drug classes, a similar approach was taken, unless the potency classification of different concentrations of the same pharmacological agent was not known to differ. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken where an alternative TCS potency classification was used, and where we used a more pooled approach to potency classification.

### Patients' perspectives on quality of care for chronic hand eczema: a qualitative study [^116xVfhh]. Contact Dermatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

3.5 Treatment and follow‐up

3.5.1 Treatment

Participants mentioned experiencing treatment of their CHE as a search for the most beneficial treatment. Some participants had a clear idea of how continuation of the treatment would be, but others indicated having uncertainties about follow‐up. Experiences with topical corticosteroids (TCS) varied. One participant mentioned being afraid of the amount of steroids entering the body when using TCS. A few participants said they did not use the TCS in a standard step‐down approach but used their own experience as to when and how to apply them. Another mentioned the added value of clear guidance by the doctor regarding reduction of TCS application towards a maintenance schedule.

On systemic treatment, a few participants found it a disadvantage that medication at some point had to be reduced, resulting in a flare‐up of the CHE. A few participants mentioned that it was not always clear to them how choices were made regarding various systemic treatments for their CHE and which considerations were taken into account. One participant indicated that, before making a choice, he would have liked a transparent explanation of the likelihood of a treatment's effectiveness.

3.5.2 Access to care when needed

Most participants found it important that the clinic was easy to contact in the event of flare‐ups, side‐effects, or questions. Participants expressed having contacted the clinic by phone or by using the online App. In their experience, an extra appointment could be quickly arranged in the event of a flare‐up.

3.5.3 Continuity of care

Several times participants expressed the need for a primary contact person. Some indicated a need for easy access to a professional when experiencing psychological problems; others mentioned the need to be able to talk about the impact of a treatment and to receive information and advice regarding questions. Two participants mentioned that a primary contact person would be particularly valuable when many physicians were involved. One participant suggested that the specialized nurse could act as a primary contact person to provide more continuity in care.

### Do people with eczema and their carers understand topical steroid potency? Results of two surveys [^111izKw9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are classified into four potencies: mild, moderate, potent and very potent. Confusion arises from the wide range of products available, none of which have the potency level printed on the tubes or packaging. An online survey of patients and carers of people with eczema showed that only 17% of 984 respondents knew how many potencies there are. In a second survey, 315 respondents provided 1520 assignments of the potency of commonly used TCSs: 55.5% were correct, 21% were underestimates and 23.5% overestimates. Some errors were extreme: 12 (8%) of those using a very potent TCS considered it mild while 9 (27%) using a mild TCS considered it potent or very potent. Other themes expressed in free-text comments included inadequate and conflicting advice about using TCSs and lack of warnings about long-term adverse effects, particularly topical steroid withdrawal. Ninety-five per cent of respondents wanted TCSs to be clearly labelled with potency.

### A new avenue for treatment of chronic hand eczema [^115qACKv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hand eczema (HE) is a prevalent disease with a lifetime prevalence of up to 15%. It strongly impacts patients' quality of life, especially in patients with chronic HE (CHE). According to recently published guidelines for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of HE, topical corticosteroids are recommended as a short‐term treatment for HE, as potent corticosteroids may cause skin atrophy and interfere with recovery in the long term. The topical calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus, is also suggested for short‐term treatment in patients with HE. In daily practice, it is used in patients refractory to topical corticosteroids, when fear of side‐effects exists or in patients with CHE. For severe CHE, alitretinoin is the only registered systemic drug in some countries. Consequently, there is a significant unmet need for effective and safe topical treatments for long‐term control of CHE.

In this issue of the BJD, Worm and colleagues report the promising results of a 16‐week double‐blind, randomized phase IIb trial in which they explore the dose response, efficacy and safety of the topical pan‐Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor delgocitinib for CHE. Adults with mild‐to‐severe CHE were treated with delgocitinib cream 1, 3, 8 or 20 mg g⁻¹, or cream vehicle twice daily for 16 weeks. Delgocitinib 8 mg g⁻¹ and 20 mg g⁻¹ showed a statistically significant treatment effect against vehicle; treatment success was achieved in 37% and 38% of patients, respectively. The treatment effect had not reached a plateau at week 16, suggesting that more prolonged treatment could show additional benefits. Delgocitinib was well tolerated without raising any safety concerns.

### The management of chronic hand eczema: a retrospective patient record review [^115B2j6P]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic Hand Eczema (CHE) is a heterogeneous fluctuating inflammatory disease that represents a significant burden. Effective treatment options for moderate to severe CHE are limited.

Objectives

To assess how patients with moderate to severe CHE are treated in clinical practice.

Methods

A retrospective, physician-led patient record review assessed the demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics of patients aged ≥ 18years with CHE across seven countries. Each participating physician was requested to review records for their three most recent patients with moderate to severe CHE treated with a topical or systemic therapy.

Results

A total of 264 physicians, of whom 88.6% were dermatologists and 70.1% were predominantly or partly hospital-based, reviewed the records of 792 patients. Signs were present on hands only in 56.4% of patients and the mean time on current treatment was 16.7months. Overall, 62.9% of patients received systemic therapy and almost one-quarter (23.4%) were treated with a biologic; 28.6% of patients were only treated with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors.

Conclusion

In patients with moderate to severe CHE, most received systemic therapy with one-quarter on biologic therapy. However, given that many of these treatments have limited evidence of efficacy in CHE, there is a need for studies specifically in patients with CHE as well as new therapeutic options.
