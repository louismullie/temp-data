## Question

How to approach a patient with seizure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach a patient with a seizure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and safety. Then, I should verify the history and classify the event. Next, I will review the focused examination and targeted diagnostics. After that, I need to determine disposition and whether to start antiseizure medication. Finally, I will consider special populations, counseling, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first few minutes: airway, breathing, circulation, and stopping the seizure if ongoing, because prolonged convulsions can cause hypoxia, aspiration, and neuronal injury. I should double-check that first-line therapy for convulsive status epilepticus is a benzodiazepine, with lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or diazepam 0.2 mg/kg IV as accepted options, and if IV access is delayed, IM midazolam 10 mg is reasonable, noting that early, aggressive treatment improves outcomes and that status epilepticus is a time-critical emergency [^1136vPwA] [^1133opk9] [^116XrDxK].

> Wait, let me verify the operational definition of status epilepticus. Traditionally defined as 30 minutes of continuous seizures or recurrent seizures without recovery, many modern protocols treat at 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity because the risk of neuronal injury and refractoriness rises with delay; I should act at 5 minutes rather than waiting for 30 minutes, and I need to ensure continuous monitoring and prepare for second-line agents if benzodiazepines fail [^113vH1Jf] [^1136vPwA].

> Next, I should review the history with a structured approach, ideally with a witness, to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic events and to identify provoking factors. I need to check for prodrome, aura, ictal semiology, postictal confusion, incontinence, tongue biting, and focal deficits, and I should ask about prior similar events, sleep deprivation, alcohol or drug use, medication changes, head trauma, stroke, tumor, infection, and family history, because these elements shape both diagnosis and recurrence risk [^113S44p1] [^114kgphu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I should classify the event as provoked versus unprovoked, and if unprovoked, consider whether this represents a first seizure or new-onset epilepsy. I need to remember that multiple discrete seizures within 24 hours are still considered a single event for prognostic purposes, and I should confirm that the ILAE allows a diagnosis of epilepsy after a first seizure if the probability of recurrence exceeds 60%, which is uncommon but relevant in select cases with strong risk markers [^114ULmiB] [^115EvC5t].

> I will now examine the patient with a focused neurologic exam, looking for focal deficits, signs of head trauma, papilledema, or meningismus, and I should reassess mental status over time. If the patient remains altered or has a persistent focal deficit, I need to escalate imaging and consider admission, whereas a normal exam after a brief postictal period supports outpatient management in carefully selected patients [^113xbu8T].

> Let me think about diagnostics next. For a first unprovoked seizure with return to baseline, I should confirm that routine labs have low yield and that most patients need only glucose, sodium, and a pregnancy test when applicable. I should avoid broad panels unless the history or exam suggests otherwise, and I must remember that alcohol withdrawal seizures are a diagnosis of exclusion after evaluating for other causes [^114xgy8u] [^1118o3e1].

> I should double-check imaging strategy. In the acute setting, noncontrast head CT is appropriate to exclude hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute stroke, with MRI preferred when feasible for superior sensitivity to cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, and subtle tumors. ACR supports CT first in emergent settings and MRI as initial imaging in nonemergent evaluations, and I need to ensure imaging is prioritized for patients older than 40, those with focal deficits, partial-onset seizures, immunocompromise, or trauma [^113CL9ac] [^115qWu4D] [^1137Mk6T].

> But wait, what if the patient is still seizing or is in nonconvulsive status? I should consider emergent EEG when there is concern for ongoing seizure activity, subtle convulsions, or when paralytics obscure the exam, because nonconvulsive status epilepticus is common in critically ill patients and requires continuous EEG monitoring and escalation of therapy [^112Nj4jn] [^1136vPwA].

> Now, disposition. I need to ensure that patients with a first unprovoked seizure who have returned to baseline, have a normal exam, no concerning comorbidities, and reliable follow-up can be discharged safely with outpatient neurology referral. ACEP advises against routine admission in this scenario, and AAFP similarly supports discharge when stable and without a clear provoking factor, though I should arrange close follow-up given early recurrence risk [^115AmM2J] [^117Pvbhb].

> Hold on, I should verify medication decisions. For a first provoked seizure, I must treat the precipitant and avoid starting an antiseizure medication in the ED. For a first unprovoked seizure without high-risk features, deferring AEDs is reasonable because immediate treatment reduces recurrence in the first 1–2 years but does not improve long-term remission or quality of life, and adverse effects are common. I should discuss risks, benefits, and patient preferences, and consider starting AEDs if there is a remote brain insult, abnormal EEG, abnormal MRI, or nocturnal seizure, where the recurrence risk exceeds 60% and the number needed to treat is lower [^112ScJ54] [^115hduCU] [^114bo3gV].

> I need to ensure I counsel on recurrence risk and safety. Patients should know that recurrence risk is 21–45% within 2 years, highest early, and that driving restrictions and other safety measures apply. I should confirm local driving laws and document counseling, because misinformation is common and only about one fifth of patients receive correct driving advice after a first seizure [^115hduCU] [^117L6pSv].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pregnancy, I must check for eclampsia and consider magnesium sulfate if preeclampsia with severe features is suspected. In children, most febrile seizures are benign and require minimal testing, though I should exclude meningitis when indicated and use MRI rather than CT when imaging is needed. In older adults, I should have a lower threshold for imaging and admission given higher risks of structural lesions and complications [^116GJABq] [^1137Mk6T].

> Let me reconsider the follow-up plan. All patients with a first unprovoked seizure should have outpatient EEG and epilepsy-protocol MRI arranged within 1–2 weeks when feasible, with urgent imaging if red flags are present. I should coordinate with neurology and provide rescue medication education if appropriate, and I need to ensure the patient understands warning signs and when to return to the ED [^113S44p1] [^115ErQQa].

> Finally, I should double-check that my documentation captures the history, exam, diagnostics, counseling, and disposition rationale, and that I have addressed patient-specific risk factors and preferences. This structured approach reduces missed diagnoses, prevents unnecessary testing, and aligns with contemporary emergency medicine and neurology guidance for first seizures [^113S44p1] [^115hduCU].

Approach a patient with a seizure by **securing the airway, protecting the head, and turning the patient on their side** to prevent aspiration and injury [^117NJzmV]. Time the seizure, and if it lasts > 5 minutes or recurs without recovery, treat as status epilepticus with **benzodiazepines** (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or diazepam 0.2 mg/kg IV/rectal) [^1136vPwA] [^1133opk9]. Obtain a focused history, perform a neurologic exam, and check glucose, electrolytes, and a pregnancy test when indicated [^114xgy8u]. For a first unprovoked seizure, obtain brain MRI and EEG; **do not start antiseizure medication unless high-risk features are present** (prior brain injury, abnormal MRI/EEG, nocturnal seizure) [^115hduCU] [^113S44p1]. Discharge stable patients with clear return precautions and neurology follow-up; admit if abnormal exam, persistent altered mental status, or high-risk features [^115AmM2J] [^117Pvbhb].

---

## Immediate stabilization and safety measures

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency; turn the patient on their side to prevent aspiration [^117NJzmV]; provide supplemental oxygen if needed.

- **Protection**: Cushion the head, clear the area of hazards, and do not restrain movements [^117NJzmV].

- **Timing**: Note seizure duration; if ≥ 5 minutes or recurrent without recovery, treat as status epilepticus [^1136vPwA].

---

## Pharmacological management of acute seizures

- **First-line therapy**: Benzodiazepines are first-line for acute seizures and status epilepticus [^116XrDxK].

| **Medication** | **Dose** | **Route** |
|-|-|-|
| Lorazepam | 0.1 mg/kg (max 4 mg) | IV |
| Diazepam | 0.2 mg/kg (max 10 mg) | IV or rectal |
| Midazolam | 10 mg | IM or buccal |

- **Second-line therapy**: If seizures persist after benzodiazepines, administer phenytoin, fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam [^notfound].

- **Refractory status epilepticus**: Consider continuous infusions (propofol, midazolam, barbiturates) and ICU admission with EEG monitoring [^1136vPwA].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### History and physical examination

Obtain a detailed history, including **onset, duration, aura, triggers, medication use, alcohol/drug use, and family history** [^113S44p1]. Perform a focused neurologic exam to assess for focal deficits and postictal findings [^114kgphu].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Routine labs**: Glucose, electrolytes (Na, K, Ca, Mg), renal and hepatic function tests [^114xgy8u].

- **Pregnancy test**: For women of childbearing age [^114xgy8u].

- **Toxicology screen**: If substance use is suspected [^113J8fXZ].

---

### Neuroimaging

Obtain a **non-contrast head CT** emergently for first seizure, focal deficits, trauma, immunocompromise, or persistent altered mental status [^1177aiHs]. Use **brain MRI** for non-emergent evaluation of new-onset seizures or when CT is negative but suspicion remains [^115qWu4D].

---

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

Obtain an **EEG** to classify seizure type, assess recurrence risk, and guide therapy [^113S44p1].

---

## Determining the need for antiseizure medication (ASM)

- **First seizure**: Generally do not start ASM unless high-risk features are present (prior brain injury, abnormal MRI/EEG, nocturnal seizure) [^115hduCU] [^112ScJ54].

- **Recurrent seizures**: Start ASM after the second unprovoked seizure or if the first seizure has high-risk features [^115ei19p] [^115bB59g].

- **Patient preference**: Consider patient values, occupation, and lifestyle [^117L6pSv].

---

## Disposition and follow-up care

Discharge patients who are **stable, have returned to baseline, and have reliable follow-up**, with driving restrictions and safety counseling [^115AmM2J] [^115NuwvD]. Admit patients with abnormal exams, persistent altered mental status, status epilepticus, or high-risk features [^notfound]. Arrange neurology follow-up, EEG, and MRI as indicated [^113S44p1].

---

## Patient education and counseling

- **Seizure first aid**: Teach caregivers to time seizures, protect the patient, and call emergency services if seizures last > 5 minutes or recur [^117NJzmV].

- **Driving restrictions**: Inform patients of legal restrictions and document counseling [^117L6pSv].

- **Medication adherence**: Emphasize adherence and discuss side effects [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Febrile seizures are common and usually benign; avoid routine imaging or labs unless indicated [^1175RimA].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of structural lesions; consider early imaging and admission [^notfound].

- **Pregnant patients**: Consider eclampsia and magnesium sulfate therapy [^notfound].

---

A structured approach to seizure care — stabilize, diagnose, treat, and counsel — ensures **safe, evidence-based management** and reduces recurrence and complications.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2004 policy on critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with seizures in the emergency department. A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) In patients with a first generalized convulsive seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status, should antiepileptic therapy be initiated in the emergency department to prevent additional seizures? (2) In patients with a first unprovoked seizure who have returned to their baseline clinical status in the emergency department, should the patient be admitted to the hospital to prevent adverse events? (3) In patients with a known seizure disorder in which resuming their antiepileptic medication in the emergency department is deemed appropriate, does the route of administration impact recurrence of seizures? (4) In emergency department patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus who continue to have seizures despite receiving optimal dosing of a benzodiazepine, which agent or agents should be administered next to terminate seizures? A literature search was performed, the evidence was graded, and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^111MHDUu]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Emergency department seizure presentations — epidemiology and clinician responsibilities include that up to 28% of all epilepsy patients require treatment in emergency departments (EDs) annually, patients with seizures or presenting complaints related to seizures represent approximately 1% to 2% of all ED visits in the United States, an estimated 2% to 5% of the population will have at least 1 nonfebrile seizure during their lifetime, and another 150,000 patients are diagnosed with a seizure each year, most often in the ED. A seizure can be the result of an acute process referred to as an "acute symptomatic seizure", or it can result from a past intracranial insult referred to as a "remote symptomatic seizure", and emergency physician responsibilities include providing stabilization and interventions to stop the seizure, preventing seizure-related complications, identifying life-threatening processes, determining an appropriate and timely disposition, and minimizing seizure-related morbidity and mortality.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^115ei19p]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical context — when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an antiepileptic drug (AED) should be initiated because the risk of additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases, whereas immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.

### First seizure presentations in adults: beyond assessment and treatment [^11626N2z]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Almost 10% of people will experience at least one seizure over a lifetime. Although common, first seizures are serious events and warrant careful assessment and management. First seizures may be provoked by acute or remote symptomatic factors including life-threatening metabolic derangements, drug toxicity or structural brain lesions. An unprovoked first seizure may herald the onset of epilepsy and may be accompanied by medical and psychiatric illnesses. Accidents, injuries and death associated with first seizures are likely under-reported. The cognitive and emotional impact of first seizures is often neglected. Evaluation of a patient presenting with a first seizure requires careful history-taking and early specialist assessment, however optimal management strategies have not been extensively investigated. Further, advances in technology and the role of eHealth interventions such as telemedicine may be of value in the care of patients who have experienced a first seizure. This article reviews the impact and implications of first seizures beyond the scope provided in current guidelines which tend to focus on assessment and management. It examines the effect of first seizures on the well-being of patients; assesses morbidity and premature mortality in first seizures and discusses current and future directions to optimise safety and health of people with first seizures, with a focus on adult patients. Recognition of these issues is essential to provide adequate care for people with first seizures.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^114bo3gV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Seizure recurrence risk and early treatment effects after a first unprovoked seizure are summarized as follows: "Approximately one third to one half of patients with a first unprovoked seizure will have a recurrent seizure within 5 years". For a single unprovoked seizure, "initiation of treatment within days to weeks after a seizure prolongs time to a subsequent event, but outcomes at 5 years are no different". For a first unprovoked generalized seizure, "it would be necessary to treat 14 patients to prevent a single seizure recurrence within the first 2 years". With "2 or 3 recurrent unprovoked seizures", the 5‑year recurrence risk increases "from about one third to about three quarters of patients", and for those with preexisting brain disease or injury and an abnormal EEG, "the NNT to prevent a single additional seizure in the following first year is approximately 5". Consequently, "for the patient with a first unprovoked seizure, the strategy of waiting until a second seizure before initiating antiepileptic medication is considered appropriate".

### Neurologic group develops recommendations for… [^111HnWxE]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

General treatment principles include initiation of therapy with one drug and the use of patient-specific factors to guide therapy. The expected duration of therapy depends on the epilepsy syndrome, the child's response to therapy and the child's age at the time of onset of seizures. In the section on epilepsy in children and adolescents, the recommendations describe the management approach for different types of seizure disorders in this group. Idiopathic Benign Partial Seizures. The recommendations state that the symptoms should guide the selection of treatment and, in some children, drug therapy may not be necessary. If drug therapy is required, drug selection can be based on the safety and side effect profile. The recommendations state that almost all antiepileptic drugs effectively control partial seizures. The recommendations note that carbamazepine is one drug of choice for this type of seizure disorder.

The newer antiepileptic agent gabapentin may also be another drug of choice because of its safety and low side effect profile. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line therapy. Clinical evaluation is recommended in children who have simple febrile seizures, but treatment is not usually required. The recommendations note that a diagnostic evaluation is indicated if complex febrile seizures have occurred. Status Epilepticus. According to the recommendations, the risk of seizure recurrence is increased in children who initially present with seizures in the form of status epilepticus. The findings on the clinical evaluation dictate whether long-term therapy is required. Epilepsy in Adults The recommendations state that a thorough, detailed history and an electroencephalogram are the two most important aspects in the evaluation of an adult who presents with the onset of seizures.

High-resolution MRI is recommended; the report states that computed tomography, which may have been performed during emergency evaluation of an adult presenting with a seizure, is not a substitute for an MRI of the brain. With respect to partial seizures, the recommendations note that phenytoin and carbamazepine are considered first-line agents. Managing Poor Response. If the initial drug fails to control seizures, that agent should be discontinued and another antiepileptic agent tried. According to the recommendations, the patient should be reevaluated if monotherapy with two different agents fails to control the seizures. High-resolution MRI should be performed and electroencephalograms obtained again to exclude the development of a new disorder. The report states that no clear recommendations can be made about the use of multidrug therapy in general or about which combinations of drugs might be helpful.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European audit of seizure management in hospitals [^115ErQQa]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Specialist services can provide a firm diagnosis, access to investigations and a management plan that needs to include the use of rescue therapy, as well as what is expected of ambulances and EDs for that individual. Given the EuroNASH findings, it is suggested that first and foremost there must be a reliable referral service to specialist advice. This should apply to those with a first suspected seizure as well as those with known epilepsy. Guidance is also needed on the management and use of investigations for those presenting to the ED with seizures.

A five‐step approach is suggested.
Create and agree on guidance on the management and use of investigations for those presenting to EDs due to a seizure. This is a multidisciplinary issue that must include collaboration amongst relevant clinical disciplines, managers and patients or representatives. This process should also identify metrics and quality standards against which performance can be assessed.
Create and agree on a guidance document for all hospitals to make specialist referral the norm, using the same multidisciplinary approach as above.
Create a process by which referral can be achieved that is easy to do and can be incorporated into the workings of local hospitals with minimal effort. Patient issues such as transport must also be considered. Better use of information technology could be a means to achieve this.
Ensure that the epilepsy clinic service is able to receive these referrals and see the patients within a short time period. In many countries this may have staffing implications. Patients who have had an acute and worrying episode should not have long waits to be seen.
Develop and implement a simple system to allow continuous monitoring of key indices of epilepsy care, building on our experience with EuroNASH.

Whilst this is easy to state, however, it is much harder to achieve. Change will require leadership, multidisciplinary collaboration, education, systems change, new processes and new ways of working. However, the challenge must be faced if the difference that is so sorely needed is to be made.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^1137Mk6T]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Emergency Physicians/American Academy of Neurology/American Association of Neurological Surgeons/American Society of Neuroradiology guideline — head CT use after seizure: The guideline categorizes CT into emergent, urgent, and routine, with urgent scans either in the emergency department (ED) or scheduled as part of ED disposition; recommendations were based on no class I articles, 18 class II, and 33 class III. It states CT should be considered in patients > 40 y or with partial-onset seizure, and urgent considered in patients who have completely recovered from their seizure when no clear-cut cause has been identified. No outcome data support the recommendations.

### Implementing clinical practice guidelines: considerations for epileptologists [^111dvN19]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 5000 articles related to "epilepsy" are indexed annually on PubMed. Clinicians cannot read every potentially relevant article to maintain familiarity with all epilepsy research; various tools (including Epilepsy Currents) assist epileptologists in maintaining a high practice standard. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are a systematic translation of research findings into clinical practice and are thus an important way to ensure that the benefit of advances in healthcare reaches individual patients. Knowledge translation also helps reduce the risk of iatrogenic harm and limits unnecessary costs to healthcare systems. Guidelines can reduce practice variation — discrepancies in clinical decision-making within and between providers for comparable patient scenarios. By reducing practice variation, guidelines can support the equitable delivery of high-quality care while improving costs of care overall. Yet, for epilepsy and other complex, highly individual chronic medical conditions, clinicians must consider guideline use in the full context of care. This review will highlight particular considerations for epileptologists in terms of guideline applicability, addressing disparities, use in the United States versus internationally, and changing clinical practice.

Clinical Practice Guidelines: Primary Versus Specialty Care

In primary care, CPGs shape annual wellness visits with recommended preventative screenings and immunizations. One barrier to the effective implementation of guidelines in epilepsy is a perception of a lack of applicability to subspecialty care. Although guidelines may be used differently by specialists and subspecialists compared to general practitioners, guidelines have important implications for all clinicians.

Distinctions in Guideline Use Patterns Across Specialties

Generalists typically face initial management decisions. By definition, these decisions address common scenarios in clinical practice. For example, about 10% of the population experiences a single seizure, and about a third of these go on to develop epilepsy. Most new-onset epilepsy is initially managed by primary care doctors, who will rely on first-seizure guidelines, and new-onset epilepsy guidelines.

Approximately a third of people with epilepsy will develop intractable disease; these patients typically make up the largest patient subgroup in a subspecialist clinic. While there are established guidelines describing medical management of treatment-resistant epilepsy, these guidelines are almost always, by nature of their rigorous development process, 1 step behind the most recent literature on several of the newest antiseizure medications. Thus clinicians, in particular subspecialists, are often faced with scenarios that go beyond the commonplace majority; eg individuals who have tried all the established antiseizure medications and for whom novel therapies, that may not be addressed in the current clinical guidelines, should be considered.

Unprovoked first seizure — recommendations indicate that adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrence is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21%–45%) (Level A). Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma (Level A), an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities (Level B), an abnormal neuroimaging study (Level B), and a nocturnal seizure (Level B). Clinicians should advise patients that, although immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment is likely to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure (Level B), it may not improve quality of life (Level C), and over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission (Level B); patients should be advised that their risk for AED adverse events ranges from 7% to 31% (Level B) and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible.

### The emergency department evaluation of the adult patient who presents with a first-time seizure [^113xbu8T]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 5% of the population will experience at least 1 nonfebrile seizure at some point during their lifetime. The management of a patient who has had a first-time seizure is driven by the history and physical examination. In almost one-half of these patients, the cause of their seizure is not identified. In general, patients with comorbidities, a focal neurologic examination, or who have not returned to a normal baseline mental status require an extensive diagnostic evaluation including a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Adults with a first-time seizure, with no comorbidities, and who have returned to a normal baseline require only serum glucose and electrolyte determination. Women of reproductive age also require a pregnancy test. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal laboratory results, and no signs of structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Initiation of antiepileptic therapy depends on the assessed risk for recurrence, in conjunction with a neurologist consultation.

### Seizure versus syncope [^114SshaN]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

One of the most common but difficult management problems in medicine is that of patients who present with a paroxysmal loss of consciousness. All too often the underlying diagnosis remains elusive. This has a cost both in terms of mortality and ongoing morbidity and in terms of the financial burden associated with hospitalisation and repeated investigations. We describe a practical approach to this clinical dilemma, which is rooted in adherence to basic principles of history taking and examination, formulation of a reasonable differential diagnosis, followed by an intelligent use of specific investigations and selection of an appropriate treatment. We also discuss the effect of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and sudden cardiac death. Despite a careful and thorough approach to the patient with a "seizure versus syncope" problem, many will require repeated assessment before a diagnosis is made.

### Diagnostic difficulty in infants and children [^111JJGhg]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Making an accurate diagnosis is the first and most critical step in the treatment of pediatric epilepsy, but it can be a daunting challenge for clinicians. Seizure types and syndromes in infants and very young children do not present with the same clarity and consistency as in adults. Work is currently being done to revise traditional International League Against Epilepsy classifications to make it easier for physicians to accurately diagnose and effectively treat epilepsy in infants and young children. A simplified approach can be formed by combining some of the International League Against Epilepsy recommendations with new findings on the clinical manifestations of pediatric seizures. Refinements in the new system will occur as knowledge of the pathophysiology of epilepsy and genetic susceptibilities expands, but even in its early stages the new classification system has much to offer, resulting in improved patient care and more effective management of the disease.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^111VnsPN]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations for treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure.

Methods

We defined relevant questions and systematically reviewed published studies according to the American Academy of Neurology's classification of evidence criteria; we based recommendations on evidence level.

Results and Recommendations

Adults with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that their seizure recurrence risk is greatest early within the first 2 years (21%-45%) (Level A), and clinical variables associated with increased risk may include a prior brain insult (Level A), an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities (Level A), a significant brain-imaging abnormality (Level B), and a nocturnal seizure (Level B). Immediate antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce recurrence risk within the first 2 years (Level B) but may not improve quality of life (Level C). Over a longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unlikely to improve prognosis as measured by sustained seizure remission (Level B). Patients should be advised that risk of AED adverse events (AEs) may range from 7% to 31% (Level B) and that these AEs are likely predominantly mild and reversible. Clinicians' recommendations whether to initiate immediate AED treatment after a first seizure should be based on individualized assessments that weigh the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, consider educated patient preferences, and advise that immediate treatment will not improve the long-term prognosis for seizure remission but will reduce seizure risk over the subsequent 2 years.

### Emergency neurological life support: status epilepticus [^1136vPwA]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with prolonged or rapidly recurring convulsions lasting more than 5 min are in status epilepticus (SE) and require immediate resuscitation. Although there are relatively few randomized clinical trials, available evidence and experience suggest that early and aggressive treatment of SE improves patient outcomes, for which reason this was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol. The current approach to the emergency treatment of SE emphasizes rapid initiation of adequate doses of first-line therapy, as well as accelerated second-line anticonvulsant drugs and induced coma when these fail, coupled with admission to a unit capable of neurological critical care and electroencephalography monitoring. This protocol will focus on the initial treatment of SE but also review subsequent steps in the protocol once the patient is hospitalized.

### An evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of a child after a seizure [^111vd7Ja]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

An evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital having had a seizure. It does not deal with the child who is still seizing. The guideline is intended for use by junior doctors, and was developed for this common problem (5% of all paediatric medical attenders) where variation in practice occurs.

Options

Assessment, investigations (biochemistry, lumbar puncture, serum anticonvulsant levels, EEG in particular), and/or admission are examined.

Outcomes

The guideline aims to direct junior doctors in recognising those children who are at higher risk of serious intracranial pathology including infection, and conversely to recognise those children at low risk who are safe to go home.

Evidence

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Articles were identified using the electronic data bases Medline (from 1966 to June 1998), Embase (from 1980 to June 1998) and Cochrane (to June 1998), and selected if they investigated the specified clinical question. Personal reviews were excluded. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements of recommendation were made.

Consensus

An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus development was used. A national panel of 30 medical and nursing staff regularly caring for these children were asked to grade their agreement with the statements generated. They were sent the relevant original publications, the appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked whether they wished to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panellists' responses. Consensus was defined as 83% of panellists agreeing with the statement. Recommendations in brief: For afebrile seizures all children should have their blood pressure recorded, but no other investigations are routine although a seizing or somnolent child should have blood glucose measured; all children under 1 year should be admitted. For seizures with fever, clinical signs indicating the need to treat as meningitis are given. Children should be admitted if they are under 18 months old, have had a complex seizure, or after pretreatment with antibiotics.

Validation

The guideline has undergone implementation and evaluation in a paediatric accident and emergency department, the results of which will be published separately. Only one alteration was made to the guideline as a result of this validation process, which is included here.

### Epilepsy: a clinical overview [^1125N4vu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of seizures and epilepsy is a common task of the physician. Approximately 1 in 10 people will have a seizure during their lifetime. Epilepsy is the tendency to have unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder and affects 1 in 26 people in the United States and 65 million people worldwide. Evaluation of a patient presenting with a seizure involves excluding an underlying neurologic or medical condition, classifying the seizure type and determining if the patient has epilepsy. Proper treatment requires accurate diagnosis of the epilepsy type and syndrome and use of a medication that is effective and without adverse effects. Most patients can achieve complete seizure control with medication, but if medication is unsuccessful, surgical treatment can be an option. Special situations in the care of people with epilepsy include status epilepticus, women with epilepsy, the older adult, and safety issues.

### Status epilepticus: what's new? [^116Wvszw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The emergent evaluation and treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus presents challenges for emergency physicians. This disease is one of the few in which minutes can mean the difference between life and significant morbidity and mortality. It is imperative to use parallel processing and have multiple treatment options planned in advance, in case the current treatment is not successful. There is also benefit to exploring, or initiating, treatment algorithms to standardize the care for these critically ill patients.

### Poststroke seizure: optimising its management [^1153xbeY]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the symptomatic treatment of PSS, once a diagnosis of PSS is established, as a practical matter, the next important step is to decide whether immediate AED treatment should be initiated. It has been proposed, and is now a generally accepted principle, that when a patient presents with a second or more unprovoked recurrent seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk for yet additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years). So by the definition, the PSE should always be treated with an AED. It also has been generally accepted that if a patient presenting with the first unprovoked seizure shows no significant high risk (≥ 60%) for recurrent seizures, the AED treatment should be deferred until the recurrent seizure occurs. But for PSS, this concept cannot be applied because stroke produces a structural lesion, and the risk of recurrent seizures varies among different studies; therefore, immediate AED treatment is still under debate and depends on several clinical situations.

Seizures are a common presentation in both emergency departments and general pediatric practices. Epilepsy affects more than 3.4 million people nationwide, of which approximately 500,000 are children, with greater than 200,000 first-time seizures each year. 1 Of the affected individuals, as many as 100,000 are estimated to experience status epilepticus (SE). Both general practitioners and neurologists alike must be able to define, recognize and treat seizure emergencies. This review article defines and describes SE, discusses the emergency evaluation and management of SE that is both new-onset and breakthrough in people with epilepsy, reviews the current treatment recommendations for SE in both the home and hospital settings, and introduces special populations that may be at high risk for SE or other seizure emergencies.

### First seizure presentation: do multiple seizures within 24 hours predict recurrence? [^114ULmiB]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

We compared clinical features and prognosis of 72 adults with a first-ever seizure presentation comprising multiple discrete seizures within 24 hours to 425 patients presenting with a single seizure. Those presenting with multiple seizures were no more likely to have seizure recurrence, irrespective of etiology or treatment. Hence, a presentation with multiple seizures within 24 hours should be regarded as a single event, in keeping with the International League Against Epilepsy recommendations.

Pediatric first unprovoked seizure — diagnostic testing guidance includes: LP: Option: In the child with a first nonfebrile seizure, LP is of limited value and should be used primarily when there is concern about possible meningitis or encephalitis. EEG: Standard: The EEG is recommended as part of the neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with an apparent first unprovoked seizure. Neuroimaging studies: Guideline: If a neuroimaging study is obtained, MRI is the preferred modality; Option: Emergent neuroimaging should be performed on a child of any age who exhibits a postictal focal deficit that does not quickly resolve or who has not returned to baseline within several hours after the seizure. Option: Nonurgent imaging studies with MRI should be seriously considered in any child with a significant cognitive or motor impairment of unknown etiology, unexplained abnormalities on neurologic examination, a seizure of partial onset with or without secondary generalization, an EEG that does not represent a benign partial epilepsy of childhood or primary generalized epilepsy.

### Best evidence topic report: is a CT head required for patients who present to the emergency department with a first seizure? [^111Z5mnQ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

A short systematic review was undertaken to assess whether adult patients presenting to the ED with a first seizure require a CT head scan to rule out emergent intracranial pathology. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched. Seven relevant papers were identified. Study information, patient characteristics, key results and methodological weaknesses were tabulated. Our results indicate that adults presenting with a first seizure are a high-yield group for CT with a number needed to scan (NNS) between 10 and 19 for findings that would change management in ED, such as haemorrhage, infarction and tumours. We believe that this NNS is sufficiently low to justify the routine use of neuroimaging for these patients in emergency care.

### Evidence-based guideline: management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^114vjc38]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — risk of recurrence is characterized from pooled prognostic studies showing that generalized tonic–clonic convulsive seizures comprise the major seizure type and that cumulative incidence of recurrence increases over time, with the great majority occurring within the first 1 to 2 years; the greatest risk is in the first year (32% at 1 year), compared with 46% by 5 years. The evidence base included 2 prognostic Class I and 8 prognostic Class II studies. Seizure recurrence was lower for patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in most of these studies, although treatment often was not randomized, and delays in recruitment by weeks or months may lead to patients experiencing a recurrence and becoming ineligible, contributing to variability and underestimation of recurrence risk.

Evidence for the likelihood of imaging changing management is not available. The conclusion states the evidence is inadequate to support or refute the usefulness of emergency CT in persons with chronic seizures, and there is no recommendation regarding an emergency CT in persons with chronic seizures (Level U).

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European audit of seizure management in hospitals [^112uiSKA]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our overarching aim is to provide data that can inform programmes of quality improvement in epilepsy care, leveraging from experience in other clinical disciplines. For example, collecting reliable up‐to‐date data on 'time to needle' in the UK led to the proportion of acute myocardial infarctions receiving thrombolysis within 30 min rising from less than 35% to nearly 80% with substantial benefit in survival outcomes. This improvement was enabled by the Central Cardiac Audit Database led from the Royal College of Physicians, established in 1998 to measure the 'time to needle'. Cardiologists, ambulance teams and patient organizations collaborated to establish a minimum dataset needed to address the question; each hospital entered their own data and had available a comparative report on a daily basis showing performance over time and in comparison to neighbouring sites. In just over 2 years all UK hospitals were participating. Success factors included (i) shared 'buy in' from professionals and patient groups, (ii) the introduction of thrombolysis nurses and (iii) instant feedback in the public domain. That project has continued and successfully expanded to cover other aspects of cardiology. There were similar achievements in stroke care supported by national audit, leading to the creation of stroke units across the country, with benefits in outcomes.

In 2011, these achievements led some of the current investigators to wonder if it would be possible to apply these approaches to epilepsy and the UK NASH was born. A seizure presenting to hospital was the starting point from which to examine care immediately before, during and following the event. Then in 2011 and 2013, NASH had two rounds of audit covering almost 9000 individuals from more than 150 hospitals. Performance of even relatively simple aspects of care varied widely. Some sites performed consistently well, demonstrating that providing care to standards set in national guidelines is possible, but in others even simple tasks such as obtaining a witness history are often not done and routine assessments are inexplicably missing.

A third round of NASH in 2019 showed that across 137 hospitals there had been very little change. This was hugely disappointing and raises many questions about what could be done to stimulate better care. Particular issues are that many patients are not under specialist review and do not get referred for a review after a hospital presentation — and so the opportunity to revise therapy and prevent further episodes is not being offered, and the huge variability across sites observed in 2011 and 2013 continues.

### Closing the diagnostic gap in epilepsy: recognizing more than just motor seizures [^117Er836]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The treatment gap in epilepsy is well recognized. Lack of antiseizure medication treatment leads to increased health care utilization and injuries, and physicians are increasingly aware of the mortality risk in those with uncontrolled seizures. Among patients who receive treatment, clinicians and researchers consistently find that one-third of epilepsy patients have drug resistance. As a result, we have seen an increased drive to aggressively evaluate patients for epilepsy surgery using intracranial EEG, and a rapid rate of novel drug development. But what about the patients who haven't made it to the stage of receiving a proper diagnosis, let alone the right treatment? The recognition of this diagnostic gap has led to the creation of "First Seizure Clinics" aimed at rapid evaluation of patients referred for a first lifetime seizure. About a third of those referred to such clinics had in hindsight a prior history of seizures, which had not yet led to a diagnosis of epilepsy. One study highlighted nonconvulsive initial seizures and socioeconomic disadvantage as factors associated with delays in diagnosis.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic management of a first unprovoked seizure in children and adolescents with a focus on the revised diagnostic criteria for epilepsy [^112mZVWB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

By definition, unprovoked seizures are not precipitated by an identifiable factor, such as fever or trauma. A thorough history and physical examination are essential to caring for pediatric patients with a potential first unprovoked seizure. Differential diagnosis, EEG, neuroimaging, laboratory tests, and initiation of treatment will be reviewed. Treatment is typically initiated after 2 unprovoked seizures, or after 1 seizure in select patients with distinct epilepsy syndromes. Recent expansion of the definition of epilepsy by the ILAE allows for the diagnosis of epilepsy to be made after the first seizure if the clinical presentation and supporting diagnostic studies suggest a greater than 60% chance of a second seizure. This review summarizes the current literature on the diagnostic and therapeutic management of first unprovoked seizure in children and adolescents while taking into consideration the revised diagnostic criteria of epilepsy.

### New-onset seizure in adults and adolescents: a review [^113S44p1]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 8% to 10% of the population will experience a seizure during their lifetime. Only about 2% to 3% of patients go on to develop epilepsy. Understanding the underlying etiology leading to an accurate diagnosis is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment and that patients with low risk for recurrence are not treated unnecessarily.

Observations

Patients can present with new-onset seizure for a variety of reasons such as acute symptomatic seizures due to acute brain injury or metabolic derangements, or unprovoked seizures that are the initial manifestation of epilepsy. A patient history and physical examination may identify features more consistent with an epileptic event and laboratory studies and brain imaging can identify an acute insult contributing to the presentation. Patients diagnosed with first-time unprovoked seizure require electroencephalography and epilepsy protocol-specific magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, which includes thin-cut coronal slices to determine risk of recurrence and the need for long-term treatment. In patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of epilepsy, a carefully selected antiepileptic medication with consideration of comorbidities, adverse effect profile, and type of epilepsy is essential along with appropriate counseling.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 3% of the population will develop epilepsy but 2 to 3 times as many patients will experience a single seizure or seizure-like event. A diagnosis of epilepsy has significant medical, social, and emotional consequences. A careful patient history and physical examination, electroencephalography, and brain imaging are necessary to separate patients with acute symptomatic seizures, single unprovoked seizures, and nonepileptic events from those with new-onset epilepsy.

### Intractable epilepsy: management and therapeutic alternatives [^1137LHwr]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

More than half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve complete seizure control without major side-effects. Patients who continue to have seizures after initial medical therapy should have an early and detailed assessment to confirm the diagnosis, to determine the underlying cause and epilepsy syndrome, and to choose an adequate treatment strategy. The risks and potential benefits of surgical procedures or experimental therapy have to be weighed against the chance of improvement and the potential side-effects of additional medical therapy. Surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common cause of focal epilepsy, can control seizures and improve quality of life in appropriately selected patients. However, around 20–30% of patients do not respond to medical or surgical treatment. The management of chronic intractable epilepsy requires comprehensive care to address the adverse events of medical treatment, quality of life issues, and comorbid disorders. Much research focuses on the experimental treatment options that offer hope of seizure reduction or cure.

### Delay of treatment, after diagnosis, as a contributor to the "Treatment gap" in epilepsy [^114A3wZE]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The "treatment gap" (the difference between people with active epilepsy and people who receive appropriate treatment)in epileptic seizures presents challenges on several levels. Past studies addressing the "treatment gap" have focused on the initial diagnosis of epilepsy. Conceptually, focal seizures can originate from any region of the cortex, and the associated signs and symptoms of seizures are unique to each individual. Therefore, theoretically, the semiology of seizures spans the spectrum of any sensory or motor phenomenon an individual can experience, which is different for each patient. Unsurprisingly, given the complexity of signs and symptoms related to epileptic seizures, there is a lengthy differential diagnosis of patients presenting with the possible diagnosis of epilepsy. These broad categories of differential diagnoses are appropriately called "imitators" of epilepsy. Fortunately, the stereotypical patterns of epileptic seizures within individuals help in establishing a diagnosis. While seizure semiology differs between individuals, within a single individual, seizures tend to be stereotypical, sharing a common, reproducible pattern of signs and symptoms. Diagnosis of epilepsy calls for a detailed history to look for patterns of seizures.

While the presenting signs and symptoms of epileptic seizures are complex and make diagnosing epilepsy challenging, other factors contribute to barriers for epilepsy diagnosis. Past studies document that limited access to health care and lack of public education about epilepsy limits diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, especially in less socioeconomically developed regions. However, past studies also show that delay in epilepsy diagnosis is prominent in areas where there is adequate access to medical care. In a study from Melbourne, Australia, in 220 adults who presented with an epileptic index seizure (the seizure which led the patient to seek medical attention), 41% had prior events. The delay from first event to presentation was > 4 weeks in 36% of patients, > 6 months in 21%, and > 2 years in 14%. Initial seizures associated with a delay in presentation were nondisruptive or nonconvulsive and therefore more subtle in presentation. Relative socioeconomic disadvantage was also associated with delay to presentation. There was a median diagnostic delay of 8.7 months among those with a history of prior events. In a study by Gasparini et al from Italy, there was a similar diagnostic delay of 15.6 months in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed cryptogenic focal epilepsy. The proportion of patients with a diagnostic delay of 4 weeks or more was 81%.

### Improving epilepsy diagnosis across the lifespan: approaches and innovations [^112989hB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Epilepsy diagnosis is often delayed or inaccurate, exposing people to ongoing seizures and their substantial consequences until effective treatment is initiated. Important factors contributing to this problem include delayed recognition of seizure symptoms by patients and eyewitnesses; cultural, geographical, and financial barriers to seeking health care; and missed or delayed diagnosis by health-care providers. Epilepsy diagnosis involves several steps. The first step is recognition of epileptic seizures; next is classification of epilepsy type and whether an epilepsy syndrome is present; finally, the underlying epilepsy-associated comorbidities and potential causes must be identified, which differ across the lifespan. Clinical history, elicited from patients and eyewitnesses, is a fundamental component of the diagnostic pathway. Recent technological advances, including smartphone videography and genetic testing, are increasingly used in routine practice. Innovations in technology, such as artificial intelligence, could provide new possibilities for directly and indirectly detecting epilepsy and might make valuable contributions to diagnostic algorithms in the future.

Evidentiary table — Breen et al. 2005 prospective observational study of adults with new-onset seizure referred to a seizure clinic reported that 232 patients in final analysis were referred to clinic, 124 (53%) via the emergency department (ED); no laboratory test was significantly associated with final diagnosis of seizure. In ED referrals, computed tomography (CT) was abnormal in 1 patient (only 17% of patients received CT, missing data in 19% of these); 19% were admitted to hospital and 3% had injury related to seizure. Follow-up findings included 18% (42 patients) not showing to the seizure clinic and 9% having a seizure before the clinic visit in 6 wk. The final diagnosis was seizure in 52% of patients referred to clinic (other diagnoses — syncope [28%], nonepileptic seizure [2%], hyperventilation [1%], panic attack [1%], arrhythmia [1%]). In clinic, 42 patients (22%) had CT, with abnormal results in 8 patients (19%) and report not available in 8 patients (19%). Overall, 56% of all initial seizures were related to alcohol, recreational drugs, or sleep deprivation. The authors concluded that adults with first-time seizure can be discharged and managed on an outpatient basis unless persistent abnormal neurologic examination results, abnormal investigation results or observations are present; not clear how data support this; recurrence was 9% in 6 wk; no mortality data reported.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^116XrDxK]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epileptic attack and a life-threatening neurological emergency, which is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. The clinical manifestation of convulsive status epilepticus is characterised by a prolonged tonic–clonic seizure or repetitive seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them.

Epidemiological studies have documented a global annual incidence of status epilepticus of 7 to 41 cases per 100,000 population. In Europe, the annual incidence of status epilepticus lies between 10 and 16 per 100,000 population, and convulsive status epilepticus accounts for 45–74% of all cases. Incidence of convulsive status epilepticus tends to be higher in males than females. Mortality of status epilepticus has been reported to range from around 8–33% according to aetiology, with older age being a detrimental factor. A recent meta-analysis of convulsive status epilepticus in high-income countries reported pooled mortality of 15.9% and the authors noted that survival rates have not improved over the last 30 years.

The ultimate goal of treatment is to stop both clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity as soon as possible as convulsive status epilepticus can worsen with delayed or suboptimal treatment. Early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality and with a greater proportion of terminated seizures at arrival at the hospital emergency department.

The first-line treatment of status epilepticus is currently benzodiazepines. The UK NICE Clinical Guidance recommends the use of buccal midazolam in the community setting before arrival at the hospital, or the administration of rectal diazepam if buccal midazolam is not available. The Scottish SIGN guideline and the 2010 European Federation of Neurologists recommend intravenous (IV) administration of lorazepam or diazepam if IV access is already established and resuscitation available. To date, few trials have evaluated treatment options for adults and there is uncertainty about the optimal first-line treatment to control seizures before arrival at the hospital.

Objectives

The objective of this assessment was to synthesise current evidence on first-line pharmacological interventions to control seizures in adults before, or at, arrival at the hospital with the aim to inform clinical practice and future research.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review according to current methodological standards and pre-specified its methods in a research protocol (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020201953). This report adheres to the principles of the PRISMA 2020 statement.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^113vH1Jf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus in adult emergency department (ED) patients — incidence, mortality, definitions, and detection are detailed as follows: Status epilepticus is a life-threatening form of seizure, generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus occurs in 50,000 to 150,000 patients per year in the United States and most commonly occurs at the extremes of age, between 5% to 17% of patients will have a seizure while in the ED and up to 7% of patients in the ED will have status epilepticus, and the reported mortality rate ranges from 5% to 22% and has been reported to be as high as 65% in those patients refractory to first-line therapies. According to the World Health Organization, status epilepticus is "a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is sufficiently prolonged or repeated at sufficiently brief intervals so as to produce an unvarying and enduring epileptic condition", it has traditionally been defined as at least 30 minutes of persistent seizures or recurrent seizures without complete return to full consciousness, some authors have proposed shortening the time criteria from 30 minutes to 5 minutes, and to diagnose nonconvulsive status epilepticus and subtle convulsive status epilepticus emergency physicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion.

Conclusion

Unenhanced CT should be the initial imaging examination performed for adults presenting with first unprovoked seizure in the acute setting to exclude conditions requiring urgent or emergent intervention. MRI has added benefits and should be considered for adults presenting acutely for whom the initial CT is negative and for those presenting with new-onset seizure in the nonacute setting.

### Who is at risk for prolonged seizures? [^113sLPz9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

This article reviews how long seizures last and how frequently seizures are prolonged, risk factors for prolonged seizures, and a conceptual framework that links them. These data are derived from studies of patients with a first unprovoked seizure, studies of children with febrile seizures, studies of population-based and community-based cohorts with newly diagnosed epilepsy and patients with refractory epilepsy, and treatment trials. Prolonged seizures that exceed 5 to 10 minutes are relatively common, and the key factor in the identification of those at risk is a history of a prior prolonged seizure. A subgroup of patients with seizures is predisposed to prolonged although not necessarily frequent seizures, which are associated with increased morbidity, increased emergency department visits, and a decreased quality of life. This article also addresses criteria used to justify treatment of a seizure once it has continued longer than 5 minutes and the rationale for such treatment.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures [^1118o3e1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Adult patients with a first-time seizure who have returned to baseline — laboratory evaluation is primarily guided by history and physical examination, and the literature suggests that laboratory testing is of very low yield in patients with a new-onset seizure who have returned to baseline. The history and physical examination will predict the majority of patients who will have a laboratory abnormality, and patients with altered mental status, fever, or a new local neurologic deficit require more extensive evaluation. Glucose abnormalities and hyponatremia are the most frequent abnormalities identified and are usually predicted by the history and physical examination. In 1 prospective study of 163 patients, 1 unexpected case of hypoglycemia was discovered, and in a prospective study of 136 patients, Turnbull et al found 4 cases of hypoglycemia and 4 cases of hyperglycemia. Two of the cases of hypoglycemia were not suspected on the basis of the history and physical examination. The diagnosis of an alcohol withdrawal seizure should be a diagnosis of exclusion, especially in patients presenting with a first-time seizure.

### Integrating network neuroscience into epilepsy care: progress, barriers, and next steps [^112JWe4a]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recognizing epilepsy as a network disorder has the potential to aid clinical decision making and improve patient quality of life. However, the practical steps required to efficaciously bring epilepsy network neuroscience into the clinic remain unclear. It is encouraging that great progress has been made in identifying and characterizing epileptic networks across various patient subgroups and analysis methodologies. - These findings have implications for medical and surgical management of epilepsy but are typically retrospective and not validated across diverse datasets. Thus, it is time to address the systemic barriers that prevent the advancement of these promising findings and ultimate adoption into clinical care.

This review will begin by briefly outlining promising network neuroscience findings in epilepsy that have the potential to be translated into clinical practice. Specifically, we highlight three critical needs at three stages of clinical care in epilepsy that we believe could be augmented by network analyses: (1) From initial presentation, reduction in the time taken trying different anti-seizure medications (ASMs) to diagnose drug-resistant epilepsy; (2) While evaluating drug-resistant epilepsy patients for advanced diagnosis and surgical treatments, utilization of validated quantitative tools to accurately characterize epileptic networks to minimize misdiagnosis, inform surgical decision-making, and avoid post-surgery deficits, and; (3) During the post-surgical treatment phase, noninvasive monitoring to prognosticate outcomes and inform clinical decision making such as how to alter ASMs post-surgery and when to consider alternative treatments if seizures remain uncontrolled. Fundamental to addressing these critical clinical needs is our ability to accurately identify a patient's epileptic network and track changes in these networks over time.

We will then discuss the barriers that hinder the adoption of network neuroscience into the clinic. Specifically, we will address barriers of patient representation, external validation, network model inconsistency, equipment and expertise, and general resistance towards change. For each barrier, we will outline a proposal of next steps to facilitate this translation. Overall, it is our hope that this review of progress, barriers, and next steps will serve as an additional motivator to move epilepsy network neuroscience beyond single institutions or datasets findings and coalesce our efforts into practical advancements for the continual benefit to those living with epilepsy.

Unprovoked first seizure in adults — timing of recurrence risk and higher-risk circumstances: based on studies including mixed cohorts of both antiepileptic drug (AED)-treated and untreated subjects, an adult with an unprovoked first seizure is at greatest risk of a recurrence relatively early, within the first 2 years (21%–45%), and especially in the first year (2 Class I studies, 8 Class II studies), and that risk appears to be lower for patients treated with AEDs; the risk of seizure recurrence increases in certain clinical circumstances, including a prior brain lesion or insult causing the seizure (2 Class I studies, 4 Class II studies), an EEG (electroencephalogram) with epileptiform abnormalities (2 Class I studies, 4 Class II studies), a significant brain-imaging abnormality (2 Class II studies, 1 Class III study), and a nocturnal seizure (2 Class II studies).

### FIRST: a practical approach to the causes and management of febrile seizures [^113bBN7k]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

During almost 4 decades of clinical practice of pediatrics and pediatric neurology, the senior authors have rarely made a formal presentation on the topic of "febrile seizures". In any large pediatric teaching hospital, questions regarding the diagnosis and management of febrile seizures are raised by medical students, pediatric residents, and adult and pediatric neurology residents. The acronym FIRST was developed as a teaching tool to present a simple and pragmatic clinical approach to children presenting with a single seizure or cluster of seizures in 1 day associated with a febrile illness before, during, or after the seizure event(s). FIRST refers to Febrile, Illness, Related, Seizure(s) and Template, with the latter representing an outline of the basic cause(s). The authors propose the use of the Table as a tool to help determine the underlying etiology of febrile seizures because this is the major factor affecting the choice of treatment.

### New era of personalised epilepsy management [^111PZPSG]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Uncertainty in treatment response is major problem

Numerous drugs are available to treat epilepsy as well as non-drug interventions such as resective surgery, neuromodulation, and dietary therapies. Yet the current standard of care still relies on a trial and error approach of sequential regimens of antiseizure medications. Although there are guidelines on drug selection based on broad seizure type (focal or generalised onset) many drugs have similar efficacy when analysed on a group basis. For any given patient, it is impossible to predict which drug will be most effective and should be selected as the initial treatment. Nor are there surrogate biomarkers that can reliably predict treatment responses or risk of drug resistant epilepsy in the routine clinical setting. The upshot is that patients must simply wait and see whether their epilepsy will be controlled, usually defined as an absence of seizures for at least one year. Despite an explosion of new drugs, with over 20 on the market, antiseizure medications fail to control seizures in one third of patients.

Across much of the world most patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy are treated by primary care physicians (box 1). If seizure control is not achieved with initial treatment, patients are referred to a general neurologist who, if further drug treatments fail, then refers them to an epilepsy centre. This sequential care pathway means critical time is lost before patients who may be at high risk of drug resistant epilepsy can be assessed by epilepsy specialists. Other treatment options, such as surgery, are widely considered a last resort. Sadly, the associated time delay means such treatments may be less effective. The result is often years of reduced quality of life, lost productivity, and increased mortality.

Box 1
Current treatment practice

Jane is a 30 year old woman with newly diagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy. Her EEG appears normal but an MRI shows right hippocampal sclerosis, the likely source of her seizures. In line with guidelines, Jane's general practitioner prescribes lamotrigine, one of the many drugs shown to be effective against focal seizures. Jane has more seizures and a few months later visits her GP who, appropriately, refers her to a general neurologist. Over the next few years Jane tries various drugs, some of which are stopped because of side effects, and is eventually maintained on three drugs. Despite this, ongoing seizures mean Jane cannot drive, loses her job, and becomes depressed. The neurologist refers her to an epilepsy centre to be evaluated for surgery.

### Evaluation of a first seizure [^115NuwvD]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure is a common presentation in the emergency care setting, and new-onset epilepsy is the most common cause of unprovoked seizures. The patient history and physical examination should direct the type and timing of laboratory and imaging studies. No single sign, symptom, or test dearly differentiates a seizure from a nonseizure event (e.g., syncope, pseudoseizure). Electroencephalography is recommended for patients presenting with a first seizure, and neuroimaging is recommended for adults. Neuroimaging also should be performed in children with risk factors such as head trauma, focal neurologic deficits, or a history of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography except when acute intracranial bleeding is suspected. The most common laboratory findings associated with a seizure are abnormal sodium and glucose levels. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal test results, and no structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Treatment with antiepileptic medications reduces the one- to two-year risk of recurrent seizures but does not reduce the long-term risk of recurrence and does not affect remission rates. Regardless of etiology, a seizure diagnosis severely limits a patient's driving privileges, although laws vary by state.

### Epilepsy and psychosis: a practical approach [^115RFvvx]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The psychoses of epilepsy can be classified according to their temporal relationship with seizures, namely as ictal, postictal and interictal psychosis. Interictal psychosis is the most common and may resemble schizophrenia. They can be challenging to diagnose and to manage, especially given the perception that some antipsychotic drugs may exacerbate seizures, while some antiepileptic medications may worsen psychosis. The current uncertainty around their best management means that some patients may not receive appropriate care. We propose a practical stepwise approach to managing psychosis in patients with epilepsy, summarising the key clinical features. We provide a framework for diagnosis, investigation and management of psychosis in the acute and long term. We also summarise the available evidence on the risk of psychosis with current antiepileptic drugs and the risk of seizures with antipsychotic drugs.

### Evaluation and management of febrile seizures in the out-of-hospital and emergency department settings [^1175RimA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Febrile seizures are the most common seizures seen in children younger than 5 years old. Out-of-hospital and emergency department providers need to be familiar with the principles of the evaluation and management of this common disorder. Most febrile seizures are brief, do not require any specific treatment or extensive workup, and have a benign prognosis. Recognizing the pattern of a simple febrile seizure in young children is important to limit interventions and to reassure parents. Patients with febrile seizures are not at higher risk for serious bacterial illnesses than similarly aged febrile patients. Excluding meningitis and encephalitis are the primary clinical interventions through a thorough history and physical examination and, occasionally, a lumbar puncture. Reassuring parents of patients with febrile seizures and arranging primary care follow-up are important roles for the emergency physician.

### The first seizure as an indicator of epilepsy [^115EvC5t]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Optimal treatment of a possible first seizure depends on the determination if the paroxysmal event was an epileptic seizure and was on an accurate assessment of the recurrence risk. This review summarizes evidence from the last 5 years addressing the following questions: Is it an epileptic seizure? Is it a first seizure? When does a first seizure indicate epilepsy?

Recent Findings

The acts of taking and interpreting the history from patients and witnesses continue to be the most important tools in the diagnosis of first seizures. Assessment tools based on factual questions and the observation of patients' conversational behaviour can contribute to the differentiation of patients with epileptic seizures from those who have experienced other types of transient loss of consciousness (TLOC). At present, only about 40% of patients are seen after their very first seizure. Tests have a limited role in the initial diagnosis of a seizure but help to determine the recurrence risk based on the cause. A remote symptomatic cause and detection of epileptiform discharges are associated with a recurrence risk of at least 60% and allow a diagnosis of epilepsy after a first seizure. The risk of recurrence after an acute symptomatic first seizure is well below 60%.

Summary

Expert history-taking continues to be the most important tool in the diagnosis of a first seizure. Cause is the most important determinant of the recurrence risk. Unfortunately, there is currently no formula enabling a precise calculation of an individualized recurrence risk.

How to keep someone safe during a seizure Steps to keeping a person safe during a seizure
- Keep yourself and others calm.
- Stay with the person.
- Remove anything near them that can cause an injury.
- Check to see if they are wearing a medical bracelet for information about any medical conditions, medicines, and emergency contacts.
- If the person is lying down, turn them gently on their side, with their mouth pointing to the ground. This will keep their airway clear.
- Time the seizure to track if it lasts more than 5 minutes. If it does, seek immediate medical attention or call 911.
- When the seizure is over, help them sit in a safe place to recover.
- Once they are alert, comfort them and explain what happened.
- Offer to call a friend or loved one to help them get home safely. To help someone with this type of seizure, follow these steps to keep them safe:

- Ease them to the ground if they appear to be falling.
- Turn them gently onto one side with their mouth pointing to the ground. This will keep their airway clear.
- Clear the space around them to prevent injury.
- Put something soft and flat under their head.
- Take off their eyeglasses.
- Loosen anything around the neck that could block breathing.
- Time the seizure to track if it lasts more than 5 minutes. If it does, seek immediate medical attention or call 911. When to call for help Seizures don't usually require emergency medical attention. But you should call 911 if one or more of these things happen:

- The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.
- They have another seizure soon after the first one.
- They have trouble breathing or waking up after the seizure.
- They are injured during the seizure.
- The seizure happens in water. It is also important to call 911 if the person having the seizure:

- Has never had a seizure before.
- Has diabetes and loses consciousness.
- Is pregnant.

What to avoid
- Don't hold the person down or stop their movements. This could injure you or them.
- Don't put anything in their mouth. This can hurt their teeth or jaw.
- Don't give mouth-to-mouth breaths during the seizure. People usually start breathing again on their own after a seizure.
- Don't offer water or food until they are fully alert. This is not necessary and could cause them to choke.

Participant characteristics

The mean age of participants in the four trials ranged from 48 years to 55.9 years in the active treatment arms and from 43.8 years to 53 years in the control groups. In all four trials, about half to three-quarters of the participants were male. In three of the included trials, the most common cause of convulsive status epilepticus was a sub-therapeutic level of antiepileptic drugs, while a brain lesion was reported as the most frequent cause in the fourth trial.

Table 2 presents a summary of the characteristics of participants in the four included trials.

Seizures

Seizures occur in a significant minority of individuals with PLAN, and seizure types may include generalized tonic seizures, focal seizures, and myoclonic seizures. Epileptic spasms have also been reported. Complex epilepsy phenotypes have not been reported. Seizures tend to occur later in the disease course and are not generally refractory to treatment. An EEG may show fast rhythms, although this does not need to be routinely obtained if there is no clinical suspicion for seizures.

How can seizures be distinguished from nonepileptic phenomena?

Individuals with PLAN, particularly infantile PLAN later in disease, may have nonepileptic stiffening or jerking episodes that can only be distinguished from seizure with an ictal EEG. Without an EEG, there are other clues that can help with this determination. Seizures tend to be unprovoked, not interruptible, stereotyped, and involve loss of awareness and a postictal period. A video of the event may be helpful. If uncertainty remains after EEG, and the spells are frequent and bothersome, a trial of an antiseizure medication could be considered.

What is the most effective first-line and second-line antiepileptic medication for PLAN patients with seizures?

There is no evidence for a specific approach to seizure management in PLAN. As with other children, seizure medications are chosen based on seizure type and side effect profile.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^115cfuNh]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Urgent control therapy in SE — indication and exception — states that urgent control AED treatment following administration of short acting benzodiazepines is required in all patients who present with SE, unless the immediate cause of SE is known and definitively corrected (e.g., severe hypoglycemia). It further notes two potential goals of urgent control therapy, including that for patients who respond to emergent initial therapy and have complete resolution of SE, the goal is rapid attainment of therapeutic levels of an AED.

Generalized status epilepticus — randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous (IV) lorazepam, phenobarbital, diazepam and phenytoin, or phenytoin alone evaluated cessation of seizure activity within 20 min; results reported N = 384 with success rates lorazepam 65%, phenobarbital 58%, diazepam and phenytoin 56%, and phenytoin 44%, and pairwise, lorazepam was significantly superior to phenytoin; limitations noted it was not clear whether refractory to initial treatment with benzodiazepines.

### Evaluation after a first seizure in adults [^113J8fXZ]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for first seizure in adults, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend to assess for history of medication or substance use that can provoke seizures through normal use, withdrawal, overdose, drug-drug interaction, or impaired metabolism due to comorbidities.
