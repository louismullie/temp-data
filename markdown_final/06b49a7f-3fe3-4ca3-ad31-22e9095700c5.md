## Question

does trending AMH annually help suggest clinical course of puberty or risk of stalled puberty

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether trending AMH annually can suggest the clinical course of normal puberty or predict the risk of stalled/delayed puberty in healthy girls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about AMH physiology and its expected trajectory across prepuberty and puberty. Then, I should verify the longitudinal "tracking" of AMH within individuals. Next, I will examine links between AMH and pubertal milestones or gonadotropins. After that, I must assess whether annual AMH trends predict delayed or arrested puberty, distinguishing healthy populations from pathological conditions. Finally, I need to review assay and methodological limitations before synthesizing clinical applicability and making a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the physiology and peripubertal pattern. AMH is secreted by granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles and generally reflects the pool of small growing follicles rather than large FSH-dependent follicles that no longer secrete AMH, which explains age-related patterns and peripubertal changes in girls [^115ZXPck] [^116K4Q9S]. Wait, I initially thought AMH consistently declines at puberty, but I should verify this nuance: longitudinal pediatric data show a prepubertal rise (about 20% between ages 7 and 9) followed by a modest peripubertal reduction (approximately 20–30%) as follicles transition to FSH-dependent growth, yet other contemporary cohort data emphasize relative stability with only minor fluctuations through puberty, suggesting an individual set-point that largely tracks across development; these perspectives are reconcilable if the decline is modest and timing-dependent while the rank order within individuals remains stable [^115WD8cf] [^111pdxPL] [^113zTZZa] [^111MyL6E].

> I need to check the strength of intra-individual tracking. High-credibility longitudinal evidence demonstrates that each girl tends to maintain her relative AMH concentration over time, with mean intra-individual variation around 0.56 ± 0.31 SD and robust correlations from infancy and mid-childhood to adolescence (r ≈ 0.35–0.68), supporting the concept of a personal AMH set-point across development, despite modest age-related shifts around pubertal onset [^1149mb6H] [^113JxA47] [^11741i9X].

> Next, I should review how AMH relates to pubertal milestones and gonadotropins. Let me consider cross-sectional peripubertal data: at age 8, AMH levels were lower in pubertal compared with prepubertal girls, consistent with the physiological shift to larger antral follicles, while AMH correlates negatively with FSH across ages, reflecting reciprocal dynamics between growing follicle activity and gonadotropin drive; however, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these associations do not establish that annual AMH velocity predicts the timing or pace of puberty in healthy girls, and I should confirm that no validated thresholds or trend rules exist for this purpose [^111pdxPL] [^1149mb6H] [^notfound].

> I will now examine predictive value for stalled or delayed puberty. In pathological contexts such as Turner syndrome, very low AMH (< 4 pmol/L, roughly < −2 SD) predicts absent spontaneous puberty and imminent POI with high sensitivity/specificity, which is clinically actionable; but wait, this should not be extrapolated to healthy girls — no studies validate specific AMH thresholds or annual trend patterns that predict delayed/arrested puberty in the general population, and contemporary guidelines explicitly recommend against routine AMH testing to predict POI, underscoring limited predictive utility outside defined disorders [^112YLtFh] [^112Visb8] [^111j4H9E].

> But I need to ensure methodological considerations do not confound interpretation. Assay nonstandardization and inter-assay differences limit comparability over time; intra-individual AMH variation can be around 20–30% even under controlled conditions; hormonal contraception can lower AMH approximately 30–40%, and ethnicity influences AMH levels and decline patterns — so, hold on, I should verify that these factors can easily obscure small annual changes, making trend-based inference in healthy adolescents unreliable without strict assay and exposure control [^115voSds] [^116MTHbX] [^116aXZa4] [^114qSzFg] [^117XA8LF].

> Let me synthesize clinical applicability. While AMH clearly tracks within individuals and reflects small follicle activity, I should double-check whether annual trending adds predictive value beyond clinical staging, growth, and gonadotropins: there are no validated AMH trend velocities or cut-points to forecast the clinical course of normal puberty in healthy girls; modest peripubertal dips or stability occur, but they are not prognostic, and repeated measures are vulnerable to assay and biological variability; moreover, using repeated AMH trajectories to improve prediction has shown limited added value even in adult ovarian aging contexts, which cautions against expecting trend-based prediction during adolescence [^1149mb6H] [^111pdxPL] [^112hoNqd].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and practical guidance. For healthy girls, trending AMH annually does not reliably suggest the clinical course of normal puberty or predict stalled puberty; instead, clinicians should prioritize clinical pubertal staging, linear growth, and targeted gonadotropin/estradiol assessment when delay is suspected, reserving AMH for specific diagnostic contexts (e.g., suspected gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome, or treatment-related ovarian injury), where extreme low values can be informative; if AMH is measured, I need to ensure assay consistency, account for contraceptive use, and interpret values within age- and context-specific norms rather than relying on annual trend velocity to forecast pubertal outcomes [^111j4H9E] [^112YLtFh] [^1149mb6H] [^116aXZa4] [^114qSzFg].

Annual AMH trends do not reliably predict the clinical course of puberty or stalled puberty in healthy adolescents [^1149mb6H]. AMH levels are relatively stable through **childhood and adolescence**, reflecting an individual's ovarian activity set point rather than pubertal timing or progression [^112Visb8] [^114Ct8Kj]. AMH is not associated with **age at menarche or pubertal onset**, and annual testing does not yield actionable insight into pubertal trajectory [^1149mb6H] [^notfound]. AMH may be useful in specific contexts (e.g. Turner syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), but routine annual AMH testing is not recommended to monitor normal puberty or detect stalled puberty [^112YLtFh] [^113ZrGCc].

---

## Physiological role of AMH in puberty

AMH is produced by **granulosa cells of small growing follicles** and reflects the pool of small antral follicles [^117XA8LF]. In healthy girls, AMH levels are relatively stable from infancy through adolescence, indicating an individual set point of ovarian activity [^112Visb8] [^1149mb6H]. This stability suggests that AMH primarily reflects ovarian follicular activity rather than directly influencing pubertal timing or progression [^115U7tSU].

---

## AMH levels and pubertal timing

Longitudinal studies consistently show that AMH levels in infancy and mid-childhood strongly correlate with levels in adolescence, indicating stable individual trajectories [^113JxA47]. However, they also show that **AMH levels do not significantly fluctuate during puberty** and are not associated with the timing of pubertal onset or menarche [^111MyL6E] [^115U7tSU]. Specifically, AMH does not predict age at menarche or pubertal onset, limiting its utility for monitoring pubertal progression [^1149mb6H].

---

## AMH and stalled puberty

Stalled puberty — delayed or arrested pubertal progression — is typically associated with hormonal abnormalities such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or primary ovarian insufficiency [^115U7tSU]. In these conditions, AMH levels may be low, reflecting diminished ovarian reserve or impaired follicular development [^115nGwZa] [^112Visb8]. However, in healthy adolescents, **AMH levels remain relatively stable** and do not provide specific information about the risk of stalled puberty [^114Ct8Kj].

---

## Clinical utility of annual AMH measurements

Annual AMH measurements have **limited clinical utility** in monitoring normal pubertal progression or predicting stalled puberty [^115U7tSU]. The stability of AMH levels throughout childhood and adolescence suggests that annual measurements would not provide significant additional information beyond a single baseline value [^114Ct8Kj]. Furthermore, AMH levels are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, complicating the establishment of standardized reference ranges for pubertal monitoring [^114qSzFg] [^115jRZhb].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors limit the **reliability** of annual AMH measurements in predicting pubertal progression:

- **Genetic variability**: Individual genetic differences significantly influence AMH levels, contributing to variability in baseline levels and trajectories [^114qSzFg].

- **Environmental factors**: Environmental influences, such as nutrition and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, may affect AMH levels and ovarian function [^115jRZhb].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assay methods and lack of standardized reference ranges complicate the interpretation of AMH measurements [^117XA8LF] [^115voSds].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend** routine annual AMH measurements for monitoring pubertal progression or predicting stalled puberty in healthy adolescents [^115U7tSU]. Instead, AMH testing is primarily recommended in specific clinical contexts, such as:

- **Turner syndrome**: AMH levels may help assess ovarian reserve and predict spontaneous puberty or premature ovarian insufficiency [^112YLtFh].

- **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**: AMH levels may assist in differentiating hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from constitutional delay of puberty [^113ZrGCc].

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Elevated AMH levels may indicate increased ovarian follicular activity associated with PCOS [^112W2ypr].

---

## Alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments

Given the limited utility of annual AMH measurements, **alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments are recommended** for monitoring pubertal progression:

- **Gonadotropins (FSH, LH)**: Measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels provides direct information about hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activation and pubertal progression [^115U7tSU].

- **Estradiol**: Estradiol levels reflect ovarian estrogen production and are useful in assessing pubertal progression in females.

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular clinical evaluation of secondary sexual characteristics, growth velocity, and bone age remains the gold standard for monitoring pubertal progression [^115U7tSU].

---

Annual AMH measurements **do not reliably predict** pubertal course or the risk of stalled puberty in healthy adolescents [^1149mb6H]. AMH levels remain relatively stable throughout childhood and adolescence, reflecting an individual's ovarian activity rather than pubertal timing or progression [^114Ct8Kj]. Therefore, routine annual AMH testing is not recommended for monitoring normal pubertal development [^115U7tSU].

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^1149mb6H]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Background**: Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in small growing ovarian follicles. In adult women, serum concentrations of AMH reflect the ovarian reserve of resting primordial follicles, and low AMH is associated with risk of early menopause. In contrast, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have elevated AMH. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the individual tracking of serum AMH concentrations, as well as whether AMH in early childhood reflects ovarian activity in adolescence.

- **Methods**: In this large longitudinal study, healthy girls were examined from infancy to adolescence (1997–2019), including physical examination, assessment of serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (in infancy: median age 0.3 years; mid-childhood: 7.2 years; puberty: 11.3 years; and adolescence: 15.9 years), transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS, puberty and adolescence), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, puberty) of the ovaries.

- **Findings**: Each girl maintained her relative AMH concentration, expressed as standard deviation (SD) scores, over time; the mean variation of individual age-adjusted AMH concentrations was 0.56 ± 0.31 SD. Serum concentrations of AMH in adolescence correlated with AMH in infancy and childhood, with values of r = 0.347 for infancy, r = 0.637 for mid-childhood, and r = 0.675 for puberty, all p < 0.001. AMH correlated negatively with FSH concentrations in all age groups: infancy (r = −0.645, p < 0.001), mid-childhood (r = −0.222, p < 0.001), puberty (r = −0.354, p < 0.001), and adolescence (n = 275, r = −0.175, p = 0.004).

### The roles of anti-Müllerian hormone in breast cancer [^117PknxD]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2023). Low credibility.

Ovarian reserve refers to the number of primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex, indicating the ability of the ovary to produce fertilizable eggs. Currently, ultrasound-guided antral follicle counting (AFC) is the diagnostic procedure used to evaluate ovarian reserve. Some scholars have suggested that the level of serum AMH can indirectly reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool in the ovary, or the abundance of ovarian reserve. Several studies have confirmed that the serum AMH level is positively correlated with AFC.

AMH levels can reflect ovarian function for women at a given age more sensitively than other reproductive hormones because the level of AMH starts declining earlier than other ovarian signs with advancing age. The dominant follicles and corpus luteum do not secrete AMH because AMH does not depend on the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, thus making it stable during the menstrual cycle. Regarding sensitivity and specificity, AMH is more suitable than FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B for evaluating ovarian reserve.

AMH has become an outstanding candidate for evaluating adult female ovarian function. The obtained results are then applied for individualized counseling of women with fertility needs to predict the menopausal date and reproductive life, predict ovarian response to overstimulation in assisted reproductive technology, assist in the diagnosis of ovarian diseases (such as polycystic ovary syndrome and congenital ovarian insufficiency), and evaluate the iatrogenic impact on ovarian reserve.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^115WD8cf]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

We measured circulating AMH levels as a marker of the rate of recruitment of primordial follicles. Our findings of complex changes in, and cross-sectional associations with, AMH levels indicate intriguing changes in the rate of ovarian follicle recruitment during the peripubertal years, which correspond to the timing of menarche.

- **Prepubertal rise in AMH levels**: Our observation of a longitudinal 20% rise in AMH levels during the 2 years between ages 7 and 9 years is consistent with the inferred doubling in AMH levels between ages 4 and 8 years in cross-sectional data. Together, these findings suggest that the rate of recruitment of "quiescent" primordial follicles into "active" preantral follicles that produce AMH is not constant, nor simply a function of primordial follicle numbers, but rather increases steadily as girls approach the onset of puberty. This conclusion is consistent with a recent review and analysis of cross-sectional data on primordial follicle numbers from autopsy samples, which estimated that the rate of follicle recruitment increases with age during childhood, despite declining total primordial follicle numbers.

The longstanding concept that the pituitary-gonadal axis is inactive from late infancy until the abrupt reawakening of pituitary sensitivity to GnRH has been questioned in recent years, with studies reporting gradual rises in the levels of E2 and inhibin B during the prepubertal years. It is not possible to say whether a gradual increase in ovarian follicle activity facilitates or even triggers the onset of puberty, but the concept…

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^117XA8LF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of small, growing follicles in the ovary. Serum AMH levels strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles and, therefore, have received increasing attention as a marker for ovarian reserve. This review summarizes recent findings and limitations in the application of serum AMH in ovarian reserve assessment.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A PubMed search was conducted to find recent literature on the measurements and use of serum AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Serum AMH levels are measured to assess the "functional ovarian reserve", a term that is preferred over "ovarian reserve" since AMH levels reflect the pool of growing follicles that potentially can ovulate. Serum AMH levels are used in individualized follicle-stimulating hormone dosing protocols and may predict the risk of poor response or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome but have limited value in predicting ongoing pregnancy. Additionally, serum AMH levels are studied to predict the natural or disease-related age of menopause. Studies show that the age-dependent decline rates of AMH vary among women. The generalized implementation of serum AMH measurement has also led to an increase in diagnostic assays, including automated assays; however, direct comparison of results remains problematic.

Serum AMH remains the preferred ovarian reserve marker. However, the lack of an international standard for AMH limits comparison between AMH assays. Furthermore, little is known about endogenous and exogenous factors that influence serum AMH.

### Age-related changes in low serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels in female adolescents: A single-center retrospective pilot study [^113Vxg13]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

The available data on the clinical significance of low serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in female adolescents are limited. This study aims to elucidate age-related changes in low serum AMH levels in adolescents and identify predictive factors for AMH progression.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted involving female adolescents aged 11–19 years with low serum AMH levels (1.6 ng/mL). Group 1 consisted of those with low AMH levels, and Group 2 comprised those without.

- **Results**: Among 1,655 adolescents who underwent AMH testing at least once from 2010 to 2022, 75 participants (4.5%) exhibited low AMH levels. A confirmation of low levels (1.6 ng/mL) was made in 7 (30.4%) of 23 female adolescents who underwent follow-up testing. Group 1 had higher initial AMH levels and lower initial follicle-stimulating hormone levels compared to Group 2 (1.0 vs. 0.59 ng/mL, P = 0.001; and 4.4 vs. 9.8 mIU/mL, P = 0.015, respectively). Ovarian volume did not differ significantly between the groups (3.8 vs. 4.4 cm³, P = 0.465). None of the participants with initial AMH levels under 0.75 ng/mL showed an increase during follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that low serum AMH levels in adolescents may have explanations beyond indicating low ovarian reserve. Prospective studies involving larger participant numbers will aid in predicting AMH.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^111MyL6E]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in small follicles prior to FSH-dependent growth. Serum AMH concentrations reflect the number of small antral follicles throughout life, i.e. in infancy, peripubertal girls, adolescents, and adult women. In adult women, the number of small growing follicles is in equilibrium with the number of resting primordial follicles, constituting the total number of germ cells established in fetal life. Thus, the risk of early menopause is increased in women with low age-specific AMH.

When AMH was first characterized, it was a marker of testicular tissue in young boys due to high levels produced by immature Sertoli cells. However, after the introduction of highly sensitive AMH assays, serum concentrations of AMH are now measurable in all healthy girls. This is due to the recruitment of primordial follicles to small growing follicles through childhood, even prior to pubertal onset. Minor fluctuations of AMH around pubertal onset have been observed, but overall, AMH concentrations are stable through pubertal development, indicating an individual set-point of ovarian activity. To our knowledge, there are currently no longitudinal data revealing whether this set-point of activity from small antral follicles tracks all the way from infancy and mid-childhood over puberty to adulthood.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^115ZXPck]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta family that derives its name from its role during male sex differentiation by inducing the regression of the Müllerian ducts. At the time of writing, AMH is best known as a serum marker for ovarian function, with assessment of AMH levels at both ends of the spectrum: ovarian reserve and polycystic ovarian syndrome. In the ovary, AMH is expressed by granulosa cells of growing follicles from the primary up to the small antral stage. After follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-dependent selection, AMH expression disappears, although some expression remains in cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles. Also, in atretic follicles and corpora lutea, AMH expression is lost.

This window of expression is largely preserved among species and in the adult human ovary. Increasing expression levels of AMH are detected in follicles up to 8 mm, and expression is absent in follicles larger than 8 mm. This expression pattern is positively matched by AMH concentrations in follicular fluid, showing the highest levels in follicles up to 8 mm and a sharp drop thereafter.

Use of serum AMH levels in the prediction of age of menopause

In the Western world, the age at which a woman decides to have her first child has increased, thereby increasing the risk of age-related involuntary infertility. Given the strong correlation between the age-related decline in primordial follicle number, the number of growing follicles, and serum AMH levels, several studies have investigated whether serum AMH could aid in the prediction of the age of menopause.

A meta-analysis by Depmann et al, in which AMH levels from six studies were reanalyzed, concluded that serum AMH can predict the time to menopause. However, compared with a woman's age, the added value of serum AMH was limited, as the C statistic only increased from 84% to 86%. Furthermore, serum AMH appeared to have limited precision on an individual level. Conflicting results have been reported in predicting the onset of menopause in women of late reproductive age.

In a recent population-based study, in which the majority of women were overweight or obese, it was shown that women aged 45 to 49 years with undetectable AMH levels had a 60% probability of becoming menopausal within five years. Furthermore, AMH did improve the prediction of menopausal onset compared with age alone (C statistic 91% vs. 83%).

A recent multiethnic study, which included 1537 pre- or early perimenopausal women at baseline and with follow-up until 12 months of amenorrhea was reached (SWAN study), analyzed the prediction of the final menstrual period (FMP) by AMH levels. Although AMH was serially assessed in a small subset of this cohort, multiple sam…

### Defining reference ranges for serum anti-Müllerian hormone on a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men highlights new potential physiological functions of AMH on FSH secretion and sperm motility [^114HnsuC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a dimeric glycoprotein that belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily. It binds to its exclusive AMH type II receptor (AMH-R2), which has been shown to interact with the type 1 receptor serine/threonine kinases ACVR1 (activin A receptor, type 1), BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type 1A), and BMPR1B (bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type 1B). Upon AMH binding, this complex leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 proteins, which are translocated to the nucleus and are involved in the regulation of gene expression.

AMH is the first hormone secreted by immature Sertoli cells at approximately 8 weeks of gestation and is responsible for the regression of the Müllerian ducts in the male fetus during the sexual differentiation process. AMH is secreted at high levels in boys from early fetal life until the onset of puberty. However, increased production of testicular testosterone (T) from the Leydig cells at puberty reduces AMH secretion, in parallel with Sertoli cell maturation and the appearance of meiotic germ cells in the seminiferous tubules. As a result, AMH serum levels in males start declining compared with prepubertal levels and continue to decrease progressively throughout adulthood. Hence, AMH is considered a good marker for testicular endocrine function.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^115qJDkF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Serum AMH levels are generally measured during the early follicular phase, similar to other hormonal markers of ovarian function, such as FSH, estradiol, and inhibin B. However, it has been questioned whether the variations in serum AMH levels could be explained by differences during the menstrual cycle. While initial studies suggested that AMH levels are relatively stable during the menstrual cycle, more recent research suggests that AMH levels show significant intracycle variation up to 20.7%. Although the small number of individuals analyzed in these studies is a limitation, a clear pattern across the menstrual cycle, as evident for FSH or estradiol, was not present. Instead, the variation in AMH levels reflects the variation in AFC during the menstrual cycle according to a study by Overbeek et al. in regularly cycling women.

The study also showed that women with higher basal AMH levels, mostly younger women, had relatively higher variation in AMH levels across the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, studies observed that the intercycle variation in AMH can range from 28% to 163%, depending on the AMH assay used. This intra-individual variation suggests that a single AMH measurement may lead to an inaccurate assessment of the FOR, which may have clinical consequences when the AMH value is used in an individualized ovarian stimulation protocol.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^116K4Q9S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

- **Figure 1**. Anti-müllerian hormone expression and concentration in relation to folliculogenesis and ovarian reserve: (A) Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) expression increases from the secondary stage onward until the small antral follicle stage. In preovulatory follicles, AMH is only expressed in cumulus granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte (dark pink layer). (B) With increasing age, the functional ovarian reserve decreases as a result of exhaustion of the primordial follicle pool. This leads to a decrease in the number of small antral follicles and consequently to a decrease in serum AMH levels, reaching undetectable levels at menopause. Figure created with Biorender.

Since AMH is expressed by growing follicles prior to FSH-dependent selection and has been shown to be detectable in circulation, serum AMH has gained momentum as a marker for ovarian function, particularly in the assessment of the quantitative aspect of ovarian reserve, which is the focus of this review. By definition, the ovarian reserve consists of the quality and quantity of primordial follicles, both of which decline with increasing age. The number of growing follicles recruited from the primordial follicle pool reflects the number of primordial follicles. Since there is no serum marker that can directly measure the number of primordial follicles, a marker that reflects the number of growing follicles is currently the best proxy for the quantitative aspect of the ovarian reserve. Initial studies, performed nearly two decades ago, showed that serum AMH levels indeed strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles.

### Clinical uses of anti-Müllerian hormone assays: Pitfalls and promises [^115voSds]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the controversy about fluctuations of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels during the menstrual cycle results from differences between the immunoassays currently available: the Beckman Coulter Immunotech kit (Fullerton, CA) and the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories kit (Webster, TX).

- **Design**: Prospective trial.

- **Setting**: Fertility clinics of two tertiary university hospitals.

- **Patients**: One hundred sixty-eight blood samples from three different populations. Serial samples at set intervals from the LH surge were taken in a fourth population of 10 volunteers.

- **Interventions**: We re-measured AMH levels using the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories kit in 168 blood samples, which initially had been measured using the Beckman Coulter assay. We also conducted serial AMH measurements (n = 7) during the menstrual cycle of 10 women.

- **Main outcome measures**: Linear regression of AMH levels determined using two different assays and analysis of variance of serial measurements in the menstrual cycle.

- **Results**: We found a linear relationship between the two methods, with a correlation coefficient of 0.88. When repeated individual AMH measures were longitudinally analyzed in relation to the LH surge, a slight but significant decrease was observed after ovulation.

- **Conclusions**: Differences in AMH fluctuations during the menstrual cycle reported in recent publications do not result from the use of different AMH assays. The changes in AMH levels after ovulation are slight yet statistically significant; however, the fluctuations observed are small.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^115nGwZa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was originally described in the context of sexual differentiation in the male fetus but has gained prominence now as a marker of ovarian reserve and fertility in females. In this mini-review, we offer an updated synopsis on AMH and its clinical utility in pediatric patients.

A systematic search was undertaken for studies related to the physiology of AMH, normative data, and clinical role in pediatrics. In males, AMH, secreted by Sertoli cells, is found at high levels prenatally and throughout childhood and declines with progression through puberty to overlap with levels in females. Thus, serum AMH has clinical utility as a marker of testicular tissue in males with differences in sexual development and cryptorchidism and in the evaluation of persistent Mullerian duct syndrome. In females, serum AMH has been used as a predictive marker of ovarian reserve and fertility, but prepubertal and adolescent AMH assessments need to be interpreted cautiously. AMH is also a marker of tumor burden, progression, and recurrence in germ cell tumors of the ovary.

AMH has widespread clinical diagnostic utility in pediatrics, but interpretation is often challenging and should be undertaken in the context of not only age and sex but also developmental and pubertal stage of the child. Nonstandardized assays necessitate the need for assay-specific normative data. The recognition of the role of AMH beyond gonadal development and maturation may usher in novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### AMH as predictor of premature ovarian insufficiency: A longitudinal study of 120 Turner syndrome patients [^112YLtFh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of Turner syndrome (TS) patients suffer from accelerated loss of primordial follicles. Low circulating levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) may predict the lack of spontaneous puberty in prepubertal girls and imminent premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in TS women with preserved ovarian function.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the association between circulating AMH and ovarian status in TS patients.
- **Design**: Longitudinal observational cohort study.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center for pediatric and gynecologic endocrinology.
- **Participants**: A total of 120 TS patients, aged 0 to 48 years.
- **Main outcome measures**: Longitudinal measurements of AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol, and inhibin B according to age, karyotype (45, X; 45, X/46, XX mosaicism; miscellaneous karyotypes), and ovarian status (group 0, prepubertal; group 1, never ovarian function; group 2, ongoing ovarian function; and group 3, loss of ovarian function).

Ovarian status was highly associated with the TS karyotype: spontaneous puberty — 45, X (three of 44 patients), 45, X/46, XX (15 of 17), miscellaneous (17 of 42); and POI — 45, X (three of three), 45, X/46, XX (one of 15), and miscellaneous (eight of 17). AMH was associated with ovarian status (e.g. group 1, < 2 pmol/L; vs. group 2, 19 pmol/L; P < .001). AMH < 4 pmol/L (corresponding to < -2 SD) predicted absent puberty in prepubertal girls and POI in adolescent and adult patients.

In conclusion, the majority of women with mosaic karyotype 45, X/46, XX had ongoing ovarian function in early adulthood. AMH < -2 SD predicted failure to enter puberty in young girls.

### Back to the basics of ovarian aging: a population-based study on longitudinal anti-Müllerian hormone decline [^112hoNqd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The notion of differing decline rates of AMH was previously put forward by Faddy et al, who suggested that the decline rate of follicles accelerates after reaching a certain numeric threshold. The number of follicles at this threshold was primarily estimated to be around 25,000, and later hypothesized to differ per individual. Thilagam recently extended this mathematical model to include the influence of other hormones involved in ovarian aging. Indeed, our results indicate that there are more factors at play.

We observed an average acceleration of AMH decline with chronological age, while the average decline rate gradually decreased with time to menopause. This could mean that follicle quantity changes are more dependent on chronological rather than reproductive aging or could be an indication of increased AMH production per follicle due to increasing FSH levels nearer to menopause. Moreover, higher initial AMH levels were first associated with a slower AMH decline rate, but later with a quicker decline. This could potentially mean that the suggested inhibitory effect of AMH on follicle recruitment is effective up to a certain age or ovarian reserve threshold. This concept was previously brought up in a mouse study, in which the decline of growing follicles and AMH levels accelerated only later in reproductive life, leading to the hypothesis that compensatory mechanisms are present earlier on.

In any case, this observation may prove detrimental for the hopes of improved reproductive age estimation with repeated AMH measurements.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^113zTZZa]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Although cross-sectional studies infer that AMH levels are stable between ages 8 and 25 years and then gradually decline with age, more detailed longitudinal studies have revealed a 30% reduction in AMH levels during the first 2 years after pubertal onset, indicating the possible regulation of AMH production during puberty. In consideration of the potential factors that might regulate AMH production during childhood, studies have related AMH levels in children and adults to certain growth characteristics, although the findings are inconsistent. Early small studies suggested that AMH levels were higher in infants following low birthweight (BW) or high BW compared with normal BW, suggesting antenatal altered follicular development. However, recent larger studies found no differences in AMH levels in prepubertal girls or young women according to birthweight or gestational age. Furthermore, growth hormone treatment had no effect on AMH levels. In adults, lower AMH levels in obese versus normal weight individuals have been reported in some but not all studies. However, such relationships may be obscured by the higher AMH levels that are consistently observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as well as in their first-degree relatives, even during childhood.

In a large sample of normal girls, we aimed to identify the hormonal and growth-related correlates of the rate of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment during peripuberty at age 8 years with the use of AMH as a marker of such activity. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study on a smaller number of subjects, we explored the…

### Ovarian reserve biomarkers and menstrual cycle length in a prospective cohort study [^111adJjN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

While age-related changes in menstrual cycle length are well known, it is unclear whether anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) or other ovarian reserve biomarkers have a direct association with cycle length.

- **Objective**: To determine the association between biomarkers of ovarian reserve and menstrual cycle length.

- **Methods**: Secondary analysis using data from time to conceive (TTC), a prospective time to pregnancy cohort study. The age-independent association between cycle length and biomarkers of ovarian reserve was analyzed using linear mixed and marginal models. Study participants were TTC-enrolled women aged 30–44 years with no history of infertility who were attempting to conceive. For instance, women with AMH levels greater than 8 ng/mL had cycles that were 2.15 days longer (95% CI 1.46, 2.83), follicular phases that were 2 days longer (95% CI 0.77, 3.24), and luteal phases that were 1.80 days longer (95% CI 0.71, 2.88).

- **Conclusion**: Increasing AMH levels are associated with longer menstrual cycles due to both a lengthening of the follicular phase.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^117NwWsX]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

At examination in adolescence, the girls completed an electronic questionnaire including age at menarche, menstrual cycle length within the past 6 months (grouped as: 35 days, "too irregular to tell", "on hormonal contraception", or "unknown"), and the number of menstrual bleedings in the past 6 months. Participants completed a menstrual calendar either from the time of invitation until examination or retrospectively, if this information was kept. Information was available for a minimum of three cycles.

Menstrual cycles in the 145 girls with AMH data at mid-childhood and adolescence were categorized as either regular menstrual cycles, irregular menstrual cycles, or other cycle patterns.

- **Regular menstrual cycles**: A reported cycle length of 21–35 days and 5 to 8 menstrual bleedings within the past 6 months was defined as regular (n = 90).

- **Irregular menstrual cycles**: This was defined as oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea (n = 38).

	- **Oligomenorrhea**: Reported cycle length of " > 35 days" or "too irregular to tell" in combination with menstrual calendar data of 1–3 bleedings in the past 6 months. Girls reporting either "don't know" or "4 bleedings in the past 6 months" were categorized as irregular only if their menstrual calendar showed oligomenorrhea.

	- **Secondary amenorrhea**: Girls who had experienced menarche but had no menstrual bleeding within the past 6 months.

- **Other cycle patterns**: Girls who had not experienced menarche or who had menarche during the past 6 months were included in this group (n = 17).

### Differential rates of change in measures of ovarian reserve in young cancer survivors across the reproductive lifespan [^117T12cp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies have examined the level and rate of change of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) for predicting time to menopause. Limited prospective, longitudinal data exists evaluating measures of ovarian reserve (MOR) in cancer survivors.

- **Purpose**: Determine the rate of change of MOR in survivors (15 to 39 years) compared with similar-aged controls and late reproductive-aged controls (40 to 50 years).

- **Design**: Prospective cohort.

- **Setting**: Quaternary university hospital.

- **Participants**: Survivors at least one year from therapy completion, similar-aged controls, and late reproductive-aged controls.

- **Interventions**: Annual visits with early follicular-phase hormone analysis and ultrasound.

- **Main outcome measure**: Changes in AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) were modeled using random effects linear regression.

Cancer survivors (170) and 135 similar-aged controls had annual visits for an average of 38 months; 71 late reproductive-aged controls were followed for an average of 24 months. In models adjusted for body mass index, time since cancer therapy (for survivors), and exogenous hormone use, the geometric mean AMH and AFC levels were lower in the survivors than similar-aged controls at all ages. After age 24.5, AMH and AFC declined in both groups at rates that were similar (P = 0.78 for AMH, P = 0.37 for AFC). Late reproductive-aged controls declined at a much more precipitous rate of 30% per year for AMH and 16% per year for AFC (P < 0.01 compared with survivors).

Although survivors had lower levels of AMH and AFC at the time of enrollment.

### Next steps toward AMH as a robust biomarker for assessing ovarian aging in individual women [^111AjvQF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a glycoprotein produced by the gonads and a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily, similar to inhibins. Previously, this hormone was referred to as Müllerian-inhibiting substance, known for its pivotal role in male embryonic sexual differentiation. More recent studies using female AMH knock-out mice convincingly elucidated its crucial role in the recruitment of follicles from the resting primordial pool, resulting in premature follicle exhaustion.

Initial human studies suggested that AMH could indeed be used as a marker of the remaining functional ovarian reserve. The study by de Vet et al. was recently elected as one of 25 seminal papers by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, emphasizing the key significance of ovarian aging in infertility care. The key questions remain, however, as to what extent the amount of growth of AMH-producing follicles truly represents the size of the remaining resting primordial follicle pool and whether this is constant across the life course. Direct counting of the number of follicles present in human ovaries is not feasible. A more practical approach would be to assess whether single or repeat measurements of AMH concentrations at a younger age are associated with the age of menopause, a state of terminal follicular depletion later in life. This would provide indirect proof that the size of the group of developing follicles is indeed a direct representation of the remaining resting follicle pool.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^115U7tSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), also known as Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), is a hormone produced exclusively in the gonads. Alfred Jost, a pioneering researcher in the field of fetal endocrinology, first proposed the existence of the "hormone inhibitrice" in the 1940s when he demonstrated the regression of the "Mullerian ducts" (paramesonephric ducts), which are anlagen to the uterus, Fallopian tubes, cervix, and the upper third of the vagina, in undifferentiated female rabbit embryos following surgical implants of testicular tissue. Josso et al. demonstrated that the Sertoli cells secreted MIS, a glycoprotein that was eventually purified and coined the term "AMH", now widely in use today, and Donahoe et al. synthesized functional recombinant human MIS.

In the decades that have followed, the sexually dimorphic functions of AMH have not only played a part in the diagnosis of differences (originally "disorders") in sexual development (DSD) but have found extensive clinical utility in female fertility and reproductive health. Its significance continues to evolve with the finding of novel neuroendocrine regulatory actions of AMH. In this mini-review, we examine the physiological role of AMH and its clinical utility in pediatric patients.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^111pdxPL]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

To identify correlates and longitudinal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels as a marker of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment in normal peripubertal girls, an observational study using mixed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses was conducted.

- **Patient selection**: Unselected girls assessed at ages 7–11 years.
- **Intervention**: None.
- **Main outcome measures**: AMH, inhibin B, and FSH levels were analyzed in blood samples collected at ages 7, 9, and 11 years for longitudinal analyses and at age 8 years for cross-sectional analyses.

In the cross-sectional analysis, AMH levels at age 8 years were lower in pubertal girls (median 25.0 pmol/L, interquartile range [IQR] 16.0–33.9; n = 39) than in prepubertal girls (33.5 pmol/L, IQR 22.3–49.1; n = 342). In prepubertal girls, higher AMH levels were associated with higher inhibin B levels, lower FSH levels, and larger body mass index at age 8 years and subsequently with later age at menarche. AMH levels were unrelated to birth weight or birth length.

In the longitudinal analysis, AMH levels increased between ages 7 (median 27.0 pmol/L, IQR 19.2–34) and 9 years (32.0 pmol/L, IQR 26.5–42.7), then declined between 9 and 11 years (26.5 pmol/L, IQR 19–42.25) with high intraindividual correlation in AMH levels between ages 7 and 9 years and 7 and 11 years.

Measurement of circulating AMH and inhibin B levels suggests that the rate of ovarian primordial follicle recruitment increases in the prepubertal years then declines again following the onset of puberty.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^114qSzFg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Serum AMH levels in the general population are negatively correlated with age in adult women. However, studies aimed at developing normative data for AMH also showed that this correlation depends on the age category analyzed. From birth onward, AMH levels increase to plateau at approximately age 25 years. Up to the age of approximately 16 years, AMH levels are positively correlated with age. This positive correlation may reflect the increased rate of primordial follicle recruitment observed from birth up to around age 14 years.

From age 25 years onward, AMH levels start to decline to undetectable levels at menopause, and only from this age onward can a negative correlation between AMH levels and age be observed. This pattern across ages appears consistent among different ethnicities. However, studies indicate that at any given age, there is considerable variation in serum AMH levels. Similar to what has been observed for antral follicle count (AFC), large interindividual variation exists for AMH levels. Ethnicity may contribute to this variation and should be taken into account when interpreting AMH values.

Although peak AMH levels at age 25 years were higher in Chinese women compared with European women, the age-related decline in Chinese women was greater, leading to 28% and 80% lower AMH levels at ages 30 and 45 years, respectively. Additionally, African American women appeared to have lower serum AMH levels compared with White women but with a slower age-dependent decline.

### Comparing anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as predictors of ovarian function [^117NwNzX]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

We compared the predictive values of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and baseline FSH with respect to IVF cycle outcomes based on oocyte numbers retrieved and the number of clinical pregnancies established. In 76 IVF cycles investigated, AMH was clearly superior in predicting IVF outcomes in comparison with FSH.

### Serum anti-mullerian hormone concentrations are not altered by acute administration of follicle stimulating hormone in polycystic ovary syndrome and normal women [^116Gsee5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

In the human ovary, expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is detected primarily in granulosa cells of preantral and small antral follicles. This finding is consistent with the tight correlation between circulating AMH levels and the number of small antral follicles (2–5 mm) in normal and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women. In addition, the greater follicle count in PCOS is mirrored by significantly higher serum AMH levels compared with those of normal women. Despite the utility of AMH measurements in evaluating ovarian physiology and function, the regulation of AMH remains poorly understood.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine whether gonadotropins acutely regulate serum AMH in women with PCOS and normal women.

- **Design**: We conducted a prospective study to compare ovarian responses to FSH in two groups of women.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in a General Clinical Research Center in a tertiary academic medical center.

- **Patients**: Women with PCOS (age 18–35 years; n = 16) and normal ovulatory controls (age 18–35 years; n = 11) were recruited for the study.

- **Interventions**: Serum samples were measured over a 24-hour period after an IV injection of recombinant human FSH (150 IU).

- **Main outcome measure(s)**: Serum AMH responses after FSH administration were measured.

- **Results**: Basal serum AMH levels were markedly increased in women with PCOS compared with levels observed in normal women. After FSH injection, PCOS women failed to demonstrate changes in circulating AMH over 24 hours. A similar lack of alteration in serum AMH was observed in normal women.

### Genome-wide association study identifies common and low-frequency variants at the AMH gene locus that strongly predict serum AMH levels in males [^111RYKVj]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The gonadal hormone anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is an essential messenger of sexual differentiation. In the male fetus, AMH results in involution of the Müllerian ducts, allowing Wolffian ducts to develop into the male reproductive tract under the influence of testosterone. In the female fetus, the absence of AMH allows the Müllerian ducts to differentiate into uterine-fallopian internal reproductive structures. Pathological disruption of AMH activity in XY karyotype males leads to the persistent Müllerian duct syndrome, a rare condition in which atypical development of the uterus and sometimes other Müllerian structures occurs. Rare mutations underlying this autosomal recessive disorder have been mapped to the AMH protein-encoding gene (AMH) and its receptor (AMHR2); however, approximately 15% of cases are idiopathic.

In recent years, the development of sensitive assays for AMH has enabled many studies of the role of postnatal AMH levels, which are approximately tenfold lower than in the fetus, as a gonadal marker in both sexes. In pre-pubertal boys, the measurement of serum AMH is performed in clinical settings as a reliable indicator of functional testes; its absence supports the diagnosis of primary hypogonadism. In women, serum AMH has emerged as the most robust circulating biomarker of reproductive lifespan. Produced by ovarian granulosa cells, AMH levels are highly correlated with ovarian primordial follicle number and levels gradually decline with age until becoming undetectable about five years before menopause when the follicle stock is depleted.

### Paediatric anti-Müllerian hormone measurement: Male and female reference intervals established using the automated Beckman Coulter Access AMH assay [^112b9uy7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Anti‐Müllerian Hormone (AMH), a dimeric glycoprotein, is a member of the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) family of cytokines, which plays an essential role in the normal differentiation of reproductive structures. In males, AMH is produced by Sertoli cells from the 7th week of gestation and plays an important role in the foetus, triggering the involution of Müllerian ducts and allowing for testicular development. In females, by contrast, AMH is produced by ovarian granulosa cells of antral and pre‐antral follicles from the 36th week of gestation and plays a role in the control of ovarian follicle growth.

Male AMH is high at birth and persists at an elevated level postnatally until puberty. Although the onset and continued basal expression of foetal male AMH is gonadotropin-independent, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) stimulates testicular Sertoli cell proliferation, up-regulating AMH transcription. However, with the onset of puberty, the increased intratesticular production of androgens, along with the expression of the Sertoli cell androgen receptor, overcomes the stimulatory effect of FSH on AMH production, leading to the downregulation of AMH. In females, AMH levels rise through infancy, increase at puberty, and then remain relatively stable until the third decade of life.

The differing expression of AMH between males and females during childhood makes AMH a valuable marker of gonadal function in paediatric reproductive disorders. One of the main clinical uses of AMH in paediatrics is as a marker for the presence of testicular tissue.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone variability and its implications for the number of oocytes retrieved following individualized dosing with follitropin delta [^116MTHbX]. Clinical endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

The stability of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) across and between menstrual cycles has been the subject of debate. The objective of this analysis was to study the inter- and intra-cycle variability in repeated measurements and assess the impact on an individualized gonadotropin dosing algorithm and predicted oocyte yield.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis of repeat AMH measures from a randomized controlled trial.

- **Patients**: A total of 1326 women aged 18–40 years.

- **Measurements**: Serum AMH levels at screening and at cycle days 2–3 in up to three ovarian stimulation cycles. AMH variability and its impact on gonadotropin dose and the predicted number of oocytes.

Repeat serum AMH measurements were strongly correlated within individual women (correlation coefficient 0.92). AMH exhibited limited within-subject variation (coefficient of variation 23%), a small time-related decline (mean 6% decrease/year), but no systematic variation across the menstrual cycle. Irrespective of whether the AMH screening value or the AMH at the initiation of ovarian stimulation was used, for women with an AMH level < 15 pmol/L, 93% would receive the same gonadotropin dose and attain an identical number of oocytes in 97% of cases. For women with an AMH level ≥ 15 pmol/L, 80% would receive an individualized dose within ± 1.5 μg, and 90% would attain ± 1 oocyte.

In conclusion, AMH variability had limited impact on individualized gonadotropin dosing, with 95% of women predicted to obtain an oocyte yield that does not vary beyond 1 oocyte count, irrespective of whether a random or early follicular AMH value is used.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^1138Acsi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Although the study by Ramezani Tehrani et al. did not specifically analyze the prediction of early menopause, the authors showed that the predictive added value of an AMH decline rate was consistent when analyzing women younger or older than age 40 years. Based on their model, women with an AMH value of 0.1 ng/mL at age 30 years have a predicted median age of menopause of 43.18 (37.56–46.33) years with a fifth percentile AMH decline rate, while with a 95th percentile decline rate, this is predicted at 33.63 (29.25–36.08) years. Similar to the age of menopause, in the statistical models by de Kat et al, an AMH decline rate did not improve the prediction of early menopause. In fact, in women younger than age 30 years, AMH levels may actually underestimate the risk of early menopause. While this outcome seems to contradict the studies discussed above, when validated, it may have clinical consequences since women of this age category may deliberate whether or not to delay childbearing.

Based on studies, the predictive value of serum AMH for the age of menopause remains controversial. The majority of these studies have analyzed different age ranges, duration of follow-up, and AMH assays, making direct comparison of studies difficult. It also remains unclear whether results obtained in regularly cycling women can be translated to infertile women, in whom the ovarian reserve may be compromised. The potential impact of ethnicity on AMH decline rates also has not been analyzed in much detail. Thus, validation studies that incorporate additional variables are required.

### Serum anti-müllerian hormone levels in healthy females: a nomogram ranging from infancy to adulthood [^114Ct8Kj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is an accurate marker of ovarian reserve, though sufficiently large sets of normative data from infancy to the end of reproductive life are scarce. This study assessed serum AMH levels in healthy females. In 804 healthy females, ranging from infancy until the end of the reproductive period, serum AMH levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunometric assay. All adults had regular menstrual cycles, and the majority was proven fertile, with none having used oral contraceptive pills prior to study inclusion.

In the total cohort, AMH was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.24; P < 0.001). The age at which the maximum AMH value was attained was 15.8 years. In girls younger than 15.8 years, serum AMH and age were positively correlated (r = +0.18; P = 0.007). Thereafter, AMH levels remained stable (r = -0.33; P = 0.66), whereas from the age of 25.0 years onward, an inverse correlation between AMH and age (r = -0.47; P < 0.001) was observed. At any given age, considerable interindividual differences in serum AMH levels were observed.

During infancy, AMH levels increase, whereas during adolescence, there is a plateau until the age of 25 years. From the age of 25 years onward, serum AMH levels correlate inversely with age, implying that AMH is applicable as a marker of ovarian reserve only in women 25 years old and older. Our nomogram may facilitate counseling women on their reproductive potential.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^11741i9X]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

AMH concentrations from this population have previously been reported for nested cross-sectional cohorts of girls in infancy, mid-childhood, puberty, and adolescence. The selection of girls for AMH analyses in previous studies from this cohort is briefly described. In 2010, to establish a reliable reference range of AMH concentrations, approximately 50 girls from each age group were randomly selected for AMH analyses due to funding restrictions. In 2014, a nested cohort of 121 girls examined at infancy and mid-childhood were randomly invited to participate in a substudy of pubertal examinations, including transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In 2019, all adolescents previously participating in the study were invited for examination, including TAUS.

All girls with at least two available AMH measurements were included in the present study. No girls were excluded due to age. Data from visits at which adolescents were on hormonal contraception were excluded from all analyses, including hormones as well as ovarian morphology (n = 61). AMH from all time points, including three examinations during puberty, were included to evaluate the intraindividual variation of AMH. To evaluate correlations between AMH at different time points, we included data from infancy (median age 0.3 years), mid-childhood (7.2 years), the first examination in puberty (11.3 years), and adolescence (15.9 years). The total number of AMH samples was 1,183; the total number of girls was n = 437; paired AMH samples included infancy to mid-childhood (n = 183), infancy to puberty (n = 212), and infancy to adolescence.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^115jRZhb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of small, growing follicles in the ovary. Serum AMH levels strongly correlate with the number of growing follicles and have received increasing attention as a marker for ovarian reserve. This review summarizes recent findings and limitations in the application of serum AMH in ovarian reserve assessment.

A PubMed search was conducted to find recent literature on the measurements and use of serum AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Serum AMH levels are measured to assess the "functional ovarian reserve", a term that is preferred over "ovarian reserve", since AMH levels reflect the pool of growing follicles that potentially can ovulate. Serum AMH levels are used in individualized follicle-stimulating hormone dosing protocols and may predict the risk of poor response or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but they have limited value in predicting ongoing pregnancy. Serum AMH levels are studied to predict the natural or disease-related age of menopause. Studies show that the age-dependent decline rates of AMH vary among women. The generalized implementation of serum AMH measurement has also led to an increase in diagnostic assays, including automated assays. However, direct comparison of results remains problematic.

- **Conclusion**: Serum AMH remains the preferred ovarian reserve marker. However, the lack of an international standard for AMH limits comparison between AMH assays. Furthermore, little is known about endogenous and exogenous factors that influence these measurements.

### Defining reference ranges for serum anti-Müllerian hormone on a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men highlights new potential physiological functions of AMH on FSH secretion and sperm motility [^113BLdqr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

AMH measurement is currently used in pediatric endocrinology for diagnostic purposes. However, the poor understanding of AMH function in adult men, combined with the lack of reliable reference ranges for circulating AMH levels in normozoospermic adult men, has prevented the use of AMH measurement in adulthood for clinical purposes. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed blood levels of AMH and AMH/tT values in a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men.

We first reported the reference range for serum AMH concentrations and AMH/tT values in normozoospermic adult men. Second, we studied the relationship between serum AMH and both reproductive hormones and semen parameters.

- **The reference range for serum AMH concentrations and AMH/tT values**: Interestingly, serum AMH concentrations were negatively correlated with age in normozoospermic adult men. In our study, the normal range for AMH serum concentrations was from 18.1 to 90.9 pmol/L for individuals between 20 and 39 years and from 12.3 to 87.6 pmol/L for those over 39 years. In 2010, Aksglaede et al. reported a reference range for serum AMH levels (13–98 pmol/L) in a cohort of 150 adult men from the general population aged between 21.6 and 64.4 years. In the latter study, exhaustive andrological phenotyping, including inhibin B measurement and the evaluation of spermatic parameters, was not performed. Their AMH assay was also less sensitive than the one used in our study. We have also reported for the first time the reference range for blood AMH/tT (20–39 years of age: 0.45–3.44 pmol/L; > 39 years of age: 0.36–3.

### AMH concentrations in infancy and mid-childhood predict ovarian activity in adolescence: A long-term longitudinal study of healthy girls [^113JxA47]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in small growing ovarian follicles. In adult women, serum concentrations of AMH reflect the ovarian reserve of resting primordial follicles, and low AMH is associated with the risk of early menopause, whereas patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have elevated AMH. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the individual tracking of serum AMH concentrations, as well as whether AMH in early childhood reflects ovarian activity in adolescence.

- **Methods**: In this large longitudinal study of healthy girls, participants were examined from infancy to adolescence (1997–2019). The study included physical examinations, assessment of serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (in infancy, median age 0.3 years; mid-childhood, 7.2 years; puberty, 11.3 years; and adolescence, 15.9 years), transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS, puberty and adolescence), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, puberty) of the ovaries.

- **Findings**: Each girl maintained her relative AMH concentration (expressed as standard deviation (SD) scores) over time; the mean variation of individual age-adjusted AMH concentrations was 0.56 ± 0.31 SD. Serum concentrations of AMH in adolescence correlated with AMH in infancy and childhood (infancy: r = 0.347; mid-childhood: r = 0.637; puberty: r = 0.675, all p < 0.001). AMH correlated negatively with FSH concentrations in all age groups (infancy: r = -0.645, p < 0.001; mid-childhood: r = -0.222, p < 0.001; puberty: r = -0.354, p < 0.001; adolescence: n = 275, r = -0.175, p = 0.004).

### Serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone as a marker of ovarian function in 926 healthy females from birth to adulthood and in 172 Turner syndrome patients [^112Visb8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). High credibility.

In adult women, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is related to the ovarian follicle pool, but little is known about AMH in girls. The objective of the study was to provide a reference range for AMH in girls and adolescents and to evaluate AMH as a marker of ovarian function. The study was conducted at a tertiary referral center for pediatric endocrinology.

- **Main outcome measures**: We measured AMH in 926 healthy females (longitudinal values during infancy) as well as in 172 Turner syndrome (TS) patients according to age, karyotype (A: 45, X; B: miscellaneous karyotypes; C: 45, X/46, XX), and ovarian function (1: absent puberty; 2: cessation of ovarian function; 3: ongoing ovarian function).

- **Results**: AMH was undetectable in 54% (38 of 71) of cord blood samples (< 2; < 2–15 pmol/liter) (median; 2.5th to 97.5th percentile) and increased in all (37 of 37) infants from birth to 3 months (15; 4.5–29.5 pmol/liter). From age 8 to 25 years, AMH levels were stable (19.9; 4.7–60.1 pmol/liter), with the lower level of the reference range clearly above the detection limit. AMH levels were associated with TS-karyotype groups (median A vs. B: < 2 vs. 3 pmol/liter, P = 0.044; B vs. C: 3 vs. 16 pmol/liter, P < 0.001) as well as with ovarian function (absent puberty vs. cessation of ovarian function: < 2 vs. 6 pmol/liter, P = 0.004; cessation of ovarian function vs. ongoing ovarian function: 6 vs. 14 pmol/liter, P = 0.001). As a screening test of premature ovarian failure in TS, the sensitivity and specificity of AMH less than 8 pmol/liter was 96 and 86%, respectively.

### Anti-müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: Update on assessing ovarian function [^116aXZa4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

To properly interpret serum AMH levels, knowledge of factors that influence AMH levels is crucial. The majority of women of reproductive age use a type of hormonal contraceptive (HC); however, reported effects of HC use on serum AMH levels are conflicting. A systematic review by Amer et al, reassessing 15 studies, concluded that serum AMH levels in normoovulatory women decreased when HC was used for at least a year; this effect was reversible in most studies after discontinuation of HC use. The extent of decline ranged from 14% to 55%, which could be explained by differences in type of HC use, duration of use, timing of AMH measurement during the menstrual cycle, and AMH assays used.

Indeed, Landersoe et al. showed in a retrospective study that serum AMH levels were 30% to 40% lower in women using the oral contraceptive or the progesterone-only pill, while women using an intrauterine device observed a decrease of only 17%. Both studies reported a decline in AFC, strongly suggesting that the change in serum AMH levels caused by HC use results from a change in follicle dynamics rather than a direct effect on AMH gene regulation. However, a direct effect of an altered gonadotropin and sex steroid milieu on AMH expression cannot be ruled out.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone serum levels predict response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation but not embryo quality or pregnancy outcome in oocyte donation [^115qHWrz]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to evaluate the value of basal serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as a predictor of ovarian response and pregnancy outcome in a donor egg program. The study showed that AMH was superior to other biomarkers of ovarian reserve in predicting low and high response in young women selected as oocyte donors, but it was not predictive of embryo morphology or pregnancy outcome in the recipient population.

### Utility of ovarian reserve screening with anti-Müllerian hormone for reproductive age women deferring pregnancy [^11477tFj]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian reserve (OR) testing with serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can provide information about a woman's fertility potential. The aim of this study was to assess interest and knowledge about OR testing and investigate the utility of measuring AMH in women of reproductive age deferring pregnancy.

- **Methods**: Women aged 27–37 years currently delaying childbearing were invited to take a survey regarding attitudes and knowledge about OR testing before and after an AMH measurement with an explanation of their results.

- **Results**: Of 121 women who took the pre-test survey, 96% believed OR testing was beneficial. The median AMH of the 97 women who underwent testing was 3.3ng/mL (IQR 1.9–5.4ng/mL). Nineteen percent of women had AMH < 10th percentile for age and 3% had an undetectable AMH. Although 83% of these women were using hormonal contraception, none had known risk factors for diminished ovarian reserve. Seventy-eight percent of women with low AMH levels for age planned to seek fertility preservation or pregnancy, while those with AMH levels within established age nomograms were reassured. On the post-test survey, 100% reported benefit in knowing their AMH level. Follow-up testing, 6–8 months after the initial measurement, showed stable AMH levels for most participants.

- **Conclusions**: Women are interested in OR testing. Most women will be reassured by knowing their AMH level, whereas those with a lower AMH can be counseled on fertility preservation options or may attempt pregnancy earlier.

### Individualized predictions of time to menopause using multiple measurements of antimüllerian hormone [^114AoZty]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

The ability of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) to predict age at menopause has been reported in several studies, and a decrease in AMH level has been found to increase the probability of menopause. The rate of decline varies among women, and there is also a variability of decline between women's cycles. As a result, individualized evaluation is required to accurately predict the time of menopause. To this end, we have used the AMH trajectories of individual women to predict each one's age at menopause.

- **Methods**: From a cohort study, 266 women (ages 20–50 years) who had regular and predictable menstrual cycles at the initiation of the study were randomly selected from among 1,265 women for multiple AMH measurements. Participants were visited at approximately 3-year intervals and followed for an average of 6.5 years. Individual likelihood of menopause was predicted by fitting the shared random-effects joint model to the baseline covariates and the specific AMH trajectory of each woman.

- **Results**: In total, 23.7% of the women reached menopause during the follow-up period. The estimated mean (SD) AMH concentration at the time of menopause was 0.05 ng/mL (0.06 ng/mL), compared with 1.36 ng/mL (1.85 ng/mL) for those with a regular menstrual cycle at their last assessment. The decline rate in the AMH level varied among age groups, and age was a significant prognostic factor for AMH level (P < 0.001). Adjusting for age and body mass index, each woman had her own specific AMH trajectory. Lower AMH and older age had significant effects on the onset of menopause.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in adolescence in relation to long-term follow-up for presence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116Y2QMS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) has been identified as an important factor involved in ovarian function. The use of AMH as a marker for ovarian reserve has gained more attention. AMH is released from ovarian granulosa cells, resulting in serum levels that are proportional to the number of early developing follicles. Previous studies have consistently shown that serum AMH levels are 2- to 4-fold increased in adult women with PCOS, indicating its potential relevance in PCOS diagnosis. Limited data are available on normal values of AMH in adolescents.

Irregular menstrual cycles during puberty are considered physiologic. However, oligo- or secondary amenorrhea is persistent into young adulthood in about half of the cases and is then recognized as a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The diagnosis of PCOS in adults is well-defined by the Rotterdam criteria: oligo- or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovaries.

Defining appropriate diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescence remains a challenge. Diagnostic issues arise first from the impropriety of transvaginal ultrasound in virgins and from the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in these youngsters. Additionally, interpreting clinical and biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism is more difficult in adolescents. Finally, the most important diagnostic issues result from physiological menstrual irregularities in the postmenarchal period.

### Peripubertal changes in circulating antimüllerian hormone levels in girls [^115iCUCG]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Our cross-sectional finding that antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels were approximately 25% lower in pubertal compared to prepubertal girls is consistent with our pilot longitudinal data showing a 20% reduction in AMH levels between ages 9 and 11 years and confirms other recent longitudinal data. The onset of puberty is characterized in the ovary by the progression of small antral follicles to antral follicles, which do not produce AMH, and this could contribute to the reduction in circulating AMH levels. Furthermore, Kelsey et al. recently estimated that the rate of primordial follicle recruitment peaks during adolescence and then declines; our findings refine the timing of such decline in follicle recruitment to the onset of puberty.

In contrast to AMH, inhibin B levels increased by 49% between ages 7 and 9 years and increased by a further 76% between ages 9 and 11 years. We consider that the divergence between AMH and inhibin B levels beyond age 9 years reflects the falling rate of primordial follicle recruitment as FSH-stimulated follicle activity increases with maturation of the pituitary-gonadal axis.

Associations between AMH levels at 8 years and age at menarche, and between baseline inhibin B levels and later changes in AMH, suggest that prepubertal ovarian follicle activity may predict the timing of pubertal onset and completion. However, this needs to be confirmed in larger longitudinal studies, ideally with the use of objective assessments of pubertal timing. Longer follow-up is needed to show whether the close intraindividual tracking in AMH levels continues over time.

### Clinical utility of Anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^115W2sdL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In isolated Leydig cell disorders, AMH was normal or high due to increased FSH effect but a lack of testosterone effect. Precocious puberty in males, including central precocious puberty and gonadotropin-independent forms such as familial male-limited precocious puberty, was associated with low AMH secretion for age due to a rise in intratesticular testosterone. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue therapy normalizes AMH to prepubertal values, suggesting that Sertoli cell maturation in early puberty may be reversible. AMH could potentially serve as an additional tool for diagnosing precocious puberty and assessing treatment efficacy, although it is not of routine clinical utility compared to LH/testosterone.

In females, AMH was normal in most patients with acquired multiple pituitary hormone deficiency but low in severe congenital hypopituitarism, reflective of gonadotropin deficiency. AMH has been shown to be lower in premature thelarche in females aged 1 to 3 years and is negatively correlated with FSH compared to age-matched controls. In girls with precocious puberty, AMH levels did not differ from healthy age-matched controls at baseline but were suppressed compared to pretreatment levels with GnRH analogue therapy and returned to pretreatment levels 6 months after discontinuation of treatment. The authors speculated that the suppression of AMH was consistent with the gonadotropin dependence of AMH secretion. However, the normal AMH levels and negative correlation with FSH at baseline were thought to be due to an individual set point for the pituitary-gonadal feedback loop.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^116BAZBP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

AMH as a marker of ovarian reserve and fertility is an important consideration. Ovarian reserve, as defined by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, represents the number of oocytes remaining in the ovary or oocyte quantity. Ovarian reserve tests include both ultrasound imaging and biochemical tests. Antral follicle count (AFC), a marker of ovarian reserve, is traditionally performed in the early follicular phase by transvaginal ultrasound, which precludes its use in prepubertal children as well as postmenarchal adolescents who do not tolerate transvaginal imaging. Although transabdominal AFC measurements have been performed in both prepubertal and pubertal children, AMH was only moderately correlated to AFC in premenarchal girls.

AMH is a sensitive biochemical marker of ovarian reserve and may be more sensitive when compared to early follicular phase FSH and estradiol levels. The ideal timing of AMH measurement depends on whether serum AMH levels vary throughout the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Numerous studies have investigated AMH variations during the menstrual cycle, and some have reported only mild intra- and intercycle fluctuations of AMH secretion, while others have reported a peak AMH level in the mid-follicular phase with a subsequent decrease in the luteal phase. However, these fluctuations are not large enough to warrant a recommendation of timed AMH measurement on specific menstrual cycle days or phases. Although AMH has the ability to predict ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation and oocyte yield in assisted reproductive technologies.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels in adolescence in relation to long-term follow-up for presence of polycystic ovary syndrome [^116Xjxjd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) measured in adolescence as a biomarker for the prediction of adult polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is doubtful but not substantiated.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether serum AMH levels and other PCOS-associated features in adolescence can predict the presence of PCOS in adulthood.

- **Design and setting**: A long-term follow-up study based on a unique adolescent study on menstrual irregularities performed between 1990 and 1997.

- **Participants and interventions**: AMH was assayed in 271 adolescent girls. Data on PCOS features were combined with AMH levels. In 160 of the 271 (59%) participants, information was collected in adulthood about their menstrual cycle pattern and the presence of PCOS features by questionnaire two decades after the initial study.

- **Results**: AMH was higher in adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea compared with girls with regular cycles, median (interquartile range): 4.6 (3.1–7.5) versus 2.6 (1.7–3.8) μg/L (P < 0.001). Women with PCOS in adulthood had a higher median adolescent AMH of 6.0 compared with 2.5 μg/L in the non-PCOS group (P < 0.001). AMH in adolescence showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for PCOS in adulthood of 0.78. In adolescent girls with oligomenorrhea, the proportion developing PCOS in adulthood was 22.5% (95% CI, 12.4–37.4) against 5.1% (95% CI, 2.1–12.0) in girls with a regular cycle (P = 0.005). Given adolescent oligomenorrhea, adding high AMH as a factor to predict adult PCOS or adult oligomenorrhea was of no value.

- **Conclusions**: Adolescent AMH, either alone or adjuvant to adolescent oligomenorrhea.

### Anti-müllerian hormone levels in the spontaneous menstrual cycle do not show substantial fluctuation [^112CcVUt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a quantitative marker for ovarian reserve, has been suggested to be independent of the classical endocrine fluctuations of the menstrual cycle.

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to determine whether AMH levels are constant throughout the menstrual cycle, compared with those of FSH, LH, and estradiol.

- **Design/patients**: Frequent blood sampling was performed in 44 fertile, regularly cycling, female volunteers during one full menstrual cycle.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a university hospital.

- **Main outcome measures**: AMH, FSH, LH, and estradiol measurements were allocated to one of seven cycle phases, and a multilevel analysis was performed. Consistent fluctuation patterns were tested by fitting sine patterns to the data. Finally, the frequency in which randomly selected individual samples would remain in one of five preset level categories (quintiles) for each of the variables was studied.

- **Results**: A sine pattern fitted to the AMH data was not statistically significant (P = 0.40). In contrast, sine patterns for FSH, LH, and estradiol were highly significant. Comparing the seven cycle phases, no significant differences could be observed between phase-specific AMH levels (P = 0.06). Repeated selection of AMH samples for each individual showed that in 71.5% of selections, AMH values remained in the same quintile, whereas in 27.9% values fell in an adjacent quintile.

- **Conclusions**: AMH levels measured through a full menstrual cycle did not show consistent fluctuation patterns in contrast to levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.

### Anti-müllerian hormone is a promising predictor for the occurrence of the menopausal transition [^112LMuHG]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Age at menopause and age at the start of the preceding period of cycle irregularity, termed the menopausal transition, show considerable individual variation. In this study, we explored several markers for their ability to predict the occurrence of the transition to menopause.

A group of 81 normal women, aged between 25 and 46 years, visited the clinic twice (at T1 and T2) with an average interval of 4 years. All participants had a regular menstrual cycle pattern at T1. At T1, levels of anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), inhibin B, and estradiol (E2) were measured, and an antral follicle count (AFC) was conducted during the early follicular phase. By T2, information regarding cycle length and variability was obtained. The menopause transition was defined as a mean cycle length less than 21 days or more than 35 days, or as a mean cycle length of 21 to 35 days with the next cycle not predictable within 7 days during the last half-year. A logistic regression analysis was performed with menopause transition as the outcome measure, and the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC AUC) was calculated as a measure of predictive accuracy.

In 14 volunteers, the cycle had become irregular at T2. Compared with women with regular cycles at T2, these women were significantly older (median 44.7 vs. 39.8 years, P < 0.001) and showed significant differences in AFC, AMH, FSH, and inhibin B levels assessed at T1. All parameters, except E2, were significantly associated with the occurrence of cycle irregularity; AMH, AFC, and age demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy.

### Paediatric anti-Müllerian hormone measurement: Male and female reference intervals established using the automated Beckman Coulter Access AMH assay [^115zv4cn]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Commercial assays for the measurement of circulating anti‐Müllerian hormone (AMH) have been available for many years. The two most commonly used first‐generation enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for AMH were the Diagnostic Systems Laboratories (DSL) AMH ELISA and the Immunotech (IOT) AMH ELISA, with the IOT kit consistently reporting statistically significant higher values than the DSL kit. In 2010, Beckman Coulter combined these technologies to produce a second‐generation (Gen II) AMH ELISA. This assay was subsequently modified to minimize interference from complement and has recently been adapted for the Beckman Access automated platform.

Whilst AMH measurement may be useful in the initial evaluation of an infant with a suspected DSD, age‐specific reference intervals are required in order to interpret results. Previous studies have investigated AMH concentration in the male and female paediatric population from 0 to 18 years. However, these have all been carried out using the now redundant first‐generation AMH protocols, bringing the results into question due to the reported issues with standardization of these assays. Further studies using the second generation of AMH assays have considered only the male or female population, therefore, limiting the use of the reference intervals in diagnosis of DSD as there is limited information concerning the discrimination between the different genders.

The aim of our study was to improve the clinical utility of plasma AMH measurement by determining robust reference intervals for male and female populations.

### Clinical utility of anti-Mullerian hormone in pediatrics [^117PFSv6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) was originally described in the context of sexual differentiation in the male fetus but has gained prominence now as a marker of ovarian reserve and fertility in females. In this mini-review, we offer an updated synopsis on AMH and its clinical utility in pediatric patients.

- **Design and results**: A systematic search was undertaken for studies related to the physiology of AMH, normative data, and its clinical role in pediatrics. In males, AMH, secreted by Sertoli cells, is found at high levels prenatally and throughout childhood and declines with progression through puberty to overlap with levels in females. Thus, serum AMH has clinical utility as a marker of testicular tissue in males with differences in sexual development and cryptorchidism and in the evaluation of persistent Mullerian duct syndrome. In females, serum AMH has been used as a predictive marker of ovarian reserve and fertility, but prepubertal and adolescent AMH assessments need to be interpreted cautiously. AMH is also a marker of tumor burden, progression, and recurrence in germ cell tumors of the ovary.

- **Conclusions**: AMH has widespread clinical diagnostic utility in pediatrics, but interpretation is often challenging and should be undertaken in the context of not only age and sex but also the developmental and pubertal stage of the child. Nonstandardized assays necessitate the need for assay-specific normative data. The recognition of the role of AMH beyond gonadal development and maturation may usher in novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications that would further expand its utility.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone reflects the severity of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112W2ypr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and the severity of the phenotype of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and whether AMH can act as a diagnostic marker for PCOS.

- **Design**: A prospective diagnostic utility study of AMH as a marker of PCOS.

- **Patients**: A consecutive series of women presenting to a tertiary infertility clinic (n = 164) plus a second series of women prepared for assisted conception treatments (n = 89) recruited between June 2012 and May 2013.

- **Measurements**: Polycystic ovary syndrome was diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. AMH was measured using the Generation II assay (Beckman Coulter). The diagnostic utility of AMH was established using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Cut-off values for the individual features of PCOS are proposed.

- **Results**: There was a significant difference in serum AMH concentration in women with normal ovaries (13.2 pmol/l), polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) alone (37.8 pmol/l), and PCOS (53.2 pmol/l). Follicle number, increasing cycle length, and evidence of hyperandrogenism were all independently associated with serum AMH concentration (P < 0.01). AMH was significantly affected by the different phenotypic presentations of PCOS, with those with all components (PCOM, HA, and OA) having the highest mean value (72.7 pmol/l, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Serum AMH has the capacity to act as a diagnostic test for PCOS. Moreover, since its value rises with the more marked phenotypes, different cut-off values need to be used to differentiate those patients.

### Baseline inhibin B and anti-Mullerian hormone measurements for diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in boys with delayed puberty [^113ZrGCc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) in boys with delayed puberty is challenging, as is the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in boys with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). However, the therapeutic choices for puberty induction depend on accurate diagnosis and may influence future fertility.

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of baseline inhibin B (INHB) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) measurements to discriminate HH from constitutional delay of puberty (CDP). Both hormones are produced by Sertoli cells upon FSH stimulation, and prepubertal AMH levels are high, reflecting Sertoli cell integrity.

We studied 82 boys aged 14 to 18 years with pubertal delay: 16 had IHH, 15 had congenital HH within CPHD, and 51 had CDP, as confirmed by follow-up. Subjects were at genital stage 1 (testis volume < 3 ml; 9 IHH, 7 CPHD, and 23 CDP) or early stage 2 (testis volume, 3–6 ml; 7 IHH, 8 CPHD, and 28 CDP).

Age and testis volume were similar across the three groups. Compared with CDP subjects, those with IHH and CPHD had lower INHB, testosterone, FSH, and LH concentrations (P < 0.05), while AMH concentration was lower only in IHH and CPHD subjects with genital stage 1, likely reflecting a smaller pool of Sertoli cells in profound HH. In IHH and CPHD boys with genital stage 1, sensitivity and specificity were 100% for an INHB concentration of 35 pg/ml or less. In IHH and CPHD boys with genital stage 2, sensitivities were 86% and 80%, whereas specificities were 92% and 88%, respectively.
