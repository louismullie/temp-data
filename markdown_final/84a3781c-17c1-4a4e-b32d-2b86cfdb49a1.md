## Question

This 40-year-old woman presented, with 15 years of slowly progressive droopy eyelids and double vision. She carries a diagnosis card of myasthenia gravis but denies, any fluctuation in her symptoms throughout the day. She has for the past 2 years developed mild dysphagia. She has been treated with pyridostigmine and also with prednisone with no benefit. Past edrophonium chloride test; repetitive stimulation, and acetylcholine receptor antibody studies have been normal. Creatine kinase is mildly elevated at 290, and EMG needle examination is normal.

What is the diagnosis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most likely diagnosis is for a 40-year-old woman with chronic ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia, with nonfluctuating symptoms, no benefit from pyridostigmine or prednisone, and negative myasthenia gravis studies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and whether it fits myasthenia gravis or an alternative neuromuscular disorder. Then, I should verify the negative MG workup and whether it truly excludes MG. Next, I will consider key mimics such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and myotonic dystrophy. After that, I need to check which diagnostic test would be most efficient to confirm the leading alternative diagnosis. Finally, I will outline management implications and summarize the most likely diagnosis with supporting evidence and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The patient has a 15-year history of slowly progressive bilateral ptosis and diplopia with later-onset dysphagia, and she denies fluctuation or diurnal variation; this chronology and pattern are atypical for autoimmune myasthenia gravis, which classically presents with fatigable, fluctuating weakness and often shows ocular symptoms early with variability over the day, whereas a fixed, slowly progressive extraocular and bulbar pattern raises concern for a myopathy rather than a neuromuscular junction disorder [^116Xanzj].

> Wait, let me verify the MG workup before I jump ahead. Negative edrophonium testing, normal repetitive nerve stimulation, and negative acetylcholine receptor antibodies substantially decrease the likelihood of MG; in fact, a negative edrophonium test has a negative likelihood ratio around 0.11, and a normal RNS similarly reduces the probability of MG, though I should remember that seronegative MG exists and that single-fiber EMG can be more sensitive than RNS in ocular MG, so I should not overstate exclusion based on these tests alone [^112SgANq].

> Hold on, I should also check the treatment response as a diagnostic clue. Lack of benefit from pyridostigmine and prednisone further argues against autoimmune MG, because most MG patients improve symptomatically with acetylcholinesterase inhibition and many respond to immunosuppression; persistent nonresponse after adequate trials pushes me to reconsider the diagnosis rather than escalating immunotherapy indefinitely [^112bo7kF] [^113ssjRj].

> Next, I should review the laboratory data. A mildly elevated creatine kinase around 290 IU/L is not diagnostic but is compatible with a chronic myopathy; by contrast, CK is typically normal in MG, so this biochemical signal nudges me toward a myopathic process rather than a pure neuromuscular junction disease, although I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a modest CK elevation in isolation [^113joitC].

> Let me consider oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy as the leading alternative. OPMD classically presents in adulthood with slowly progressive bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, and later proximal limb weakness, often with mildly elevated CK and a myopathic pattern on EMG; importantly, OPMD is frequently misdiagnosed as seronegative MG because of overlapping ocular and bulbar features, and there are documented cases of OPMD coexisting with AChR antibody positivity, which can confound the picture and delay the correct diagnosis [^112UxcAX] [^113s4C9j] [^114njtyB].

> But wait, what if this is mitochondrial disease such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. CPEO typically causes symmetric ptosis with ophthalmoplegia and can include dysphagia and proximal myopathy; diplopia may be less prominent early due to symmetric involvement and adaptation, and patients can be misdiagnosed as seronegative MG when the phenotype is ocular-predominant, so I should keep mitochondrial etiologies in mind, especially if there is multisystem involvement or a maternal inheritance pattern on family history [^117NZHJi] [^116mdbNz] [^115cPDKi].

> I should also double-check for myotonic dystrophy, even though it is less likely here. DM1 can present with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia and may rarely coexist with MG; however, the absence of clinical myotonia and the normal EMG make DM1 less likely in this case, though I must remember that mild myotonia can be missed on casual examination and that EMG myotonic discharges would be expected if present [^116LvZXt] [^116GHdWE].

> Let me synthesize the competing hypotheses. The combination of fixed, slowly progressive ptosis and diplopia with dysphagia, nonfluctuating course, negative MG serology and RNS, and a modest CK elevation fits best with a genetic myopathy such as OPMD or mitochondrial CPEO, whereas the lack of response to cholinesterase inhibition and steroids further weakens the case for autoimmune MG; I should confirm this with targeted genetic testing rather than empiric immunotherapy escalation [^112UxcAX] [^117NZHJi].

> I will now examine the most efficient confirmatory test. Given the phenotype and the differential of OPMD versus mitochondrial disease, the next best step is PABPN1 genetic testing for OPMD, which is typically due to GCG repeat expansions in PABPN1; if PABPN1 is negative, I should proceed with mitochondrial genome analysis, ideally with muscle tissue when available due to heteroplasmy issues, to evaluate for common mtDNA deletions or nuclear genes causing CPEO, as this sequencing strategy has higher diagnostic yield than peripheral blood alone in suspected mitochondrial myopathy [^112UxcAX] [^114UHZEB] [^115cPDKi].

> Hold on, I should verify management implications before concluding. If OPMD is confirmed, immunosuppression and pyridostigmine should be discontinued to avoid futile treatments and potential harm, and care should pivot to supportive measures for dysphagia and ptosis, including speech and swallowing therapy, dietary modifications, and surgical ptosis repair when indicated; I need to ensure we also screen for aspiration risk and discuss genetic counseling given the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the normal EMG might exclude a myopathy, but I should correct that assumption. A normal EMG does not exclude a chronic myopathy, particularly OPMD or mitochondrial disease, where EMG can be normal early or show only subtle myopathic changes; thus, the normal EMG here does not negate the clinical and biochemical clues pointing toward a genetic myopathy, and it should not delay genetic testing when the phenotype is compelling [^113joitC].

> Final diagnosis and rationale: The most likely diagnosis is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, given the chronic, nonfluctuating ptosis and diplopia with dysphagia, negative MG serology and RNS, lack of response to pyridostigmine and prednisone, and mildly elevated CK; mitochondrial chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia remains a close alternative and should be pursued if PABPN1 testing is negative, with muscle-based mitochondrial genetic testing considered to overcome heteroplasmy limitations [^112UxcAX] [^117NZHJi] [^114UHZEB].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD)** [^112UxcAX], given the chronic, non-fluctuating ptosis and diplopia with dysphagia, normal MG tests, and mild CK elevation [^112UxcAX]. OPMD is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by PABPN1 GCG repeat expansions, typically presenting in adulthood with progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and bulbar weakness; CK is often mildly elevated, and EMG may be normal or show myopathic features [^112UxcAX]. Genetic testing for PABPN1 is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^112UxcAX]. Management is supportive, including ptosis surgery and dysphagia management; immunotherapy is ineffective [^112UxcAX].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for chronic, non-fluctuating ptosis and diplopia with dysphagia includes:

- **Myasthenia gravis (MG)**: Typically presents with fluctuating weakness and positive AChR antibodies or RNS decrement; this patient's normal MG tests and lack of fluctuation make MG unlikely [^111shfos] [^112SgANq].

- **Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)**: Mitochondrial disorder with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia; often associated with systemic features and maternal inheritance [^117NZHJi].

- **Myotonic dystrophy**: Presents with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and distal weakness; EMG typically shows myotonic discharges [^116GHdWE].

- **Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS)**: Early-onset, fatigable weakness with variable response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; genetic testing confirms diagnosis [^111a9KP8].

- **Inflammatory myopathies**: Typically present with proximal weakness, elevated CK, and myopathic EMG; ocular involvement is rare [^112Vx8qp].

---

## Clinical features supporting OPMD

The patient's clinical features strongly suggest OPMD:

- **Ptosis and diplopia**: Chronic, non-fluctuating, progressive ptosis with ophthalmoplegia is characteristic of OPMD [^112UxcAX].

- **Dysphagia**: Bulbar involvement with dysphagia is a hallmark of OPMD [^115KvW6A].

- **Normal MG tests**: Negative edrophonium test, normal RNS, and negative AChR antibodies argue against MG [^112SgANq].

- **Mildly elevated CK**: CK is often mildly elevated in OPMD, consistent with a myopathic process [^112UxcAX].

- **Normal EMG**: EMG may be normal or show mild myopathic features in OPMD [^112UxcAX].

---

## Genetic testing and diagnosis

Genetic testing for PABPN1 GCG repeat expansions is the **diagnostic gold standard** for OPMD [^112UxcAX]. Testing should be offered to the patient and at-risk family members, as OPMD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner [^115KvW6A].

---

## Management

Management of OPMD is supportive and symptomatic:

- **Ptosis correction**: Surgical ptosis repair can improve vision and cosmesis [^112UxcAX].

- **Dysphagia management**: Dietary modifications, speech therapy, and cricopharyngeal myotomy may be considered in severe cases [^112UxcAX].

- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for patients and family members due to autosomal dominant inheritance [^115KvW6A].

Immunotherapy, including corticosteroids and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, is ineffective in OPMD and should be avoided [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's chronic, non-fluctuating ptosis and diplopia with dysphagia, normal MG tests, and mildly elevated CK strongly suggest **oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy** [^112UxcAX]. Genetic testing for PABPN1 mutations will confirm the diagnosis, and management should focus on supportive care and genetic counseling [^112UxcAX].

### Myotonic dystrophy in a female with myasthenia gravis [^116LvZXt]. Pediatric Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The likelihood of coexistence in the same patient of myasthenia gravis and myotonic dystrophy has been estimated at 1 in 40 million. The case of a patient in whom both diagnoses were made is reported here. A 13-year-old girl was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis because of weakness, fluctuating fatigability, and mild difficulty with chewing and swallowing. She had ptosis, with weakness predominantly of her face, arms, and neck. Serum antibodies against acetylcholine receptors were 9.9 nmol/L. She was started on pyridostigmine, with significant clinical improvement, reassuming normal daily activities. Two years later, generalized weakness reappeared and reappraisal of her symptomatology disclosed tongue percussion and hand action myotonia. Molecular genetic analysis disclosed 550 repeats of cytosine-thymidine-guanosine triplets on the DMPK gene. Undiagnosed relatives had expansions ranging from 110 to 1000 repeats. Myotonic dystrophy is considered the most common muscular dystrophy, with highly variable clinical manifestations; mildly affected individuals may escape clinical detection. Myasthenia gravis has an estimated prevalence of 15 per 100,000. No studies on the epidemiology of these diseases have been done in Chile. Although both diseases have specific clinical and laboratory presentations, they share some features in the mode of presentation that may generate difficulty in diagnosis of both entities in the same patient.

Patient 3

The third patient was a 59-year-old woman who was diagnosed with MG with significant diagnostic delay. She was admitted to Neurology ward several times for diplopia, ptosis, dyspnoea, dysphagia, and fatigue, but in the absence of AChR-Ab was initially diagnosed as affected by functional neurological disorder. Her medical history mentioned only Graves' disease. Some clinicians hypothesized a seronegative MG, and she was treated with pyridostigmine and prednisone with a good response on ptosis and diplopia. Due to a finding of thymic residual, she underwent thymectomy in 2019 and was treated with IVIg with clinical benefit. After reduction of the dosage of prednisone, anti-AChR-Abs were detected in three different samples, as well as a neurophysiological confirmation of MG diagnosis was obtained with SFEMG (MGFA IIb). However, after a couple of years she complained of balance difficulties with frequent falls and cognitive impairment associated with spasms. Clinical and neurophysiological examination showed the presence of an exaggerated startle response, increased muscle tone with brisk reflexes, and ataxia. MRI of the brain was unremarkable. Hence, a diagnosis of SPS was confirmed with seropositive anti-GAD Abs in the serum. After a significant response achieved with two cycles of IVIg, she did not benefit from further IVIg cycles. Azathioprine was then started, but it was stopped afterwards for nausea and vomiting. Even Rituximab 1000 mg was started with unsatisfactory response after 6 months.

### Antibodies to AChR, MuSK and VGKC in a patient with myasthenia gravis and morvan's syndrome [^114eDkSL]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 46-year-old woman presented to a local hospital with acute respiratory failure and a 2-year progressive history of fatigue, personality changes, increased sweating, dysphagia with substantial weight loss, dysarthria, and intermittent ptosis and diplopia. Neurological examination showed facial weakness, lingual atrophy and bulbar palsy, which necessitated the use of a feeding tube and ventilatory support. Mild limb weakness with severe muscle atrophy and diffuse muscle twitches were observed. The patient had also developed visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions. Her personal and family medical histories were unremarkable.

Investigations

Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies, repetitive nerve stimulation, electromyogram, blood-cell counts, general chemistry and metabolic function tests, a CT scan, an [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scan, and tests for serum antibodies to acetylcholine receptors, muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, voltage-gated potassium channels, P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and paraneoplastic antigens, were carried out.

Diagnosis

Myasthenia gravis associated with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase, and Morvan's syndrome associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels in the absence of thymoma.

Management

Combined treatment with prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, ciclosporin, and rituximab.

### Bedside testing for myasthenia gravis: the ice-test [^1146sTAP]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented to the acute medical take with a history of droopy eyelids and difficulty swallowing. A diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was suspected from the clinical history. The patient's symptoms were progressive, raising concerns of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory compromise if untreated. Definitive diagnosis of myasthenia gravis relies upon a combination of serological and electrophysiological investigations, the results of which are not immediately available in an acute situation. Bedside tests are therefore of practical clinical importance to enable prompt and effective initiation of treatment, particularly where critical symptoms are present. The ice-test is a straightforward and non-invasive investigation with a high sensitivity for myasthenia gravis and is a useful alternative to edrophonium testing. It is especially helpful in patients with cardiac and respiratory co-morbidities for whom acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated. We describe a case where this simple bedside test successfully expedited the correct treatment and improved patient care.

### Ice pack test: is it obsolete? [^113TSzZD]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmologic signs are the most often presenting symptoms of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), most common being ptosis. However, ptosis may be caused by a variety of non-myasthenic disorders; hence, the distinction between them and myasthenic ptosis is critical. A battery of diagnostic tests are available to establish the diagnosis of MG, all having their pros and cons, some being life threatening. The authors present a case of 40-year-old male who presented to them with progressive weakness and double vision in which they were successful in narrowing the differentials to myasthenia by performing a simple bed side test.

A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented with a 1-year history of horizontal diplopia, bilateral exophthalmos and progressive asymmetrical ophthalmoparesis, with no pupillary dysfunction or ptosis. Within 3months of her initial presentation, she noticed paresis of right eye abduction, followed after 1month with paresis of left eye abduction. Initial investigations revealed positive antiperoxidase antibodies for Graves' disease and positive AChR for myasthenia gravis. MRI of the brain showed increased intensity in bilateral inferior rectus muscles and CT of the chest showed thymic hyperplasia. Treatment with carbimazole and pyridostigmine was started, with complete resolution after 1month.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated myasthenia gravis [^117SXLcP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a wide range of toxicities affecting potentially any organ system stemming from increased activity within the T-cell lineage similar to that observed in autoimmunity.

Case Report

A 57-year-old man with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treatment with combination ICI therapy presented with a history of rapidly progressive diplopia. Neurological examination revealed bilateral fatigable ptosis and asymmetrical ophthalmoplegia. His clinical findings were in keeping with an immune-mediated myasthenia gravis. He was immediately commenced on 1 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone and pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times a day. On day 2 of admission he was given 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins. He made a rapid and full clinical recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Immune-mediated myasthenia gravis is an important toxicity of ICIs. Early recognition and treatment of this presentation may reduce the significant morbidity and mortality associated with it.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^115tWNob]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer pyridostigmine as part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Adjust pyridostigmine dose as needed, based on symptoms. Recognize that the ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies.

Neuromuscular junction disorders

Myasthenia gravis (MG) can occur after ICI treatment, either due to preexisting disease exacerbation or de novo disease. In a series of 65 patients with ICI-related MG, 20% had pre-existing MG while 80% presented with de novo disease. Common presenting symptoms include ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, dyspnea, and limb weakness. ICI-related MG tends to be severe, with high reported rates of bulbar involvement (75%), respiratory failure (45–65%), and death (38%). Patients can present with concurrent myopathy and myocarditis, with overlap being associated with severe disease. In a 12-patient case series of nivolumab-related MG, 1/3 had muscle involvement. Recommended work-up includes myasthenia antibody evaluation (including antibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK)), creatine kinase (CK) to screen for concomitant myopathy, NCS/EMG (including repetitive nerve stimulation to assess for MG and needle exam to assess for myopathy), and pulmonary function testing to evaluate for respiratory involvement. Positive AChR antibodies are present in 59–66% of patients with generalized weakness, and more likely to be positive in patients with pre-existing MG. Antibodies against P/Q type voltage-gated potassium channels, seen in Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome, have also been reported and may be paraneoplastic in etiology. Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrating decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation or increased jitter on single fiber EMG support the diagnosis. Needle EMG may additionally show abnormal spontaneous activity and/or short duration, sometimes polyphasic motor unit potentials in patients with overlapping myopathy.

### Proximal muscle weakness [^116Xanzj]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 1: what is the differential diagnosis?

This 38-year-old woman likely has a myopathy given the symmetrical pattern of proximal weakness involving legs and arms. The differential diagnosis includes an acquired (e.g. inflammatory or toxic myopathy) or genetic (e.g. muscular dystrophy, late-onset congenital myopathy or metabolic myopathy) myopathic disorder. A neuromuscular junction disorder needs to be considered although the absence of ocular symptoms (which occurs in 90% of patients with myasthenia) and lack of fluctuating symptoms would be atypical for myasthenia gravis, and the lack of autonomic symptoms and intact patella reflexes would be atypical for Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. A motor neurone disease such as spinal muscular atrophy type III is unlikely since muscle weakness typically progresses more slowly than in this case.

### Unexpected fibrous mediastinitis in a patient with myasthenia gravis-a case report [^114sSS1h]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A female aged 56 years was admitted for treatment of generalized MG. Her chief complaints were ptosis, dysphagia, and upper limb weakness for three years. Initially, the manifestation of MG started with ocular symptoms, including left-eyelid ptosis and double vision. Four months later, she presented with left upper limb weakness, swallowing disorders, and dysphonia. Results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the AChR-Ab was positive (38.79 nmol/L) and the muscle-specific kinase antibody (MuSK-Ab) was negative (0.03 U/mL). She denied a history of tuberculosis or other bacterial infections. Based on her clinical symptoms and laboratory test, she was diagnosed with type IIb MG and treated with oral administration of pyridostigmine (60 mg three times daily), prednisone (15 mg once daily), and tacrolimus (1 mg once daily). After treatment, the ocular symptoms were largely improved but the swallowing disorders and limb weakness continued to affect her quality of life to a significant extent. She was therefore admitted for thymectomy.

After this admission, no ocular symptoms were noted upon physical examination. The Myasthenia Gravis Composite score was 4 (2 for swallowing and 2 for shoulder abduction). Routine blood test, urinalysis, and liver function, renal function, and coagulation tests were all within normal ranges. In chest CT, only sporadic calcifications were detected in the lymph node near the left hilum and in the left upper lung (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Chest CT findings. There were no overt imaging abnormalities. Only sporadic calcifications were found in the left lung (A, B; white arrows) and near left hilar regions (C, D; white arrows)

Rrobotic transxiphoid thymectomy was performed to remove the thymus and perithymic adipose tissue. Interestingly, in addition to the signs of MG, a pathological feature of FM was also found on final pathology. As shown in Fig. 2, numerous ectopic GCs were identified in the thymic cortex by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, dense collagen was distributed in a haphazard pattern and was infiltrated with minimal numbers of inflammatory cells; this matches features of stage II fibrosing mediastinitis. As a result, the final diagnosis of this patient was generalized MG (IIb) and FM.

### Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? [^112SgANq]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians must be able to diagnose myasthenia gravis, since delays in establishing the diagnosis may put patients at risk for complications from this treatable disease.

Objective

To determine if items in the history and examination or results of simple tests change the likelihood of myasthenia gravis as a diagnosis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles (January 1966-January 2005) using the terms myasthenia gravis, diagnosis, and test, and a search of bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating a particular symptom or sign in patients both with and without myasthenia gravis. Of 640 articles retrieved, 33 were eligible for review. Of these, 15 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using previously published criteria.

Data Synthesis

A history of "speech becoming unintelligible during prolonged speaking" and the presence of the peek sign increase the likelihood of myasthenia gravis (likelihood ratio [LR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–17.0 and LR, 30.0; 95% CI, 3.2–278.0, respectively). Their absence does not significantly reduce the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. The identified studies only assessed 1 other historical feature and sign each ("food remaining in the mouth after swallowing" and quiver eye movements, respectively), and neither of these significantly changes the likelihood of myasthenia. The ice test is useful when the response is abnormal (summary positive LR, 24.0; 95% CI, 8.5–67.0) and diminishes the likelihood of myasthenia gravis when the response is normal (summary negative LR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09–0.27). A positive response to an anticholinesterase medication (mainly edrophonium test) increases the probability of a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (summary positive LR, 15.0; 95% CI, 7.5–31.0), and a negative response reduces the diagnostic probability of myasthenia (summary negative LR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.21). An abnormal sleep test result is useful in confirming the diagnosis (LR, 53.0; 95% CI, 3.4–832.0). The rest and sleep tests make the probability of myasthenia unlikely when results are normal (LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.95 and LR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00–0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

Items in the history and physical examination along with results of certain simple tests performed in the office (ice test, sleep test, and edrophonium test) are useful in predicting the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. These results must be interpreted with caution, however, given the high prevalence of disease in the populations reported in clinical studies. This review is limited by the small number of signs and symptoms scientifically studied and reported in the literature. Future studies evaluating the value of common historical features and easy maneuvers commonly known and practiced by experts in the clinical diagnosis of myasthenia are needed.

### Late-onset myasthenia gravis: a review when incidence in older adults keeps increasing [^113s4QcG]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

We define late-onset myasthenia gravis (LOMG) when symptoms appear at ≥ 65 years of age. There has been a continuous increase in the incidence of LOMG with a clear male predominance. Commonly, patients present with focal (ocular or bulbar) weakness. A high index of suspicion required to achieve early diagnosis and to improve prognosis. Management options include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, steroids, and immunosuppressants. The most controversial issue in treatment is thymectomy, because not enough data are available. Successful treatment is associated with improved survival, and death is often secondary to comorbidities.

### Clinical reasoning: an unusual cause of diplopia and ptosis in a 67-year-old woman [^111VKPa5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diplopia is a relatively common chief complaint encountered in an outpatient neurology clinic and carries a broad differential diagnosis. In this case, a 67-year-old woman presented with new horizontal, binocular diplopia and ptosis of 8-month duration, which persisted without significant progression. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses for patients with acquired ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Key learning points include an illustration of the stepwise diagnostic approach to evaluate for common etiologies, the importance of interpreting test results in the appropriate clinical setting, and the significance of recognizing specific signs and symptoms in achieving the correct diagnosis.

### Management of patients with neuromuscular disorders at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^114d3cYf]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The most dangerous complication that may arise during short-term treatment with such agents is QTc prolongation and arrhythmias. In addition to CQ/HCQ, many drugs that are now used against COVID, such as azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, hold potential for QTc prolongation, which may already be altered in NMD patients, such as individuals with myotonic dystrophy. The Canadian Heart Rhythm Society has released guidelines to minimize the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias. In this document, they recommend performing baseline electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with an increased risk of rhythm alterations. If QTc is moderately prolonged, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy, while in patients with markedly prolonged QTc these therapies should be avoided. CQ and HCQ are also associated with CK increase and, in long-term treatments, with the development of toxic neuropathy and myopathy. Furthermore, reports describe drug-induced myopathies and rhabdomyolysis in patients treated concomitantly with LPV/RTV and statins. For this reason, we recommend a careful risk/benefit assessment before use in myopathic patients, and, in case of treatment with these agents, regular monitoring of serum CK levels. HCQ and azithromycin also have the potential to cause the onset or worsening of myasthenia gravis, and thus use in these patients should be carefully evaluated. We do not recommend using these drugs as prophylaxis in NMD patients, as their prophylactic efficacy has not been proven and it may lead to serious toxicity.

Treating the underlying NMD disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients may be challenging. One report describes the therapy of an MG exacerbation presenting with dysphagia, neck weakness, and diplopia during the infection. Anand et al. administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (2 g/kg/die) and increased dose of steroids (from 2.5 mg every other day at basal to 20 mg per day during the infection). In another report, a SARS-CoV-2 case with ETI experienced an MG crisis involving the proximal upper and lower extremities. This patient was treated with prednisone (increased from 20 to 40 mg twice daily), pyridostigmine, and IVIg (0.4 g/kg for five days). Due to a worsening of the proximal weakness of upper and lower limbs, another course of IVIg (650 mg/kg for two days) was performed. In both cases, the outcome was favourable.

### Ptosis as the initial presentation of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^114uLDD2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guillain-Barré syndrome has been regarded as a spectrum of diseases with many variants.

Objective

To present a case in which, when the ocular muscles are affected in the beginning, it is very challenging to distinguish Guillain-Barré syndrome from myasthenia gravis.

Case Report

We describe a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome who presented initially with isolated ptosis without ophthalmoplegia and subsequently developed descending paralysis. Due to the primary involvement of the lid levators, the patient was initially diagnosed as having a myasthenic crisis.

Conclusion

Although extremely rare, Guillain-Barré syndrome can present initially as isolated ptosis with subsequent descending paralysis.

### Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus: overlap and interactions [^113s4C9j]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ptosis and proximal weakness may develop in multiple diseases including oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and myasthenia gravis (MG). These two entities can be challenging to differentiate since they may have important clinical and neurophysiological overlap. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a common autoimmune disease, has been described in association with MG. We present a woman in her 60s with fluctuating bilateral ptosis and proximal muscle weakness. Single fibre electromyography showed increased jitter. Her brother has genetically proven OPMD. The investigation revealed a positive genetic test for OPMD and positive antibodies for acetylcholine receptor. Additionally, she has SLE, treated with hydroxychloroquine for more than 30 years. This case highlights the importance of a thoughtful anamnesis with personal and familial history and raises awareness for the rare coexistence of three pathologies with some common clinical characteristics but different treatments and management.

### Myotonic dystrophy type 1 coexisting with myasthenia gravis and thymoma [^116GHdWE]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal-dominant multisystemic disorder that may rarely be associated with benign and malignant neoplasms. Cases of both thymoma and myasthenia gravis in association with DM1 are extremely rare. A literature review revealed only three prior reports. We present a 51-year-old man with a family history of DM1 and fluctuating diplopia and ptosis, who was found to have acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies, thymoma, and a clinical presentation compatible with ocular myasthenia gravis as well as positive genetic testing for DM1. Needle electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated diffuse runs of myotonic discharges in multiple muscles, consistent with the diagnosis of DM1. Single-fiber EMG showed both increased jitter and blocking. Due to somatic instability, which has been shown previously in DM1, the myotonin protein kinase (DMPK) gene appears to act as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, abnormal CTG repeat expansions in the gene could lead to the development of thymoma and myasthenia gravis.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated kelch-like protein-11 IgG brainstem encephalitis [^117WrDg7]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

A 61-year-old man presented with 6 months of double vision, dizziness, and progressive gait instability. Eight months prior, he was diagnosed with stage IV poorly differentiated esophageal adenocarcinoma with diffuse metastatic lymph node and bone involvement. He was initiated on combination folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in addition to nivolumab. After 2 months of cancer treatment, he reported new-onset binocular vertical diplopia and disequilibrium provoked by head turning (Figure 1A). Brain MRI showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Nivolumab was held, and he received a short 40 mg prednisone taper with mild improvement. His symptoms were suspected to be secondary to ICI-associated myasthenia gravis (MG), for which he was initiated on pyridostigmine and maintenance prednisone at 100 mg daily. Acetylcholine-receptor antibodies were negative. EMG detected a mild sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy but no evidence of a neuromuscular junction disorder. Over the next 3 months, he developed progressive incoordination and ataxic gait resulting in dependence on a 4-wheel walker.

### Limb-girdle myasthenia gravis in a 10-year-old girl: a case report [^111hR6og]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented with progressive proximal limb muscle weakness without facial, ocular, or bulbar muscle involvement. There was no fatigability or diurnal fluctuation in symptoms. Her weakness worsened with febrile illnesses and recovered with accruing disabilities over a few weeks. Serum creatine kinase levels and muscle biopsy were normal. A significant decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation test and positive response to therapeutic neostigmine challenge test confirmed the diagnosis of limb-girdle myasthenia. She responded well to corticosteroids and thymectomy, demonstrating a likely autoimmune etiology. This case highlights the long-term fluctuations in a case of myasthenia gravis and the need for a high index of suspicion for myasthenia in children presenting with unexplained muscle weakness, even in the absence of typical features such as fatigability, diurnal fluctuation, and oculobulbar weakness.

Diagnostic Procedures

All patients underwent a standardized clinical assessment including careful history and physical examination. The core of the clinical assessment was the rating of disease severity with the Besinger score, a well-established clinical score for patients with MG. All patients underwent antibody testing, including autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab), titin, muscle-specific kinase, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4. Clinical and pharmacologic diagnostic procedures comprised the Simpson test with occurrence or increase of ptosis while looking upwardwithin 60 seconds, the ice pack test with improvement of ptosis with local cooling for 2 minutes, and a video-documented edrophonium test. In the edrophonium test, we first injected 2 mg edrophonium and verified that no acute adverse reactions occurred; if this was not the case after 30 seconds, the remaining 8 mg edrophonium were injected (total 10 mg). The test was performed on a recliner with a pulse oximeter and atropine ready. Objective improvement of ptosis and/or diplopia was assessed, and all tests were documented on video. Contraindications for the test were asthma or cardiac disease. In addition to roVEMP, we performed other electrophysiologic tests, including stimulated SFEMG of orbicularis oculi muscles and 3 Hz RNS of both facial nerves (nasalis recording) and 1 accessory nerve (trapezius recording) at rest, twice for each muscle with an interval of 2 minutes between the stimulations, where the decrement between the first and fifth response of ≥ 10% was defined as abnormal. Patients were withdrawn from acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors for at least 10 hours when the roVEMP and electrophysiologic testing were performed after initiation of treatment.

The final diagnosis (MG yes/no) was established at a 3-month follow-up visit based on all the clinical tests and evaluation of any treatment response. Owing to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, some patients were unable to visit the site and were followed up by phone. The study physicians who made the final diagnosis were blinded to the roVEMP results but had access to all the clinical routine tests. Conversely, both the examiners (M. A.W. Y.V. F.C.F.) and the analyzer (Y.V.) of roVEMP were blinded to the final clinical diagnosis. MG severity was classified according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification.

According to her family history (Fig. 1 A), two sisters and one brother were asymptomatic. The remaining two sisters (III:4 and III:6) of 20 and 14 years of age, respectively, showed a similar but milder phenotype, with a sparing of proximal muscles of the lower limbs. The disease onset was during childhood (III:6) or later in the adolescence (III:4), characterized in both cases by difficulties in running, climbing stairs and rising from the floor. Serum CK was mildly increased (300 mg/dL) only in the younger sister (III:6). The father was asymptomatic. The mother (II:2), 48 years of age, was affected by a Myasthenia Gravis associated with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and confirmed by the repetitive nerve stimulation test; she was administered with pyridostigmine and prednisone. The disease onset had been approximately 20 years before the consultation in our center, characterized by muscular fatigability. Neurological examination revealed a mild weakness of tongue and cranial muscles (orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi), diplopia after fixation and a mild weakness of axial muscles and scapular and pelvic girdles. Considering some similarities with the neuromuscular examination of the daughters, the mother's family history was investigated: she reported an asymptomatic brother, but, unfortunately, she could not provide clinical information about her parents.

2 Methods

2.1 Patients

Patient 1 is a 43-year-old woman who came to our observation at age 20 years with a five-year history of progressive bilateral ptosis without diplopia and minimal bilateral ophthalmoplegia with referred worsening at the end of day. For this reason she underwent diagnostic screening for Myasthenia Gravis (EMG with repetitive stimulation and jitter, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody dosage), which was normal. She therefore underwent skeletal muscle biopsy of left brachial biceps muscle. Both ptosis and ophthalmoplegia got worse in the following two years, thereafter she refused any medical follow-up and she did not change her mind even when we contacted her to inform her about the genetic results. More recently, however, we were able to contact her 76 years old mother and 79 years old father who, though initially reluctant, finally agreed in coming to our Outpatient Department to undergo clinical and genetic assessment. Their neurological examination is normal and their clinical history is poor (the mother suffers from migraine with aura and the father has mildly elevated blood pressure and benign prostatic hypertrophy). Talking with them we came to know that their daughter got progressively worse in terms of both ptosis and ophthalmoparesis to the point that her driving licence was recalled. She is otherwise strong and healthy with no overt medical problems (she refuses any medical follow-up). She got married 13 years ago and has an 11 years old healthy daughter whose picture, taken at age 10 years, does not show any eyelid ptosis.

### Efficacy of prednisone for the treatment of ocular myasthenia (EPITOME): a randomized, controlled trial [^112bo7kF]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this study we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of prednisone in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) concurrently treated with pyridostigmine.

Methods

This investigation was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants whose symptoms failed to remit on pyridostigmine were randomized to receive placebo or prednisone, initiated at 10 mg every other day, and titrated to a maximum of 40 mg/day over 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was treatment failure.

Results

Fewer subjects were randomized than the 88 planned. Of the 11 randomized, 9 completed 16 weeks of double-blind therapy. Treatment failure incidence was 100% (95% CI 48%-100%) in the placebo group (n = 5) vs. 17% (95% CI 0%-64%) in the prednisone group, P = 0.02 (n = 6). Median time to sustained minimal manifestation status (MMS) was 14 weeks, requiring an average prednisone dose of 15 mg/day. Adverse events were infrequent and generally mild in both groups.

Conclusions

A strategy of low-dose prednisone with gradual escalation appears to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in treating OMG.

### Medical and surgical treatment for ocular myasthenia [^111vRFDW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 50% of people with myasthenia gravis present with purely ocular symptoms, so called ocular myasthenia. Of these between 50% to 60% develop generalized disease, most within two years. Their management is controversial. This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and previously updated in 2008 and 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for ocular myasthenia and to answer three specific questions. Are there any treatments that impact the progression from ocular to generalized disease? Are there any treatments that improve symptoms of diplopia or ptosis? What is the frequency of adverse effects associated with treatments used?

Search Methods

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (3 August 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1996 to July 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to July 2012) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as case-control and cohort studies. The titles and abstracts of all articles were read by both authors and the full texts of possibly relevant articles were reviewed. The references of all manuscripts included in the review were scanned to identify additional articles of relevance and experts in the field were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished data. Where necessary, we contacted authors for further information.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion required meeting three criteria: (a) randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled study design; (b) active treatment compared to placebo, no treatment or some other treatment; and (c) results reported separately for patients with ocular myasthenia (grade 1) as defined by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data regarding the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis, improvement in ocular symptoms, and the frequency of treatment-related side effects.

Main Results

In the original review, we identified two RCTs relevant to the treatment of ocular myasthenia, only one of which reported results in terms of the pre-specified outcome measures used in this review. This study included only three participants and was of limited methodological quality. There were no new RCTs in searches conducted for this or previous updates. In the absence of data from RCTs, we present a review of the available observational data.

Authors' Conclusions

The available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. Data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.

### Hyperkalemia in a patient with myasthenia gravis: case presentation [^116WtYPg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old Chinese woman who was a carrier of the hepatitis B and C viruses and who had a 2-year history of MG was receiving treatment with oral Mestinon (pyridostigmine 120 mg daily), which controlled her symptoms well (minimal bilateral ptosis, especially in the morning, and proximal muscle power of 4/5). The diagnosis of MG was verified by the presence of high levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors (54.23 nmol/L). The stimulation single fiber electromyography recorded from orbicularis oculi muscle showed abnormal results (MCD: 180 s), and repetitive nerve stimulation showed no decremental response. A chest computed-tomography (CT) scan showed a thymoma of about 3.2 cm.

She presented with a 7-day history of poor appetite and progressive muscular weakness. Acute exacerbation of MG was initially considered by the neurologist but the muscle weakness did not improve in spite of an increased Mestinon dose to 360 mg daily. She was referred to the nephrology department for further assessment because the laboratory data showed an electrolyte imbalance. Such symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stool, and lower extremity numbness were absent. There was no history of recent strenuous exercise or diuretic use.

On admission, physical examination revealed clear consciousness and symmetrical weakness of the lower extremities. The following laboratory findings were recorded: blood pressure, 116/64 mmHg; heart rate, 82 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min; and body temperature, 36.8 °C. Moreover, a generalized skin pigmentation without long-term exposure to sunlight was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.

### Congenital myasthenic syndromes in adult neurology clinic: a long road to diagnosis and therapy [^111a9KP8]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the diagnostic challenges of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) in adult neuromuscular practice.

Methods

We searched the Mayo Clinic database for patients with CMS diagnosed in adulthood in the neuromuscular clinic between 2000 and 2016. Clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic data were reviewed.

Results

We identified 34 patients with CMS, 30 of whom had a molecular diagnosis (14 DOK7, 6 RAPSN, 2 LRP4, 2 COLQ, 2 slow-channel syndrome, 1 primary acetylcholine receptor deficiency, 1 AGRN, 1 GFPT1, and 1 SCN4A). Ophthalmoparesis was often mild and present in 13 patients. Predominant limb-girdle weakness occurred in 19 patients. Two patients had only ptosis. Age at onset ranged from birth to 39 years (median 5 years). The median time from onset to diagnosis was 26 years (range 4–56 years). Thirteen patients had affected family members. Fatigable weakness was present when examined. Creatine kinase was elevated in 4 of 23 patients (range 1.2–4.2 times the upper limit of normal). Repetitive nerve stimulation revealed a decrement in 30 patients. Thirty-two patients were previously misdiagnosed with seronegative myasthenia gravis (n = 16), muscle diseases (n = 15), weakness of undetermined cause (n = 8), and others (n = 4). Fifteen patients received immunotherapy or thymectomy without benefits. Fourteen of the 25 patients receiving pyridostigmine did not improve or worsen.

Conclusion

Misdiagnosis occurred in 94% of the adult patients with CMS and causes a median diagnostic delay of nearly 3 decades from symptom onset. Seronegative myasthenia gravis and muscle diseases were the 2 most common misdiagnoses, which led to treatment delay and unnecessary exposure to immunotherapy, thymectomy, or muscle biopsy.

### Indirect carotid cavernous fistula mimicking ocular myasthenia [^113thUyB]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

71-year-old woman with progressive left-sided, monocular diplopia and ptosis. Her symptoms mimicked ocular myasthenia, but she had an indirect carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). She was diagnosed with monocular myasthenia gravis (negative acetylcholinesterase antibody) after a positive ice test and started on Mestinon and underwent a thymectomy complicated by a brachial plexus injury. Months later, she developed left-sided proptosis and ocular bruit. She was urgently referred to neuro-interventional surgery and was diagnosed with an indirect high-flow left CCF, which was treated with Onyx liquid and platinum coil embolisation. Mestinon was discontinued. Her ophthalmic symptoms resolved. However, she was left with a residual left arm and hand hemiparesis and dysmetria secondary to a brachial plexus injury. Indirect CCF usually can present with subtle and progressive symptoms leading to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. It is important for ophthalmologists to consider this differential in a patient with progressive ocular symptoms.

### Myasthenic syndromes: mistaking genetic for acquired [^114BAhQh]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a rare, heterogeneous group of disorders caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins essential for neuromuscular transmission. DOK7 variants are among the most common causes of CMS and one of the subtypes that may worsen with pyridostigmine. We report two patients who presented in adulthood with fatigable limb girdle weakness, initially diagnosed with seronegative myasthenia gravis, who slowly progressed over time despite escalating treatment and eventually needed intensive care admission. Revisiting the history led to the diagnosis of DOK7 CMS. Both patients improved after stopping immunosuppressants and pyridostigmine and starting salbutamol. These cases highlight the importance of considering CMS in patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis.

### Radiological characteristics of extraocular muscles in myasthenia gravis patients with ocular manifestations: a case-control study [^1118YacB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction, frequently mediated by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (anti-AChR-Ab) and anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies (anti-MuSK-Ab). The diagnosis is usually based on clinical symptoms and signs. Common symptoms are fluctuation of double vision, drooping eyelids, limb weakness, and difficulties with speech, swallowing, and breathing. Differential diagnoses of MG include chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), inflammatory myositis, Miller-Fisher syndrome, and brainstem lesions. Establishing a diagnosis can be challenging in treatment-resistant patients. It would be helpful if there is an additional test for clinical judgement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables noninvasive visualization of muscles and extraocular muscles (EOMs). It is increasingly being used in the evaluation of muscle disorders. Besides, EOMs are commonly affected in MG. However, MRI is not frequently performed in MG cases and radiological characteristics of MG are limited. The goal of this study was to analyze the radiological patterns of the EOMs in MG cases with ocular manifestations.

### Mitochondrial disease: genetics and management [^117NZHJi]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic neurological presentations

Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis

More than half of adult patients have external ophthalmoplegia and/or ptosis in our large cohort of patients (unpublished). Ptosis and ophthamoplegia can be asymmetrical at the outset but most cases become symmetrical with time. CPEO is one of the main presenting features in adult patients with mitochondrial disease and ptosis often imposes more functional limitation than the restricted eye movement because the extra-ocular paresis occurs insidiously allowing cerebral adaptation and symptomatic diplopia is less common. Some patients with CPEO phenotype are occasionally misdiagnosed as other conditions such as seronegative myasthenia gravis.

Myopathy

Many adult patients experience fatigue, exercise intolerance and muscle weakness. The degree of proximal myopathy is often mild on clinical testing and it progresses slowly. Early loss of ambulation due to muscle weakness is not a typical feature of adult mitochondrial disease with a few exceptions such as patients with Kearns–Sayre syndrome caused by single deletion in mtDNA and TK2 mutation. There is a risk of aspiration when facial and oropharyngeal weakness is present in addition to the respiratory muscle weakness. Some patients may have normal muscle strength and EMG study but complain of limited exercise capacity with recurrent nausea and/or vomiting on exertion due to lactic acidosis.

Ataxia

Cerebellar ataxia is often subtle at the onset and typically progress with time and becomes debilitating in many genotypes. Cerebellar atrophy is a common imaging finding. Sensory ataxia due to dorsal root ganglionopathy is one of the defining features in SANDO phenotype (sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia) caused by POLG mutations.

Neuropathy

Diminished or absent long tendon reflexes are a common clinical finding and axonal neuropathy is the most common finding in nerve conduction studies in adult patients with mitochondrial disease with a few exceptions such as demyelinating neuropathy described in patients with MNGIE. A recent study showed that neuropathy is a useful feature to guide molecular diagnosis in adult patients with CPEO.

### Ocular myasthenia gravis: treatment successes and failures in patients with long-term follow-up [^111cz1Jm]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We previously reported that prednisone reduced the frequency of generalized myasthenia (GMG) and controlled diplopia without major adverse effects at 2 years in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). Questions remain as to whether study subjects had long-standing disease, biasing results towards a steroid benefit, and if prednisone merely delayed GMG onset. Here, we performed a record review of a referral neuro-ophthalmology service OMG database for patients who were followed-up for ≥ 4 years or until GMG developed. We studied the effect of prednisone on GMG incidence and control of ocular symptoms. Generally, patients with diplopia were recommended for prednisone therapy. Most remained on daily 2.5–10 mg for diplopia control. We compared the results for prednisone-treated and "untreated" (pyridostigmine only) patients. Of 87 patients, 55 were in the prednisone-treated and 32 were in the untreated groups. GMG developed in 7 (13%) of the prednisone-treated (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.22–0.76) and in 16 (50%) of the untreated (OR 2.78; 95% CI 1.68–4.60) patients. After OMG onset, GMG developed at a mean 5.8 and 0.22 years in prednisone and untreated groups. Diplopia was present at the last exam in 27% of the prednisone-treated (mean 7.2 years) and in 57% of the untreated (mean 4.6 years) OMG patients. For 48 prednisone-treated patients who did not develop GMG, OMG treatment failure occurred in 13. Thus, prednisone delays the onset of GMG and has sustained benefit in reducing the incidence of GMG and controlling diplopia. Without prednisone, GMG develops in 50% of OMG patients, typically within 1 year.

### Ocular myasthenia gravis-how effective is low dose prednisone long term? [^114qcZ4v]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controversy persists on the best treatment to control ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) and reduce conversion to generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG). We hypothesized that low dose prednisone could accomplish both in a cohort of OMG patients followed after three years.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 168 patients who presented with OMG. Our study included 103 of the OMG patients who met inclusion criteria, requiring follow up for a minimum of 3 years without disease generalization. Low dose prednisone was defined as ≤ 7.5 mg per day. The main outcome was having single vision without ptosis blocking vision, measured by binocular single vision (BSV) and upper lid position. We also analyzed late progression to GMG.

Results

Of 87 patients treated with prednisone, chronic low dose prednisone alone restored BSV in 47 patients (46% of all patients) without GMG. Pyridostigmine monotherapy restored BSV in 11/14 patients (11% of all patients). Other immunomodulatory therapy (OIT) was needed in 38 patients (37%). Medical therapy maintained BSV at last evaluation (mean follow up 8.2 ± 5.0 years) in 93 patients (90%). GMG developed in 10 patients (10%) during the follow-up period.

Conclusion

In OMG patients who do not generalize before 3 years, chronic long term prednisone at lower doses is moderately effective in maintaining optimum BSV. However, OIT are commonly required in these patients. In these OMG patients receiving prednisone and/or OIT, conversion to GMG after three years of disease is uncommon.

### Changing faces of mitochondrial disease: autosomal recessivedisease mimicking myasthenia gravis and progressive supranuclear palsy [^116syER4]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old right-handed man was seen in the general neurology clinic in August 2016. He reported a 7-month history of painless left ptosis, worsening as the day progressed and intermittent diplopia. He also reported long-standing numbness and tingling of the hands and feet due to a known diabetic neuropathy. His balance was worsening, but had been poor for several years, requiring bannisters and handrails at home. He had a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed at age 25. He was known to have a sensory axonal neuropathy, a diabetic retinopathy and bilateral cataracts (right cataract surgically removed in 2015). On examination, pupils were equal and reactive and he had full visual fields. He had fatigable partial left sided ptosis with restriction of horizontal eye movements and upgaze, but spared downgaze. Facial movements were reduced, interpreted as mild bifacial weakness. Neck flexion and extension was medical research council (MRC) 5/5. Upper and lower limbs were of normal tone and power with no fatigable weakness. Reflexes were normal in the upper limbs but absent in the lower limbs. He had reduced pinprick sensation in the feet.

A provisional diagnosis of MG was made based on fatigable ptosis and diplopia and the patient was referred for single-fibre electromyography (EMG). Unfortunately, this was poorly tolerated and therefore only 14 single-fibre action potential pairs were acquired. However, two pairs showed borderline jitter and two showed pathological jitter. This was felt to be supportive of a diagnosis of MG. He also had nerve conduction studies, which revealed evidence of a significant axonal sensory neuropathy, consistent with the known history of diabetes.

He was started on trial of pyridostigmine 60 mg two times per day and bloods were sent for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, MuSK antibodies, LRP4 and low affinity antibodies which were all negative.

A CT scan of the chest showed no evidence of a thymoma. An MRI scan of the orbits showed slightly thinned optic nerves but no abnormal signal changes.

### Changing faces of mitochondrial disease: autosomal recessivedisease mimicking myasthenia gravis and progressive supranuclear palsy [^115cPDKi]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Background

Mitochondrial disorders are known to cause diverse neurological phenotypes which cause a diagnostic challenge to most neurologists. Pathogenic polymerase gamma (POLG) variants have been described as a cause of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, which manifests with ptosis, horizontal and vertical eye movement restriction and myopathy. Autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia is rarely associated with Parkinsonism responsive to levodopa.

Methods

We report a case of a 58-year-old man who presented with an eye movement disorder then Parkinsonism who made his way through the myasthenia then the movement disorder clinic.

Results

A diagnostic right tibialis anterior biopsy revealed classical hallmarks of mitochondrial disease, and genetic testing identified compound heterozygous pathogenic gene variants in the POLG gene. The patient was diagnosed with autosomal recessive POLG disease.

Conclusions

It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of pathogenic POLG variants in patients presenting with atypical Parkinsonism and ophthalmoplegia. Patients with POLG -related disease will usually have ptosis, and downgaze is typically preserved until late in the disease. Accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate prognosis and genetic counselling.

Ocular MG

A small RCT comparing prednisone with placebo in patients with 11 ocular MG who had previously failed to achieve minimal manifestation (MM) status after 4–6 weeks of pyridostigmine found that 5 of 6 participants (83%) in the prednisone group achieved the primary end point of sustained MM status at a median of 14 weeks on prednisone (median dose 15 mg/d), compared with none of 5 in the placebo group. Three of the 5 placebo participants switched to prednisone (60 mg/d) with rapid taper; 2 attained sustained MM status. A prospective cohort study of 13 consecutive ocular and 76 generalized MG patients evaluated the effect of IS agents on ophthalmoparesis. Fifty-nine percent of patients had complete resolution of ophthalmoparesis within 12 ± 2 months of initiation of IS agents. Patients with milder ophthalmoparesis had greater odds of symptom resolution in the first year of treatment. Median time to resolution was 7 months after IS agents were started.

Evidence for the efficacy of thymectomy in ocular MG is limited by the retrospective design of most published studies. In a case-control study of 47 patients with nonthymomatous ocular MG who underwent thymectomy matched to 67 patients who refused surgery, there was no difference in the proportion of patients achieving stable remission at a median follow-up of 100–116 months. A retrospective analysis of 236 patients with thymomatous and nonthymomatous MG reported no improvement after thymectomy in 25 patients, of whom 17 (68%) were ocular or predominantly ocular, over 12 months of follow-up. In another retrospective case series of 52 patients with MG, only 2 of 11 patients with ocular MG (18%) achieved remission after thymectomy, in contrast to 28%–50% of patients with generalized MG.

ASCO guideline — myasthenia gravis (MG) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy: All grades warrant workup and intervention given potential for progressive MG to lead to respiratory compromise, and inpatient admission may be appropriate at all grades. For grade 2 (G2; some symptoms interfering with ADLs and MGFA class I and II), hold ICPi and may resume only if symptoms resolve and steroid taper completed, obtain neurology consultation, strongly consider inpatient care as patients can deteriorate quickly, start pyridostigmine 30 mg PO three times a day with gradual titration to a maximum of 120 mg PO four times a day as tolerated with close collaboration with the neurologist, and administer corticosteroids. For grade 3–4 (G3–4; limiting self-care with dysphagia, facial or respiratory muscle weakness, or rapidly progressive symptoms), follow G2 recommendations and add: permanently discontinue ICPi, admit the patient with possible ICU-level monitoring, continue steroids with taper beginning 3–4 weeks after initiation then wean based on symptom improvement, initiate IVIG 2 G/kg IV over 5 days (0.4 G/kg/d) or plasmapheresis × 5 days, consider adding rituximab if refractory to IVIG or plasmapheresis, perform frequent pulmonary function assessment, and conduct daily neurologic review.

Case 3

A 73-year-old man with a past medical history of melanoma (Stage IIIc), and right bundle branch block was referred to neuro-ophthalmology clinic for 1 week of binocular diplopia without ptosis, generalized weakness, and orthopnea without variability or fatigability. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. Given perineural invasion, he had been started on nivolumab 1 month before presentation. With workup in Table 1, he was admitted for presumed irMyocarditis/irMyopathy and irMG and started on 1 g i.v. daily of methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by oral prednisone, plus a heparin drip for 48 hours for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. After 3 days of oral corticosteroids, he had worsening negative inspiratory force (NIFs), diplopia, and required bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) overnight, so was started on i.v. immunoglobulin G (2 g/kg). Prednisone was continued at 60 mg/day. Within 2 days, diplopia and NIFs improved. Pyridostigmine 30 mg PO TID was initiated and prednisone tapered. At the time of his last follow-up in mid-2021, he remained free of ocular symptoms and without cardiovascular symptoms.

### Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy coexisting with myasthenia gravis [^114njtyB]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and myasthenia gravis are both rare conditions of different pathophysiological nature, so a fortuitous association is unlikely. However, antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies may be found in other genetic myopathies and this is probably not coincidental. Muscle fibre degeneration can induce innate immune responses that may break immune tolerance and allow the generation of autoantibodies to muscle proteins. We report a patient with atypical OPMD who also had acetylcholine receptor antibody-mediated myasthenia gravis. This report raises awareness of the diagnostic and treatment implications of the association of myasthenia gravis with genetic myopathies.

### Heterozygous frameshift variants in HNRNPA2B1 cause early-onset oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy [^1129bpet]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we describe a distinct phenotype of early-onset myopathy caused by specific heterozygous HNRNPA2B1 frameshift mutations clinically manifesting with progressive muscle weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and variable degrees of respiratory insufficiency. With the notable exception of the very early disease onset and rapid progression in our cohort, the overall clinical presentation was reminiscent of classical OPMD, such that the disease could be understood as a distinct early-onset form of OPMD (eoOPMD). The uniform absence of bone, cognitive and motor neuron involvement in our patients distinguishes our cohort from the previously described MSP phenotype associated with a p.D290V HNRNPA2B1 variant. In addition, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and dysphagia were absent in the reported HNRNPA2B1 missense (D290V) family, whereas these were consistent phenotypic features within our patient cohort, further differentiating these distinct HNRNPA2B1 -related phenotypes.

Acquired ptosis identification and differential diagnosis

Accurately identifying ptosis, as well as its underlying aetiology and severity, is essential to successful management. Thorough clinical examination and differential diagnosis is also needed in order to rule out similar conditions or most importantly, diagnose any serious underlying cause requiring more immediate medical intervention (Table 3).

Table 3
Diagnostic testing approaches for acquired ptosis.

CPEO chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, MRD-1 marginal reflex distance 1.

The initial diagnostic step is a review of patient history to understand timing of ptosis onset, as a sudden appearance may signal serious underlying pathology. If patient history suggests that ptosis may be secondary to a more serious condition, subsequent evaluation can be conducted based on the observable clinical signs. The serious neurological or muscular conditions most commonly encountered in clinical practice include Horner's syndrome, 3 rd cranial (oculomotor) nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis, and CPEO. In a study of patients referred for ptosis surgery, 5.6% of cases had a neurogenic cause, and among these cases, the majority were due to serious underlying aetiologies (35.7% palsy of the 3 rd cranial nerve, 28.6% myasthenia gravis, 14.3% aberrant regeneration, 7.1% Horner's syndrome). While myogenic causes (which broadly include conditions such as OPMD, CPEO, and myotonic dystrophy) were likewise uncommon in the study population (4.0% overall), 30% of the patients in this group had an underlying diagnosis of CPEO.

### Psychogenic unilateral pseudoptosis [^1111Fvr8]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

A 13- year-old girl presented with unilateral psychogenic pseudoptosis. She had sudden-onset ptosis on the left side 3 weeks before presentation. Careful review of her medical history revealed multiple assessments for chronic pain symptoms over the previous 2 years. Physical examination revealed isolated ptosis on the left side, with no other abnormal neurologic findings. On sustained upward gaze, mild elevation of the upper eyelid accompanied by slight elevation of the lower eye lid was seen. Imaging of the brain, laboratory investigations and Electrophysiologic studies for neurogenic and myogenic pathologies were normal. Dramatic and sustained response with complete resolution of ptosis was observed after administration of placebo during the edrophonium test, thus confirming the diagnosis of psychogenic pseudoptosis. The patient was offered psychologic assessment and support. There was no recurrence of symptoms at follow-up after 2 months. Psychogenic pseudoptosis is an uncommon manifestation of conversion disorder in children. Early recognition of the condition and institution of appropriate psychologic therapeutic interventions are essential for good recovery.

### Long-term effect of thymectomy plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in patients with non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis: 2-year extension of the MGTX randomised trial [^112sVgw6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Background

The Thymectomy Trial in Non-Thymomatous Myasthenia Gravis Patients Receiving Prednisone (MGTX) showed that thymectomy combined with prednisone was superior to prednisone alone in improving clinical status as measured by the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score in patients with generalised non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis at 3 years. We investigated the long-term effects of thymectomy up to 5 years on clinical status, medication requirements, and adverse events.

Methods

We did a rater-blinded 2-year extension study at 36 centres in 15 countries for all patients who completed the randomised controlled MGTX and were willing to participate. MGTX patients were aged 18 to 65 years at enrolment, had generalised non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis of less than 5 years' duration, had acetylcholine receptor antibody titres of 1.00 nmol/L or higher (or concentrations of 0.50–0.99 nmol/L if diagnosis was confirmed by positive edrophonium or abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation, or abnormal single fibre electromyography), had Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification Class II-IV disease, and were on optimal anticholinesterase therapy with or without oral corticosteroids. In MGTX, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either thymectomy plus prednisone or prednisone alone. All patients in both groups received oral prednisone at doses titrated up to 100 mg on alternate days until they achieved minimal manifestation status. The primary endpoints of the extension phase were the time-weighted means of the QMG score and alternate-day prednisone dose from month 0 to month 60. Analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00294658. It is closed to new participants, with follow-up completed.

Findings

Of the 111 patients who completed the 3-year MGTX, 68 (61%) entered the extension study between Sept 1, 2009, and Aug 26, 2015 (33 in the prednisone alone group and 35 in the prednisone plus thymectomy group). 50 (74%) patients completed the 60-month assessment, 24 in the prednisone alone group and 26 in the prednisone plus thymectomy group. At 5 years, patients in the thymectomy plus prednisone group had significantly lower time-weighted mean QMG scores (5.47 [SD 3.87] vs 9.34 [5.08]; p = 0.0007) and mean alternate-day prednisone doses (24 mg [SD 21] vs 48 mg [29]; p = 0.0002) than did those in the prednisone alone group. 14 (42%) of 33 patients in the prednisone group, and 12 (34%) of 35 in the thymectomy plus prednisone group, had at least one adverse event by month 60. No treatment-related deaths were reported during the extension phase.

Interpretation

At 5 years, thymectomy plus prednisone continues to confer benefits in patients with generalised non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis compared with prednisone alone. Although caution is appropriate when generalising our findings because of the small sample size of our study, they nevertheless provide further support for the benefits of thymectomy in patients with generalised non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis.

### Early-onset acquired myasthenia gravis secondary to anti-muscle-specific kinase autoantibodies [^115b4Awh]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune myasthenia gravis is rarely seen during infancy. Similar to adults, 85% to 90% of generalized pediatric myasthenia gravis cases have acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Approximately 30% of the remaining cases have antibodies against muscle-specific kinase. Information on the clinical course, treatment alternatives, and prognosis of pediatric muscle-specific kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis is limited because of the small number of cases. Here, we present a 14-month-old girl with muscle-specific kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis as one of the youngest patients described so far in the literature.

### Vaccines and myasthenia gravis: a comprehensive review and retrospective study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a large cohort of myasthenic patients [^117YUg1r]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial investigated the serological and clinical course of MG over 12 weeks after seasonal influenza vaccination. Sixty-two patients were included in the study. No significant difference in anti-AchR antibody titres between the two groups was found. The number of adverse events (74) was comparable between groups and the most common was the presence of flu-like symptoms. Adverse events occurred in 61.3% in the verum group and 41.9% in the placebo group, yet the difference was not statistically significant.

A case report showed the case of a 58-year-old woman, who developed bulbar MG 5 days after undergoing trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. In particular, exclusive laryngeal involvement presenting with mild dysphagia and severe dysarthria, was reported. The patient was treated with pyridostigmine and steroid therapy, with significant symptoms attenuation after 2 weeks. The follow-up conducted 6 months after discharge showed complete remission of symptoms.

HBV

A case series reported two cases of post-HBV vaccine MG. The first case was characterised by a generalised myasthenic exacerbation occurring in the month following the second dose of HBV vaccine. In the second case, onset of MG occurred 1 week after the first dose in an asthmatic patient. The clinical presentation included tetraparesis, dysphonia and dysphagia; anti-AchR antibodies were positive.

Furthermore, other two case reports regarding asthmatic patients who developed MG after anti-HBV vaccination have been described; anti-AchR antibodies were not measured and negative, respectively. In particular, in one case HBV vaccination was administered, 3 days earlier, by general anaesthesia, induced and maintained with the following anaesthetics: fentanyl, thiopental, atracurium, and isoflurane. The patient developed the first symptoms 1 month after receiving the vaccine dose, afterwards ensued by generalisation. The stabilization of this patient's MG entailed plasma exchanges and immunosuppressive drugs. The second patient, instead, developed a myasthenic crisis 4 years after onset, and required ventilator care and IVIG.

Nonetheless, a review indicated as extremely rare the risk of developing myasthenia gravis after HBV vaccination (only one case reported in the cited study). Among all cases of post-HBV vaccine MG presented above, only the first one was caused by a recombinant inactivated HBV vaccine, whereas all the others occurred after obsolete HBV vaccines derived from human donor plasma.

### Correlation between PABPN1 genotype and disease severity in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy [^112UxcAX]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and paraclinical examination of compound heterozygous and homozygous patients.

The clinical presentation of compound heterozygous patients for (GCN)11/(GCN)12 mutant alleles was typical of the OPMD phenotype but with an earlier mean age at diagnosis as compared with patients heterozygous for a single (GCN)12 allele (mean 58 and 73 years of age, respectively). These patients showed bilateral ptosis without diplopia and dysphagia appearing around 50–55 years of age. In half of them, a proximal weakness appeared around 60 years, affecting both lower (quadriceps, psoas) and upper (deltoid) limbs. The CK levels were slightly elevated from 300 to 650 UI/L.

A homozygous mutated genotype was found in 13 independent patients: 9 with (GCN)11, 2 with (GCN)12, and 2 with (GCN)13 alleles (figure 1). Patients carrying the homozygous (GCN)11 allele had a mean age at diagnosis of 73 years. They presented with a bilateral ptosis inconstantly associated with diplopia. All exhibited dysphagia, sometimes associated with dysphonia, and complications such as aspiration were noticed in 7 patients. Proximal and especially distal muscle weakness with myalgia and difficulty walking were observed in 4 patients older than 65. In 2 patients, an EMG was performed and showed a myogenic pattern. CK levels were normal or slightly elevated (300 UI/L). No cognitive decline was noticed although no specific tests were performed. The 2 patients homozygous for the (GCN)12 allele were from consanguineous families. The first patient was a 60-year-old man in whom the diagnosis of OPMD was first excluded on the basis of a transmission not clearly in favor of a dominant heredity although some cousins presented with ptosis both on the maternal side and on the paternal side. Upon clinical examination, the patient presented with ptosis and dysphagia associated with a proximal muscle weakness of lower limbs (walking difficulties, waddling gait), with hypertrophy of calves and quadriceps and a diffuse areflexia. The patient complained of walking difficulties since the age of 50 years. CK levels were slightly elevated, ranging from 300 to 500 UI/L. His older brother presented with the same phenotype but was never genotyped. Both underwent a surgery for their ptosis. The second patient was a man born in 1954 in an Indian family. The patient noticed bilateral ptosis and dysphagia around the age of 40 years. His older brother born in 1952 was heterozygous and presented with a moderate phenotype, whereas his younger brother born in 1966, who was genotyped homozygote for the mutant allele, exhibited at 45 years of age bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, ophthalmoparesis, and proximal and axial muscle weakness. Two patients were homozygous for the (GCN)13 repeat. The first one was a woman of Turkish origin. She presented with a bilateral ptosis noticed at 32 years of age and a progressive dysphagia from her 40s onward. At 48 years of age, she noticed proximal muscle weakness of the pelvic girdle, affecting both upper and lower limbs, with wasting and difficulties standing from a chair, walking, and climbing stairs. She underwent a cricopharyngeal myotomy at 51 years of age. Her CK levels were elevated (700 UI/L). The second patient was a 49-year-old woman originating from the North of France. She complained for many years about an asymmetric bilateral ptosis associated with dysphagia, dysphonia, and muscle weakness. The familial context was in favor of a dominant disease since both her mother and her 2 aunts also presented with a bilateral ptosis and dysphagia. The EMG disclosed a myogenic pattern in the lower limb muscles. At the age of 50 years, she noticed an exacerbation of muscle weakness of the 4 limbs, predominantly in the lower limbs, since the patient was unable to kneel.

### Myasthenia gravis masquerading as dysphagia: unveiled by magnesium infusion [^111GXNkX]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder that typically affects the ocular, bulbar, neck, proximal limbs and respiratory muscles. Dysphagia can occasionally be the only presenting symptom leading to extensive but ultimately futile gastrointestinal workup. Delay in diagnosis and use of certain pharmacological agents in the interim can lead to a myasthenic crisis, which though diagnostic is life threatening. We document a case of dysphagia as the only symptom of myasthenia, diagnosed after a magnesium infusion precipitated myasthenic crisis. A 70-year-old Caucasian woman who had had progressive dysphagia for 2 years, for which multiple oesophageal dilations were performed. During a hosptalisation for further gastrointestinal workup, she went into myasthenic crisis (respiratory failure) after receiving magnesium replacement. She required ventilatory support and received five plasma exchange (PLEX) treatments after myasthenia was confirmed by the detection of high antiacetylcholine receptor antibody. Though her symptoms improved, she had a prolonged hospital stay (25 days) and required 18 days of mechanical ventilation. This underscores the morbidity associated with a delay in diagnosis of this condition. This case report suggests that neuromuscular causes should be considered early in elderly patients presenting with dysphagia. Timely diagnosis, initiation of management and avoidance of drugs that affect neuromuscular transmission may help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with myasthenic crisis.

### Inflammatory myopathy with myasthenia gravis: thymoma association and polymyositis pathology [^112Vx8qp]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Thymomatous IM patients rarely showed fluctuating ocular symptoms (2/7) and abnormal RNS responses on extremities (1/7). By contrast, 3 nonthymomatous IM patients showed abnormal RNS responses (3/3) and positive edrophonium infusion test (2/2) but showed no ocular symptoms (0/3).

Before IM diagnosis, 2 patients had a history of transient elevation of serum CK levels without limb weakness (4,209 IU/L in no. 1 and 518 IU/L in no. 8). Progression of weakness in IM was rapid in 5 patients. Four thymomatous patients with normal RNS tests on extremities presented with rapid progression of weakness with acute markedly elevated serum CK levels (1,008–10,226 IU/L) at IM development (rhabdomyolysis-like features) and required ventilator support. One nonthymomatous patient (no. 9) developed respiratory muscle weakness with relatively preserved limb muscle strength, cardiac failure, and acute elevation of serum CK levels (1,140 IU/L).

The clinical features of the 10 patients included respiratory failure requiring ventilator support (5/10), severe weakness of extremities (4/10), dropped head (4/10), myalgia (4/10), dysphagia (5/9), and cardiac involvement (3/10). One thymomatous patient (no. 7) had initial symptoms of muscle swelling and pain in the forearms.

The mean serum CK level was 2,712 IU/L. The serum testing for autoantibodies demonstrated anti-AChR Ab (9/10), MSAs (0/9), and anti-titin Ab (6/8). A needle EMG, performed for 9 patients, showed spontaneous activities at rest in most of them (8/9). Three patients (3/10) showed cardiac involvements. A cardiac muscle biopsy performed in 1 patient (no. 6) showed abundant T-lymphocyte infiltration consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis.

### Clinical reasoning: a 60-year-old woman with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis [^115AS3uA]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical assessment of patients with proximal muscle weakness represents a frequent yet intricate challenge. We present the case of a 60-year-old woman who experienced a progressive, symmetrical weakness in proximal limbs and bulbar muscles over 6 months. Notable clinical findings included bilateral ophthalmoparesis; widespread muscle atrophy; and pronounced weakness in craniobulbar, cervical, and proximal muscles, more severe than in distal ones. We elucidate a methodical diagnostic approach, focusing on constructing a comprehensive differential diagnosis and identifying potential causes of proximal muscle weakness. Special emphasis is placed on exploring the etiologies in cases presenting with both progressive muscle weakness and ophthalmoparesis. We further describe the role of muscle biopsy results and their integration with genetic testing outcomes.

Individuals carrying the ABCD3 CCG repeat expansion present with the hallmark features of OPDM

Comprehensive clinical data from 24 individuals carrying CCG ABCD3 expansions were available for review (Table 1). The average age of onset was 26.7 years (range: 10–50 years). There were 11 affected males (average age at onset 29.8 years) and 13 affected females (age of onset 24.0 years). In almost all cases the presenting symptom was ptosis (22/24, 92%); one presented with dysphagia and one with weakness of the oropharyngeal muscles. On examination, ptosis was confirmed in all affected individuals, while other common features included ophthalmoparesis (14/20, 70%), facial weakness (16/21, 77%), dysphagia (16/21, 77%), dysarthria (13/20, 65%) and distal lower limb weakness (17/23, 74%). Figure 4 and Supplementary movie 1 demonstrate the main clinical features and disease progression. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography were in keeping with a myopathic process. CK was normal to mildly elevated (278 ± 79 IU, range 142–377).

### Penicillamine [^1112GfaG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Because of rare reports of intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis, liver function tests are recommended every six months for the duration of therapy. In Wilson's disease, these are recommended every three months, at least during the first year of treatment.

Goodpasture's syndrome has occurred rarely. The development of abnormal urinary findings associated with hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray requires immediate cessation of penicillamine.

Obliterative bronchiolitis has been reported rarely. The patient should be cautioned to report immediately pulmonary symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, unexplained cough or wheezing. Pulmonary function studies should be considered at that time.

Onset of new neurological symptoms has been reported with penicillamine capsules (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Occasionally, neurological symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with penicillamine capsules (see INDICATIONS). Myasthenic syndrome sometimes progressing to myasthenia gravis has been reported. Ptosis and diplopia, with weakness of the extraocular muscles, are often early signs of myasthenia. In the majority of cases, symptoms of myasthenia have receded after withdrawal of penicillamine.

Most of the various forms of pemphigus have occurred during treatment with penicillamine. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are reported most frequently, usually as a late complication of therapy. The seborrhea-like characteristics of pemphigus foliaceus may obscure an early diagnosis. When pemphigus is suspected, penicillamine capsules should be discontinued. Treatment has consisted of high doses of corticosteroids alone or, in some cases, concomitantly with an immunosuppressant. Treatment may be required for only a few weeks or months, but may need to be continued for more than a year.

Background and aims: The combination myositis‐myasthenia with or without myocarditis, is a rare but life‐threatening complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Diagnostic and treatment approaches vary across hospitals. We evaluated the clinical spectrum, treatments, and outcomes of patients with this ICI‐related complication.

Methods: This retrospective observational multicenter study in Spain collected clinical information on patients diagnosed with ICI‐related myositis‐myasthenia with/without myocarditis over the past 7 years using a structured questionnaire. Syndromes were classified as definite, probable, or possible based on the 2021 consensus disease definitions.

Results: We included 133 patients from 33 hospitals, with a median age of 72 years [IQR 34‐89], 67% male. Symptoms began 30 days [IQR 18‐68] after ICI initiation, including limb weakness, ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, myalgia and axial weakness. Mean time from onset to hospital admission was 11 days [IQR 6‐27]. Initial diagnoses were myositis in 88% (isolated 22%, combined with myasthenia 15%); myocarditis in 54% (with myositis 27%), and myasthenia in 9% (with myositis and myocarditis 24%). According to consensus definitions, 74% of myositis cases were definite, 61% of myasthenia cases probable, and 49% of myocarditis cases possible. During the acute phase, 74% had mRS > 2, 26% required intensive care, 96% received steroids, and 60% received immunoglobulins. At 30 days, 16% had died, 9% worsened, 3% stabilized, and 72% improved. At last follow‐up (175 days [IQR 47‐579]), ICI‐related mortality was 23%. Predictors of poor outcomes will be presented.

FIGURE 1 Frequncy and combinations of myositis, myasthenia and myocarditis

Conclusion: ICI‐related myositis‐myasthenia develops early after ICI initiation, progresses with severe symptoms, often includes myocarditis, and has a high first‐month mortality rate.

### Long remission in muscle-specific kinase antibody-positive juvenile myasthenia [^114Ctmiu]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical course of anti-muscle specific kinase-positive myasthenia in children has been little reported. Described here is the case of an 8 year-old boy who presented with ptosis and generalized weakness, which resolved within 1 month without any immunomodulatory treatment. This spontaneous remission lasted 6 years and was then followed by a relapse with bulbar symptoms. The patient was put on plasmapheresis; after initial benefit, symptoms worsened and serum antibody levels persisted. This case constitutes an example of the variability of the clinical presentation, course, and therapeutic response in anti-muscle specific kinase-positive myasthenia in childhood.

### Mitochondria and the eye-manifestations of mitochondrial diseases and their management [^116mdbNz]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

The onset of CPEO is often insidious and while it can occur at any age, it is often seen in young adults (mean age 29 years) presenting with bilateral symmetrical ptosis as the result of poor function of the levator palpebrae superioris. Classically, diplopia was not considered a presenting feature: the symmetrical nature of the extraocular myopathy and the ptosis itself (and in many patients a degree of visual suppression) preventing diplopia in the early stages. However, several case series have reported diplopia in up to 50% of cases, and early oculomotor changes can often be seen on examination including slowed saccades before any deviation becomes manifest.

### Histopathologic study of extraocular muscles in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy coexisting with ocular myasthenia gravis: a case report [^112KRyeZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old man presented to a tertiary eye center with a 2-year progression of bilateral proptosis. Physical examination revealed prominent proptosis, mild conjunctival redness, inflamed plica and lower eyelid retraction in both eyes. The unnatural crease of the right upper eyelid resulted from an eyelid surgery 3 years prior to presentation (Fig. 1 a, left). Before the eyelid surgery, he was documented with a 1-year history of right eye ptosis which worsened upon sustained upward gaze. The patient was suspected with OMG and underwent relative examinations. Both the neostigmine test and the ice-pack test reversed ptosis. The neurophysiological tests revealed no involvement of non-ocular muscles. Computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated thymus enlargement. Although serologic tests detected no antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, the other clinical findings secured the diagnosis of OMG. The patient underwent total thymectomy, and the histopathologic diagnosis was thymic hyperplasia. After surgery, the ocular symptoms showed no improvement. The patient was then treated with right eye blepharoplasty to "correct ptosis" in an oculoplastic medical facility. The surgery partially relieved the right eye ptosis but resulted in mild drooping of the left eyelid. One year later, the symptom of bilateral proptosis developed.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to patients with ocular myasthenia, EFNS 2014 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine to reduce corticosteroids to the lowest effective dose if corticosteroids do not result in good symptom control and/or if it is necessary to use high corticosteroid doses.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^113ssjRj]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic and IS treatment of MG.

1. Pyridostigmine should be part of the initial treatment in most patients with MG. Pyridostigmine dose should be adjusted as needed based on symptoms. The ability to discontinue pyridostigmine can be an indicator that the patient has met treatment goals and may guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or IS therapy should be used in all patients with MG who have not met treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine.
2. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used alone when corticosteroids are contraindicated or refused. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be used initially in conjunction with corticosteroids when the risk of steroid side effects is high based on medical comorbidities. A nonsteroidal IS agent should be added to corticosteroids when: a. Steroid side effects, deemed significant by the patient or the treating physician, develop; b. Response to an adequate trial (table e-1) of corticosteroids is inadequate; or c. The corticosteroid dose cannot be reduced due to symptom relapse.
3. Nonsteroidal IS agents that can be used in MG include azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. The following factors should be considered in selecting among these agents: a. There is widespread variation in practice with respect to choice of IS agent since there is little literature comparing them. b. Expert consensus and some RCT evidence support the use of azathioprine as a first-line IS agent in MG. c. Evidence from RCTs supports the use of cyclosporine in MG, but potential serious adverse effects and drug interactions limit its use. d. Although available RCT evidence does not support the use of mycophenolate and tacrolimus in MG, both are widely used, and one or both are recommended in several national MG treatment guidelines.
4. Patients with refractory MG should be referred to a physician or a center with expertise in management of MG. In addition to the previously mentioned IS agents, the following therapies may also be used in refractory MG: a. Chronic IVIg and chronic PLEX (see IVIg and PLEX, no. 6); b. Cyclophosphamide; c. Rituximab, for which evidence of efficacy is building, but for which formal consensus could not be reached.
5. IS agent dosage and duration of treatment a. Once patients achieve treatment goals, the corticosteroid dose should be gradually tapered. In many patients, continuing a low dose of corticosteroids long-term can help to maintain the treatment goal. b. For nonsteroidal IS agents, once treatment goals have been achieved and maintained for 6 months to 2 years, the IS dose should be tapered slowly to the minimal effective amount. Dosage adjustments should be made no more frequently than every 3–6 months (table e-1). c. Tapering of IS drugs is associated with risk of relapse, which may necessitate upward adjustments in dose. The risk of relapse is higher in patients who are symptomatic, or after rapid taper. d. It is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years, sometimes for life.
6. Patients must be monitored for potential adverse effects and complications from IS drugs. Changing to an alternative IS agent should be considered if adverse effects and complications are medically significant or create undue hardship for the patient.

### Pearls and Oy-sters: chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia with electrical myotonia and negative initial genetic testing [^114UHZEB]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), a genetic syndrome characterized by slowly progressive paresis of extraocular muscles, is often due to single large-scale deletions of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). Owing to heteroplasmy, mtDNA variants are often not uniformly expressed across tissues. This genetic variability affects clinical presentation and diagnostic testing. We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who presented with symptoms suspicious for a genetic myopathy: chronic asymmetric ptosis, slowly progressive asymmetric weakness, and external ophthalmoplegia. After initial nondiagnostic peripheral genetic testing, whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing of muscle revealed a single large-scale mtDNA deletion, consistent with a diagnosis of mtDNA deletion-associated CPEO. Of interest, electrophysiologic studies showed myotonia in select muscles, a rarely reported finding. We discuss the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach in suspected CPEO, with an emphasis on common pitfalls in genetic testing for mitochondrial myopathies and the need for appropriate tissue and genetic testing modality selection.

### Penicillamine (Cuprimine) [^113RCUwC]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Because of rare reports of intrahepatic cholestasis and toxic hepatitis, liver function tests are recommended every 6 months for the duration of therapy. In Wilson's disease, these are recommended every 3 months, at least during the first year of treatment.

Goodpasture's syndrome has occurred rarely. The development of abnormal urinary findings associated with hemoptysis and pulmonary infiltrates on x-ray requires immediate cessation of penicillamine.

Obliterative bronchiolitis has been reported rarely. The patient should be cautioned to report immediately pulmonary symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, unexplained cough, or wheezing. Pulmonary function studies should be considered at that time.

Onset of new neurological symptoms has been reported with CUPRIMINE (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Occasionally, neurological symptoms become worse during initiation of therapy with CUPRIMINE (see INDICATIONS). Myasthenic syndrome sometimes progressing to myasthenia gravis has been reported. Ptosis and diplopia, with weakness of the extraocular muscles, are often early signs of myasthenia. In the majority of cases, symptoms of myasthenia have receded after withdrawal of penicillamine.

Most of the various forms of pemphigus have occurred during treatment with penicillamine. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are reported most frequently, usually as a late complication of therapy. The seborrhea-like characteristics of pemphigus foliaceus may obscure an early diagnosis. When pemphigus is suspected, CUPRIMINE should be discontinued. Treatment has consisted of high doses of corticosteroids alone or, in some cases, concomitantly with an immunosuppressant. Treatment may be required for only a few weeks or months, but may need to be continued for more than a year.

Once instituted for Wilson's disease or cystinuria, treatment with penicillamine should, as a rule, be continued on a daily basis. Interruptions for even a few days have been followed by sensitivity reactions after reinstitution of therapy.

Pathological findings of myocardial biopsy; a Lymphocytic and macrophages infiltration. b Shedding of cardiomyocytes (30–40%) or severe degeneration is observed. c, d CD3-dominant T cells were observed than CD20. e, f CD8-dominant T cells were higher in number than CD4 cells. a, b: H & E, × 150; c: CD3, × 150; d: CD20, × 150; e CD4, × 150; f CD8, × 150

The patient then developed progressive ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, dysphagia, dyspnea, and limb weakness. Repeated nerve stimulation revealed no waning, and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies were detected in the serum. Thus, the diagnostic criteria of MG were met. We diagnosed the patient with MG, concomitantly with nivolumab-related myocarditis. The occurrence of concomitant myositis was not confirmed as muscle biopsy had not been performed. Blood test results for antibodies to muscle-specific kinase and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 were negative. However, anti-striational antibodies, including antibodies against titin and muscular voltage-gated potassium channel 1.4, were positive. Pulse methylprednisolone (1.0 g/day) was initiated for 3 days after admission to treat nivolumab-related MG and myocarditis, followed by a dose of 1 mg/kg/day. On the seventh day after hospital admission, a Mobitz type II atrioventricular block was observed after electrocardiography, and a temporary cardiac pacemaker was implanted. The levels of CPK, CK-MB, troponin I, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase gradually decreased.

A high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (1.0 g/day) was initiated; however, symptoms of MG worsened progressively. After 7 days of the initial infusion, an additional infusion of intravenous methylprednisolone (1.0 g/day) was administered. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (22.5 g/day) were also administered. Subsequently, three plasma exchange cycles were completed. Despite plasma exchange and intravenous administration of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins, the status of MG in the patient gradually worsened, and he died of type II respiratory failure due to progression of myasthenia gravis 103 days after admission. The clinical course is shown in Fig. 2.

### Consider myocarditis when patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors present with ocular symptoms [^115G5nWE]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Cases

Case 1

A 69-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on axitinib and 3 months of pembrolizumab presented to the emergency room (ER) with 2 weeks of binocular diplopia and no cardiac symptoms. Work-up is summarized in Table 1. Cardiac biopsy demonstrated myocarditis. He received methylprednisolone 1 g i.v. daily for 3 days. Because TropT-hs rose again after initial improvement, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1000 mg twice a day (BID) was added. TropT-hs decreased, and prednisone and MMF were tapered off over 3 months. His ocular symptoms improved on pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times a day (TID). His RCC is being followed with active surveillance, off therapy, and he has had no adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Table 1.
Summary of characteristics and treatment of patients.

Case 2

A 69-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on ipilimumab and nivolumab, presented to the emergency department with acute right ptosis and binocular diplopia, worse at day's end. She denied chest pain, pressure, or palpitations. Work-up is summarized in Table 1. On hospital day 1, she developed new onset atrial fibrillation with heart rates reaching 200 beats per minute. TropT-hs peaked at 132 ng/L. Endomyocardial biopsy showed active myocarditis. Methylprednisolone 1 g i.v. for 3 days followed by prednisone and pyridostigmine 90 mg TID resulted in improved ptosis and diplopia, and down-trending TropT-hs. MMF 750 mg PO BID was initiated when TropT-hs rose again during steroid taper. Though ICI therapy was discontinued, at 1 year follow-up, she had no evidence for cancer progression. She had no ocular symptoms and was at her cardiovascular baseline off prednisone and MMF.

### Letibotulinumtoxina-wlbg (Letybo) [^116iTBj2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Cardiovascular System Adverse Reactions

There have been reports following administration of botulinum toxins of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Use caution when administering to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

5.6 Increased Risk of Clinically Significant Effects with Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders

Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia, and respiratory compromise from typical doses of LETYBO. Monitor patients with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) for increased neuromuscular compromise following botulinum toxin treatment.

5.7 Dysphagia and Dyspnea

Treatment with botulinum toxin products, including LETYBO, can result in dysphagia and dyspnea including respiratory failure. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin. Patients with preexisting dysphagia and dyspnea may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this has been a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing

Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin products. Dysphagia may persist for several months. Patients treated with botulinum toxin products, including LETYBO, may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech, or breathing. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.8 Pre-existing Conditions at the Injection Site

Use caution when LETYBO treatment is used in the presence of inflammation at the proposed injection site(s) or when excessive weakness or atrophy is present in the target muscle(s).

Use caution when LETYBO treatment is used in patients who have marked facial asymmetry, with surgical alterations to the facial anatomy, pre-existing eyelid or eyebrow ptosis, when excessive weakness or atrophy is present in the target muscles, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, thick sebaceous skin (e.g., the inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines even by physically spreading them apart).

### Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy complicating airway management [^115KvW6A]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an uncommon autosomal dominant disorder characterized by late onset and slow progression. Complications of OPMD include ptosis and progressive dysphagia leading to eventual malnutrition and aspiration. We report a rare case of OPMD complicating mechanical ventilator management following emergent surgery. OPMD and the resulting dysphagia contributed to multiple intubations, tracheostomy, aspiration pneumonia, and a prolonged hospital course. Awareness of the possibility of OPMD in intubated patients with a history of dysphagia is crucial for avoidance of complications.

### Solu-cortef [^111WBSX7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Ophthalmic

Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some individuals. If steroid therapy is continued for more than 6 weeks, intraocular pressure should be monitored.

Other

Pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, has been reported after administration of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with suspected pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids.

Information for Patients

Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids, and to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1149ZDzY]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

### An update on treatments in myasthenia gravis [^1127PLgr]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Randomized trial of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis

In this international multicentre randomised single-blind trial of thymectomy in patients with non-thymomatous MG, 126 participants were randomised to treatment with extended trans-sternal thymectomy plus alternate-day prednisone or treatment with alternate-day prednisone alone. The dual primary outcome was the time-weighted QMG score over 3 years and the time-weighted average required dose of prednisone over 3 years. Secondary outcomes addressed treatment safety and quality of life and focused on 36 treatment-associated complications and 29 symptoms associated with glucocorticoids.

Sixty-six participants were randomised to the thymectomy group of whom 58 underwent an extended trans-sternal thymectomy within 30 days of randomisation. The remaining eight participants declined surgery. Of the 60 participants randomised to the prednisone-only group, eight had a thymectomy outside the trial protocol. The trial was single-blinded as it was deemed unethical to perform a sham thymectomy. All participants wore a black, high-collared shirt to conceal any evidence of trans-sternal incisions to maintain rater blinding. Patients were treated with alternate-day prednisone starting at 10 mg, increasing in 10 mg steps to a maximum 100 mg on alternate days for participants not previously taking prednisone and 120 mg for those already taking prednisone, with the goal of achieving minimal-manifestation status. This was defined as having "no symptoms or functional limitations from myasthenia gravis, but there may be some weakness on examination of some muscles". Once this was reached, the prednisone was reduced by 10 mg every 2 weeks until 40 mg was reached, with subsequent tapering by 5 mg a month to maintain the minimal-manifestation status. Pyridostigmine dose could not exceed 240 mg per day during the tapering phase and plasmaphersis or intravenous immunoglobulin was permitted in unstable patients.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^114dQ9Qg]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a part of Kearn–Sayre syndrome, a multisystem disorder with central nervous system involvement caused by a large-scale mtDNA deletion. Onset before 20 years of age, cerebellar ataxia, pigmentary retinopathy (usually rod-cone dystrophy), and in some cases, cardiac conduction block (usually the cause of death in young adulthood) and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level are typical for this syndrome. Other neurological problems may include proximal myopathy, exercise intolerance, ptosis, oropharyngeal and esophageal dysfunction, sensorineural hearing loss, dementia, and choroid plexus dysfunction resulting in cerebral folate deficiency. Moreover, CPEO may be present in MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes), MERRF syndrome (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), or ARCO syndrome (autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy, ophthalmoplegia).

### Pembrolizumab induced bulbar myopathy and respiratory failure with necrotizing myositis of the diaphragm [^113HfAEU]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD 1 antibody, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and head and neck cancers; and is being investigated in other cancers. We describe a case of Pembrolizumab induced severe bulbar myopathy and respiratory failure with necrotizing myositis of the diaphragm.

A 78-year-old man with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma with predominantly osseous metastases presented with a subacute onset of bulbar weakness 2 weeks after the second cycle of pembrolizumab. The week prior to admission, he had developed progressive dysarthria, bilateral ptosis, neck weakness, dysphagia, diffuse myalgia, and mild proximal muscle weakness in both the upper and lower extremities. He denied any fever, rash, dizziness or sensory deficit. At the time of admission, physical examination revealed asymmetric ptosis (Figure 1 A), bifacial paresis (Figure 1 B), mild ophthalmoparesis (pseudo-internuclear ophthalmoparesis — Figure 1 C and D), flaccid dysarthria, mild neck flexion weakness, mild bilateral proximal limb muscle weakness (upper > lower) and subtle facilitation. A PET-CT scan done at the time of hospitalization showed significantly decreased FDG uptake and size of all the osseous metastases. Initial laboratory testing revealed a mildly elevated WBC count at 16 000 and a mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK) at 1284 units per liter. Paraneoplastic antibody panel revealed a high titre of striational antibodies at 1:61 440, while anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, anti-SRP70 (signal recognition particle), anti-HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), and other paraneoplastic antibodies were negative. MRI of the cervical spine revealed symmetric enhancement of the paraspinal musculature. Electromyography showed reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes in the spinal accessory and facial nerves without decrement or facilitation, contrary to the subtle facilitation on physical exam. Fibrillation potentials were noted in proximal muscle groups and in the orbicularis oculi muscles. These findings were consistent with ongoing muscle necrosis without evidence of a neuromuscular junction disorder. A triceps muscle biopsy showed necrotic fibers in most fascicles, replaced by mononuclear cells (Figure 2 A). Taken together, the elevated CK, electromyography findings, laboratory studies, and the results of the muscle biopsy favored a diagnosis of an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy over a NMJ disorder.

In the case of limbic encephalitis MRI demonstrated bilateral hippocampal fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities (Figure 2l) and lumbar puncture revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (13/μl), oligoclonal bands type 2 and mild disruption of the blood–brain barrier. The encephalitis antibody panel and tumour search were negative. A flare of previously stable mild ocular myasthenia gravis was diagnosed by rapidly progressive bulbar crisis supported by corresponding elevation of acetylcholine‐receptor antibody titre (8.29 nmol/l, normal < 0.4).

1 CASE PRESENTATION

A 53‐year‐old previously healthy man developed difficulty in climbing stairs and getting to stand at 37 years old. Carrying heavy objects and swallowing solids became difficult 5 and 11 years later, respectively. He became nonambulant at age 50 years after a surgery for bilateral hip fractures. There was no family history of neuromuscular disease or history of consanguinity. Physical examination showed predominantly proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities, scoring 3 out of 5 by the Medical Research Council score. The upper limb weakness was mild and asymmetrical. There were bilateral scapular winging and facial muscle weakness, predominantly on the left side. He had nasal speech, decreased gag reflex, and palatal and tongue muscle weakness but no ophthalmoplegia or ptosis. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was 246 U/L (normal 22–171 U/L). Electromyography showed myopathic changes. Muscle MRI was not performed (Box 1).

A definitive diagnosis was arrived at in only 1 by histochemical studies, although 4 others demonstrated minor myopathic changes. Biochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis in an additional 5. Muscle biopsy is useful for evaluating such patients, but extensive studies of the muscle are necessary.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^116a31Dg]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to immunosuppressants, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to monitor patients for potential adverse effects and complications from immunosuppressive drugs. Consider changing to an alternative immunosuppressive agent, if adverse effects and complications are medically significant or create undue hardship for the patient.

### Development of generalized disease at 2 years in patients with ocular myasthenia gravis… [^115UgVZr]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

We reviewed an ocular myasthenia gravis database of 147 patients. Patients underwent measurement of acetylcholine receptor antibody levels and chest computed tomography. Unless contraindicated, patients with diplopia were recommended for therapy with prednisone, up to 40 to 60 mg/d, with the dosage tapered for 5 to 6 weeks. Most continued to receive daily or alternate-day doses of 2. 5 to 10 mg to prevent diplopia. Patients not given prednisone received pyridostigmine bromide or no medication. After the diagnosis, we documented the signs and symptoms of ocular and generalized myasthenia gravis and performed 2-year follow-up in 94 patients. Conclusions At 2 years, prednisone treatment appears to reduce the incidence of generalized myasthenia gravis to 7% in contrast to 36% of patients who did not receive prednisone. Thymoma, although uncommon, occurs in ocular myasthenia gravis. Only small amounts of edrophonium are needed to diagnose ocular myasthenia gravis.

Patients were not randomized for therapy. Because previous work suggested that corticosteroids alleviate diplopia in the primary gaze, 4 except in patients who refused or had contraindications, patients with diplopia in primary or downward gaze and extraocular muscle dysfunction or ptosis that blocked vision and was unresponsive to pyridostigmine bromide were treated with prednisone. The dosage was further reduced by 2. 5 mg/d each week while clinically titrating the dosage to the patient's clinical symptoms and findings of ocular myasthenia gravis. Most patients in the prednisone treatment group continued to receive a daily or alternate daily dose of 2. 5 to 10 mg. Patients not treated with prednisone received pyridostigmine as necessary and tolerated to relieve ptosis. Few patients continued to receive pyridostigmine to alleviate diplopia because this drug failed to accomplish this goal.

In only 1 of 15 female patients younger than 40 years, in contrast to 7 of 22 who were 40 years or older, generalized myasthenia developed at 2 years. Generalized disease developed at 2 years in 3 of the 22 male patients younger than 40 years and 6 of those 40 years or older.

### A woman with dyspnea, dysphagia, and dysarthria | NEJM resident 360… [^113GzR7w]. resident360.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published October 16, 2024 A hallmark of myasthenia gravis is fatigable weakness. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What causes myasthenia gravis. A: Myasthenia gravis is caused by antibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and is characterized by bulbar, ocular, facial, limb, and axial weakness. In 60% of patients, the presenting sign is asymmetric ptosis, diplopia, or both; approximately 10% of patients have an associated thymoma. A: The management of myasthenic crisis in patients with previously untreated myasthenia gravis is highly complex. Efficacy is based on clinical response instead of antibody titers.

The treatment approach to myasthenic crisis involves first stabilizing life-threatening respiratory-muscle weakness and then addressing the underlying autoimmune disorder, with the goal of restoring neuromuscular function sufficiently to minimize symptoms and prevent relapse. Immediate measures include intensive care and ventilatory support with either mechanical ventilation or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Rapid-acting treatment options for myasthenic crisis are plasma exchange and the administration of intravenous immune globulin. Additional immunotherapy is recommended once the patient's condition is medically stable. A: Prednisone is used as a first-line immunosuppressive agent for patients in myasthenic crisis. High doses of prednisone are recommended for patients in myasthenic crisis to allow for a shorter time to clinical effect.

However, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy leads to transient disease exacerbation in nearly half of patients with myasthenia gravis who receive such treatment, typically within the first 1 or 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy. In patients with severe myasthenia gravis, including those in myasthenic crisis, nonsteroidal immunosuppressants can be administered early, in addition to prednisone. First-line nonsteroidal immunosuppressive agents used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis include mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors, and methotrexate; rituximab is typically reserved for patients with refractory disease.

### Ocular myasthenia gravis treatment… [^1121h6cR]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

E. S. ROACHMD Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction membrane. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are frequently present, and the number of functioning postsynaptic receptors is reduced. Muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be identified in individuals with and without AChR antibodies. 1 Ptosis or diplopia due to ocular muscle involvement are frequently the first symptoms of the disease. 2 Approximately half of the patients are first seen with purely ocular MG; of these, 53% develop generalized MG within 2 years. Furthermore, a spontaneous remission rate of 30% has been reported in patients with OMG during a 15-year period. 3 Both AChR and muscle-specific kinase antibodies may be present in OMG.
