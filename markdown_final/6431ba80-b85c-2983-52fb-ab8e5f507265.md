## Question

generalized anxiety with sleep disruption

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about generalized anxiety disorder with sleep disruption, including prevalence, mechanisms, diagnostic implications, and treatment sequencing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core relationship between GAD and sleep disturbance. Then, I should verify prevalence and the bidirectionality of the association. Next, I will examine mechanisms, especially worry and hyperarousal. After that, I need to check diagnostic implications and screening tools. Then, I will review treatment hierarchies, including CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs, and CBT-I, and clarify benzodiazepine positioning. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the core relationship. Sleep disturbance is embedded in DSM criteria for GAD and is among the most common associated symptoms, with patients frequently reporting difficulty falling asleep, maintenance insomnia, or early morning awakenings, which tracks with clinical experience and epidemiologic summaries of GAD phenomenology [^a3da5290] [^ac79ac21].

> I should double-check prevalence estimates. Comorbidity between GAD and insomnia is high, with estimates around 45–70% in anxiety disorders overall and higher risk in GAD compared with other anxiety disorders; meta-analytic data also show large effects for subjective sleep disturbance and medium effects for reduced total sleep time and sleep continuity in anxiety-related disorders, reinforcing the clinical impression of frequent and clinically meaningful sleep complaints in GAD [^22d47397] [^69ed596b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Longitudinal data suggest anxiety disorders predict later insomnia more consistently than insomnia predicts later anxiety, but there is also evidence of a bidirectional, mutually maintaining relationship between worry and sleep disturbance in GAD, implying that treating either domain can meaningfully influence the other; mechanistically, worry-driven cognitive arousal and physiologic hyperarousal are plausible links that perpetuate insomnia in GAD [^22d47397] [^cb39a836] [^ad982911].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications. Sleep complaints are common in primary care and often misattributed to medical causes, so I need to ensure I screen for GAD when patients present with insomnia and vice versa; the GAD-7 is a validated, brief tool for screening and severity tracking, and DSM-5 criteria require excessive worry for at least 6 months with associated symptoms including sleep disturbance, which helps anchor diagnosis and avoid missing comorbidity [^811bd7c0] [^a3da5290].

> I will now examine first-line treatments for GAD and their impact on sleep. SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for GAD and can improve anxiety and sleep over time, though initial activation and insomnia can occur early; CBT is a first-line psychotherapy with durable benefits, and in older adults, CBT delivered in primary care improved worry, depressive symptoms, and mental health quality of life, with behavioral sleep management as a component, suggesting that anxiety-targeted CBT can indirectly improve sleep even when sleep is not the primary target [^01908ae8] [^55920705] [^63d5579f].

> Wait, let me verify the role of CBT-I specifically. CBT-I remains first-line for insomnia and has moderate-to-large effects on insomnia severity; in comorbid GAD, open trials and small studies suggest CBT-I can improve both sleep and anxiety symptoms, but evidence is limited by small samples and lack of adequately powered RCTs; sequencing may matter, with some data suggesting treating GAD first may enhance subsequent CBT-I outcomes, though this remains preliminary and warrants cautious interpretation [^12b204ea] [^b0ad6a37] [^28b0ef11].

> I need to ensure I position benzodiazepines correctly. Guidelines advise against routine benzodiazepine use for GAD due to limited long-term benefit, tolerance, dependence, and safety risks; short-term use may be considered for acute severe anxiety or as a bridge in select cases, but even then, WHO recommends limiting to 3–7 days and not using BZDs as treatment for GAD; tapering guidance emphasizes optimizing evidence-based treatments for anxiety and insomnia before and during any taper, and ICU-focused guidance similarly highlights insufficient evidence for BZDs in anxiety management in critical care, reinforcing a conservative stance [^774a10ff] [^7dfb64fd] [^d705e6dc] [^e8e5d907] [^2904e241].

> Let me consider alternative pharmacologic options when SSRIs/SNRIs are unsuitable or insufficient. Pregabalin has guideline support as an alternative initial agent for GAD and has demonstrated improvements in sleep maintenance across conditions, which can be clinically useful when sleep disruption is prominent; however, I should confirm dosing and tolerability, as somnolence and dizziness are dose-related and require careful titration [^fb48bd0a] [^5d11f079] [^2c0f4f9a].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older adults, falls, cognitive impairment, and psychomotor effects heighten the risks of benzodiazepines, so nonpharmacologic strategies and agents with favorable safety profiles are preferred; in pregnancy and postpartum, benzodiazepines should be avoided or used only transiently as a bridge while SSRIs/SNRIs or psychotherapy take effect; in pediatrics, combination CBT plus SSRI may be preferred in moderate-to-severe anxiety, and sleep-focused CBT techniques can be integrated as developmentally appropriate [^d705e6dc] [^bef05694] [^7faf44c0].

> I should double-check monitoring and sequencing pragmatics. For pharmacotherapy, reassess at 4–6 weeks and extend trials to 12 weeks when needed to judge efficacy; counsel on early side effects and discontinuation symptoms to support adherence; for CBT, set expectations that response accrues over weeks and that booster sessions help maintain gains; when combining modalities, avoid routine initial combination and instead sequence based on severity, patient preference, and response, escalating thoughtfully if monotherapy is inadequate [^3d9e1e45] [^c45c4ccd] [^0014f41d].

> But wait, what if sleep remains refractory despite optimized anxiety treatment. In that scenario, I should reconsider the diagnosis, screen for other sleep disorders such as OSA or restless legs, and then add targeted CBT-I; digital CBT-I can expand access and has shown improvements in insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms in meta-analyses, though effect sizes vary and engagement remains key; if insomnia persists, I should also reassess for residual anxiety symptoms and consider augmentation or switching strategies within guideline-concordant options [^bb4c8e74] [^12b204ea] [^addff970].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while acknowledging uncertainties. First, confirm GAD and characterize sleep complaints with standardized tools like GAD-7 and ISI/PSQI; second, initiate evidence-based treatment for GAD with SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT, setting expectations and monitoring early tolerability; third, if sleep disturbance persists after 6–8 weeks, add CBT-I either in person or digitally, considering sequencing that places GAD treatment first in more severe anxiety; fourth, reserve benzodiazepines for short-term rescue in acute severe anxiety and avoid long-term use; fifth, tailor choices to comorbidities, age, pregnancy, and patient preference, and iterate based on response and functional outcomes [^a3da5290] [^12b204ea] [^774a10ff].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: sleep disruption is integral to GAD, highly prevalent, and bidirectionally linked via worry and hyperarousal; treating GAD improves sleep, and treating sleep can modestly improve anxiety, but high-quality RCTs of CBT-I specifically for comorbid GAD are limited; first-line care should prioritize SSRIs/SNRIs or CBT for GAD, with CBT-I added when insomnia persists, while avoiding routine benzodiazepine use and individualizing decisions to patient context and evolving response [^22d47397] [^12b204ea] [^01908ae8] [^774a10ff].

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with sleep disruption is common, with **sleep disturbance present in 70–90% of patients** and often persisting despite anxiety treatment [^22d47397] [^af0cc7d1]. Sleep problems in GAD include difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and early morning awakening, driven by worry-related hyperarousal and emotion dysregulation [^7680c55f] [^af0cc7d1]. Persistent insomnia worsens anxiety, increases relapse risk, and impairs functioning, so **targeted treatment is essential** [^4f7b421a] [^e3023748].

First-line management is **CBT for GAD**, which reduces anxiety and improves sleep even when sleep is not directly targeted [^7680c55f] [^63d5579f]. If insomnia persists, add **CBT-I**, which improves sleep and can reduce anxiety symptoms [^12b204ea] [^bb4c8e74]. Pharmacologically, SSRIs/SNRIs are first-line for GAD and can improve sleep over time; consider pregabalin or mirtazapine when sleep disruption is prominent or SSRIs/SNRIs are unsuitable [^addff970] [^fb48bd0a] [^5d11f079]. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine use due to dependence and safety risks; reserve for short-term rescue only [^774a10ff] [^7dfb64fd]. Addressing sleep disruption in GAD improves anxiety outcomes and quality of life, so **integrated care is recommended** [^4f7b421a] [^22d47397].

---

## Prevalence and clinical significance

- **High comorbidity**: Sleep disturbance is a core symptom of GAD, with 70–90% reporting insomnia symptoms [^notfound].
- **Persistent symptoms**: Sleep problems often persist despite anxiety treatment, indicating independent mechanisms [^af0cc7d1].
- **Functional impact**: Insomnia worsens anxiety severity, increases relapse risk, and impairs daily functioning [^4f7b421a] [^e3023748].

## Nature of sleep disturbances in GAD

Sleep disturbances in GAD include:

| **Sleep domain** | **Common complaints** |
|-|-|
| Sleep onset | Difficulty falling asleep due to racing thoughts and worry [^7680c55f] |
| Sleep maintenance | Frequent awakenings, restless sleep [^7680c55f] |
| Sleep offset | Early morning awakening, unrefreshing sleep [^7680c55f] |
| Daytime consequences | Fatigue, irritability, cognitive impairment [^a3da5290] |

---

## Mechanisms linking GAD and sleep disruption

- **Hyperarousal**: Heightened physiologic and cognitive arousal from worry delays sleep onset and fragments sleep [^22d47397].
- **Emotion dysregulation**: Difficulty managing emotions mediates the link between GAD and sleep problems [^af0cc7d1].
- **Bidirectional relationship**: Anxiety worsens sleep, and poor sleep amplifies anxiety, creating a vicious cycle [^22d47397] [^cb39a836].

---

## Impact on clinical outcomes

Sleep disruption in GAD is associated with:

- **Increased severity**: Greater anxiety symptom severity and functional impairment [^22d47397].
- **Relapse risk**: Higher risk of relapse and chronicity [^4f7b421a].
- **Quality of life**: Reduced health-related quality of life and increased disability [^22d47397].

---

## Evidence-based treatment strategies

### Psychological interventions

- **CBT for GAD**: Effective for anxiety and improves sleep even when sleep is not directly targeted [^7680c55f] [^63d5579f].
- **CBT-I**: First-line for persistent insomnia; improves sleep and can reduce anxiety symptoms [^12b204ea] [^bb4c8e74].
- **Digital CBT**: Effective and accessible options for delivering CBT-based interventions [^270ce620] [^bb4c8e74].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **SSRIs/SNRIs**: First-line for GAD; improve anxiety and sleep over time [^addff970] [^01908ae8].
- **Pregabalin**: Alternative agent with direct sleep benefits, useful when SSRIs/SNRIs are unsuitable [^fb48bd0a] [^5d11f079].
- **Mirtazapine**: Consider when anxiety and sleep disruption co-occur, especially with appetite/weight concerns [^notfound].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Not recommended for routine use; reserve for short-term rescue only due to dependence and safety risks [^774a10ff] [^7dfb64fd].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Integrated care**: Combine anxiety and sleep treatments for optimal outcomes [^4f7b421a].
- **Sequential approach**: Start with CBT for GAD; add CBT-I if insomnia persists [^b0ad6a37].
- **Patient education**: Explain the bidirectional link and the importance of treating both conditions [^22d47397].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Sleep disruption is a core feature of GAD, with high prevalence and significant functional impact. Treating both anxiety and insomnia yields the best outcomes, so **integrated, sequential care** — CBT for GAD followed by CBT-I if needed, with pharmacotherapy tailored to symptom profile — is recommended.

Sleep disturbances commonly are associated with anxiety disorders, in particular generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Sleep loss may exacerbate and contribute to relapse of these conditions. Core features of panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder occur in relation to sleep (sleep panic attacks or re-experiencing nightmares). Investigation of sleep in anxiety disorders provides clues to mechanisms of arousal regulation relevant to insomnia and pathologic anxiety. Established treatments for anxiety disorders and insomnia have many overlapping components; however, optimal sequencing and integration of the approaches remain under-investigated.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common and disabling illness that is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Patients with GAD are at increased risk for suicide as well as cardiovascular-related events and death. Most patients can be diagnosed and managed by primary care physicians. Symptoms include chronic, pervasive anxiety and worry accompanied by nonspecific physical and psychological symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbances). Effective treatments include psychotherapy (often cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacotherapy, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

### Refractory generalized anxiety disorder [^bb0d40b5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has a lifetime prevalence in the US population of about 5.7%. Typically, GAD begins in early adulthood and tends to have a chronic and persistent course. The disorder frequently presents comorbidly with other conditions, and about 90% of patients with GAD have at least 1 comorbid lifetime psychiatric disorder. Patients with GAD tend to be high users of medical services; the disorder is associated with significant physical as well as psychological symptomatology and impacts health, family relationships, and employment. Pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments are available for GAD. Different side effect profiles, speed of onset of action, and discontinuation requirements of individual drugs need to be taken into account when selecting treatment. Treatment selection should include consideration of comorbidity, psychological function, social impairment, and refractoriness, as well as the need for ongoing intervention for many individuals. Innovative treatments, including anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and others, as well as treatment targeting concomitant insomnia, may help improve outcomes for affected individuals.

### Generalized anxiety disorder in primary care: emerging issues in management and treatment [^c222c227]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is highly prevalent in primary care patients and is a source of major morbidity. The low rate of recognition and diagnosis of GAD is often the result of insufficient knowledge on the part of primary care physicians, time pressures, and competing demands during patients' visits. Patient attribution of symptoms and the stigma related to mental illness also contribute to underrecognition. Other contributing factors include the natural history of GAD, the bimodal age of presentation, a chronic but waxing and waning course, frequent comorbidity with other anxiety and depressive disorders, and the controversy regarding the best diagnostic criteria. However, proper diagnosis is critical to appropriate management. Primary care management of GAD and associated comorbidities includes education about the nature of GAD as a medical disorder that is amenable to treatment and counseling about treatment alternatives and coping strategies. Most patients with GAD suffer from insomnia, and treating insomnia can be of great benefit to them. While cognitive-behavioral therapy and relaxation therapy are effective in treating GAD, most patients in primary care settings are likely to require pharmacologic treatment. Although commonly used, benzodiazepines and their short-term benefits are overshadowed by their decreased long-term effectiveness, their minimal treatment of psychic symptoms, and their degradation of patient performance. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is indicated for the short-term treatment of GAD, although adequate data supporting the use of most SSRIs for GAD are not yet available. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine provides a treatment option resulting in both short- and long-term improvement of symptoms, attaining not only a response but also remission from GAD and prevention of relapse.

### A systematic review of sleep disturbance in anxiety and related disorders [^cb39a836]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Recent research suggests that sleep disturbance may be a transdiagnostic process, and there is increasing interest in examining how sleep disturbance may contribute to anxiety and related disorders. The current review summarizes and synthesizes the extant research assessing sleep in anxiety and related disorders. The findings suggest that sleep disturbance exacerbates symptom severity in the majority of anxiety and related disorders. However, the nature of sleep disturbance often varies as a function of objective versus subjective assessment. Although sleep disturbance is a correlate of most anxiety and related disorders, a causal role for sleep disturbance is less clear. A model of potential mechanisms by which sleep disturbance may confer risk for the development of anxiety and related disorders is discussed. Future research integrating findings from basic sleep research with current knowledge of anxiety and related disorders may facilitate the development of novel treatments for comorbid sleep disturbance and clinical anxiety.

The high prevalence and comorbidity of anxiety and sleep problems, especially insomnia, suggest an important underlying relationship between these disorders. In this article, we highlight two theoretical models explaining this co-occurrence, provide a brief update on the association between anxiety-insomnia and anxiety-cataplexy in general, and review more specifically sleep problems in generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder. We also explore sleep paralysis as an anxiety-sleep event. Our goal with this examination of selective anxiety-sleep problems is to provide clues about diagnostic and treatment approaches and frame strategies for future research.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The majority of individuals with anxiety disorders report poor sleep, and comorbidity rates with insomnia are estimated to be high, ranging from 45 to 70%. Not all anxiety disorders are equally comorbid with insomnia — those with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), compared to other anxiety disorders, are 140% more likely to also have sleep disturbance. This comorbidity is particularly worrisome, as the presence of poor sleep in addition to an anxiety disorder is associated with decreased health-related quality of life and increased disability.

Longitudinal data indicates that anxiety disorders are a risk factor for later insomnia, but not necessarily the other way around. A potential mechanism underlying the anxiety-insomnia association is the role of worry, which is a phenomenological feature of GAD and a critical element in the cognitive model of insomnia — namely, inappropriate worry about sleep and sleep-related consequences may lead to arousal, which perpetuates insomnia. This association has been demonstrated using daily process/ecological momentary assessment approaches. In a non-clinical sample, worry experienced on a particular day was found to predict increased sleep disturbance that night; however, in a sample with GAD, there was a bidirectional association between worry and sleep disturbance, suggesting a mutually maintaining relationship between worry and poor sleep among individuals with clinically significant anxiety.

1 INTRODUCTION

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a disorder characterized by excessive anxiety and worry, as well as associated symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, and/or sleep disturbance, which for a diagnosis to be made, need to have been present more days than not for at least 6 months (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Over the course of a life‐time, GAD tends to have a chronic nature. It is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders, with lifetime prevalence estimated internationally at approximately 6% (Bandelow & Michaelis, 2015; Remes et al. 2016). GAD is significantly and negatively associated with personal and health‐related quality of life (Olatunji et al. 2007; Saarni et al. 2007), appears to also have a significant societal impact (Wittchen, 2002), and is a highly comorbid disorder (Brown et al. 2001).

There are currently several forms of treatment recommended for GAD, including some form of antidepressant medication (Strawn et al. 2018). In terms of psychotherapy, several forms of therapy, particularly variations of cognitive‐behavioral therapies (CBTs) have been empirically supported (Behar et al. 2009). These therapies offer a variety of therapeutic strategies targeting beliefs around worry and emotional avoidance as present in patients with GAD. More recently, CBT transdiagnostic approaches have also been applied to patients with GAD (Barlow et al. 2017). In the context of calls to establish evidence for non‐CBT models (Hunot et al. 2007) and to increase patients' choice of treatment (Williams et al. 2016), noncognitive behavioral models have also emerged and are being evaluated (e.g. Keefe et al. 2014).

### A psychopharmacological treatment algorithm for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^5a04909f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is defined as excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about everyday life situations. It is a chronic disorder, and is associated with substantial somatisation, high rates of comorbid depression and other anxiety disorders, and significant disability. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy has continued to grow, and a wide range of drug choices for GAD now exists. Current guidelines for GAD generally restrict themselves to presentation of the evidence for various treatments, which, as a result, generally do not offer detailed discussion or recommendation of strategies beyond the first level of treatment, or take into account the individual circumstances of the patient. Thus, there is a lack of algorithm-based treatment guidelines for GAD. Our aim is, therefore, to present an algorithm for the psychopharmacologic management of GAD, intended for all clinicians who treat patients with GAD, where issues of pharmacotherapy are under consideration. We also hope that these GAD algorithms and other guidelines can help to identify high-priority areas that need further study. In this algorithm, we provide a sequenced approach to the pharmacotherapy of GAD, taking into account salient symptomatology and comorbidity, levels of evidence and extent of response. Special issues, including comorbidity, insomnia, suicidality, substance abuse, treatment adherence, pregnancy and lactation, cross-cultural issues, use of medication in the elderly, psychosocial treatment and dosing issues are also addressed.

Purpose of Review

With a focus on reviewing adequately powered randomized controlled trials, we present recent research on the potential of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to improve depression and anxiety outcomes among patients with insomnia and one of the following comorbid psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We also examine potential moderators of CBT-I on depression and anxiety outcomes in this population.

Recent Findings

Despite high comorbidity rates, current behavioral and pharmacological treatments for MDD, GAD, and PTSD do not substantially target or improve insomnia symptoms; residual insomnia is exceedingly common even among patients who experience remission. Insomnia plays a critical role in the onset and maintenance of depression and anxiety, and treating insomnia with CBT-I may improve global outcomes for patients with MDD, GAD, and PTSD.

Summary

CBT-I is superior to traditional depression/anxiety treatment in improving insomnia symptoms among patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Results are mixed on whether CBT-I (either alone or augmented with depression/anxiety treatment) is effective in improving overall MDD, GAD, and PTSD outcomes. Evening circadian preference and depression/anxiety symptom severity may moderate the effect of CBT-I on depression and anxiety outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of generalized anxiety… [^803ef1e2]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are among the most common mental disorders in the United States and are often encountered by primary care physicians. The hallmark of GAD is excessive, out-of-control worry, and PD is characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks. Both conditions can negatively impact a patient's quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living. The rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high, with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes. 1 The etiology of GAD is not well understood. There are several theoretical models, each with varying degrees of empirical support. An underlying theme to several models is the dysregulation of worry. Emerging evidence suggests that patients with GAD may experience persistent activation of areas of the brain associated with mental activity and introspective thinking following worry-inducing stimuli.

2 Twin studies suggest that environmental and genetic factors are likely involved. 3 The etiology of PD is also not well understood. The neuroanatomical hypothesis suggests that a genetic-environment interaction is likely responsible. Patients with PD may exhibit irregularities in specific brain structures, altered neuronal processes, and dysfunctional corticolimbic interaction during emotional processing. 14 Smoking cessation leads to improved anxiety scores, with relapse leading to increased anxiety. Many studies show an association between disordered sleep and anxiety, but causality is unclear. 15 In addition to decreased depression and anxiety, physical activity is associated with improved physical health, life satisfaction, cognitive functioning, and psychological well-being. Physical activity is a cost-effective approach in the treatment of GAD and PD.

16, 17 Exercising at 60% to 90% of maximal heart rate for 20 minutes three times weekly has been shown to decrease anxiety 16; yoga is also effective.
18. 11 Some patients will require longer treatment. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety, but there is a dose-response relationship associated with tolerance, sedation, confusion, and increased mortality. Its rapid onset can be appealing for patients needing immediate relief, and it may be a more appropriate alternative if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Based on clinical experience, gabapentin is sometimes prescribed by psychiatrists to treat anxiety on an as-needed basis when benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Of note, the placebo response for medications used to treat GAD and PD is high. 13.

### Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder among adults… [^811bd7c0]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry that is difficult to control accompanied by physical symptoms including restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance. The GAD–7 scale is a validated brief self-report measure to screen for GAD and assess the severity of symptoms. NOTES: Severity of anxiety symptoms was based on the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale and summarized into none or minimal, mild, moderate, and severe. Those categorized as having no or minimal symptoms of anxiety are not shown in this figure. Summary During 2019, about one in six adults aged 18 and over experienced symptoms of anxiety in the past 2 weeks that were either mild, moderate, or severe. Severity of symptoms of GAD differed by sociodemographic characteristics.

The GAD–7 scale is a validated brief self-report measure which was developed to screen for GAD and assess the severity of its symptoms. A score of 10 or higher, corresponding to moderate and severe symptoms of GAD, may suggest the presence of a clinically significant anxiety condition that warrants further evaluation, including a diagnostic interview and mental status examination by a mental health professional. This report showed that 6. 1% of adults scored 10 or higher on the GAD–7 scale. Severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms: Based on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale and summarized into no or minimal, mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of GAD.

Sample adults were asked how often they have been bothered by the following symptoms in the past 2 weeks: "Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; " "Not being able to stop or control worrying; " "Worrying too much about different things; " "Trouble relaxing; " "Being so restless that it's hard to sit still; " "Becoming easily annoyed or irritable; " and "Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen".

Overall, evidence indicates that CBT-I is safe at likely effective in improving insomnia symptoms among patients with GAD, and there is some indication that improvement in anxiety symptoms prior to conducting CBT-I may improve outcomes for both insomnia and anxiety. However, any conclusions about the efficacy of CBT-I in treating comorbid GAD and insomnia must be considered with caution — while there is empirical support for the link between anxiety and sleep, further research is needed to determine if CBT-I can effectively treat both conditions in this population.

### The role of insomnia in depression and anxiety: its impact on functioning, treatment, and outcomes [^4f7b421a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a common yet often unrecognized symptom in patients with depression and anxiety. Because of its association with functional impairment, medical conditions, and disturbances in multiple body systems, insomnia must be included in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. If left untreated, insomnia may increase the risk of episode recurrence, severe illness course, and poor treatment response. However, these risks may be diminished with effective insomnia treatment.

### Targeted behavioral therapy for childhood generalized anxiety disorder: a time-series analysis of changes in anxiety and sleep [^4287d624]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

This study examined the efficacy of Targeted Behavioral Therapy (TBT), a newly developed intervention targeting features of childhood generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Using a time-series design, 4 children (7–12 years) with primary GAD were treated with TBT, which includes sleep improvement strategies, systematic desensitization for reducing intolerance of uncertainty, and in vivo exposures for anxiety. Diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were administered at baseline, post-treatment and 3 months follow-up. Anxiety symptoms and sleep characteristics/problems were rated weekly during a 4-week baseline and 14-weeks of treatment. Two children remitted at post-treatment and no child had a GAD diagnosis at follow-up. Child but not parent report revealed improvements in both worry and sleep. Despite improvements from pre- to post-assessment, considerable symptom fluctuation observed during the baseline period preclude conclusion that symptom changes are specifically attributable to the course of treatment. Overall, preliminary support is provided for the efficacy of TBT for childhood GAD.

### Moderators of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia on depression and anxiety outcomes [^12b204ea]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insomnia is a common clinical condition with severe health consequences — prevalence rates range from 10 to 20% of the adult population for insomnia disorder, and 35 to 50% for insomnia symptoms. Insomnia disorder, as defined by the DSM-5, is characterized by a dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity due to difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, resulting in clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. However, insomnia symptoms are listed in the diagnostic criteria for many other psychiatric disorders, and estimates suggest that individuals with insomnia are five times as likely to present with anxiety or depression compared to individuals without insomnia.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is the first-line treatment for insomnia, recommended before pharmacotherapy — it is the most widely used and widely studied non-drug treatment for insomnia. A large body of research has supported the efficacy of CBT-I in treating chronic insomnia in adults without comorbidities; additionally, recent studies have indicated that CBT-I may also effectively treat insomnia in children and adolescents, pregnant people, older adults, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions. Drawing directly from basic science on sleep and circadian rhythms, CBT-I combines multiple treatment elements including sleep education, stimulus control techniques, sleep restriction techniques, and cognitive therapy.

Given the high comorbidity rates of insomnia with depression and anxiety, and considering the various limitations of current evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety, there has been an increase in research on utilizing CBT-I to improve depression and anxiety outcomes in comorbid samples. Focusing on reviewing randomized controlled trials, we present the literature on CBT-I for patients with insomnia as well one of the following comorbid psychiatric disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Finally, in order to better understand why some — but not all — patients experience improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms following CBT-I, we highlight recent research on moderators of treatment outcomes among comorbid samples and suggest promising avenues for future research.

### Emotion dysregulation and sleep difficulties in generalized anxiety disorder [^af0cc7d1]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) include sleep problems, which often persist even after successful treatment of the disorder. The purpose of this study was to examine emotion dysregulation as a potential contributor to sleep problems in GAD patients. Participants comprised two groups: 59 individuals diagnosed with GAD and 66 healthy controls. They were assessed for the presence of mood and anxiety disorders and then completed self-report questionnaires assessing problems with sleep and emotion regulation. Participants in the GAD group scored significantly higher on a number of sleep outcomes than did the control group. Importantly, difficulties with emotion regulation statistically mediated the relationship between GAD and a wide range of outcomes of sleep dysfunction independently of the effects of depression and secondary anxiety diagnoses. Emotion regulation difficulties that characterize GAD mediate the relationship between symptoms of this disorder and a wide range of sleep problems. Implications for treatment and future research directions are discussed.

### Sleep and anxiety: from mechanisms to interventions [^ad982911]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Anxiety is the most common mental health problem worldwide. Epidemiological studies show that sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, affect ∼50% of individuals with anxiety, and that insufficient sleep can instigate or further exacerbate it. This review outlines brain mechanisms underlying sleep and anxiety, by addressing recent human functional/structural imaging studies on brain networks underlying the anxiogenic impact of sleep loss, and the beneficial effect of sleep on these brain networks. We discuss recent developments from human molecular imaging studies that highlight the role of specific brain neurotransmitter mechanisms, such as the adenosinergic receptor system, on anxiety, arousal, and sleep. This review further discusses frontline sleep interventions aimed at enhancing sleep in individuals experiencing anxiety, such as nonbenzodiazepines/antidepressants, lifestyle and sleep interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Notwithstanding therapeutic success, up to ∼30% of individuals with anxiety can be nonresponsive to frontline treatments. Thus, we address novel non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that can enhance electroencephalographic slow waves, and might help alleviate sleep and anxiety symptoms. Collectively, these findings contribute to an emerging biological framework that elucidates the interrelationship between sleep and anxiety, and highlight the prospect of slow wave sleep as a potential therapeutic target for reducing anxiety.

### Efficacy of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for moderate-to-severe symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^270ce620]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Digital CBT may provide a scalable means of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life.

Methods

This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10).

Results

Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life.

Conclusion

Digital CBT (Daylight) appears to be safe and efficacious for symptoms of anxiety, worry, and further measures of mental health compared with waitlist control in individuals with GAD.

### Cognitive behavior therapy for generalized anxiety disorder among older adults in primary care: a randomized clinical trial [^63d5579f]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can be effective for late-life generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but only pilot studies have been conducted in primary care, where older adults most often seek treatment.

Objective

To examine effects of CBT relative to enhanced usual care (EUC) in older adults with GAD in primary care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial recruiting 134 older adults (mean age, 66.9 years) from March 2004 to August 2006 in 2 primary care settings. Treatment was provided for 3 months; assessments were conducted at baseline, posttreatment (3 months), and over 12 months of follow-up, with assessments at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months.

Intervention

Cognitive behavior therapy (n = 70) conducted in the primary care clinics. Treatment included education and awareness, motivational interviewing, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, exposure, problem-solving skills training, and behavioral sleep management. Patients assigned to receive EUC (n = 64) received biweekly telephone calls to ensure patient safety and provide minimal support.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes included worry severity (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and GAD severity (GAD Severity Scale). Secondary outcomes included anxiety ratings (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory), coexistent depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II), and physical/mental health quality of life (12-Item Short Form Health Survey).

Results

Cognitive behavior therapy compared with EUC significantly improved worry severity (45.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 43.4–47.8] vs 54.4 [95% CI, 51.4–57.3], respectively; P < .001), depressive symptoms (10.2 [95% CI, 8.5–11.9] vs 12.8 [95% CI, 10.5–15.1], P = 0.02), and general mental health (49.6 [95% CI, 47.4–51.8] vs 45.3 [95% CI, 42.6–47.9], P = 0.008). There was no difference in GAD severity in patients receiving CBT vs those receiving EUC (8.6 [95% CI, 7.7–9.5] vs 9.9 [95% CI, 8.7–11.1], P = 0.19). In intention-to-treat analyses, response rates defined according to worry severity were higher following CBT compared with EUC at 3 months (40.0% [28/70] vs 21.9% [14/64], P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Compared with EUC, CBT resulted in greater improvement in worry severity, depressive symptoms, and general mental health for older patients with GAD in primary care. However, a measure of GAD severity did not indicate greater improvement with CBT.

Trial Registration

### Ramelteon for insomnia symptoms in a community sample of adults with generalized anxiety disorder: an open label study [^0baf86cf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Prior research confirms the relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression. The effectiveness and tolerability of ramelteon was examined in adult generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients with insomnia symptoms.

Methods

Twenty-seven adults with sleep disturbance meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for GAD and partially responsive on an SSRI or SNRI by randomization visit (as signified by a Hamilton Anxiety scale [HAMA] maximum score of 15 and minimum of 8, Clinical Global Impressions Severity of Illness [CGI-S] scale of ≤ 4 and ≥ 2 [measuring anxiety symptoms], CGI-S of 4 [measuring insomnia symptoms], ≥ 5 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI], and ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) were treated openly for 10 weeks on ramelteon 8 mg at bedtime. Analysis was conducted using repeated measures methodology. Patient reported sleep diaries were maintained throughout the study.

Results

Significant symptom reduction was observed on all scales (HAMA, ESS, CGI-I, CGI-S), with subjects falling asleep faster and sleeping longer. Headache upon stopping ramelteon, daytime tiredness, agitation, and depression were the most commonly reported side effects and were cited as transient.

Conclusion

Data from this 12-week open-label study suggests ramelteon is an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for insomnia symptoms in this community sample of adults with GAD.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^f52ba74d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

The mirtazapine (MIR) trial investigated the effectiveness of the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI in 480 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) recruited from primary care. Treatment-resistance was defined pragmatically as failure to respond to at least six weeks of an SSRI/SNRI at an adequate dose; in the event, 90% of patients in MIR had been on antidepressants for more than six months. The MIR trial did not find evidence of a meaningful clinical difference between Beck Depression Inventory score (BDI-II) scores at 12 weeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (adjusted difference between means (ADM) −1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.92 to 0.27, primary outcome). It did, however, find a small difference in GAD-7 scores at 12 weeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (ADM 0.98, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93, secondary outcome), although it is not clear whether this is clinically meaningful. GAD-7 is a questionnaire which captures the features of GAD – a syndrome with the core symptoms of excessive, difficult to control and disruptive anxiety and worry with associated features such as restlessness and lack of sleep. Similarly PANDA, a recent primary care trial of sertraline for depression, showed clear improvements in generalized anxiety, despite less convincing evidence of a superior antidepressant effect compared with placebo.

The frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety means targeted prescribing for this group is a potentially valuable objective. The MIR participants had high levels of generalized anxiety, with 48.6% scoring greater than 10 on GAD-7 at baseline, the normal cut-off point for screening for GAD. This is consistent with the previous research finding that 46% of those with depression have moderate to severe anxiety. The MIR trial thus represents an important resource to examine a possible rationale for targeted prescribing in a common and difficult to manage cohort. Using data from the MIR trial, we aimed to investigate whether there was a differential effect on generalized anxiety and depression symptoms at 12 weeks according to baseline severity of generalized anxiety. Because there is evidence of mirtazapine's effectiveness in anxiety disorders and preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in depression with anxiety symptoms, we hypothesized that mirtazapine may be more effective in individuals within the MIR trial with greater generalized anxiety symptoms at baseline.

### The Pittsburgh sleep quality index in older primary care patients with generalized anxiety disorder: psychometrics and outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapy [^7fbbb0ff]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used, comprehensive self-report measure of sleep quality and impairment, which has demonstrated good psychometric properties within various populations, including older adults. However, the psychometric properties of the PSQI and its component scores have not been evaluated for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Additionally, changes in PSQI global or component scores have not been reported following cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) of late-life GAD. This study examined (1) the psychometric properties of the PSQI within a sample of 216 elderly primary care patients age 60 or older with GAD who were referred for treatment of worry and/or anxiety; as well as (2) response to CBT, relative to usual care, for 134 patients with principal or coprincipal GAD. The PSQI demonstrated good internal consistency reliability and adequate evidence of construct validity. Those receiving CBT experienced greater reductions in PSQI global scores at post-treatment, relative to those receiving usual care. Further, PSQI global and component scores pertaining to sleep quality and difficulties falling asleep (i.e., sleep latency and sleep disturbances) demonstrated response to treatment over a 12-month follow-up period. Overall, results highlight the usefulness of the PSQI global and component scores for use in older adults with GAD.

### Sleep, circadian rhythms, and anxious traits [^b0c9275d]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Anxiety is adaptive and plays an important role in keeping us safe. However, when anxiety becomes too extreme, it can cause significant disruptions and distress. Understanding the mechanisms underlying excessive anxiety and how to best treat it is a priority for researchers and clinicians. There is increasing recognition that disruptions in the amount and timing of sleep are associated with anxiety symptoms and characteristics. In the current paper, we explore the intersections between sleep, circadian rhythms, and anxiety. First, we review accumulating evidence that anxiety is associated with disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms in both clinical and nonclinical samples and across ages. Next, we discuss the data linking sleep disruptions with anxiety-related traits (anxiety sensitivity, neuroticism, and perfectionism) and patterns of cognition and emotion. Finally, potential treatment implications are highlighted. Overall, these data suggest that delineating the role of disruptions in the amount and timing of sleep holds promise for improving the lives of individuals with heightened anxiety.

### Insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder: effects of cognitive behavior therapy for gad on insomnia symptoms [^7680c55f]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Although clinical practice suggests that sleep complaints are frequent among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), frequency, severity, types of insomnia complaints, and relationship to GAD diagnosis severity in patients diagnosed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria are not well documented. Clinical data about the impact on insomnia symptoms of treating GAD worries are also lacking. The present study examined these aspects in 44 GAD patients who participated in a treatment study specifically addressing excessive worries through CBT interventions. All patients were assessed using a structured clinical interview and the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV). They also completed anxiety and insomnia inventories, including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a self-report measure which assesses insomnia type, severity and interference with daily life. Among this sample, 47.7% reported difficulties initiating sleep, 63.6% reported difficulties maintaining sleep, and 56.8% complained of waking too early in the morning. The majority of these patients (86.5%) reported never having experienced insomnia without having excessive worries. However, insomnia severity and GAD severity were not correlated. In this sample, patients with severe GAD did not necessarily report more severe insomnia symptoms. Regarding treatment impact on insomnia complaints, ISI post-treatment scores were significantly lower after treatment. Mean post-treatment scores almost reached ISI's "absence of clinical insomnia" category. Results indicate that this CBT package for GAD does have a significant impact on sleep quality even if sleep disturbances were not specifically addressed during treatment.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^d705e6dc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks. This guidance reflects the general lack of evidence for the long-term clinical benefit of BZDs, as well as research demonstrating that the clinical benefits may decrease over time while the risks persist. – Meta-analyses of patients taking BZDs for insomnia demonstrated minor improvements in sleep onset, increased sleep duration, and decreased nighttime awakenings. However, therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks due to changes in BZD receptor density and/or affinity resulting from chronic use, while risks remain present. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BZDs to placebo for insomnia in adults over age 60 showed a 3.8-fold increase in daytime sedation, a 4.8-fold increase in cognitive impairment, and a 2.6 fold increase in incidence of psychomotor effects (e.g. falls, motor vehicle accidents). Another meta-analysis showed an increased risk of hip fractures (RR 1.34) associated with current and recent BZD use in older adults. In addition to its psychomotor effects, BZDs may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension in older adults, which also contributes to fall risks.

Although long-term BZD use should generally be avoided, exceptions do exist. For example, long-term BZD use may be indicated in patients with severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or bipolar spectrum disorders. – Long-term BZD use may also be appropriate for medical conditions such as complex seizure disorders, spasticity, sleep disorders involving abnormal movements (e.g. rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome), and catatonia. Finally, BZDs have a role in palliative and end-of-life care. In any of these patient populations, clinicians should consider consulting with an appropriate specialist to determine whether BZD tapering is indicated and manage the process when it is.

### Tiagabine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized, open-label, clinical trial with paroxetine as a positive control [^085afaac]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of anxiety. Tiagabine, a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor, enhances normal GABA tone. This 10-week, randomized, open-label trial evaluated tiagabine in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with paroxetine serving as a positive control.

Method

Adult patients with DSM-IV GAD were randomly assigned to receive either tiagabine or paroxetine. Tiagabine was initiated at 4 mg/day (2 mg morning and evening) during week 1. Between weeks 2 and 6, the dose was individually titrated in 2-mg increments (maximum increase of 4 mg/week) for optimal response to a maximum dose of 16 mg/day (8 mg morning and evening). During weeks 7 through 10, patients received the dosage determined during the titration period. Paroxetine was initiated at 20 mg nightly for the first week and similarly titrated in 10-mg increments to a maximum dose of 60 mg/day. Assessments included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).

Results

Forty patients were enrolled (tiagabine, N = 20; paroxetine, N = 20). Mean final doses were tiagabine 10 mg/day (range, 4–16 mg/day) or paroxetine 27 mg/day (range, 20–40 mg/day). Tiagabine and paroxetine significantly reduced anxiety (HAM-A and HADS total and anxiety subscales). Although patients were not diagnosed with a mood disorder, both tiagabine and paroxetine reduced comorbid depressive symptoms (HAM-D total and HADS total and depressive subscale). Tiagabine and paroxetine significantly improved sleep quality (PSQI) and functioning (SDS). Both tiagabine and paroxetine were well tolerated.

Conclusion

The selective GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine and the positive control paroxetine significantly reduced anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms, improved sleep quality and functioning, and were well tolerated in patients with GAD. Tiagabine may be a therapeutic option for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

### Pharmacological approaches to the treatment of residual symptoms [^d443b208]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the efficacy of currently available antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are common among individuals treated for major depressive disorder and are associated with an increased risk of relapse and poor psychosocial functioning. However, distinguishing treatment-emergent side effects from residual symptoms can be challenging for clinicians. Anxiety, sleep disturbance, somnolence/fatigue, apathy and cognitive dysfunction are among the more frequent residual symptoms. Approaches to the management of residual symptoms include addressing treatment-emergent side effects and co-morbid conditions, optimizing antidepressant dosing and using augmentation therapy. Clinicians are often guided in their decisions by anecdotal impressions. Studies assessing the evaluation and treatment of residual symptoms and side effects will contribute importantly to the optimal acute and long-term management of depression.

### (Re) conceptualizing sleep among children with anxiety disorders: where to next? [^c338467e]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2018). Low credibility.

Children with anxiety disorders (AD) characteristically complain of sleep problems and the extent to which cognitive behavioral treatments (CBT) for childhood anxiety produce sleep-based improvements is a topic of increasing interest. The current paper reviews available evidence for subjective sleep complaints and objective sleep alterations in children and adolescents with AD, including investigations of potential changes in sleep following anxiety-focused CBT. Despite pervasive complaints of poor sleep, the empirical literature provides minimal evidence for actual sleep-wake alterations in this population of youth and evidence for sleep-based changes following treatment for anxiety is minimal. In line with calls for more comprehensive models of the role of sleep in developmental psychopathology, several fundamental gaps in understanding are described and highlighted as essential avenues for clarifying the nature and consequences of poor quality sleep among youth with clinical levels of anxiety. In a second section of the paper, an emerging body of novel, translational research investigating more intricate sleep-anxiety relationships is introduced with potential implications for both etiological models and treatment design and delivery.

### Digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia on depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb4c8e74]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been an effective non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia. It is a multi-component, evidence-based treatment and is considered the first-line approach including cognitive restructuring, sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, and relaxation. Due to the association between insomnia and depression, CBT-I has been viewed an effective approach for managing depression. A systematic review of CBT-I to treat depression revealed CBT-I as a promising treatment for depression comorbid with insomnia, with in-person CBT-I delivery having the most supporting evidence in its efficacy among 18 studies that included CBT-I, prescription medication or sleep hygiene as its treatment methods. In addition, study findings suggest that insomnia improvement from CBT-I may also mediate the reduction in depressive symptoms. Likewise, in addition to depression, CBT-I demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms. These findings indicate that CBT-I is not only effective for treating insomnia and sleep-related disorders but also for treating comorbid mental disorders including depression and anxiety.

Whilst such a traditional approach of CBT-I has been proven effective, there are certain limitations of this therapeutic method including the lack of therapists, time and geographical limitations, and high costs. With the advent of technology, digital CBT-I (dCBT-I), which is the implementation of technology in computers, the internet, smartphone applications, and other devices in healthcare service have been developed and researched over the last decade. dCBT-I programs are not only structured with the main key components of CBT-I but also provide additional levels of personalized support to enhance user engagement, including the use of email reminders, alerts, etc. Furthermore, dCBT-I users can evaluate their sleep status through online sleep diaries, questionnaires, or syncing with other devices such as wrist-worn actigraphs, to track certain sleep patterns and collect the ecological momentary assessment. A meta-analysis found that internet-based CBT-I had significantly improved insomnia severity and sleep parameters in addition to comorbid factors of depression and anxiety, maintaining such improvements at a 6-month follow-up. According to these results, dCBT-I is an effective treatment alternative for insomnia, both in terms of clinical effectiveness and positive user satisfaction whilst also demonstrating that the treatment was effective in improving comorbid anxiety and depression with a mild strength.

### Generalized anxiety disorder: practical assessment and management [^61886169]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder is common among patients in primary care. Affected patients experience excessive chronic anxiety and worry about events and activities, such as their health, family, work, and finances. The anxiety and worry are difficult to control and often lead to physiologic symptoms, including fatigue, muscle tension, restlessness, and other somatic complaints. Other psychiatric problems (e.g., depression) and nonpsychiatric factors (e.g., endocrine disorders, medication adverse effects, withdrawal) must be considered in patients with possible generalized anxiety disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy and the first-line pharmacologic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are effective treatments. However, evidence suggests that the effects of cognitive behavior therapy may be more durable. Although complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used, their effectiveness has not been proven in generalized anxiety disorder. Selection of the most appropriate treatment should be based on patient preference, treatment success history, and other factors that could affect adherence and subsequent effectiveness.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^98062d31]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as defined in DSM-IV. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of GAD was established in two 8-week placebo-controlled trials in adults with GAD. Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following 6 symptoms: Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

The efficacy of paroxetine in maintaining a response in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, who responded during an 8-week acute treatment phase while taking paroxetine and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 24 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^e8e5d907]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

### Treatment for anxiety and substance use disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: challenges and strategies [^cc409bfb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate existing anxiety and substance use disorders (SUDs) and increase vulnerability among individuals previously free of these conditions. Numerous pandemic-related stressors-coronavirus infection fears, social distancing and isolation, activity restrictions, financial insecurity and unemployment, caregiving or childcare responsibilities-place a substantial burden both on the general population and on many health care providers. Anxiety symptoms such as worry, tension, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disruption are increasingly prevalent. For individuals in SUD treatment, anxiety can complicate efforts to achieve treatment goals. In this commentary, we outline the potential impact of anxiety on substance use problems during the COVID-19 crisis and describe key behavioral, pharmacological, and digital health treatment considerations. We highlight populations of special concern due to heightened vulnerability and challenges accessing services, strategies to support health care providers, and directions for future research.

### Effects of extended-release quetiapine fumarate on long-term functioning and sleep quality in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): data from a randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled maintenance study [^3f03e9d2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This analysis evaluated effects of quetiapine XR maintenance treatment on functioning and sleep in patients with GAD.

Methods

Analysis of patient-reported data from a randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine XR monotherapy in GAD. Following open-label run-in (4–8 weeks) and a 12-18-week stabilization phase (quetiapine XR 50, 150, or 300 mg/day), eligible patients were randomized to continue on quetiapine XR or receive placebo for up to 52 weeks. Primary variable was time to an anxiety event. Secondary variables included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Results

In total, 432 patients were randomized (quetiapine XR, N = 216; placebo, N = 216). The risk of an anxiety event was significantly reduced for quetiapine XR vs. placebo (HR 0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.31; p < 0.001). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining SDS total scores (LSM change: -0.19 vs. 1.01; p = 0.017) and non-work-related SDS domain score 'family life/home responsibilities' (-0.13 vs. 0.32; p = 0.011), but not 'social life' (0.05 vs. 0.34; p = 0.114). Quetiapine XR was more effective than placebo at maintaining the work-related SDS domain score 'days lost' (-0.05 vs. 0.11; p = 0.027), but not 'work/school' (-0.10 vs. 0.29; p = 0.051) or 'days underproductive' (0.06 vs. 0.13; p = 0.619). PSQI global scores were reduced from randomization with quetiapine XR vs. placebo (0.39 vs. 1.60; p < 0.001).

Limitations

Lack of active-comparator arm, exclusion of patients with comorbid depression.

Conclusions

In patients with GAD, long-term treatment with quetiapine XR (50–300 mg/day) monotherapy was effective at maintaining improvements in functioning and sleep quality.

### CLINICAL PRACTICE. generalized anxiety disorder [^ac79ac21]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on generalized anxiety disorder:

- **Definition**: GAD is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a number of events or activities (such as work, home, and social) symptoms, and tension, which an individual finds difficult to control.
- **Pathophysiology**: GAD is mostly caused by genetic (altered DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism) and environmental factors (stress, trauma, etc.).
- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 GAD in the US is estimated at 7,800 cases per 100,000 individuals.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include restless feeling, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, arguments with relatives or friends, difficulty/inability to complete tasks, restriction of usual activities, with associated autonomic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary symptoms decreasing the overall health of the individual. GAD is associated with various comorbidities including depression, dysthymia, bipolar I and II, panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, substance use disorder, and personality disorders (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and antisocial).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anxiety disorders are associated with an increased risk of death with a natural mortality rate ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.28–1.51) and an unnatural mortality rate ratio of 2.46 (95% CI 2.20–2.73).

### Effect of interventions for the management of sleep disturbances in patients with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1aa9be6d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Long COVID is a complex condition characterized by more than 200 documented symptomsthat persist or develop following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. This multisystemic disease affects various bodily functions and causes significant neurological and psychological distress. According to the World Health Organization, 10–20% of COVID-19 patients go on to develop long COVID. With over 65 million cases reported worldwide as of 2023, long COVID presents challenges across all demographics, with particular prevalence in females and adults aged 18 years and older, regardless of the initial infection's severity.

Long COVID has many definitions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, patients with long COVID experience a "range of ongoing symptoms and conditions" lasting at least 3 months postinfection. The National Center for Infectious Diseases describes it as a group of symptoms in recovered COVID-19 patients that "persist or emerge four weeks after the initial infection". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence further defines long COVID as symptoms developing during or after infection that prolong for "more than 12 weeks" and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Additionally, the World Health Organization characterizes long COVID as the persistence or emergence of new symptoms 3 months after initial infection, lasting at least 2 months without any other explanation.

Among the neurological and psychological symptoms reported, sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent. Sleep disturbances encompass disorders that disrupt normal sleep patterns, classified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition into 6 major categories: insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnolence and narcolepsy, circadian rhythm disorders, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Studies on long COVID–associated sleep disturbances have identified common issues such as insomnia, frequent awakenings, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Chinvararak and Chalderfound that about 46% of patients with long COVID experienced sleep disturbances, with insomnia affecting 38%. Similarly, Seighali et al'smeta-analysis reported a 45% prevalence of sleep disorders among 15,362 patients. If not adequately managed, these disturbances can impair physical, psychological and social health, increase anxietyand dyspnoea, and significantly reduce quality of life.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^7faf44c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline — combination cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (recommendation 3) suggests (2C) that combination treatment (CBT and an SSRI) could be offered preferentially over CBT alone or an SSRI alone to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, two RCTs compared combination treatment to either treatment alone and these 2 studies included 550 patients (52.6% male; mean age 12.2 years, range 7–17 years). Compared to CBT alone and to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline improved primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), whereas combination CBT plus fluoxetine did not separate from CBT alone for global function, secondary measures, or response to treatment (all low SOE) and may have reduced remission of disorder compared to CBT alone (low SOE). For adverse effects (AEs), combination CBT plus sertraline did not differ from CBT alone with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all low SOE) but increased AEs related to behavior activation (moderate SOE) and increased any AEs and AEs related to sleep (both low SOE); compared to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline decreased AEs related to behavior activation and reduced AEs due to fatigue/somnolence (both moderate SOE), and insufficient evidence precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior. Because there were only two studies with conflicting results, the AHRQ/Mayo review did not find definitive evidence for the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy, yet expert consensus generally supports the prioritization of combination treatment; in CAMS, youths who received combination treatment had significantly higher rates of remission than monotherapy with SSRI or CBT or placebo at week 12 and week 24, and in clinical practice, combination treatment may be favored if there is a need for acute symptom reduction in a severe, functionally impairing disorder or a partial response to monotherapy. Combination treatment typically involves concurrent administration of psychotherapy and medication, optimally delivered in the same facility to enhance convenience and provider communication, and naturalistic follow-up (CAMELS) failed to demonstrate long-term maintenance of treatment effects by original randomized treatment while initial response — significantly superior in the combination treatment — was a strong predictor of long-term outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults [^25cce5d5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are among the most common mental disorders in the United States, and they can negatively impact a patient's quality of life and disrupt important activities of daily living. Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high, with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes. Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions. Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy. The GAD-7 and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools. Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient. Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or psychotherapy, both of which are highly effective. Among psychotherapeutic treatments, cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has an extensive evidence base. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, but their use is limited by risk of abuse and adverse effect profiles. Physical activity can reduce symptoms of GAD and PD. A number of complementary and alternative treatments are often used; however, evidence is limited for most. Several common botanicals and supplements can potentiate serotonin syndrome when used in combination with antidepressants. Medication should be continued for 12 months before tapering to prevent relapse.

### Moderators of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia on depression and anxiety outcomes [^b0ad6a37]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Given this connection between worry and sleep, treating insomnia among individuals with GAD may be a fruitful opportunity for overall symptom reduction — however, there is currently no adequately powered randomized controlled trial of CBT-I among patients with comorbid GAD and insomnia. Belleville et al. compared the efficacy of two treatment sequences (CBT-I followed by CBT-GAD vs. CBT-GAD followed by CBT-I) in a sample of 10 women with comorbid GAD and insomnia. Results indicated that participants who first received CBT-GAD had superior outcomes on anxiety and sleep — however, most participants who were initially treated with CBT-GAD also experienced additional improvements in both anxiety and sleep following CBT-I. Jansson-Fröjmark and Jacobson (2021) conducted an open trial of CBT-I for 24 adults with comorbid GAD and insomnia, finding moderate to large effect sizes on insomnia and GAD symptoms, as well as depression, functional impairment, and quality of life. Compared to Belleville et al. Jansson-Fröjmark and Jacobson (2021) found stronger effects of CBT-I on anxiety symptoms, possibly due to the emphasis on cognitive components in their implementation of the treatment. Notably, only 26.1% of the patients reached insomnia remission at follow-up, a rate much lower than prior studies among patients with insomnia only (~ 56%), suggesting that clinically significant anxiety symptoms might hinder the efficacy of CBT-I. While there may be some promise in CBT-I as a treatment for GAD, neither of the two trials described above were adequately powered or included a control condition — therefore, any conclusions but be considered with caution.

To our knowledge, the two studies with adults described above are the only trials of CBT-I specifically for patients with comorbid GAD and insomnia. A few open trials have assessed the efficacy of CBT-I (often digital CBT-I) in improving anxiety and insomnia symptoms among adolescents from community samples, with mixed results. In the Aslund et al. (2020) open pilot of individual in-person CBT-I among 23 adolescents, anxiety symptoms significantly improved after treatment, but the post-treatment mean anxiety score was above the clinical cutoff. In the Cliffe et al. (2020) open trial of digital CBT-I among 39 adolescents seeking mental health services, there was a post-treatment reduction in anxiety symptoms (with 51% of the sample having clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety at baseline).

### Sleep in the anxiety-related disorders: a meta-analysis of subjective and objective research [^69ed596b]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Although sleep disturbance is implicated in psychopathology, its role in anxiety-related disorders remains unclear. The present meta-analysis characterizes sleep disturbance in anxiety-related disorders collectively and individually. Subjective measures of total sleep time and sleep continuity were included with objective measures. Results indicate a large effect for increased subjective sleep disturbance (g = 2.16), medium effects for decreased total sleep time (g = -.40) and sleep continuity (g = -.49), and a small effect for decreased sleep depth (g = -.20) in anxiety-related disorders compared to healthy controls. Each anxiety-related disorder exhibited a distinct sleep disturbance pattern, suggesting that sleep may facilitate identification of unique biopsychological underpinnings. Effects were not moderated by comorbid depression and were similar in magnitude to those found for depression. Sleep disturbances, particularly decreased sleep continuity, may be a key pathology in the anxiety-related disorders that could highlight novel etiological mechanisms and intervention targets.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^e9f183a5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions. The CGC noted that distinguishing BZD withdrawal symptoms from recurrence of symptoms related to underlying conditions can be difficult. Based on clinical experience, symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage changes and/or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper are more likely to be related to BZD withdrawal. However, if symptoms do not resolve after pausing the taper, it may be unclear whether the symptoms are related to protracted withdrawal (which can last for months or years), worsening or new physical or mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety or sleep-related disorders), or a combination of withdrawal and underlying conditions. If the patient experiences physical or psychological symptoms that are distinct from symptoms of the underlying condition (e.g. neurological or sensory symptoms), they may be related to protracted withdrawal. In these instances, more frequent monitoring may be warranted. Clinicians may also consult with specialists appropriate to patients' symptoms.

Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal symptoms is lacking, treating symptoms of underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD; see Appendix 7 for a list of CPGs on the management of conditions for which BZDs are commonly prescribed). Clinicians should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment for any psychiatric disorder prior to or, if clinically indicated (e.g. due to imminent risks related to continued BZD use), concurrent with the taper. Clinicians should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible when selecting adjunctive medications (see Appendix 5).

This article describes the latest nonpharmacologic therapies for generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, a review of available nonpharmacologic treatment outcome studies and studies that compare the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment is presented. The authors conclude that, of the nonpharmacologic therapies available, cognitive-behavioral therapy may be the preferred first-line treatment. Results of comparison studies have suggested that medication acts more quickly than does therapy in reducing symptoms, whereas therapy has more long-lasting effects. The authors recommend that further research be conducted in identifying the essential components of treatment and the most efficacious treatment combinations.

### Escitalopram oxalate (escitalopram) [^3f30bdf0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Escitalopram oral solution is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for:

Acute and Maintenance Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years (1.1)
Acute Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Escitalopram oral solution is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Escitalopram oral solution is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

### Correlates and consequences of chronic insomnia [^699c43e5]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately one half of patients with insomnia have a primary psychiatric disorder such as a depression or anxiety. Insomnia is associated with increased risk of new or recurrent psychiatric disorders, increased daytime sleepiness with consequent cognitive impairment, poorer prognoses, reduced quality of life and high healthcare-related financial burden. Emerging data suggest that resolution of insomnia may improve psychiatric outcomes, which underscores the importance of vigorous treatment. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of patients receive such care. An ideal monotherapeutic strategy would treat both depression and insomnia. There are, however, only a handful of modern antidepressants that objectively improve sleep maintenance problems, and none do so without causing adverse next-day effects such as sedation. Thus, a significant number of patients must take adjunctive hypnotic medications, even though longer-term efficacy has not been established. New and emerging anti-insomnia agents may prove useful in the long-term treatment of chronic insomnia. Further research is needed to establish the benefits of such treatment.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^533dd8d1]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.4 Intervention characteristics

Overall, nine interventions were disorder‐specific and 15 were transdiagnostic. A total of 18 interventions were based on conventional (second wave) CBT (seven of which were disorder‐specific), two on cognitive bias modification, one on psychodynamic therapy (disorder‐specific), one on extinction therapy, one on acceptance‐based behavior therapy (disorder‐specific), and one on affect‐focused psychodynamic psychotherapy. Most interventions consisted of eight modules (i.e. units of content delivered to participants). Specifically, there were 12 interventions with 8 modules, 4 with 6 modules, 2 with 10 modules, 3 with 7 modules, 1 with 5 modules, 1 with 4 modules, and 1 with a range of 3–6 modules.

With the exception of the two interventions based on cognitive bias modification, most interventions included some combination of the following nonspecific intervention components: psychoeducation, case examples or vignettes, mindfulness and/or relaxation exercises, notification and/or reminder emails, homework, summaries, and relapse prevention and maintenance. In some interventions, participants had to have completed homework assignments or modules to progress to the next module. Several interventions included additional, supplementary information and resources on lifestyle factors, for example, sleep, interpersonal relationships, communication, problem‐solving, and stress.

Given differences in the models used across interventions, there was variability between iCBT and other approaches in terms of the specific techniques used. In iCBT interventions, specific cognitive techniques included cognitive restructuring, cognitive distancing, thought and worry records or diaries, mood monitoring; and behavioral techniques included activity scheduling, behavioral experiments, graded exposure, worry exposure, scheduled worry time; and homework. Specific techniques used in other interventions included defense restructuring, extinction techniques, functional analysis, valued action, acceptance, affect‐experiencing techniques, affect expression, and cognitive bias modification. Intervention components that specifically addressed worry, like psychoeducational content, for example, types of worry, and worry‐related techniques, for example, cognitive restructuring of worry‐related beliefs, were reported in 15 interventions.

### Cortical kappa opioid receptors integrate negative affect and sleep disturbance [^e4d6294d]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep disruption and negative affect are attendant features of many psychiatric and neurological conditions that are often co-morbid including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and chronic pain. Whether there is a causal relationship between negative affect and sleep disruption remains unclear. We therefore asked if mechanisms promoting negative affect can disrupt sleep and whether inhibition of pathological negative affect can normalize disrupted sleep. Signaling at the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) elicits dysphoria in humans and aversive conditioning in animals. We tested the possibility that (a) increased KOR signaling in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region associated with negative emotions, would be sufficient to promote both aversiveness and sleep disruption and (b) inhibition of KOR signaling would normalize pathological negative affect and sleep disruption induced by chronic pain. Chemogenetic Gi-mediated inhibition of KOR-expressing ACC neurons produced conditioned place aversion (CPA) as well as sleep fragmentation in naïve mice. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of ACC KOR normalized both the negative affect and sleep disruption elicited by pathological chronic pain while maintaining the physiologically critical sensory features of pain. These findings suggest therapeutic utility of KOR antagonists for treatment of disease conditions that are associated with both negative affect and sleep disturbances.

### Generalized anxiety disorder… [^226e612e]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Generalized anxiety disorder is excessive worry and tension about everyday events, on most days for at least six months, to the extent that there is distress or difficulty in performing day-to-day tasks. However, diagnosing GAD accurately can be difficult. Up to one in 20 persons may have GAD at any one time, and most have additional health problems. Less than one-half of persons with GAD have full remission after five years. GAD may have a genetic component, and has been linked to previous psychological or other trauma. Definition GAD is defined as excessive worry and tension about everyday events and problems, on most days for at least six months, to the point that the person experiences distress or has marked difficulty in performing day-to-day tasks.

It may be characterized by the following symptoms and signs: increased motor tension; autonomic hyperactivity; and increased vigilance and scanning, but not because of panic attacks. One nonsystematic review of epidemiologic and clinical studies found marked reductions in quality of life and psychosocial functioning in persons with anxiety disorders, including GAD. It also found that persons with GAD had low overall life satisfaction and some impairment in the ability to fulfill roles, social tasks, or both. In the European survey of adults, 76 percent of persons who had more than one mental disorder for 12 months had GAD. Those persons who had GAD were significantly more likely to have other mental disorders, including: major depression, social phobia, persons with GAD had a significantly decreased quality of life. A nonsystematic review suggested that autonomic arousal to stressful tasks was decreased in older persons, and that older persons became accustomed to stressful tasks more quickly than younger persons.

### Yoga-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (Y-CBT) for anxiety management: a pilot study [^d956ea14]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, but there is still room for improvement. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential benefit of enriching CBT with kundalini yoga (Y-CBT). Participants consisted of treatment resistant clients at a community mental health clinic. A total of 32 participants enrolled in the study and 22 completed the programme. After the Y-CBT intervention, pre-post comparisons showed statistically significant improvements in state and trait anxiety, depression, panic, sleep and quality of life. Results from this preliminary study suggest that Y-CBT may have potential as a promising treatment for those suffering from generalized anxiety disorder.

Key Practitioner Messages

Yoga-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (Y-CBT) may be a promising new treatment for those suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Y-CBT may also reduce depression in those suffering from generalized anxiety. Y-CBT may reduce depression and anxiety in a clinic population where clients suffer from multiple diagnoses including generalized anxiety disorder.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^8215d5ee]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODOLOGY

ASAM's Quality Improvement Council (QIC) and Clinical Practice Guideline Methodology and Oversight Committee (CPG-MOS) oversaw the development of this Guideline. The FDA provided guidance on the content and development of the Guideline but did not dictate the content. The QIC, working with partner professional societies and the FDA, oversaw the appointment of a Clinical Guideline Committee (CGC) comprised of clinicians representing ten medical and professional societies with broad subject matter expertise across medicine, psychiatry, and pharmacology. A panel of individuals who have lived experience with BZD tapering (the Patient Panel) provided input during the development of the Guideline.

The following key clinical questions were addressed in the systematic literature review:
What is the efficacy and/or safety of tapering strategies for BZDs?
What factors influence the outcomes of BZD tapering and should be monitored?
How can shared decision-making and patient-centered health care be utilized to support the effectiveness and safety of BZD tapering?

These questions were used to develop a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework for identifying relevant research literature to answer each of the key clinical questions.
Population: Adults who have been using one or more BZD medication for at least 2–4 weeks, including those with benzodiazepine use disorder
Intervention: two types of interventions were considered: Interventions that promote the successful discontinuation of BZD use Interventions that manage withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing BZDs
Comparator: alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition
Outcome: BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g. insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c5f68d19]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Many patients with psychiatric disorders are able to taper from BZDs in outpatient settings, but some may require a more intensive level of care. BZD tapering may exacerbate or cause recurrence of psychiatric symptoms that may warrant more intensive clinical oversight. Clinicians should consider any underlying psychiatric conditions and relevant treatment history, prior to beginning a BZD taper. Clinicians can consider using the LOCUS for guidance determining the appropriate treatment setting for patients with psychiatric disorders (see Box 9).

Box 9 Level of Care Utilization System: Levels of Care

For more information, see

Patients who have used BZDs for a long time may be reluctant to taper the medication due to fear of experiencing adverse effects related to discontinuation. As BZD tapering can lead to rebound psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety, insomnia), clinicians should optimize evidence-based treatments for any co-occurring psychiatric disorders prior to initiating a BZD taper or concurrently if clinically indicated (e.g. due to significant imminent risks related to continued BZD use). Non-BZD therapies such as SSRIs, CBT, and other evidence-based interventions may be appropriate alternatives to BZD for many patients (see Appendix 4). – Clinicians should also consider evidence-based suicide screening such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) tool for patients at risk.

Clinicians should educate patients regarding potential rebound psychiatric symptoms and how they will be managed and offer or refer for appropriate mental health services. As discussed in the " Adjunctive Interventions During the Tapering Process ", providing behavioral interventions during the BZD taper is associated with successful discontinuation of BZD. –

Patients with PTSD

The VA recommends that clinicians avoid prescribing BZDs to patients with symptoms of PTSD and provides guidance on alternative treatments for management of anxiety and insomnia in these patients.BZDs are ineffective for the treatment of PTSD; they do not reduce the core symptoms of PTSD or improve PTSD-related sleep dysfunction. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of substance use, depression, and aggression; increased PTSD severity; and decreased efficacy of trauma-focused psychotherapy. When tapering BZD in patients with PTSD, clinicians should consider that withdrawal from BZDs can worsen existing PTSD symptoms (e.g. increased anxiety, rage, increased nightmares, intrusive thoughts, hyperalertness). The CGC noted that clinicians can consider consulting with psychiatric specialists to develop a tapering strategy that minimizes these risks.

### Optimizing pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder to achieve remission [^de1e9d3f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

More than half of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have chronic and persistent symptomatology that may warrant ongoing pharmacotherapy. Many of these patients also have significant comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. There is growing consensus among clinicians that the treatment goal for anxiety disorders should be remission, including the minimization of anxiety and depression and resolution of functional impairment. Clinical management strategies for optimizing pharmacotherapy aimed at achieving remission in GAD include attention to drug selection, dosing levels, and duration of treatment. To optimize treatment for GAD with the goal of achieving remission, it is reasonable to select an agent with demonstrated effectiveness for GAD and associated comorbidities as well as a favorable side effect profile. Dosing and duration of treatment should be adequate, and consideration of adjunctive strategies for refractory patients may be warranted. This article discusses the optimization of pharmacotherapy with the goal of promoting remission in patients with GAD.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^699e8c0c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Current Approaches to Treating Neuropsychiatric Syndromes in Neurodegenerative Disorders

The usual clinical approach to treating neuropsychiatric syndromes in NDD is to extrapolate from the use of psychotropic agents used in idiopathic psychiatric disorders for similar phenomena. Approved antidepressants are used for the treatment of depression in NDD; antipsychotics are used for the treatment of psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) and agitation in NDD; mood stabilizers are used in the management of agitation in NDD; anxiolytics are applied to anxiety in NDD; stimulants are prescribed for apathy in NDD; and hypnotics are used for sleep dysregulation in NDD. This approach is based on the approval of antidepressants for the indication of major depressive disorder, antipsychotics for schizophrenia or bipolar illness, mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder, stimulants for attention deficit disorder, anxiolytics for generalized anxiety disorder, and hypnotics for insomnia. This extrapolation is based on the clinical similarity of symptoms and behaviors of the neuropsychiatric syndromes occurring in NDD and non-NDD circumstances and the absence of alternatives. The implementation of treatment by analogy has been called the "the therapeutic metaphor" for the use of psychotropic agents. However, patients with NDD are excluded from trials of patients used for testing of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, stimulants or hypnotics, and no data concerning the use of psychotropic medications in patients with NDD are available at the conclusion of trials involving patients with conventional psychiatric disorders. The extension of these therapies from non-NDD to NDD patients is based on many untested assumptions that may result in treating patients with agents that are ineffective or have safety and tolerability issues that differ from those observed in clinical trials of patients without NDD. The change of the clinical phenotype by the features of the NDD (e.g. apathy, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances) and the brain changes induced by the NDD may alter the efficacy or side effect profile of the psychotropic agent. Likewise, brain changes may alter the necessary doses to impact behavior. Most patients with NDD are elderly compared to those with idiopathic disorders, and this may affect the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of an agent. Doses of psychotropics used in the elderly are often lower than doses used in idiopathic disorders occurring in younger individuals; for example, the doses of antipsychotics that appear to be efficacious and tolerated in older AD patients with agitation are much lower than those used for psychosis in younger patients with schizophrenia. Data generated on use of psychotropic agents within patients with the NDD are vital for guiding use of psychotropics in these conditions.

Melatonin in ICU practice — evidence-to-recommendation rationale states that melatonin is commonly used to mitigate sleep and circadian disruption in critically ill adults, and endogenous melatonin suppression and circadian disturbances in critical illness provide a rationale for replacement therapy. The conditional recommendation favoring melatonin is based on the reduction of delirium prevalence and perceived improvement in sleep quality balanced against the low risk of adverse events, but these data have limitations which is why a strong recommendation was not provided. Sleep/circadian outcomes were not assessed in many included RCTs, and most RCTs that included sleep as an outcome used subjective measurement tools, which may introduce recall bias, includes only those who can respond, and does not measure sleep architecture.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^bef05694]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — benzodiazepine use and safety are characterized by the following guidance: ACOG recommends that benzodiazepines be avoided or prescribed sparingly as a treatment for perinatal anxiety; if benzodiazepines are prescribed, they should preferably be prescribed transiently as a bridge until SSRIs, SNRIs, or psychotherapy achieve their expected response, and they are not recommended as first-line treatment for the treatment of anxiety disorders, with avoidance particularly prudent in the setting of a history of substance use disorder; other agents, such as hydroxyzine, can be used as an adjuvant treatment, particularly for the acute management of associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are often used to manage acute symptoms until the benefits of SSRIs or SNRIs are achieved in the setting of moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms or when first-line options have not been effective, and in these settings obstetric care professionals should consult with or refer to a perinatal mental health subspecialist because psychotherapy has a stronger evidence base for anxiety treatment than benzodiazepines do. Although their use as primary treatment for anxiety is not recommended due to their side effects and addictive potential, benzodiazepines have a limited but overall relatively reassuring perinatal safety profile, with earlier observational data suggesting an association between first-trimester benzodiazepine exposure and cleft lip or palate not confirmed by more recent studies; meta-analytic data demonstrate associations between pregnancy benzodiazepine exposure and ectopic pregnancy and early-pregnancy benzodiazepine exposure and spontaneous abortion, and exposure during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of neonatal sedation, decreased muscle tone, respiratory compromise, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

### Polysomnographic sleep patterns of non-depressed, non-medicated children with generalized anxiety disorder [^5196d703]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Polysomnographic (PSG) studies of children with psychiatric illness have primarily focused on depressed samples. Children with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report high rates of sleep problems yet investigation of objective sleep patterns in non-depressed children with GAD are unavailable. Identification of unique clinical features linking early GAD with sleep disturbance, including possible HPA activation during the pre-sleep period, is needed to inform effective treatments.

Method

Thirty non-medicated, pre-pubescent children (ages 7–11 years) were assessed including 15 children with GAD and 15 matched healthy controls. Anxious children had GAD as their primary diagnosis and did not meet criteria for secondary mood disorders. All participants underwent structured diagnostic assessment and laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG). State anxiety and salivary cortisol were assessed prior to light out on the PSG night.

Results

Children with GAD showed significantly increased sleep onset latency and reduced latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared to controls. Marginal differences in the form of reduced sleep efficiency and increased total REM sleep also were found in the GAD group. Pre-sleep anxiety and cortisol levels did not differ between the two groups.

Limitations

A small sample size, time-limited assessment of cortisol, and possible first night effects should be considered.

Conclusions

Results of this study provide initial evidence of PSG-based differences in children with GAD compared to controls. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the course of sleep alterations and whether targeting sleep problems early in the course of GAD might improve clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in generalised anxiety disorder: a critical review of the literature [^2c0f4f9a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Of 241 literature citations, 13 clinical trials were identified that were specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in GAD, including 11 randomised double-blind trials and two open-label studies. Pregabalin efficacy has been consistently demonstrated across the licensed dose range of 150–600 mg/day. Efficacy has been reported for pregabalin monotherapy in elderly patients with GAD, patients with severe anxiety, and for adjunctive therapy when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients who have failed to respond to an initial course of antidepressant therapy. The two most common adverse events with pregabalin are somnolence and dizziness, both of which appear to be dose-related. Pregabalin appears to have a low potential for causing withdrawal symptoms when long-term therapy is discontinued; however, tapering over the course of at least one week is recommended. A review of available evidence indicates that pregabalin is a well-tolerated and consistently effective treatment for GAD, with a unique mechanism of action that makes it a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Intensive sleep deprivation and cognitive behavioral therapy for pharmacotherapy refractory insomnia in a hospitalized patient [^4b9cbe86]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The case of a 59-year-old woman psychiatrically hospitalized with comorbid insomnia, suicidal ideation, and generalized anxiety disorder is presented. Pharmacologic therapies were unsuccessful for treating insomnia prior to and during hospitalization. Intensive sleep deprivation was initiated for 40 consecutive hours followed by a recovery sleep period of 8 hours. Traditional components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), sleep restriction, and stimulus control therapies, were initiated on the ward. After two consecutive nights with improved sleep, anxiety, and absence of suicidal ideation, the patient was discharged. She was followed in the sleep clinic for two months engaging in CBTi. Treatment resulted in substantial improvement in her insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and anxiety about sleep. Sleep deprivation regimens followed by a restricted sleep recovery period have shown antidepressant effects in depressed patients. Similar treatment protocols have not been investigated in patients with pharmacotherapy refractory insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder.

### Effectiveness of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder and co-morbid generalized anxiety disorder in routine clinical practice: a subgroup analysis of the RELIEVE study [^61de2488]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

Of the 737 patients in the RELIEVE study, 413 (56.0%) had symptoms of anxiety co-morbid with MDD at baseline, including 203 patients (27.5%) reporting anxiety symptoms of 'unspecified type'. A total of 180 of the 737 patients (24.4%) had a diagnosis of GAD and formed the FAS-GAD and safety population for the present analysis.

Baseline demographics of patients with MDD and co-morbid GAD, and the overall study population, are shown in Table 1. In total, 85% of patients with MDD and co-morbid GAD were white/Caucasian, 68.3% were female, and the mean age at baseline was 47.8 years. Most patients (66.7%) reported at least one co-morbid condition at baseline. The most common co-morbidities (aside from GAD) were sleep disorders (30.6%) and cardiovascular disease (20.0%), with sleep disorders, panic disorder, chronic pain and social phobia present more frequently in the co-morbid GAD subgroup than in the overall study population (Table 1).

Table 1.
Patient demographic and general clinical characteristics at baseline (FAS) in the RELIEVE study overall population and subpopulation with co-morbid GAD.

Patient disease characteristics at baseline, including concomitant medications, are shown in Table 2. The majority of patients (62.2%) had ⩾2 previous MDEs, and the mean duration of MDD was 13.4 years. Vortioxetine (5–20 mg/day) was initiated as first-line treatment for the current MDE in 27.8% of patients, as second-line treatment in 34.4% of patients, and as third-line treatment or beyond in 37.8% of patients. At baseline, patients displayed impaired functioning across all SDS domains, moderate-to-severe depressive and cognitive symptoms, impaired sexual function and impaired HRQoL. In general, levels of impairment in the co-morbid GAD subgroup at baseline were slightly greater than in the overall RELIEVE study population. In addition, the mean duration of the current MDE was longer in the co-morbid GAD subgroup (101 weeks) than in the overall study population (47 weeks).

### Gabapentin and pregabalin in bipolar disorder, anxiety states, and insomnia: systematic review, meta-analysis, and rationale [^1e88ff22]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a systematic review on the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of gabapentinoids in BD, anxiety, and insomnia/sleep disturbance. By comparison with prior studies, our systematic review covered more disorders and databases, considered only DB-RCTs for evidence synthesis on efficacy, included unpublished literature, and, as far as possible, conducted quantitative syntheses. Our study shows that there is minimal evidence to support the use of gabapentinoids in BD and insomnia. The moderate effect size was seen across the anxiety spectrum; this was also significant for several individual anxiety states and showed a dose-effect of gabapentin in preoperative anxiolysis.

In BD, the small number of DB-RCTs investigating gabapentin, and the absence of studies investigating pregabalin, highlight the sparse evidence based on that to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentinoids in the treatment of BD. Quantitative synthesis was not performed due to heterogeneity in study population, design, and outcome measures. The evidence is inconclusive and does not support the current use of gabapentinoids in the management of BD.

Our analysis of all anxiety-related studies showed statistically significant low to large effect sizes favoring gabapentinoid use, compared to placebo, across the spectrum of anxiety disorders/states. This transdiagnostic effect is supported by the fact that state, trait, and pathological anxiety are mediated by a common brain network and by the common neural phenotypes observed across anxiety disorders. Our approach necessitated the inclusion of baseline-to-endpoint change scores as well as post-intervention scores, but a study of 21 meta-analyses found that combining post-intervention and change scores produces valid meta-analytical results. The results suggest a dose-dependent effect of preoperative gabapentin, with > 600 mg being required for significant acute anxiolysis. These analyses were performed post-hoc to investigate the large between-study heterogeneity and therefore should be considered as hypothesis-generating to guide future studies. The choice of dose thresholds was based on empirical reports of dose-dependent effects in GAD, which is a limitation of this subgroup analysis. For gabapentin, a dose-response pattern has been observed in GAD with remission/mild anxiety on total daily doses of gabapentin ≥ 900 mg/day and recurrence of severe anxiety, suggesting ineffectiveness, at < 600 mg/day. For pregabalin, we used a similar approach based on a reported difference in efficacy between 150 mg/day versus 200–600 mg/day in GAD.

### A review of the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance across multiple clinical conditions [^5d11f079]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Pregabalin is approved for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions and its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties are well documented. Pregabalin's effects on sleep, however, are less well known. This review summarizes the published data on the effects of pregabalin on sleep disturbance associated with neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless legs syndrome, partial onset seizures and general anxiety disorder. The data demonstrate that pregabalin has a positive benefit on sleep disturbance associated with several different clinical conditions. Polysomnographic data reveal that pregabalin primarily affects sleep maintenance. The evidence indicates that pregabalin has a direct effect on sleep that is distinct from its analgesic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects.

### Cortical kappa opioid receptors integrate negative affect and sleep disturbance [^9bb625e5]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurological and psychiatric disorders are often co-morbid and characterized by negative affect and disrupted sleep. Though repeatedly proposed, causal and/or mechanistic links between sleep disruption and negative emotional states have yet to be established. In this study, we evaluated cortical kappa opioid receptors (KOR) as a potential link between negative affect and sleep disruption.

To date, development of KOR agonists as analgesic drugs has been unsuccessful due to dysphoria and unpleasantness produced by these molecules in human trials. These observations, and others, have now led to the discovery and evaluation of KOR antagonists that are currently in advanced clinical trials for treatment of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anhedonia, and bipolar disorder. Notably, all of these conditions are associated with negative affect and disrupted sleep. For this reason, we hypothesized that endogenous KOR activation could be a common link between sleep disruption and negative affect.

This possibility was tested in the present experiments using a murine model of chronic neuropathic pain. Chronic pain was chosen as a model system for testing the potential link between negative affect and sleep disruption as preclinical studies have shown that KOR activation promotes pain aversiveness and systemic administration of KOR antagonists diminish the negative affective qualities of chronic pain and normalize pain-related sleep disruption. As the aversive qualities of chronic pain in humans are thought to be mediated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and few studies have linked the ACC to sleep disruption in pain, we hypothesized that (1) activation of cingulate KOR signaling could elicit both negative affect and sleep disruption in naïve mice and (2) inhibition of KOR signaling could normalize the aversiveness and disrupted sleep associated with pathological chronic pain.
