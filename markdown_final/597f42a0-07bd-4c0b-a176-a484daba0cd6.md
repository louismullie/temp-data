## Question

Chorea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing chorea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the phenomenology and pathophysiology of chorea. Then, I should classify etiologies into genetic versus acquired. Next, I will structure the diagnostic workup, including history, examination, laboratory testing, and neuroimaging. After that, I will consider genetic testing strategies and counseling. Finally, I will outline management principles, including symptomatic therapy, disease-specific treatments, and special scenarios like pregnancy and pediatrics, and close with prognosis and follow-up considerations [^116Yo7ZM] [^112PK6Zt].

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition and core pathophysiology so I don't anchor prematurely on a single cause. Chorea consists of continuous, brief, irregular, purposeless movements that flow unpredictably from one body part to another, reflecting dysfunction of basal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits, particularly involving medium spiny neurons in the caudate and putamen, with downstream motor control impairment and frequent cognitive and behavioral comorbidity in hereditary forms [^112PK6Zt] [^111UaAts].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify the major categories. I should divide causes into hereditary and acquired groups, because this split drives testing and management. Hereditary causes include Huntington's disease, Huntington's disease–like syndromes, neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, benign hereditary chorea, and other monogenic disorders, whereas acquired causes span vascular, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic, drug-induced, and structural lesions; this framework is supported by contemporary reviews and algorithms for adult-onset and pediatric chorea [^112PK6Zt] [^114cvmk8] [^114dG2sQ].

> I will now examine Huntington's disease as the most common hereditary cause, but I should verify prevalence and genetics before assuming. HD is autosomal dominant with a CAG repeat expansion in HTT, with full penetrance generally at 40 or more repeats and anticipation, particularly with paternal transmission; typical onset is midlife with chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms, while juvenile forms often present with dystonia–parkinsonism and larger repeat lengths, and MRI may show caudate atrophy even early on [^112gKAy7] [^113h79em] [^115hC9ny].

> Wait, let me verify the HD phenocopies because a negative HTT test does not end the hereditary workup. HD-like syndromes account for roughly 1% of suspected HD cases, with SCA17, HDL2, familial prion disease, and DRPLA among the most common when a genetic diagnosis is reached; clinical red flags such as prominent orofacial involvement, ataxia, or ancestry-specific patterns can guide targeted testing, and I should remember that SCAs and DRPLA can present with chorea and ataxia, sometimes with anticipation [^111ini6y] [^115SUUv2] [^116xr4KG].

> Next, I should review neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, but I need to check the hematologic clues carefully. Chorea-acanthocytosis is autosomal recessive due to VPS13A variants, with generalized chorea, feeding dystonia, self-mutilation, tics, seizures, axonal neuropathy, and elevated CK, while McLeod syndrome is X-linked due to XK variants, featuring chorea, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and absent Kx antigen; both can show acanthocytes on smear and caudate atrophy on MRI, and large deletions may be missed by standard WES, so MLPA or array-CGH may be needed [^1123RRHM] [^115mFhKj] [^114yMkPD].

> Let me consider benign hereditary chorea and ensure I don't overstate its simplicity. Classic NKX2–1–related BHC presents in childhood with nonprogressive chorea and may include thyroid and respiratory involvement; some patients respond to levodopa, and I should remember that ADCY5-related chorea can mimic BHC but often shows episodic exacerbations and bilateral striatal lesions on MRI, which would argue against classic BHC [^1141ckVq] [^11166k98] [^1128CXYQ].

> I should double-check the broader genetic landscape so I don't miss emerging entities. Over 200 genes have been linked to chorea, including PDE10A and PDE2A, mitochondrial disorders such as MELAS and POLG-related disease, and inborn errors of metabolism; phenotype-guided testing and awareness of syndromic features are essential to navigate this heterogeneity [^113p5CaW] [^111UaAts] [^113dhEG8].

> Now, shifting to acquired causes, I need to ensure I prioritize treatable etiologies. Vascular hemichorea–hemiballism from subthalamic nucleus involvement, autoimmune choreas including Sydenham chorea and antiphospholipid-associated chorea, metabolic derangements such as nonketotic hyperglycemia, infectious etiologies like HIV, and drug-induced chorea from dopaminergic agents or anticonvulsants are all critical considerations, and I should tailor the workup to age, geography, and exposure risks [^116Yo7ZM] [^114kYwk5] [^115hJMev].

> Let me first confirm the bedside diagnostic approach so I don't miss obvious clues. I need a meticulous history of age at onset, tempo, family history across three generations, medication and substance exposures, autoimmune or infectious triggers, and systemic symptoms; on examination, I should characterize the distribution and evolution of chorea, look for motor impersistence, oculomotor abnormalities, dystonia or parkinsonism, and search for acanthocytes, Kayser-Fleischer rings, organomegaly, or cardiomyopathy that would redirect testing toward specific hereditary or systemic causes [^112PK6Zt] [^114cvmk8] [^112524KZ].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory screen and make sure I don't omit reversible causes. A reasonable panel includes CBC with smear for acanthocytes, CK, liver enzymes, ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper for Wilson disease, thyroid function, fasting glucose and A1c, renal and hepatic profiles, autoimmune serologies including ANA and aPL, HIV and syphilis testing when indicated, and antistreptococcal titers in children or adolescents; these tests align with phenotype-driven algorithms for adult and pediatric chorea [^114cvmk8] [^114yMkPD] [^114dG2sQ].

> I will now examine neuroimaging, but wait, I should verify modality selection. Brain MRI with appropriate sequences is the cornerstone to detect caudate atrophy in HD, iron deposition patterns such as the "eye of the tiger" sign in PKAN, cerebellar atrophy in SCAs or DRPLA, and bilateral striatal lesions in ADCY5 or PDE10A; CT is generally inferior for these patterns, and FDG-PET can show caudate–putaminal hypometabolism in HD and related disorders when the diagnosis remains uncertain [^115hC9ny] [^1176Dsr8] [^1125YLhd].

> Hold on, I should verify the genetic testing strategy because repeat expansions are often invisible to standard WES. A stepwise approach is prudent: start with HTT CAG repeat analysis using TP-PCR or RP-PCR, then, if negative and suspicion persists, test for common repeat expansions such as C9orf72, TBP, ATN1, JPH3, and consider SCA17 and DRPLA repeats guided by phenotype; if still negative, broaden to multigene panels or WES/WGS, recognizing that WES may miss CNVs, mitochondrial variants, or deep intronic changes, and that long-read sequencing or ExpansionHunter can improve detection of complex repeats [^114yMkPD] [^116rYxRQ] [^115hC9ny].

> I need to ensure genetic counseling is integrated before predictive testing. Presymptomatic testing for HD and other serious hereditary choreas should follow international guidelines with pretest counseling, psychological assessment, and post-test support, and I should document a three-generation pedigree and confirm diagnoses in relatives whenever possible to guide cascade testing and to interpret variants of uncertain significance [^112VFFyL] [^111Y5MJu].

> Let me think about management principles, and I should confirm that etiologic therapy takes precedence when available. For HD-related chorea, VMAT2 inhibitors such as deutetrabenazine or valbenazine are first-line when chorea is functionally significant, with antipsychotics reserved for combined psychiatric indications; I should avoid overtreatment that worsens motor function and monitor for depression, suicidality, and QT prolongation, aligning with EHDN guidance and FDA labeling for deutetrabenazine [^114YH9D7] [^114JgUhn] [^114gP1W5].

> But wait, what if the chorea is autoimmune or infectious. In Sydenham chorea, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and sodium valproate shorten chorea duration and reduce relapse risk, and I should coordinate cardiology follow-up for rheumatic heart disease prevention; in antiphospholipid-associated chorea, immunomodulation and anticoagulation may be indicated depending on thrombotic risk and clinical context [^113Qbc2S] [^115buDEw] [^114kYwk5].

> I should confirm disease-specific interventions for mimics as well. Wilson disease requires lifelong chelation or zinc to restore copper balance, which can improve neurological features including chorea; benign hereditary chorea due to NKX2–1 may respond to levodopa in selected cases; and structural or metabolic causes such as normal pressure hydrocephalus or nonketotic hyperglycemia warrant targeted treatments that can resolve chorea when addressed promptly [^114bfrCM] [^11166k98] [^117Ryr7M].

> Let me reconsider special populations so I don't overlook nuances. In pregnancy, chorea gravidarum may reflect hormonal modulation of immune or vascular mechanisms and requires individualized risk–benefit discussions for symptomatic therapy; in pediatrics, I should prioritize Sydenham chorea, drug effects, and genetic causes such as BHC or ADCY5, using a stepwise algorithm that balances acquired and hereditary etiologies; in suspected HD phenocopies, I should escalate to expanded repeat testing and panels rather than repeatedly testing HTT alone [^116sdkkM] [^114dG2sQ] [^114yMkPD].

> I should double-check prognosis and follow-up expectations to counsel accurately. HD typically progresses over 15–20 years with monotonic declines in motor, cognitive, and functional scores, whereas Sydenham chorea often remits within months but can relapse; neuroacanthocytosis carries substantial morbidity with shortened survival; benign hereditary chorea is generally nonprogressive but may be accompanied by systemic features in NKX2–1-related disease, necessitating longitudinal surveillance [^111a1bo9] [^113qhm3H] [^1123RRHM] [^1141ckVq].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, phenotype-driven approach: define chorea and its impact, classify likely etiologies by tempo and associated features, execute a targeted laboratory and MRI workup prioritizing treatable causes, deploy a stepwise genetic testing strategy with counseling, and tailor management to etiology while using VMAT2 inhibitors judiciously for HD-related chorea; this iterative process reduces diagnostic delay and optimizes outcomes across the broad spectrum of choreic disorders [^112PK6Zt] [^114cvmk8] [^114YH9D7].

Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by **involuntary, irregular, non-repetitive movements** that flow from one body part to another, often associated with basal ganglia dysfunction [^116Yo7ZM]. The most common hereditary cause is **Huntington's disease** (HD), caused by CAG repeat expansion in HTT, with juvenile onset linked to larger repeats and a rigid-dystonic phenotype [^112gKAy7] [^113Rj5C2]. Other genetic causes include neuroacanthocytosis, benign hereditary chorea, and spinocerebellar ataxias; acquired causes include autoimmune, vascular, metabolic, drug-induced, and infectious etiologies [^112PK6Zt] [^114cvmk8]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, family history, neuroimaging (MRI for caudate atrophy, iron deposition, or cerebellar atrophy), and genetic testing (HTT, C9orf72, TBP, ATN1, JPH3) [^115hC9ny] [^114yMkPD]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine) for chorea, antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms, and genetic counseling for families; prognosis varies by cause, with HD typically progressive and fatal over 15–20 years [^114cvmk8] [^114gP1W5] [^112gKAy7].

---

## Clinical features

Chorea presents with **involuntary, irregular, non-repetitive movements** that flow from one body part to another, often accompanied by motor impersistence and cognitive or psychiatric symptoms [^112PK6Zt]. The movements are typically **worsened by stress or anxiety** and may improve with sleep or distraction [^notfound].

---

## Etiology

Chorea has diverse etiologies, broadly categorized as **hereditary and acquired**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Hereditary | - Huntington's disease (HD) <br/> - Neuroacanthocytosis <br/> - Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) <br/> - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA17, DRPLA) <br/> - Wilson's disease [^1138ApCS] |
| Acquired | - Autoimmune (Sydenham's chorea, SLE, APS) <br/> - Vascular (stroke, Moyamoya) <br/> - Metabolic (hyperglycemia, electrolyte disturbances) <br/> - Drug-induced (antipsychotics, levodopa) <br/> - Infectious (HIV, syphilis) [^1138ApCS] [^114kYwk5] [^114BCWB5] [^115hJMev] [^112SDbre] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Chorea arises from dysfunction of basal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits, particularly involving the caudate nucleus and putamen [^112PK6Zt]. In HD, mutant huntingtin causes neuronal loss and dysfunction, especially in medium spiny neurons, leading to **chorea and cognitive decline** [^113h79em].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history, family history, neurological examination [^116rYxRQ].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI for caudate atrophy (HD), iron deposition (PKAN), cerebellar atrophy (SCA17, DRPLA) [^115hC9ny] [^114cvmk8].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CK, ceruloplasmin, copper, thyroid function, autoimmune panels, infectious serologies [^114cvmk8].
- **Genetic testing**: HTT CAG repeats, C9orf72, TBP, ATN1, JPH3; consider WES/WGS if negative [^114yMkPD].

---

## Management

Management is **multidisciplinary** and tailored to etiology:

- **Symptomatic treatment**: VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine) for chorea; antipsychotics for behavioral symptoms [^114gP1W5] [^114JgUhn].
- **Disease-specific therapy**: Chelation for Wilson's disease, immunotherapy for autoimmune chorea, antibiotics for infectious causes [^113Qbc2S].
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for hereditary choreas, including presymptomatic and prenatal testing [^111Y5MJu].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by cause. HD is **progressive and fatal over 15–20 years** [^111a1bo9]; BHC is non-progressive with a favorable outlook; Sydenham's chorea typically resolves within months but may relapse [^113qhm3H].

---

Chorea is a complex movement disorder requiring a structured diagnostic approach and multidisciplinary management. HD is the most common hereditary cause, but many **treatable acquired causes** must be considered.

Differential diagnosis of chorea.

The pattern of inheritance, the presence of anticipation due to trinucleotide repeat expansions within a family, and the geographic origin of the patient may also provide valuable diagnostic clues. Among autosomal dominant (AD) forms with anticipation, HD is the most frequent; among autosomal recessive disorders, chorea‐acanthocytosis is the most frequent cause, whereas McLeod syndrome is the main representative of X‐linked choreas. A number of additional clinical features and neuroimaging findings can further support the diagnostic process, as summarized in Tables 2, 3, 5 and Figure 1.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the primary forms of hereditary choreas with a particular focus on adult‐onset presentations. Childhood‐onset choreas are not the primary focus of this review, but are briefly discussed when relevant to adult neurology practice. The search methodology is detailed in the Supporting Information. We discuss the clinical, genetic, and pathophysiological aspects of each disorder, highlighting the importance of detailed patient history, thorough neurological examination, and the use of complementary diagnostic tests — including neuroimaging and laboratory studies — to guide genetic diagnosis. For each disorder, we indicate the most appropriate genetic test, emphasizing that many adult‐onset choreas cannot be reliably diagnosed through next‐generation whole‐exome sequencing (NGS‐WES) alone, as they are often caused by repeat expansions not detectable by standard WES pipelines. Advanced technologies such as whole‐genome sequencing (NGS‐WGS) with specific tools like ExpansionHunter, or long‐read sequencing, may overcome most of these limitations; however, their availability in routine clinical settings remains limited. These approaches are expected to become increasingly accessible in the near future, potentially enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. Given the clinical overlap and genetic heterogeneity of these disorders, accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate management, genetic counseling, and timely access to disease‐specific treatments and potential clinical trials.

9 Discussion

The spectrum of genetic disorders associated with chorea is broad, with HD being the most common cause worldwide. In clinical practice, the diagnostic approach for a patient presenting with chorea and no previously genetically confirmed family diagnosis should be guided by several factors: age at onset (childhood vs. adult), disease course (acute, subacute, or chronic), family history, suspected inheritance pattern, and associated clinical features (Table 1). A chronic and progressive course is more suggestive of a hereditary etiology. In cases with a genetically confirmed family history, confirmatory testing for the known pathogenic variant is indicated. Furthermore, genetic testing of asymptomatic individuals at risk requires thorough genetic counseling to address the psychological, ethical, and medical implications of predictive testing.

The first step in the workup patients without a genetically confirmed family history, as detailed in Figure 2, involves ruling out acquired causes through neuroimaging, blood tests, and, when clinically indicated, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, particularly in cases with subacute onset. Differential diagnosis should consider autoimmune and paraneoplastic, vascular, metabolic, or infectious etiologies. Laboratory screening should also include CK, peripheral blood smear for acanthocytes, serum ceruloplasmin and 24 h urinary cooper, thyroid function tests and plasma manganese, that may provide diagnostic clues suggestive of hereditary choreas (Table 5 summarizes the recommended laboratory tests and neuroimaging findings). Similarly, brain MRI may reveal disease‐specific patterns such as caudate nucleus atrophy (commonly observed in HD and neuroacanthocytosis), iron deposition in the globus pallidus ("eye of the tiger" sign in PKAN), or cerebellar atrophy suggestive of SCA17, DRPLA, or other ataxic disorders. These clinical, biochemical, and radiological features are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, and can serve as key elements to orient the differential diagnosis.

### Seminar on choreas [^116Yo7ZM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Chorea is one of the major types of involuntary movement disorders originating from dysfunctional neuronal networks interconnecting the basal ganglia and frontal cortical motor areas. The syndrome is characterised by a continuous flow of random, brief, involuntary muscle contractions and can result from a wide variety of causes. Diagnostic work-up can be straightforward in patients with a positive family history of Huntington's disease or acute-onset hemichorea in patients with lacunar stroke, but it can be a challenging and complex task in rare autoimmune or genetic choreas. Principles of management focus on establishing an aetiological classification and, if possible, removal of the cause. Preventive strategies may be possible in Huntington's disease where genetic counselling plays a major part. In this review we summarise the current understanding of the neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of chorea, its major aetiological classes, and principles of diagnostic work-up and management.

### Update on genetic chorea [^113EvSk2]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary choreas are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders in which chorea constitutes the core or an early-dominant feature. These conditions result from various genetic mutations affecting the structures and pathways involved in movement control, primarily the caudate and putamen, ultimately impairing the basal ganglia circuits involved in the regulation of movement, cognition, and behavior. This review focuses on the main forms of hereditary choreas, including Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, Huntington's disease phenocopies, benign hereditary chorea, and other less common genetic disorders presenting with chorea. We discuss the clinical, genetic, and pathophysiological features of each condition, alongside key aspects of phenomenology, examination, and complementary tests-including laboratory findings-to guide phenotype-driven genetic testing. We detail the characteristic features of key disorders while also highlighting less common but emerging conditions. This review aims to assist neurologists in recognizing and diagnosing hereditary choreas efficiently, including guidance on the selection of appropriate genetic tests, thereby reducing diagnostic delays, informing accurate counseling, and facilitating access to disease-specific interventions and clinical trials.

### Family history in juvenile Huntington disease: do the signs point to "yes" or "very doubtful"? [^113Rj5C2]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Juvenile Huntington disease (JHD)-Huntington disease (HD) with an onset ≤ 20 years-accounts for approximately 10% of all HD cases. Like the adult form of the disorder, JHD is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia and behavioral changes, caused by an expanded CAG repeat within the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4.(1) Unlike the adult form, JHD tends to present with a rigid-dystonic picture or nonspecific motor and neuropsychological signs rather than chorea.(2,3.)

### Benign hereditary chorea: a case report and brief review of inherited choreas [^115rLXjy]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chorea as a nonprogressive abnormality is often associated with Sydenham chorea in the pediatric population. Benign hereditary chorea is a condition where chorea presents before age 5 years and runs a very slowly progressive course.

Patients

We present a family that was thought to have a variant of Huntington disease but on genetic testing was confirmed to have benign hereditary chorea. We describe a 7-year-old girl in this family who presented with involuntary movements and hyperactivity.

Results

Our family was determined to have benign hereditary chorea after extensive genetic testing and follow-up.

Conclusions

When chorea presents as a familial entity, the differential diagnosis is limited and is often misdiagnosed as Huntington disease. In this family benign hereditary chorea was found to be the cause.

### The Wilson films – Huntington's chorea [^115dS683]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Wilson's Queen Square Case 9 with Huntington's chorea shows a 68-year-old man with mild to moderate generalized chorea, impaired fixation, and probable cognitive decline in keeping with a diagnosis of Huntington's disease (HD). An age of onset in the late sixties and a negative family history suggest a relatively small expanded trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene in the patient and reduced penetrance of an even shorter repeat allele in one of his parents. A highly sensitive and specific gene test has been offered worldwide for diagnostic testing of HD for almost two decades. This test, obviously unavailable at Wilson's times, became the historic frontrunner for guidelines of symptomatic, presymptomatic, and prenatal testing for an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Regarding treatment of HD, however, we are still awaiting the successful translation of research results into the development of effective cause-directed, neuropreventive and neurorestaurative therapies.

### Coeliac disease presenting with chorea [^1113mkkY]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chorea can be genetic or acquired, and often leads to a challenging diagnostic conundrum. In a significant proportion, there is no specific identifiable cause. Chorea is a rare but potentially reversible neurological manifestation of coeliac disease, usually presenting insidiously and often presumed to be associated with typical gastrointestinal symptoms. We report a patient with rapidly progressive generalised chorea, but without preceding gastrointestinal symptoms, who was subsequently diagnosed with coeliac disease. A gluten-free diet resulted in complete resolution of the chorea.

FIGURE 2
Diagnostic approach to adult‐onset chorea. Stepwise diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with chorea. The initial evaluation focuses on excluding acquired causes through clinical history, laboratory studies, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis when appropriate. In chronic or progressive cases, a genetic etiology should be suspected [(A) Step 1 — Differential diagnosis of adult‐onset chorea]. Targeted genetic testing is recommended in the presence of specific diagnostic clues (e.g. acanthocytosis, MRI findings, systemic involvement). In the absence of such clues, broader approaches including repeat expansion testing and phenotype‐guided next‐generation sequencing panels should be considered [(B) Step 2 — Work‐up of suspected genetic chorea]. See Tables 1, 3, and 5 for detailed clinical and ancillary test correlations.

TABLE 5
Recommended diagnostic workup for potentially treatable causes of chorea and hereditary chorea.

When specific diagnostic indicators are identified (e.g. acanthocytosis, Kayser–Fleischer rings, or disease‐specific MRI findings), targeted genetic testing should be prioritized.

In the absence of such findings, a stepwise approach is recommended. This should begin with analysis of HTT, followed by testing for the most frequent known repeat expansions in C9orf72, TBP, ATN1, JPH3 using RP‐PCR or TP‐PCR. If negative, broader sequencing strategies should be considered. NGS‐WES is commonly employed, although it may fail to detect CNVs, such as those found in VPS13A, NKX2‐1, or PDGFB, as well as variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), or deep intronic variants which require specific complementary assays (e.g. MLPA, mtDNA analysis, WGS).

### Benign hereditary chorea revisited: a journey to understanding [^115drEBb]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) has been characterized as an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting nonprogressive chorea without dementia. However, there has been controversy regarding its existence. Diagnosis has been based solely on clinical criteria with many patients and families demonstrating "atypical" features and until recently, no diagnostic test was available for confirmation. Since 2002, mutations in the thyroid transcription factor (TITF-1) gene have been identified as resulting in some cases of BHC. Additionally, the clinical spectrum has expanded to include abnormalities in thyroid and lung with the putative mechanism of disease resulting from gene haploinsufficiency and reduced protein product. This review summarizes both a historical perspective and our current understanding of BHC.

6 Paroxysmal Dyskinesias

These are a group of genetic disorders characterized by sudden episodes of hyperkinetic choreo‐dystonic movements triggered by specific factors. Patients typically exhibit a normal interictal examination, and symptoms often improve with age. Although these disorders typically present with paroxysmal symptoms beginning in childhood, there is increasing recognition of their overlap with choreic syndromes. A single gene can give rise to a spectrum of phenotypes, including forms that resemble hereditary chorea. Moreover, many cases remain undiagnosed until adulthood, and these disorders should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of genetic choreas, particularly in cases with paroxysmal or fluctuating symptoms. A comprehensive review of all genetic causes of paroxysmal dyskinesias exceeds the scope of this article and is addressed in detail in dedicated reviews.

### Genetic counseling and testing for Alzheimer disease: joint practice guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^112VFFyL]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Guidelines — Alzheimer disease (AD) genetic counseling and testing should follow these principles: Pediatric testing for AD should not occur, and prenatal testing for AD is not advised if the patient intends to continue a pregnancy with a mutation. Genetic testing for AD should only occur in the context of genetic counseling and support by someone with expertise, and genetic counseling for symptomatic patients should be performed in the presence of the individual's legal guardian or family member. For asymptomatic patients, a protocol based on the International Huntington Association and World Federation of Neurology Research Group on Huntington's Chorea Guidelines is recommended, and DTC APOE testing is not advised. A ≥ 3-generation family history should be obtained, medical records should be used to confirm AD diagnosis when feasible, and a risk assessment should be performed by pedigree analysis to determine whether the family history is consistent with EOAD or LOAD and with autosomal dominant, familial, or sporadic inheritance. Patients should be informed that currently there are no proven pharmacologic or lifestyle choices that reduce the risk of developing AD or stop its progression, and the lifetime risk of AD in the general population is approximately 10–12% in a 75–80-year lifespan.

### Huntington's disease: diagnosis and management [^1135szra]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterised by neuropsychiatric symptoms, a movement disorder (most commonly choreiform) and progressive cognitive impairment. The diagnosis is usually confirmed through identification of an increased CAG repeat length in the huntingtin gene in a patient with clinical features of the condition. Though diagnosis is usually straightforward, unusual presentations can occur, and it can be difficult to know when someone has transitioned from being an asymptomatic carrier into the disease state. This has become increasingly important recently, with several putative disease-modifying therapies entering trials. A growing number of conditions can mimic HD, including rare genetic causes, which must be considered in the event of a negative HD genetic test. Patients are best managed in specialist multidisciplinary clinics, including when considering genetic testing. Current treatments are symptomatic, and largely directed at the chorea and neurobehavioural problems, although supporting trial evidence for these is often limited.

### Treatment of chorea in childhood [^111MrzCf]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chorea is a movement disorder characterized by ongoing random-appearing sequences of discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Chorea results from dysfunction of the complex neuronal networks that interconnect the basal ganglia, thalamus, and related frontal lobe cortical areas. The complexity of basal ganglia circuitry and vulnerability of those circuits to injury explains why chorea results from a wide variety of conditions. Because etiology-specific treatments or effective symptomatic treatments are available for causes of chorea, defining the underlying disease is important. The treatment of chorea can be considered in three main categories: (1) terminating or modifying exposure to the causative agent, (2) symptomatic treatment of chorea, and (3) treatment targeting the underlying etiology. Symptomatic treatment decision of chorea should be based on the functional impact on the child caused by chorea itself. There have been no reported randomized, placebo-controlled trials of symptomatic treatment for chorea in childhood. Thus the recommendations are based on clinical experience, case reports, expert opinions, and small comparative studies. Better knowledge of mechanisms underlying childhood chorea will provide more etiology-based treatments in the future.

8 Other Genetic Neurological Disorders That May Present With Chorea

To date, up to 249 genes have been associated with the chorea phenotype according to the Human Phenotype Ontology database. Many genetic disorders may present with chorea, although it is often not the primary clinical feature. In most of these conditions, chorea may emerge in the context of a broader neurological or multisystemic syndrome, underscoring the importance of careful phenotyping and targeted genetic testing in the diagnostic workup. Examples include genetic ataxias beyond the more common SCA17 and DRPLA, such as SCA48, ataxia telangiectasia, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia, RFC1 related diseases; mitochondrial diseases due to mitochondrial DNA mutations (e.g. MELAS) or nuclear DNA gene defects (e.g. POLG); inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. glutaric aciduria type I, Lesch‐Nyham syndrome); and nucleotide excision repair disorders (NERDND). A comprehensive review of all these genetic entities exceeds the scope of this article. However, Table 3 provides a brief overview of some of the most relevant and prevalent disorders in which chorea may be part of the clinical phenotype.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis is unlikely to cause movement disorders – a critical review [^117Wqp78]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive systemic iron overload disorder in which CNS manifestations, particularly movement disorders, have been reported. We report a 63-year-old woman with familial HH with a four-year history of progressive gait disturbance, chorea, and mild cervical and laryngeal dystonia. Her movement disorder was thought to be related to the haemochromatosis. On further investigation, analysis for the Huntington's disease expansion was positive. A review of the seven published cases of movement disorders associated with HH as well as data concerning brain iron deposition in this condition leads us to debate the causal link between movement disorders and HH. We suggest that movement disorders are rare in association with HH, and that such patients should be thoroughly investigated for another cause for their movement disorder.

Comments

Obtaining a collateral history is essential in establishing baseline function in people presenting with neuropsychiatric disturbance. This can help us focus on the differential diagnoses and plan for investigation. It can also avoid repeating previous investigations.

The admitting team contacted his brother, his next of kin. The patient was an unemployed ex-builder. One year earlier, he had consulted a movement disorder doctor with a high-frequency tremor and brief involuntary movements. Investigations at this time included a normal MR scan of the brain and routine blood tests, including thyroid function tests and serum calcium. In the 2 months before admission, his family had noticed occasional repetitive conversation. However, he still lived independently and attended training courses. His agitation and disorientation had developed over the 24 hours before presentation. There was no family history of dementia or of involuntary movements.

1 Introduction

Hereditary choreas are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders in which chorea constitutes the core or an early‐dominant feature. Chorea is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, rapid, and irregular movements that unpredictably shift from one part of the body to another. These movements, often described as flowing or dance‐like, can interfere significantly with daily activities and are the hallmark of the neurological dysfunction seen in these conditions. Hereditary choreas arise from genetic mutations that impair the function of proteins highly expressed in key brain regions involved in motor control — most notably the caudate nucleus and putamen — leading to dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuits.

In addition to the motor symptoms, most hereditary choreas are frequently associated with a range of cognitive and behavioral alterations, adding further complexity to their clinical presentation. Cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety, and personality changes are common features that can emerge alongside the movement disorder, often complicating both diagnosis and management.

Differential diagnosis of adult‐onset chorea can be challenging, and one of the most informative clinical clues is the temporal pattern of symptom onset. Hereditary choreas typically manifest as slowly progressive, generalized choreic syndromes, whereas acquired etiologies — most often pharmacological, autoimmune, metabolic, or infectious — tend to present with a subacute onset. The distribution of involuntary movements also contributes to diagnostic orientation. Hemichorea–hemiballism syndromes are commonly linked to structural brain lesions, such as vascular events or non‐ketotic hyperglycemia. In contrast, hereditary choreas are usually generalized, although specific regions — such as the upper face in Huntington's disease (HD) — may show earlier or more prominent involvement. Age at onset may also help guide the differential diagnosis. A childhood onset presenting as a non‐progressive choreic syndrome is more suggestive of one of the benign hereditary chorea (BHC) conditions, whereas paroxysmal choreo‐dystonic episodes during childhood are more consistent with paroxysmal dyskinesias (see Table 1). Given the diagnostic complexity of these disorders and the growing number of implicated genes, some patients may reach adulthood without a definitive diagnosis.

### The differential diagnosis of chorea [^1138ApCS]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterised by excessive spontaneous movements that are irregularly timed, randomly distributed and abrupt. In this article, the authors discuss the causes of chorea, particularly Huntington's disease and the genetic syndromes that may resemble it, including HDL1–3, inherited prion disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 3 and 17, neuroacanthocytosis, dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), brain iron accumulation disorders, Wilson's disease, benign hereditary chorea, Friedreich's ataxia and mitochondrial disease. Acquired causes of chorea include vascular disease, post-infective autoimmune central nervous system disorders (PANDAS), drugs, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, AIDS, chorea gravidarum, and polycythaemia rubra vera. The authors suggest an approach to the clinical assessment of chorea, the value of investigations, including genetic tests (for which they offer a structured framework highlighting the importance of prior counselling), and finally briefly discuss symptomatic drug treatment of chorea.

### Benign hereditary chorea: clinical, genetic, and pathological findings [^114hB1dN]. Annals of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting with childhood-onset chorea, no dementia, and little or no progression. We present a family with typical clinical features of benign hereditary chorea. Pathological investigation of the brain of an affected family member who died of an unrelated condition showed no significant gross or histological abnormalities. Genetic evaluation showed a novel single nucleotide substitution of intron 2 of the TITF-1 gene (also referred to as TTF, NKX2.1, and T/ebp) on chromosome 14 which is predicted to have drastic consequences on the maturation processes of TITF-1.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study offers a thorough examination of aPL-associated chorea, drawing on the most robust evidence from an incident cohort of 180 patients spanning the past 40 years. Despite its rarity, chorea emerges as a noteworthy manifestation of APS. Our findings underscore the crucial significance of promptly recognising and testing for aPL in cases of unexplained chorea. This awareness is pivotal, as aPL-associated chorea is a treatable condition with a favourable outcome.

### Mutations in TITF1 are not relevant to sporadic and familial chorea of unknown cause [^112cmzky]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea (BHC; OMIM 118700) is an autosomal dominant movement disorder. Mutations in the thyroid transcription factor 1 (TITF1) gene have been linked with BHC. The phenotype for BHC is highly variable and may include atypical features such as dystonia, slow saccades, and even cognitive deficits. Although BHC is commonly transmitted in a dominant manner, assessment of TITF1 mutations in familial or sporadic patients with late-onset nonprogressive or early-onset progressive chorea is of practical relevance in order to evaluate diagnostic strategies in single patients. In this study, 18 patients with chorea of unknown cause including index patients of three families with autosomal dominantly inherited nonprogressive chorea have been screened for TITF1 mutations by means of denaturating high-pressure liquid chromatography (dHPLC). No sequence variations were detected for the complete open reading frame, suggesting that TITF1 mutations are not a common cause of sporadic or familial chorea of unknown cause. Additionally, linkage analysis excluded TITF1 mutations in a large family with benign hereditary chorea.

### Cause and course in a series of patients with sporadic chorea [^114BCWB5]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify correlations between clinical and neuroimaging features in sporadic chorea and to explicate the evolution of choreas of differing aetiologies.

Methods

We analysed the clinical and neuroimaging data of 51 consecutive cases (17 males, 34 females; age 16–95 years) of sporadic chorea admitted to the neurology departments of two general hospitals from January 1994 to December 1999, and two neurological institutes from January 1997. Six months later the patients were reassessed clinically and those still with chorea (20 cases) were asked to undergo the genetic tests for Huntington's disease and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy.

Results

There were 9 cases of focal dyskinesias, 18 of hemichorea, and 24 of generalised chorea; onset was acute in 17, subacute in 27, and insidious in seven. Analysis permitted classification as follows: vascular-related (21 cases); vasculitis (1 case); hypoxia (2 cases); drug-induced (7 cases); AIDS-related (5 cases), borreliosis (1 case); Sydenham's chorea (1 case); hyperglycaemia (2 cases); hyponatraemia (2 cases); Huntington's disease (HD) (5 cases) and acanthocytosis (1 case). In 3 patients neither etiological factors nor neuroradiological alterations were found.

Conclusions

Although a convincing concordance between choreic signs and neuroradiological findings was possible in 4 patients only, it was possible to assign an aetiology in most cases with vascular related causes the most frequent and metabolic factors often participating. Huntington's disease is not unusual as a cause of sporadic choreas. HIV infection is an emerging cause of chorea and AIDS-related disease should be considered in young patients presenting without a family history of movement disorders. We emphasize the importance of follow-up to identify persistent chorea for which genetic testing is mandatory.

### Recent advances in genetics of chorea [^116GWN1o]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chorea presenting in childhood and adulthood encompasses several neurological disorders, both degenerative and nonprogressive, often with a genetic basis. In this review, we discuss how modern genomic technologies are expanding our knowledge of monogenic choreic syndromes and advancing our insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for chorea.

Recent Findings

A genome-wide association study in Huntington's disease identified genetic disease modifiers involved in controlling DNA repair mechanisms and stability of the HTT trinucleotide repeat expansion. Chorea is the cardinal feature of newly recognized genetic entities, ADCY5 and PDE10A-related choreas, with onset in infancy and childhood. A phenotypic overlap between chorea, ataxia, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental disorders is becoming increasingly evident.

Summary

The differential diagnosis of genetic conditions presenting with chorea has considerably widened, permitting a molecular diagnosis and an improved prognostic definition in an expanding number of cases. The identification of Huntington's disease genetic modifiers and new chorea-causing gene mutations has allowed the initial recognition of converging molecular pathways underlying medium spiny neurons degeneration and dysregulation of normal development and activity of basal ganglia circuits. Signalling downstream of dopamine receptors and control of cAMP levels represent a very promising target for the development of new aetiology-based treatments for chorea and other hyperkinetic disorders.

2.4 Diagnosis

The genetic diagnosis is based on the detection of an abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene. This is typically performed using targeted molecular techniques such as triplet‐primed PCR (TP‐PCR), also referred to as repeat‐primed PCR (RP‐PCR), which are specifically designed to identify large or interrupted repeat expansions. Although a biological classification system (Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System [HD‐ISS]) has been proposed recently, clinical diagnosis in routine practice still relies primarily on the unequivocal presence of motor symptoms consistent with HD in patients with confirmed genetic mutations or a family history of genetic confirmation. Neuroimaging tests can assist in the differential diagnosis. In classic forms of HD, brain MRI typically reveals atrophy of the caudate and putamen. In JHD forms, a characteristic hyperintensity in the putamen on T2/FLAIR sequences may be observed (Figure 1). PET‐FDG scans can show hypometabolism in the caudate and putamen.

A pregnant woman, in her early 20s, presents with chorea following an emotional outburst. While the family members feel it to be a spirit haunting her, we try to establish the medical diagnosis of the present condition. There is a history of rheumatic fever in the past and examination reveals choreioathetoid jerky movements of her upper limbs with jerky speech, spooning of her limbs and demonstration of milkmaid's grip. Laboratory investigations did not reveal anything interesting. We discuss the diagnosis and management of this patient.

This pathway will lead to satisfactory alleviation for most patients with clinically disturbing chorea who require treatment. It is important to bear in mind that treatment of chorea should aim to reduce involuntary movements, not to abolish them. Side effects, such as sedation and a negative impact on cognitive functioning, should always be assessed for and carefully monitored. Patients who respond inadequately to the suggested interventions should be referred to HD specialists. Currently, effective treatment of chorea should follow expert advice and not evidence-based guidelines in order to avoid side effects and potential harm to patients.

Regarding medical management for Huntington's disease, more specifically with respect to management of chorea, EHDN 2019 guidelines recommend to consider initiating drug treatment if chorea causes distress or discomfort. Prefer monotherapy for chorea management because combination therapy increases the risk of adverse effects and may complicate the management of non-motor symptoms.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [^1176Dsr8]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases are a variety of conditions that involve progressive neuronal degeneration, injury, or death. Establishing the correct diagnosis of a movement disorder or neurodegenerative process can be difficult due to the variable features of these conditions, unusual clinical presentations, and overlapping symptoms and characteristics. MRI has an important role in the initial assessment of these patients, although a combination of imaging and laboratory and genetic tests is often needed for complete evaluation and management. This document summarizes the imaging appropriateness data for rapidly progressive dementia, chorea, Parkinsonian syndromes, suspected neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, and suspected motor neuron disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Movement disorder emergencies include any movement disorder which evolves over hours to days, in which failure to appropriately diagnose and manage can result in patient morbidity or mortality. It is crucial that doctors recognize these emergencies with accuracy and speed by obtaining the proper history and by being familiar with the phenomenology of frequently encountered movements. These disorders will be discussed based on the most common associated involuntary movement, either parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea, tics or myoclonus, and, when available, review the workup and treatment options based on the current literature.

### Benign hereditary chorea: clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic findings [^116BuXgH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea is an autosomal dominant disease with an early onset of symptoms. In some families, symptoms tend to decrease in adulthood, suggesting that the disorder results from a developmental disturbance in the brain. Individuals with benign hereditary chorea, a nonprogressive disease, have normal or slightly below normal intelligence. The locus for benign hereditary chorea is on chromosome 14. Benign hereditary chorea is a result of mutations in the thyroid transcription factor 1 gene. Previous neuroimaging and pathological investigations of the brain showed no notable abnormalities in patients with this condition. In this study, 5 patients from 1 family with typical clinical features of benign hereditary chorea are presented. Clinical severity varied considerably in the family. Brain magnetic resonance imaging results were normal. Brain single photon emission computed tomography in 3 children, performed 1 hour after intravenous injection of 0.35 mCi/kg of body weight of technetium 99m ethyl cysteinate dimer, showed markedly decreased uptake in the right striatum and the right thalamus in 1 child. The oldest child had mildly reduced uptake in the right putamen and the left thalamus. Brain single photon emission computed tomographic findings in the youngest child were normal. Contrary to other reports of radionuclide brain imaging, notable brain single photon emission computed tomography changes were detected in 2 of 5 patients. Brain single photon emission computed tomography findings did not seem to correlate with the clinical status of the children.

2 Huntington's Disease

HD is the most common cause of hereditary chorea with a prevalence of approximately 5–12 cases per 100,000 people in populations of European descent, being less prevalent in Asia and Africa.

This neurodegenerative disease is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG triplets in exon 1 of the HTT gene with an AD inheritance pattern. The greater the number of CAG repeats, the earlier the age of onset, which is associated with a worse prognosis. There is a phenomenon of CAG‐triplet expansion that can occur in successive generations, particularly when the disease is inherited paternally. The penetrance of the disease is related to the number of CAG repeats, being incomplete with 36–39 repeats and complete with 40 or more repeats. Juvenile‐onset (JHD) forms are typically associated with 55 or more repeats.

The typical onset of HD occurs between the ages of 35 and 50, although up to 25% of cases manifest after the age of 60. It leads to a reduced life expectancy, with an average course from symptom onset to death ranging 15–20 years. Between 2% and 5% of cases present before the age of 21 and are classified as JHD. The phenotype differs from the classic forms of HD, with a clinical picture dominated by dystonia and parkinsonism from the early stage of the disease.

HD is characterized by a clinical triad of motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms that can manifest at various stages throughout the course of the disease. Before the onset of established symptoms, there is a prodromal phase characterized by subtle signs of the disease.

2.1 Motor Symptoms

Chorea is the hallmark motor symptom of HD. It typically begins in the facial region, often with a frontal predominance, and progressively generalizes. Tics and vocalizations may also be present. Motor impersistence often co‐occurs with chorea. As the disease progresses, chorea will gradually be replaced by dystonia and parkinsonism. Hyperreflexia with hung‐up knee jerk is characteristic. Oculomotor abnormalities are common, particularly the inability to inhibit the head impulse during eye movements. Gait abnormalities in HD are often difficult to categorize as they typically present with a combination of chorea, motor impersistence, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia.

### Autoimmune choreas [^114kYwk5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Chorea, a movement disorder characterised by a continuous flow of unpredictable muscle contractions, has a myriad of genetic and non-genetic causes. Although autoimmune processes are rare aetiology of chorea, they are relevant both for researchers and clinicians. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory features, pathogenesis and management of the most common autoimmune causes of chorea. Emphasis is given particularly to Sydenham's chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary antiphospolipid antibody syndrome, paraneoplastic chorea and anti- N -methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis.

### A de novo ADCY5 mutation causes early-onset autosomal dominant chorea and dystonia [^112aF2C4]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Importance

Apart from Huntington's disease, little is known of the genetics of autosomal dominant chorea associated with dystonia. Here we identify adenylate cyclase 5 (ADCY5) as a likely new causal gene for early-onset chorea and dystonia.

Observations

Whole exome sequencing in a three-generation family affected with autosomal dominant chorea associated with dystonia identified a single de novo mutation — c.2088+1G > A in a 5' donor splice-site of ADCY5 — segregating with the disease. This mutation seeming leads to RNA instability and therefore ADCY5 haploinsufficiency.

Conclusions and Relevance

Our finding confirms the genetic/clinical heterogeneity of the disorder; corroborated by previous identification of ADCY5 mutations in one family with dyskinesia-facial myokymia and in two unrelated sporadic cases of paxoysmal choreic/dystonia-facial myokymia; ADCY5's high expression in the striatum and movement disorders in ADCY5-deficient mice. Hence ADCY5 genetic analyses may be relevant in the diagnostic workup of unexplained early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders.

### Chorea: non-genetic causes [^115hJMev]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review the literature on the non-genetic causes of chorea. The differential diagnosis of the large number of causes of sporadic chorea is often a challenging task. Interest has also been growing in the possibility that the mechanism responsible for Sydenham's chorea plays a role in the pathogeneis of other neuropsychiatric disorders.

Recent Findings

Stroke is the main cause of sporadic chorea. Sydenham's chorea shares clinical features with tic disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, there are unequivocal differences between Sydenham's chorea and Tourette's syndrome. There is initial evidence suggesting the beneficial effect of immunosuppression in Sydenham's chorea. Other autoimmune causes of chorea include systemic lupus erythematosus as well as paraneoplastic syndromes. The growing list of drugs associated with chorea include lamotrigine, methadone and lithium. Among infectious agents, HIV is the leading reported cause of chorea.

Summary

Patients with sporadic chorea require a thorough work up because numerous causes can lead to this condition. It remains unconfirmed whether the pathogenic mechanisms of Sydenham's chorea are responsible for other conditions such as isolated obsessive-compulsive disorder or Tourette's syndrome. Drugs and infectious agents, especially HIV, are often implicated in the causes of chorea.

### Chorea and seizures in a patient with a rare VPS13A gene mutation and neuroacanthocytosis [^114pRWMv]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Choreo-acanthocytosis (hAc) is an autosomal-recessive, neurodegenerative disorder, often presenting as movement disorder, seizures and behavioural changes. This case report describes a male patient who presented with progressive movement disorder, long-standing seizures and cognitive impairment. Neurological examination and neuroimaging revealed features suspicious for basal ganglia degeneration. Routine metabolic and infectious investigations were negative. Genetic testing identified a likely pathogenic VPS13A variant (c.799C > T, p. Arg267Ter), a rare genetic mutation associated with ChAc. This report highlights the complexities of diagnosis, differential considerations, the importance of genetic testing in atypical movement disorders, therapeutic strategies, and the detrimental impact of the VPS13A gene mutation on the patient's quality of life. This case also tries to expand the known mutational spectrum of the VPS13A gene and its varied clinical presentation.

5 Childhood‐Onset Chorea Formerly Labeled as 'Benign Hereditary Chorea'

The term benign hereditary chorea (BHC) has been historically used to describe childhood‐onset, non‐neurodegenerative choreas with stable or slowly progressive courses. However, this term is misleading, as some patients may develop significant disability related to motor symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities, cognitive dysfunction, or systemic involvement.

Several genes have been described that can result in a benign hereditary chorea (BHC) phenotype. However, BHC classically refers to patients with mutations in the NKX2‐1 / TITF‐1 gene. Mutations in the ADCY5 gene have been more recently described as a cause of benign hereditary chorea. Other genes associated with paroxysmal dyskinesias can also manifest as non‐progressive chorea.

5.1 ‐1‐Related Disorders ("Classic")

NKX2‐1 mutations, formerly TITF‐1, cause an AD childhood‐onset chorea that often improves with age. With a prevalence of less than one case per million, it is characterized by choreiform movements, often accompanied by respiratory and endocrine involvement. It belongs to the brain–lung–thyroid syndrome spectrum, although only 30%–40% of patients exhibit the full triad. Congenital hypothyroidism, recurrent respiratory infections, obstructive lung disease, and increased neoplastic risk have been reported.

The neurological clinical picture includes hypotonia associated with hyperkinetic movement disorders such as chorea, myoclonus, ataxia, tremor, and dystonia. Patients usually present with mild, non‐progressive psychomotor delay and psychiatric disorders within the spectrum of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and OCD.

Pathogenic variants include point mutations and larger deletions; the latter may be missed by standard NGS and require complementary techniques such as MLPA or array‐CGH for detection. Neuroimaging frequently reveals pituitary abnormalities, although it can also be normal. Blood tests may reveal thyroid hormone abnormalities.

Some patients may respond to treatment with levodopa.

Chorea is a movement disorder that may be found in children due to several causes. Here we focus especially on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus associated chorea. First we outline its epidemiology, hypothesized pathogenesis, clinical presentation and treatment, then we report four significant clinical cases, which represent well the extreme variability of set of symptoms that may accompany lupus chorea. Our experience, according to literature, suggests that choreic movements in a child should alert the pediatrician and lead him to investigate a potential neurological involvement of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

### Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in benign hereditary chorea [^112uedGb]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) is an autosomal dominant disorder that can be distinguished from Huntington disease by its early onset, stable or only slightly progressive course, and absence of mental deterioration. The variation in clinical features is such that its very existence has been doubted. The authors recently described the localization of a gene responsible for BHC on chromosome 14q in a large Dutch family.

Objective

To report results of extensive clinical and linkage analyses for this Dutch family and six other families with BHC.

Results

Three of the seven families had linkage to a region on chromosome 14q13.1-q21.1. HOMOG analysis showed odds of 10 x 10(11) in favor of locus heterogeneity. Haplotype analyses for the linked families resulted in a reduction of the critical interval for the BHC gene to 8.4 cM between marker D14S49 and marker D14S278. Clinically, these three families had a homogeneous picture with early-onset chorea, sometimes accompanied by slight ataxia in walking, but without dystonia, myoclonic jerks, or dysarthria. The severity of the choreatic movements tended to abate in adolescence or early adulthood. In the unlinked families, symptoms and signs were more heterogeneous as to age at onset and the occurrence of myoclonic jerks or dystonia.

Conclusions

BHC is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, with one well-defined clinical syndrome mapping to chromosome 14q.

3.2 Syndrome

It primarily affects males due to its X‐linked recessive inheritance, although there have been some cases reported in homozygous women or those with X chromosome inactivation, who tend to have milder symptoms. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the XK gene that contains a single coding exon and encodes the Kell protein responsible for carrying the Kx antigen on red blood cells. The prevalence of this condition is even lower than ChAc, with fewer than 1000 cases reported worldwide.

The onset of symptoms usually occurs later in life, typically between the ages of 40 and 60. The phenotype includes generalized chorea. Tics may be predominant. Self‐injurious behaviors are less common than in ChAc. Axial myopathy, sensory‐motor axonal polyneuropathy with areflexia, and epileptic seizures are common. OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as perseveration, behavioral changes, and cognitive decline, may also be present. Regarding systemic symptoms, the presence of cardiomyopathy (up to 70% of patients), arrhythmias, and the risk of sudden death should be considered. These patients may experience severe adverse reactions after receiving a blood transfusion without the McLeod phenotype starting from the second exposure.

The genetic diagnosis of McLeod syndrome relies on the identification of pathogenic variants in the XK gene. XK is covered in most neuroacanthocytosis gene panels and WES. However, as previously mentioned for ChAc, large deletions may also escape detection by WES; in such cases, confirmation with MLPA or array‐CGH focused on Xp21 is recommended.

The absence of the Kx antigen and weakened Kell antigen expression in red blood cells provides a useful hematological clue that supports the diagnosis and should prompt genetic confirmation. As for ChAc, blood tests may show elevated CK levels, and acanthocytes may be present. MRI shows caudate atrophy. The electromyogram may reveal a pattern consistent with sensory‐motor axonal polyneuropathy and myopathy, which can also be confirmed through muscle biopsy or muscle MRI.

1 INTRODUCTION

Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic condition in which psychological distress is common. Due to its genetic nature, a child of an individual with the expanded HD gene will have a 50% chance of inheriting and subsequently developing the condition. HD is incurable and progressive, with increasing problems with movement and cognitive impairment leading to dementia. The global prevalence is approximately 2.7 per 100,000 (Pringsheim et al.) but is higher in some countries, for example, 10 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom (Furby et al.).

Predictive genetic testing can be undertaken to determine whether an individual carries the expanded gene and guidelines recommend that this should occur at age 18 or older, barring exceptional circumstances.

Individuals are not diagnosed with HD until they display motor difficulties, for example, chorea or loss of balance (Novak & Tabrizi). Therefore, those with the gene expansion but no motor signs are known as presymptomatic or premanifest and those who have not sought genetic testing but have a biological parent (50% risk) or grandparent (25% risk) with HD are known as being at risk (Novak & Tabrizi). Usual onset of motor symptoms occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 (McColgan & Tabrizi,), though with wide variation (Frich et al.). Death occurs approximately 24 years after a HD motor diagnosis (Rodrigues et al.). Currently, no medications slow the progression of the disease, though help with symptom control is available for some elements, such as involuntary movements (Venuto et al.).

### Should spinocerebellar ataxias be included in the differential diagnosis for Huntington's diseases-like syndromes? [^116xr4KG]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

In this article, we describe three patients with different spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes presenting with unusual movement disorders predominantly characterized by choreoathetosis, which, together with their autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, resembled the Huntington-like syndromes. From a large SCA cohort, we have observed chorea in 1/35 SCA2, 1/112 SCA3/MJD, and 1/30 SCA7 patients. Twenty-eight patients with SCA1, 11 patients with SCA6, and 3 patients with SCA10 were also evaluated, and none of them presented chorea. We provide a brief report of the three cases, with a video demonstrating chorea. Although a debate regarding the frequency of chorea in SCA patients is a fact, its occurrence, together with the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, clearly imposes SCA in the differentials of Huntington-like syndromes. There is some debate about what to include in a list of Huntington-like disorders, with several review articles about Huntington-like syndromes not including SCA in the differential diagnosis, except for SCA17. We believe that SCAs-at least SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA7 and DRPLA-should be thought in the diagnostic workout of at least the atypical cases, such as those presented in this report.

3 Neuroacanthocytosis

Neuroacanthocytosis refers to a group of disorders that present neurological symptoms and acanthocytes in peripheral blood (Table 4). These syndromes can be categorized into "core" neuroacanthocytosis syndromes — such as chorea‐acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome — where chorea is a key clinical feature, and other neurological conditions in which acanthocytes may also appear but chorea is not the predominant manifestation.

TABLE 4
Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes.

3.1 Chorea‐Acanthocytosis — Levine‐Critchley Syndrome

It is the most common cause of neuroacanthocytosis, as well as the most frequent form of autosomal recessive (AR) hereditary chorea. It is caused by variants in the VPS13A gene, which leads to the absence of chorein — a protein expressed in both neurons and erythrocytes. The estimated prevalence is less than one case per million. Symptom onset typically occurs in the third or fourth decade of life, and the life expectancy is approximately 15–20 years from onset.

The phenotype closely resembles that of HD, presenting with a pattern of generalized chorea. However, several distinctive features help differentiate it from HD. There is a marked predilection for involvement of the buccolingual region, including oromandibular dystonia and the characteristic "feeding dystonia". Self‐injurious behaviors — particularly tongue and lip biting — are common and may lead to significant mutilation. Tics are very common, particularly vocalizations, grunting, belching, and echolalia. A particularly distinctive motor symptom is intermittent head drop. Additional neurological findings include axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy and myopathy with hypo‐ or areflexia. The gait is described as "rubber‐person" attributed to a combination of motor impersistence, dystonia, and myopathy. Parkinsonism may also occur. Approximately one‐third of patients also experience generalized epileptic seizures. Neuropsychiatric symptoms include prominent OCD, along with apathy and frontal behavioral changes. Cognitively, patients experience progressive deterioration, primarily with executive dysfunction, which may ultimately progress to dementia.

2.5 Treatment

The management of HD should be multidisciplinary, addressing the treatment of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms in an integrated manner. Chorea is primarily managed with vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, although antipsychotics are commonly used in routine clinical practice to manage both chorea and psychiatric symptoms, while antidepressants are frequently employed to treat psychiatric disorders.

### Pharmacological treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease-good clinical practice versus evidence-based guideline [^111oG7YR]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, the American Academy of Neurology published an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacological treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease. Although the progress in medical care because of the implementation of criteria of evidence-based medicine is undisputed, the guideline classifies the level of evidence for drugs to reduce chorea based on anchors in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Motor Score chorea sum score, which were chosen arbitrarily and do not reflect validated or generally accepted levels of clinical relevance. Thus, the guideline faces several serious limitations and delivers clinical recommendations that do not represent current clinical practice; these are reviewed in detail, and arguments are presented why these recommendations should not be followed. To remedy the lack of evidence-based recommendations and provide guidance to a pragmatic symptomatic therapy of chorea in HD, a flow-chart pathway that follows currently established clinical standards based on expert opinion is presented. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society

### Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes [^111ini6y]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients presenting with features of Huntington's disease but lacking the causative genetic expansion can be challenging diagnostically. The differential diagnosis of such Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes has not recently been reviewed.

Recent Findings

Cohort studies have established the relative frequencies of known Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes, whereas newly described ones have been characterized genetically, clinically, radiologically and pathologically.

Summary

About 1% of suspected Huntington's disease cases emerge as phenocopy syndromes. Such syndromes are clinically important in their own right but may also shed light on the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease produces a range of clinical phenotypes, and the range of syndromes that may be responsible for Huntington's disease phenocopies is correspondingly wide. Cohort studies have established that, while the majority of phenocopy patients remain undiagnosed, in those patients where a genetic diagnosis is reached the commonest causes are SCA17, Huntington's disease-like syndrome 2 (HDL2), familial prion disease and Friedreich's ataxia. We review the features of the reported genetic causes of Huntington's disease phenocopy syndromes, including HDL1–3, SCA17, familial prion disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, chorea-acanthocytosis and iron-accumulation disorders. We present an evidence-based framework for the genetic testing of Huntington's disease phenocopy cases.

### George Huntington: a legacy of inquiry, empathy and hope [^111cG1Lv]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

In the 100 years since the death of George Huntington in 1916, the disorder he described as a 'medical curiosity' has become a focus of intense medical and scientific interest, in part because of the contribution of families in generating knowledge about this family disease. As many writers have noted, George Huntington's own family played a crucial role in defining this illness. What has been less appreciated is that the affected families he described also played a role, in ways that George Huntington himself acknowledged. Not quite 22 years old (Fig. 1), just graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, and with little clinical experience, no established medical practice, and no patients of his own with the disorder, he wrote an account in 1872 that William Osler considered one of the most succinct and accurate portraits of a disease ever written. It was not the earliest medical account of hereditary chorea but it was certainly the most complete. And for social and cultural as well as medical and scientific reasons, it played a far more important role in defining the discrete clinical entity that soon came to be known as 'Huntington's chorea' and by the late 1960s, as 'Huntington's disease'. Despite considerable recognition during his lifetime, George Huntington remained a small town family physician but not a provincial or isolated one. He was aware that his paper had drawn the attention of the medical profession at home and abroad and that this had helped reveal the disease in many parts of the world. He was in touch with some eminent clinicians of his day, including Osler, and an invited speaker on Huntington's chorea at medical societies such as the influential New York Neurological Society. At a time when medicine was becoming increasingly 'scientific', he too placed his hope in research, although he chose not to pursue research himself. Alluding to the unknown pathology of chorea, which had intrigued him from the start, he trusted 'that science, which has accomplished such wonders through the never-tiring devotion of its votaries, may yet "overturn and overturn, and overturn it", until it is laid open to the light of day'.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^114dG2sQ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Paediatric movement disorders (PMDs) comprise a large group of disorders (tics, myoclonus, tremor, dystonia, chorea, Parkinsonism, ataxia), often with mixed phenotypes. Determination of the underlying aetiology can be difficult given the broad differential diagnosis and the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relationships. This can make the diagnostic process time-consuming and difficult. In this overview, we present a diagnostic approach for PMDs, with emphasis on genetic causes. This approach can serve as a framework to lead the clinician through the diagnostic process in eight consecutive steps, including recognition of the different movement disorders, identification of a clinical syndrome, consideration of acquired causes, genetic testing including next-generation sequencing, post-sequencing phenotyping, and interpretation of test results. The aim of this approach is to increase the recognition and diagnostic yield in PMDs. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: An up-to-date description and diagnostic framework for testing of paediatric movement disorders is presented. The framework helps to determine which patients will benefit from next-generation sequencing.

### Antiphospholipid-related chorea [^111hfYjh]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chorea can be associated with autoimmune diseases such as antiphospholipid syndrome and has been associated with the isolated presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Chorea is a rare neurological manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying aPL-related chorea are still debated. One postulated mechanism is aPL or other autoantibody binding to brain-blood vessel endothelium, resulting in endothelial dysfunction secondary to a proinflammatory cascade, with sequalae of inflammation and local microthrombosis. Another postulated mechanism considers immune-mediated attack (aPL or antibasal ganglia antibodies) against specific basal ganglia epitopes. Here, we report a patient with isolated aPL-related chorea that followed a relapsing-remitting course. We highlight the role of brain metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxy glucose positron-emission tomography in the diagnostic workup of chorea and the challenges in the practical management of aPL-related chorea with symptomatic treatments.

### Role of neuroimaging in multidisciplinary approach towards non-Alzheimer's dementia [^115QMKfj]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD)

HD is an autosomal dominant, inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. It is characterized by abnormal choreiform movements, psychiatric symptoms and early onset dementia. Cognitive deficits are inevitable in HD and common clinical manifestations are executive dysfunction, lack of insight and slowed processing. Caudate atrophy is the typical neuroimaging finding on axial MRI images (Fig. 7), and changes in linear caudate measurements correlate with severity of cognitive dysfunction. Abnormal metabolic changes can also be noted on positron-emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI. The differential diagnosis of HD is broad and ranges from benign familial chorea to hereditary and acquired neurodegenerative diseases. The diagnosis of HD is principally based upon a combination of clinical features, family history and presence of trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the HTT gene.

### Consecutive pregnancy with chorea gravidarum associated with moyamoya disease [^112SDbre]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Chorea gravidarum is uncommon movement disorder of pregnancy, characterized by involuntary, abrupt, non-rhythmic movements. It can be idiopathic or secondary to the underlying pathology. A 28-year-old, primigravida woman who was 8 weeks and 6 days of gestation presented with a history of involuntary choreiform movements in the left side limbs and facial twitch for 2 weeks. The symptoms started just after onset of severe emesis gravidarum. There was no meaningful medical history or family history, and she was taking no regular medication. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed moyamoya disease. The symptoms, as well as the hyperemesis gravidarum, improved with gestational age; however, they were sustained up to 30 weeks of gestation. She delivered 2.61 kg, healthy male neonate at 40 weeks' pregnancy by vaginal delivery under epidural analgesia. After 3 years later, she got pregnant again, and delivered at 41 weeks of pregnancy without complication. She experienced similar but milder symptoms to that of the first pregnancy until the late second trimester. After the delivery, full evaluation was lost due to her refusal. In this report, we present the case of a patient with chorea gravidarum in which moyamoya disease acts as an etiologic factor and a review of literature with management proposal.

### The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes:' red flags' for the clinician [^116EKHqs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

To date, progressive hereditary HD-like syndromes were classified mainly according to their mode of inheritance. Although this criterion can be very helpful in the presence of a well-established family history, it may not be practically useful in the numerous cases in which family history is unavailable or inaccurate. In this review, we discuss the differential diagnosis of HD focusing on a restricted number of clinical features ('red flags') that might help clinicians to narrow the spectrum of working diagnoses and improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic process.

### Treatments and outcomes among patients with sydenham chorea: a meta-analysis [^113Qbc2S]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which clinical and treatment factors at onset of Sydenham chorea are associated with chorea duration, relapsing disease course, and functional outcome?

Findings

In this individual patient data meta-analysis of 1479 patients, those receiving at least 1 month of corticosteroids had a median chorea duration of 1.2 months vs 2.8 months for patients receiving none, a significant difference. Patients treated with antibiotics, corticosteroids, or sodium valproate had significantly reduced odds of relapse.

Meaning

These observational data support the use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, and sodium valproate for treatment of Sydenham chorea.

### [F] FDG PET in conditions associated with hyperkinetic movement disorders and ataxia: a systematic review [^1125YLhd]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Key characteristics

Studies on several chronic types of ataxia were included. Hypometabolism in the cerebellum was a common feature. In addition, hypometabolism may occur in various regions, such as the brainstem, frontal cortex, and striatum. Motor symptoms were correlated with metabolism in these areas, and [18 F]FDG PET scans showed potentially positive effects of treatment.

Chorea

The 27 articles that reported on [18 F]FDG PET in patients with Huntington's disease (HD) had a number of symptomatic patients per study that ranged from 5 to 47. One study reported on a heterogeneous group with, next to HD patients, two patients with chorea-acanthocytosis, two patients with a HD phenotype but a without a positive family history, and two patients with hemichorea due to vascular lesions. Although we excluded HMD due to structural lesions, we decided to include this study as the results are given to the whole group. Nine of the 27 articles performed a partial volume correction.

Changes in regional glucose metabolism

Eighteen articles compared patients with healthy controls. The most prominent finding was hypometabolism of the caudate nucleus and putamen (n = 18 and n = 15). Hypometabolism was also found in the frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, while relative hypermetabolism was observed in the occipital cortex and around the calcarine fissure (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).

### De novo mutations in PDE10A cause childhood-onset chorea with bilateral striatal lesions [^111UaAts]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Main Text

Movement disorders comprise a large clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders, which can be subdivided into various clinical entities, including dystonia and chorea. Although monogenic causes are overall rare, mutations in greater than > 200 genes are known to cause either an isolated movement disorder or a syndromic form of movement disorders. However, in total, mutations in these genes only explain a small proportion of cases, suggesting that mutations in more genes await discovery.

Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder clinically characterized by continuous and brief involuntary movements, which flow from one body part to another and are unpredictable in terms of timing, speed, and direction. Chorea is a major feature of several inherited neurological disorders. Functional dysregulation of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which form the main output projections from the basal ganglia, is considered to underlie the pathophysiology of the choreic movements.

We have identified three European-descent individuals affected by a similar childhood-onset movement disorder predominantly characterized by chorea and bilateral striatal abnormalities on cerebral MRI. The main clinical and radiological features of the three individuals are presented in Table 1. In brief, all three individuals presented in childhood (age of onset between 5 and 10 years) with a scarcely progressive movement disorder dominated by chorea. Developmental milestones were normal, and there were no other major neurological features, in particular intellectual disability or cognitive decline. Given these clinical features and the absence of a significant progression of symptoms, a diagnosis of benign hereditary chorea (BHC [MIM:])was initially considered. However, within the striatum in all three individuals, brain MRI consistently showed bilateral T2 hyperintensity (Figure 1), which is an atypical finding for BHC.

### The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes:' red flags' for the clinician [^114PczRy]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common hereditary neurodegenerative illness with onset before mid-life and a distinct phenotype characterised by movement disorders (mainly chorea, dystonia and Parkinsonism), incoordination, cognitive deterioration and behavioural changes. Progressive neural cell loss within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, predominantly in the neostriatum (caudate and putamen), leads to this clinical presentation.

HD is a trinucleotide-repeat disorder with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The causative mutation is a prolongation (above 35 repeats) of a trinucleotide (CAG) stretch within the IT15 gene, associated with full penetrance when this exceeds 40 and incomplete penetrance between 36 and 39. As in several other trinucleotide-repeat disorders, there is a strong association between repeat length and age at disease onset, with higher repeat length leading to earlier onset. Paternal transmission facilitates this anticipation phenomenon. Age at onset is strongly linked to the clinical expression of both motor and cognitive features of the disease. Juvenile HD (ie, with onset before age 20) is dominated by a hypokinetic-rigid syndrome (Westphal variant) and a more rapid course, whereas adult-onset HD classically presents with a choreatic syndrome and a less severe progression of motor and non-motor features.

An increasing number of progressive heredodegenerative illnesses may mimic the presentation of HD. It has been estimated that between 1% and 7% of subjects with a HD-like syndrome do not have HD. Given the relationship between motor phenotype and age at onset in HD, these HD-like syndromes are, with some exceptions, either diseases manifesting with a predominantly choreatic syndrome and onset in adulthood (online supplementary table 1a) or diseases presenting with predominant dystonia and Parkinsonism and onset in the first 2 decades (online supplementary table 1b). The comprehensive understanding of the phenomenology and diagnosis of progressive HD-like syndromes is crucial for an efficient and cost-effective diagnostic work-up and guides further genetic testing once the diagnosis of HD has been genetically excluded. This work-up may include thorough clinical examination, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment, metabolic screening, imaging and electrophysiology.

Clinical features and laboratory findings

The most common criteria manifestations were thrombocytopenia (30.0%; 54/180), and arterial thrombosis (29.1%; 52/179) without a high-risk cardiovascular disease profile. Venous thromboembolism was observed in 18.4% (33/179) of patients. The majority of patients (67.0%; 120/179) experienced only one episode of chorea (table 2). Bilateral chorea was observed in 58.8% (94/160) of patients, while 87.2% (102/117) had involvement of both upper and lower limbs. Isolated lower limb involvement was not seen. Head or face involvement was present in 72.8% (83/114) of patients. Although most patients lacked clear triggers, some had definite precipitating factors, with 7.8% (14/179) associated with oral contraceptives and 7.3% (13/179) associated with pregnancy. The duration of the chorea varied widely, from days to years. While some patients recovered within days (1.2%; 2/166), the majority required months (58.4%; 97/166) or even years (22.3%; 37/166) for improvement.

### Oral contraceptive induced chorea: another condition associated with anti-basal ganglia antibodies [^112xaQFn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Use of oral contraceptives is a recognised but infrequent cause of chorea. This type of chorea has usually been considered a reactivation of Sydenham's chorea by an unknown mechanism. A patient developed a chorea triggered by the use of oral contraceptives with no definite evidence of previous Sydenham's chorea or recent streptoccocal infections. However, the patient had positive anti-basal ganglia antibodies, which supports an immunological basis for the pathophysiology of this chorea.

14.1 Chorea Associated with Huntington's Disease

The efficacy of AUSTEDO as a treatment for chorea associated with Huntington's disease was established primarily in Study 1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial conducted in 90 ambulatory patients with manifest chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The diagnosis of Huntington's disease was based on family history, neurological exam, and genetic testing. Treatment duration was 12 weeks, including an 8-week dose titration period and a 4-week maintenance period, followed by a 1-week washout. Patients were not blinded to discontinuation. AUSTEDO was started at 6 mg per day and titrated upward, at weekly intervals, in 6 mg increments until satisfactory treatment of chorea was achieved, intolerable side effects occurred, or until a maximal dose of 48 mg per day was reached. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Total Maximal Chorea Score, an item of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). On this scale, chorea is rated from 0 to 4 (with 0 representing no chorea) for 7 different parts of the body. The total score ranges from 0 to 28.

Of the 90 patients enrolled, 87 patients completed the study. The mean age was 54 (range 23 to 74). Patients were 56% male and 92% Caucasian. The mean dose after titration was 40 mg per day. Table 5 and Figure 1 summarize the effects of AUSTEDO on chorea based on the Total Maximal Chorea Score. Total Maximal Chorea Scores for patients receiving AUSTEDO improved by approximately 4.4 units from baseline to the maintenance period (average of Week 9 and Week 12), compared to approximately 1.9 units in the placebo group. The treatment effect of -2.5 units was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The Maintenance Endpoint is the mean of the Total Maximal Chorea Scores for the Week 9 and Week 12 visits. At the Week 13 follow-up visit (1 week after discontinuation of the study medication), the Total Maximal Chorea Scores of patients who had received AUSTEDO returned to baseline (Figure 1).

We studied a boy with congenital hypothyroidism, benign hereditary chorea, and respiratory distress. His mother and his grandfather were affected by hypothyroidism with a late onset and benign hereditary chorea. The aim of this study was to establish the genetic defects that cause that phenotype and study the molecular mechanisms of the pathology.

Methods

NKX2.1, PAX8, NKX2.5, and TAZ genes were sequenced.

Results

Direct sequencing of the NKX2.1 gene showed, in all the affected, a new heterozygous mutation from cytosine to adenine in the second base of the triplet encoding for the amino acid at position 145. The mutation (C609A) is responsible for a change from serine to a stop codon (S145X). We also demonstrated that the mutant protein is predominantly in the cytoplasm and unable to translocate into the nucleus. Of note, the S145X mutation produces variable phenotypes in the affected members of the family. No mutations have been identified in the NKX2.5, PAX8, and TAZ genes.

Conclusions

Our study extends the knowledge of the functional effect of NKX2.1 mutations and further highlights the complexities of genotype-phenotype correlation in the NKX2.1 deficiency syndromes.

### Familial psychogenic movement disorders [^115BQ5pq]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Psychogenic (or functional) movement disorders (PMDs) are considered sporadic. Despite the growing literature describing the clinical features and the natural history of sporadic cases with PMDs, their occurrence in familial clusters is not reported.

Methods

We identified 10 patients from 5 families affected by PMDs. In this report, we describe the clinical characteristics along with videos and long-term follow-up of these patients.

Results

Clinical clues from the history and signs suggesting a functional origin of the symptoms in these patients with familial PMD were similar to those identified in sporadic cases. The phenomenology of the PMD was similar in the affected members of the same family.

Conclusions

We wish to highlight that a positive family history does not necessarily imply an organic disorder. When a positive family history for a condition is reported by a patient with PMD, examination of these further affected members may be needed and may identify further family members suffering from PMDs. A positive family history of PMDs may be an additional risk factor for developing PMDs. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### Huntington's disease [^113h79em]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a distinct phenotype, including chorea and dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioural difficulties. Typically, onset of symptoms is in middle-age after affected individuals have had children, but the disorder can manifest at any time between infancy and senescence. The mutant protein in Huntington's disease — huntingtin — results from an expanded CAG repeat leading to a polyglutamine strand of variable length at the N-terminus. Evidence suggests that this tail confers a toxic gain of function. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of Huntington's disease are poorly understood, but research in transgenic animal models of the disorder is providing insight into causative factors and potential treatments.

### Huntington's disease and Huntington's disease-like syndromes: an overview [^115SUUv2]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The differential diagnosis of chorea syndromes may be complex and includes various genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and mimicking disorders called Huntington's disease-like (HDL) phenotypes. To familiarize clinicians with these (in some cases very rare) conditions we will summarize the main characteristics.

Recent Findings

HDL disorders are rare and account for about 1% of cases presenting with a Huntington's disease phenotype. They share overlapping clinical features, so making the diagnosis purely on clinical grounds may be challenging, however presence of certain characteristics may be a clue (e.g. prominent orofacial involvement in neuroferritinopathy etc.), Information of ethnic descent will also guide genetic work-up [HDL2 in Black Africans; dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in Japanese etc.], Huntington's disease, the classical HDL disorders (except HDL3) and DRPLA are repeat disorders with anticipation effect and age-dependent phenotype in some, but genetic underpinnings may be more complicated in the other chorea syndromes.

Summary

With advances in genetics more and more rare diseases are disentangled, allowing molecular diagnoses in a growing number of choreic patients. Hopefully, with better understanding of their pathophysiology we are moving towards mechanistic therapies.

### A novel TITF-1 mutation causes benign hereditary chorea with response to levodopa [^11166k98]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Presented is a pedigree with infancy-onset benign hereditary chorea (BHC) caused by a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 (523G→T, E175X) of the TITF-1 (Nkx2.1) gene. Four confirmed mutation carriers showed the typical movement disorder of BHC and congenital hypothyroidism. Surprisingly, treatment with levodopa improved gait dramatically and reduced chorea in two patients. Dopaminergic drugs should be considered a useful therapeutic option in BHC.

### The clinical approach to movement disorders [^112524KZ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders are commonly encountered in the clinic. In this Review, aimed at trainees and general neurologists, we provide a practical step-by-step approach to help clinicians in their 'pattern recognition' of movement disorders, as part of a process that ultimately leads to the diagnosis. The key to success is establishing the phenomenology of the clinical syndrome, which is determined from the specific combination of the dominant movement disorder, other abnormal movements in patients presenting with a mixed movement disorder, and a set of associated neurological and non-neurological abnormalities. Definition of the clinical syndrome in this manner should, in turn, result in a differential diagnosis. Sometimes, simple pattern recognition will suffice and lead directly to the diagnosis, but often ancillary investigations, guided by the dominant movement disorder, are required. We illustrate this diagnostic process for the most common types of movement disorder, namely, akinetic-rigid syndromes and the various types of hyperkinetic disorders (myoclonus, chorea, tics, dystonia and tremor).

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a patient with a family history of Huntington disease: genetic counseling challenges [^116ZKE8X]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2014). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington disease (HD) are generally considered to be distinct and easily differentiated neurologic conditions. However, there are case reports of the co-occurrence of ALS with HD. We present a 57-year-old male with a clinical diagnosis of sporadic ALS in the context of a family history of HD. This case adds to the limited literature regarding individuals with a family history of HD who present with features of ALS. There were several genetic counseling challenges in counseling this patient including the diagnostic consideration of two fatal conditions, complex risk information, the personal and familial implications, and the patient's inability to communicate verbally or through writing due to disease progression. DNA banking effectively preserved the right of our patient and his wife not to learn his HD genetic status during a stressful time of disease progression while providing the option for family members to learn this information in the future if desired. We present lessons learned and considerations for other clinical genetics professionals who are presented with similar challenging issues.

### Movement disorders and pregnancy: a review of the literature [^116sdkkM]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnant patients are rarely encountered in the movement disorders clinic, but they present significant dilemmas regarding treatment and counseling for neurologists. While movement disorders in pregnancy once described those disorders arising de novo during pregnancy, such as chorea gravidarum or restless leg syndrome, advancing maternal age in Western countries will likely increase the number of women in whom pregnancy complicates a pre-existing movement disorder. Physicians treating these women must be aware of the impact of the movement disorder and its treatment on fertility, pregnancy, fetal development, lactation, and infant care. This review summarizes retrospective series and case reports to both guide clinicians and to stimulate and direct the design of prospective studies.

### The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes:' red flags' for the clinician [^115SmMLt]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Speed of progression

The rate of progression of HD can vary considerably across subjects, being, at least in part, related to age of onset and length of trinucleotide-repeat expansion. HD-like syndromes with adult onset may vary in their speed of progression. Importantly, some conditions may progress more rapidly. Among the latter, HDL1, a very rare autosomal dominant prion disease with onset in early adulthood (third–fourth decades), should be kept in account. HDL1 is caused by a 192-nucleotide insertion in a region of the prion protein (PRNP) gene coding for an octapeptide-repeat. HDL1 is recognised as the fourth genetic prion disease phenotype, although not associated typically with spongiform degeneration pathology, but with atrophy and prion deposition within basal ganglia, frontal and temporal lobes, and cerebellar cortex. Although this condition progresses more slowly than other prion diseases, case series reported that most subjects survive between 1 and 10 years from onset. Patients develop prominent personality changes, cognitive decline, chorea, rigidity, limb and truncal ataxia, dysarthria and seizures. It is useful to remind that chorea may be a feature also of the most common prion disease, that is, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Other forms characterised by higher speed of progression are HDL2, relentlessly leading to death within 10–20 years, and DRPLA, generally leading to death within 10–15 years.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: leukodystrophy-tremor and tribulations [^116aZZyC]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The initial symptoms described in this patient included a progressive movement disorder coupled with behavioral change and psychiatric symptoms These symptoms suggest a broad differential diagnosis including Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and anti-NMDA encephalitis, among others. Although the absence of a family history in this case does not align with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of Huntington disease, there is overlap in the clinical picture. Specifically, as with this patient, individuals with Huntington disease present with chorea, irritability, and depression while later Parkinsonism and dystonia are frequently observed. By contrast, Wilson disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, meaning negative family history would not be uncommon. Typically half of patients present with neurologic signs, 40% with hepatological involvement and only 10% with psychiatric symptoms. Initial symptoms may be mild and nonspecific, such as difficulty concentrating and lack of coordination, with later features including parkinsonism, tremor, and dystonia. However, abnormalities in serum copper and caeruloplasmin testing would be anticipated. Anti-NMDA encephalitis, with a young (25–35 years) female predominance and linked with ovarian teratomas, shares similar symptoms at presentation. These would include behavioral change and depression, although mania and psychosis are also reported, with later movement disorder emergence and seizures. However, NMDA encephalitis is typically acute or subacute, making it less likely in this patient. Although not consistent with the clinical phenotype in this case, a wider differential diagnosis for adult-onset movement disorder and psychiatric symptoms includes Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome, primary dystonia, and the immune mediated anti–leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), antiglycine receptor, and anti-D2 dopamine receptor disorders.

In this case, the key investigation was MRI of the brain demonstrating diffuse white matter changes, which raised the possibility of a leukodystrophy. The pattern and anatomical distribution of white matter changes vary with the distinct aetiologies of leukodystrophy but can often aid in guiding next-step investigations, including genetic testing. In the absence of a family history, initial investigations should explore potential acquired causes including testing for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B/C and tuberculosis, inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and malignancy, particularly primary CNS lymphoma. Other potential causes of a confluent and symmetrical leukoencephalopathy on MRI of the brain include previous chemotherapy (in particular 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate), radiotherapy, and recreational drug use, such as heroin and methanol that would need to be explored during the clinical history.

Neurologic Wilson disease — manifestations and evaluation: Neurological manifestations of WD are also extremely variable, and there is no clear correlation between specific ATP7B mutations and risk of neurological presentation; neurological symptoms of WD include dysarthria, dystonia, gait abnormalities, ataxia, tremor, parkinsonism, and chorea, and seizures occur rarely. A complete neurological examination should be performed by a neurologist or movement disorder specialist in all patients with WD with neurological signs or symptoms detected on examination by any healthcare provider. Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are of limited value in determining the extent of clinical neurological disease but may help in excluding other neurological disorders, and evaluation of the extrapyramidal system should include observation for posturing of the extremities or torso, irregular dance-like movements (chorea), determination of tone, and evidence of tremor at rest, with posture or action, or as a rubral wing-beating tremor.

### George Huntington: a legacy of inquiry, empathy and hope [^113B3GRg]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Huntington's chorea in the crosshairs of psychiatry, neurology, genetics and eugenics

Although George Huntington's paper was immediately published in a reputable Philadelphia medical journal, The Medical and Surgical Reporter (Fig. 4), it attracted little notice at first apart from a brief abstract in Virchow and Hirsch's Jahresbericht or Yearbook of Important Medical Writings for the Year 1872. Two years later, the eminent Italian neuropathologist Camillo Golgi footnoted it in a paper noting dramatic changes in the cortex and striatum of a deceased 42-year-old male patient with chorea, mental disturbance, and an 'hysteric' mother. However, with the expansion of neurology as a medical specialty in the 1870s and 1880s and the growing population of patients in psychiatric hospitals and asylums in the United States and Europe, clinicians began reporting similar cases with increasing frequency. In 1892 some authors were even claiming that the literature on this disorder was 'copious' and that its clinical history was 'very thoroughly known'. (;. (A few clinicians, including Charcot, considered 'hereditary chorea' a variant of the childhood disorder. But by the 1890s most viewed it as distinct.) Ironically, while neurologists claimed Huntington's chorea as a neurological disease par excellence, many more psychiatrists than neurologists actually encountered such patients, typically in the mushrooming population of psychiatric institutions. Those who did were impressed by the contrast this disorder presented with Sydenham's chorea, including the late onset, the inexorable progression, and the fact that 'heredity is one of the most remarkable features'. Nonetheless, the names used at the time highlighted features other than heredity, for example chorea of the aged, choreic dementia, dementia choreica, and Osler's preference, chronic progressive chorea, although soon Huntington's chorea displaced them all (.

### A novel nonsense mutation in the TITF-1 gene in a Japanese family with benign hereditary chorea [^1156RPrg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

A Japanese family with a novel nonsense mutation in the TITF-1 gene (p.Y98X) is described. The proband showed severe generalized chorea, delayed motor development, subnormal intelligence, congenital hypothyroidism, bronchial asthma, and a history of pulmonary infection, all of which are characteristic features of Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome. On the other hand, her brother and mother showed a mild benign hereditary chorea (BHC) phenotype with congenital hypothyroidism. Intrafamilial phenotypic variation is common in BHC/Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome and suggests the existence of other genetic or environmental factors regulating TITF-1 function. Although choreic movement in BHC/Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome is recognized as non-progressive, the proband showed re-exacerbation of choreic movement at puberty. The dopamine agonist, ropinirole hydrochloride, reduced her choreic movements, suggesting that levodopa and/or dopamine agonists may compensate for underdeveloped dopaminergic pathways in this disorder.

### Discovering the family history of Huntington disease (HD) [^111gVxxR]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2006). Low credibility.

A considerable body of research has explored both predictive genetic test decisions for Huntington disease (HD) and the impact of receiving a test result. Extant research reveals little, however, about how and when at risk persons first discover their family history of HD. Drawing upon 24 semi-structured interviews with at risk persons and their family members, this study explored initial discovery of HD in the family. Qualitative data analysis revealed four different, though sometimes related, trajectories of discovery: (1) something is wrong, (2) out of the blue, (3) knowing, but dismissing, and 4) growing up with HD. These pathways highlighted the importance of the temporal and historical contexts in which genetic risk for HD was discovered. Notably, ignorance about HD was the most salient feature shaping participants' narratives of discovery. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed.

### Phenotypic insights into ADCY5-associated disease [^1128CXYQ]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Three of seven of our subjects had involuntary movements during infancy (K4‐1, K5‐1, and K6‐1). Infantile onset chorea has a wide differential diagnosis, both acquired and hereditary; however chorea almost always disappears during sleep, 38 in contrast to our subject who had episodic exacerbations of chorea during arousal from sleep. Contrasting our patient's presentation with other acquired and hereditary causes of childhood‐onset chorea, Sydenham chorea tends to occur in childhood rather than in infancy and causes continuous rather than episodic generalized chorea, often associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. 39 Neuroimaging abnormalities, history of birth injury, and a nonprogressive course helps to differentiate dyskinetic cerebral pallsy from ADCY5 mutations. Benign hereditary chorea is an autosomal‐dominant, nonprogressive infantile or childhood‐onset condition presenting with generalized chorea that usually diminishes or disappears with age, 40 differing from ADCY5 mutations in which choreoathetosis is often initially episodic and progressively becomes constant. 1, 3 Therefore, we propose that infantile‐onset chorea, with exacerbation during drowsiness or arousal, should alert the clinician to the possibility of an ADCY5 mutation.

The majority of our subjects had normal cognitive development despite subjects with initial language milestone delay. Two subjects had mild‐to‐moderate intellectual disability that was nonprogressive. The lack of cognitive decline differentiates ADCY5 mutation from neurodegenerative conditions such as Huntington's disease, which presents with chorea and dementia.

### Treatments and outcomes among patients with sydenham chorea: a meta-analysis [^113qhm3H]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sydenham chorea (SC) is an autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with prior group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. It is 1 of the major manifestations of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and remains the most common acquired chorea of childhood worldwide, including some high-income settings. In SC, chorea of the extremities, and, often, chorea of the face, tongue, and trunk are usually accompanied by hypotonia and emotional or behavioral disturbances, most frequently emotional lability. In a subgroup with severe disease, there is complete loss of tone and voluntary movements (chorea paralytica). Most patients recover fully within 6 to 9 months, but symptoms persist in up to 40% of patients, and relapses occur in 16%-42%. Except for antibiotics, there is limited consensus regarding treatment. Only 3 small randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing immunotherapy for SC have been reported, and treatment strategies vary widely, with corticosteroid use in recent cohorts ranging from 16% to 75%, and steroid regimens differing even within centers. Herein we present a comprehensive evidence synthesis of published SC cases with individual patient data (IPD), with the aims of describing the clinical features and management of SC and of identifying associations between early clinical and treatment factors and disease course and outcome.

### New syndromic form of benign hereditary chorea is associated with a deletion of TITF-1 and PAX-9 contiguous genes [^113PyuZX]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea is a rare autosomal dominant disorder presenting with a childhood-onset and slowly progressive chorea. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical and genetic features of 3 patients who developed childhood-onset chorea. Three affected patients from three generations of a family with benign hereditary chorea associated with a multisystemic disorder of the basal ganglia, thyroid, lungs, salivary glands, bowels, and teeth. The TITF-1 gene was screened by microsatellite analysis, gene sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Genetic analysis revealed a novel 0.9-Mb deletion on chromosome 14, which includes the TITF-1 and PAX9 genes. We have identified a novel deletion responsible for a new syndrome of benign hereditary chorea, including symptoms of brain-thyroid-lung syndrome associated with bowels, salivary glands, and teeth disorders. Associated signs, sometimes of slight expression, remain of high interest for the clinical and genetic diagnosis of benign hereditary chorea.

Presymptomatic and predictive testing — clinical utility (CU) in asymptomatic individuals depends on the condition and whether testing targets those with a family history or the general population; for high-penetrance conditions such as Huntington disease, testing predicts future disease with high confidence and presymptomatic testing includes prenatal screening, fetal testing, newborn screening, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis when a familial mutation is known; molecular testing also predicts drug response based on germline variants, and for Huntington disease molecular testing is the only way to determine, presymptomatically, if an at-risk individual has inherited the disorder.

### Functional characterization of a novel mutation in TITF-1 in a patient with benign hereditary chorea [^112B5fow]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Benign hereditary chorea (BHC) is an autosomal dominant disorder of early onset characterised by non progressive choreic movements with normal cognitive function occasionally associated with hypothyroidism and respiratory problems. Numerous pieces of evidence link BHC with TITF-1/NKX2.1 gene mutations. We studied a patient with a familial benign hereditary chorea and normal thyroid and respiratory function. Sequence analysis of TITF-1 revealed the presence of a heterozygous C > T substitution at nucleotide 532, predicted to change an arginine (CGA) with a stop codon (TGA) at position 178 (R178X). A functional analysis shows that the mutated TTF-1 is not binding DNA, nor activating the canonical thyroid target gene promoter or interfering with the ability of wild type TTF-1 to activate transcription. In addition, the mutated protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, rather than nuclear as in the case of the wild type TTF-1. Thus, we have identified a new mutation in the TTF-1 coding gene in a patient with benign hereditary chorea. The results show that the mutation leads to a haploinsufficiency of TITF-1 and opens the question of genotype/phenotype correlation.

### Treatments and outcomes among patients with sydenham chorea: a meta-analysis [^115buDEw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this individual patient data meta-analysis is the most comprehensive evidence synthesis to date for SC, including IPD from 1479 cases. We found that immunotherapy, in particular with corticosteroids, was associated with faster resolution of chorea at the first episode, and that antibiotics, corticosteroids, and sodium valproate were associated with lower rates of relapse, which occurred in 34.3% of patients overall. We found that 86.1% of patients had a good final functional outcome, but no treatment factors were identified in association with this.

Sydenham chorea was one of the earliest conditions recognized in neurology, and its distinctive features, including the full rheumatic syndrome recognized since 1889, give us some confidence that the disorder has been relatively consistently identified over time. We found that age at onset (median 10 years) and female preponderance (2.2:1)have remained almost constant for more than 100 years, while the frequencies of fever, arthritis or arthralgia, and poor functional outcome have reduced in the modern era (Figure 1). In the modern era, 12.0% of patients had complete loss of upper and lower limb function (possibly consistent with chorea paralytica). Psychiatric or behavioral symptoms were reported in 64.5% of patients, with formal psychiatric diagnoses (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder) assigned in 9.9% of patients. However, mental health specialist assessment was reported in only 17.6% of cases. In cohorts undergoing standardized psychiatric evaluations, rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder up to 31% and obsessive-compulsive disorder up to 24% have been reported.

### The challenge of juvenile Huntington disease: to test or not to test [^116Xky4p]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In a cohort of patients with suspected juvenile-onset Huntington disease (HD), we compared HD expansion-positive and -negative cases in order to identify parameters that may allow differentiating between them and may act as a guide to clinicians contemplating genetic testing.

Methods

We analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of 76 juvenile-onset patients referred consecutively for HD genetic testing over a 16-year period.

Results

In total, 24 patients were positive for the HD expansion (7.8% of our HD cohort). Mean age at onset of expanded cases was similar to unexpanded cases. All expanded cases had a family history of genetically confirmed HD compared to only 13.5% of unexpanded cases (p = 0.000). Clinical symptoms at onset or at presentation could not differentiate between expanded and unexpanded patients. Although criteria suggested by previous reports allowed statistical differentiation between the 2 groups, they were not sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used in clinical context and performed less satisfactorily than presence of a family history of HD alone.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of juvenile HD should be primarily contemplated in symptomatic children with a family history of HD, although a proportion of these will test negative. With no family history of HD, juvenile HD is very unlikely and genetic testing should never delay searching for other causes. The specific nature of symptoms at onset or at presentation is of limited value in guiding the decision to test or not to test.

### Natural history of Huntington disease [^111a1bo9]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Understanding the natural history of Huntington disease will inform patients and clinicians on the disease course and researchers on the design of clinical trials.

Objective

To determine the longitudinal change in clinical features among individuals with Huntington disease compared with controls.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, longitudinal cohort study at 44 research sites in Australia (n = 2), Canada (n = 4), and the United States (n = 38). Three hundred thirty-four individuals with clinically manifest Huntington disease who had at least 3 years of annually accrued longitudinal data and 142 controls consisting of caregivers and spouses who had no genetic risk of Huntington disease.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in movement, cognition, behavior, and function as measured by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and vital signs.

Results

Total motor score worsened by 3.0 points (95% CI, 2.5–3.4) per year and chorea worsened by 0.3 point per year (95% CI, 0.1–0.5). Cognition declined by 0.7 point (95% CI, 0.6–0.8) per year on the Mini-Mental State Examination. Behavior, as measured by the product of frequency and severity score on the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, worsened by 0.6 point per year (95% CI, 0.0–1.2). Total functional capacity declined by 0.6 point per year (95% CI, 0.5–0.7). Compared with controls, baseline body mass index was lower in those with Huntington disease (25.8 vs 28.8; P < .001), and average pulse was higher (74.2 vs 69.6 beats/min; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Over 3 years, the cardinal features of Huntington disease all declined in a monotonic manner. These data quantify the natural history of the disease and may inform the design of trials aimed at reducing its burden.

### Acute rheumatic fever… [^113TZDvt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of some group A streptococcal infections.
- It affects many organ systems and has a varied clinical presentation. One manifestation, carditis, may result in long-term disability or death.
- Treatment involves antibiotics, which help prevent recurrent episodes.
- As of July 10, 2025, there is a voluntary recall of Bicillin L-A, a preferred antibiotic to prevent recurrences. Find details in the Prevention section below.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with acute rheumatic fever. Overview Cause Acute rheumatic fever is a delayed sequela of pharyngitis and skin infections, such as impetigo, due to Streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria are also called group A Streptococcus. Streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection typically precedes the onset of acute rheumatic fever by 1 to 5 weeks. Central nervous system Chorea, also called Sydenham's chorea or St.

Vitus dance, is the major central nervous system manifestation. Chorea often appears after the other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. It also can appear as the only manifestation of acute rheumatic fever. Musculoskeletal system Arthritis is present in up to 75% of episodes. Polyarthritis of the large joints is the most common musculoskeletal manifestation. Clinical features Clinical features Acute rheumatic fever is usually characterized by fever. Other symptoms depend on the affected organ systems. Chorea Chorea is a neurological disorder characterized by abrupt, purposeless, non-rhythmic, involuntary movements. It's often associated with muscle weakness and emotional lability. Erythema marginatum Erythema marginatum is an erythematous, non-pruritic, non-painful macular lesion on the trunk or proximal extremities. Lesions are transient and tend to extend outward with central clearing and are often described as serpiginous.

Complications Rheumatic heart disease is the most important long-term sequela of acute rheumatic fever. It can cause disability or death. Cardiac complications may vary in severity and include, but aren't limited to:

- Arrhythmias
- Congestive heart failure
- Endocarditis
- Pericarditis
- Stroke
- Valvular damage.

The mode of invasion of the disease, its seasonal prevalence, its self-limitation, its liability to recurrence, its occasional fatal termination, the endocardial and articular complications or associations, the postmortem findings in some cases, all point in this direction. It is true that in a number of cases lesions, sometimes macroscopic, at other times microscopic, have been found in brain and cord, but their exact relation to the clinical manifestations has not been entirely clear, while the results of such bacteriologic examinations as have been made are lacking in uniformity. Thus, certain bodies thought to be characteristic have been described as present in the central nervous system.

Again, emboli have been supposed to result from the endocarditis and give rise to softening in the brain and spinal cord. Further, changes have been found Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Sydenham's chorea and seizures… [^113t9Ywr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The hospital records of 28 children with typical Sydenham's chorea were reviewed. Nineteen of 28 patients had antistreptolysin O titers of ≥ 200 Todd units. Other causes of chorea were excluded by appropriate laboratory and clinical follow-up studies. At the onset of the movement disorder, 17 of 28 patients had abnormal EEGs consisting of irregular posterior slowing in 15, sharp epileptic spikes in 5, and high-voltage sharp waves in 2. Two patients with spikes predominantly in the temporal lobe regions developed complex partial seizures. On follow-up evaluation, the EEGs returned to normal within one to four weeks. Seizures did not recur after therapy with anticonvulsants. Seizures have been reported only rarely in association with Sydenham's chorea. Our observation suggests that seizures may occur during chorea but may often be masked by frequent choreic movements and thus not recognized.

The EEG changes and seizures were transient in our patients studied so far. Ch'ien LT, Economides AN, Lemmi H. Sydenham's Chorea and Seizures: Clinical and Electroencephalographic Studies. Arch Neurol. 1978; 35: 382–385.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: In a previous article, we considered the two most common movement disorders in children: tics and stereotypies. Although less common, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, and tremor are not rare in children. Therefore, it is important for the pediatric clinician to be able to recognize and distinguish these movement disorders. The first step in diagnosis and treatment is to identify and classify the disorders. In this article, we review these and drug-induced movement disorders. Drug-induced movement disorders fall into the same phenomenologic categories but often are considered as a separate entity because of their specific causes and treatments. Chorea is characterized by frequent, brief, unpredictable, purposeless movements that tend to flow from body part to body part chaotically and unpredictably. The movements are less sustained than those of dystonia but are more sustained and less.

### The treatment of chorea minor by means of electropyrexia… [^116oM1iz]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The therapy of chorea minor, or Sydenham's chorea, has always been empirical and symptomatic. The usual recommendations for treatment have been bed rest, a quiet environment, hydrotherapy and arsenicals, especially solution of potassium arsenite, combined with the judicious use of sedatives and hypnotics. Under this regimen the disease, which is self limiting, usually disappears in from two to six months, depending on the severity of the attack and the resistance of the individual. Most neurologists and pediatricians have classified the malady as "rheumatic. " While sudden shock, trauma or fright can play a rôle in bringing on the initial attack, it is generally conceded to be a disease of toxic infectious origin closely allied to rheumatoid infection. Chorea has a definite tendency to recur once it has attacked an individual and is thrice as common among females as among males. It is dominantly a disease of childhood and adolescence.
