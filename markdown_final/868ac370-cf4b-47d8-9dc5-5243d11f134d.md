## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for a rash under the breast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and workup plan for a rash under the breast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location and environmental contributors in the inframammary fold. Then, I should categorize the differential by etiology: inflammatory/dermatologic, infectious, neoplastic/metastatic, drug-induced, and systemic/paraneoplastic. Next, I will prioritize high-risk entities that must not be missed, especially malignancy and serious drug reactions. After that, I will outline a focused history, examination, and targeted testing strategy. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and highlight red flags that mandate urgent action, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and guidelines where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the site. The inframammary fold is a classic intertriginous zone with occlusion, moisture, friction, and maceration, which predisposes to inflammatory dermatoses, secondary candidiasis, and bacterial overgrowth; I need to keep these environmental drivers front-of-mind as I interpret morphology and distribution [^1112Bfzt] [^113m6Gn4].

> I will now examine inflammatory and dermatologic causes. Inverse psoriasis presents as well-demarcated, smooth, erythematous plaques in folds and may be complicated by secondary candidiasis; I should double-check for satellite pustules and consider biopsy if uncertain or refractory to antifungal therapy [^113m6Gn4]. Intertrigo is common under the breast and can be purely irritant or secondarily infected; I need to check for malodor, fissuring, and maceration and remember that persistent, indurated, or treatment-resistant plaques warrant reconsideration of neoplasia or granulomatous processes [^1112Bfzt]. Contact dermatitis, both irritant and allergic, is plausible given deodorants, bras, detergents, or topical medications; I should confirm exposure history and consider patch testing if allergic contact is suspected [^1112Bfzt]. Granular parakeratosis produces hyperkeratotic, scaly brown papules in axillae and inframammary folds and is often misdiagnosed as candidiasis; I should verify lack of response to antifungals and consider biopsy if the diagnosis is unclear [^117Wxbao]. Hailey-Hailey disease can mimic intertrigo with erosions and fissures in folds; I need to check for a positive family history and recurrent flares, and consider genetic counseling if suspected [^114QshBv].

> Next, I should review infectious etiologies. Candidiasis is frequent in the inframammary fold and classically shows satellite pustules; I should confirm with KOH and treat, but if there is no improvement, I must reconsider psoriasis, granular parakeratosis, or even tinea [^113m6Gn4]. Erythrasma, due to Corynebacterium minutissimum, presents as brown, scaly macules or patches in intertriginous areas and may be minimally symptomatic; Wood's lamp can reveal coral-red fluorescence and guide therapy [^112tv9eB]. Bacterial superinfections, including impetiginization, can complicate intertrigo; I should look for honey-colored crusts and consider culture if purulence is present [^1112Bfzt]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has recent oncology therapy? I need to ensure I do not miss atypical mycobacterial infection or tuberculosis mastitis, which can masquerade as cellulitis or malignancy and require targeted cultures and imaging if suspected [^114iQSJ8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benign disease. I should prioritize neoplastic and metastatic considerations because missing them has consequences. Inflammatory breast cancer presents with rapid-onset erythema, edema, peau d'orange, and warmth over a large portion of the breast; I need to check timing, extent, and associated pain or mass and proceed to urgent diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound and core biopsy if suspected, as dermal lymphatic involvement supports the diagnosis even if not strictly required [^114E9J8K]. Cutaneous metastases from breast or other primaries can present as nodules, plaques, or erysipelas-like erythema; in any patient with a history of malignancy, a new, persistent, or indurated rash under the breast warrants biopsy to exclude metastasis, given the broad morphologic spectrum and prognostic implications [^114gT6rK] [^115i4AnZ]. Paget disease of the breast, while typically nipple-areolar, can extend to periareolar skin and must be considered for chronic eczematous, erosive, or indurated plaques; diagnostic mammogram and punch biopsy are indicated when suspected [^113HtXJL] [^112TN2sj]. Carcinoma en cuirasse produces firm, indurated plaques and may follow prior breast surgery; I should confirm prior oncologic history and examine for axillary nodes if suspected [^112zoshZ].

> I need to check for drug-induced etiologies next. Radiation recall dermatitis presents as an acute inflammatory eruption in previously irradiated fields after initiation of certain drugs, including anastrozole; I should confirm prior radiotherapy timing and drug start date, and remember that topical steroids may fail and drug cessation is often required for resolution [^114k2C9d] [^112pwtsL]. EGFR inhibitors frequently cause acneiform or intertriginous rashes; I should ask about recent initiation of gefitinib, erlotinib, or amivantamab and look for dose-dependent patterns or secondary infection, which may necessitate dose modification and supportive care [^114k9smY] [^116tVBRr]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce immune-related dermatitis; I should confirm timing relative to pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and assess severity to guide corticosteroid therapy and oncologic management [^1158A4iK]. Fixed drug eruption can localize to the breast and recur at the same site with the same agent; I should probe for repeated exposures and consider biopsy if the diagnosis is uncertain [^114W7fPJ].

> Let me consider systemic and paraneoplastic associations. Refractory urticaria has been reported as a paraneoplastic manifestation of breast cancer, with resolution after tumor excision; I should double-check for atypical urticaria refractory to antihistamines and pursue age-appropriate cancer screening if no other cause is identified [^116nVoya] [^113MeNSt]. Sweet syndrome can present with tender, erythematous plaques or nodules and may be idiopathic, drug-induced, or malignancy-associated; I should confirm systemic symptoms, obtain CBC and inflammatory markers, and consider biopsy if suspected [^113VieuK] [^111SfdhH]. Connective tissue diseases such as cutaneous lupus can mimic radiation dermatitis; if the eruption persists beyond the expected radiation timeline or behaves atypically, I should verify with biopsy and serologies to avoid mislabeling as radiation injury [^111e2oZp].

> I should confirm the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Onset and tempo help separate acute infections from chronic inflammatory or neoplastic processes; unilateral versus bilateral involvement can suggest localized disease versus systemic dermatoses; associated pain, itch, discharge, or systemic symptoms guide toward infection, inflammatory dermatoses, or malignancy; prior breast cancer, radiation, or implants heighten concern for recurrence, radiation recall, or implant-associated disease; medication changes, especially endocrine or targeted therapies, are pivotal for drug eruptions; and lactation status shifts the pretest probabilities toward candidiasis, mastitis, or HSV in the appropriate clinical context [^1112Bfzt] [^112TN2sj].

> Next, I should review the physical examination with a focus on morphology and distribution. Well-demarcated erythematous plaques favor inverse psoriasis or contact dermatitis; macerated, malodorous fissures suggest intertrigo with secondary infection; satellite pustules point to candidiasis; induration, peau d'orange, or warmth raise concern for inflammatory breast cancer; grouped vesicles in a dermatomal pattern indicate herpes zoster; and sharply demarcated, hyperkeratotic brown papules or plaques suggest granular parakeratosis or erythrasma. I need to ensure a full skin exam, including the contralateral breast, axillae, and trunk, to detect synchronous or metastatic lesions and to assess for systemic dermatoses [^113m6Gn4] [^117Wxbao] [^112tv9eB].

> I will now examine the diagnostic testing strategy. For suspected infection, KOH prep, bacterial and fungal cultures, and Wood's lamp can guide therapy. For suspected malignancy or atypical inflammatory disease, punch biopsy with appropriate immunohistochemistry is essential. For suspected IBC or Paget disease, diagnostic mammogram with targeted ultrasound and core biopsy of breast tissue and skin are indicated. And for patients with a history of breast implants and new peri-implant fluid or rash, MRI and seroma aspiration for CD30 testing should be considered to evaluate for BIA-ALCL [^1112Bfzt] [^113HtXJL] [^112iuYN3].

> But wait, what if the rash is treatment-refractory or atypical? I should double-check that I have not overlooked a drug eruption, radiation recall, or cutaneous metastasis, and I should lower the threshold for biopsy in any patient with a history of malignancy, implants, or recent oncologic therapy. If standard antifungals and topical steroids fail, I need to reconsider psoriasis, granular parakeratosis, or Hailey-Hailey disease and escalate diagnostics accordingly [^114gT6rK] [^117Wxbao] [^114QshBv].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm. Start with a focused history and exam to classify morphology and chronicity. If morphology is classic for intertrigo or candidiasis, treat empirically and reassess in 1–2 weeks. If there is no improvement, or if there are red flags such as induration, peau d'orange, rapid progression, pain, systemic symptoms, or history of malignancy, proceed to biopsy and breast imaging. If there is a history of radiation or new endocrine/targeted therapy, consider radiation recall or drug eruption and adjust therapy. If implants are present with new fluid or rash, evaluate for BIA-ALCL. And if urticaria is refractory or atypical, consider paraneoplastic etiologies and pursue age-appropriate cancer screening [^1112Bfzt] [^112iuYN3] [^116nVoya].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have highlighted red flags that mandate urgent action. Rapid-onset erythema with edema and peau d'orange suggests inflammatory breast cancer and requires urgent breast imaging and biopsy. A new, persistent, indurated, or ulcerated rash in a patient with prior breast cancer warrants biopsy to exclude cutaneous metastasis. A painful, erosive intertriginous eruption in an oncology patient may represent toxic erythema of chemotherapy and needs prompt recognition and supportive care. And severe drug eruptions with mucosal involvement, blisters, or systemic symptoms require immediate drug cessation and potential inpatient management. I should confirm that any of these features triggers expedited referral and escalation of care to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment [^114E9J8K] [^114gT6rK] [^117WQsTZ] [^116g3Fyo].

A rash under the breast is most often due to **intertrigo** [^notfound] (moist, macerated skin with secondary Candida or bacterial infection) [^notfound], but the differential is broad and includes inverse psoriasis [^113m6Gn4], contact dermatitis, erythrasma [^112tv9eB], hidradenitis suppurativa, and less commonly Paget's disease [^113HtXJL] or inflammatory breast cancer [^114E9J8K]. Key distinguishing features include **moisture-associated maceration** with satellite pustules for candidiasis, well-demarcated erythematous plaques for inverse psoriasis, and peau d'orange with induration for inflammatory breast cancer [^114E9J8K]. Persistent, non-healing, or indurated rashes require **biopsy** [^112TN2sj] to exclude malignancy [^1138Ngzd].

## Common inflammatory and infectious causes

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Intertrigo | Moist, erythematous, macerated rash in skin folds; may be secondarily infected with Candida or bacteria [^notfound] | - Moisture-associated <br/> - Satellite pustules (Candida) <br/> - Malodor (bacterial) |
| Inverse psoriasis | Well-demarcated, erythematous, smooth plaques in intertriginous areas; minimal scaling [^113m6Gn4] | - Chronic <br/> - Recurrent <br/> - Often associated with psoriasis elsewhere |
| Contact dermatitis | Erythematous, pruritic rash with possible lichenification; history of allergen exposure [^notfound] | - Pruritic <br/> - Lichenification <br/> - Exposure history |
| Erythrasma | Brown, scaly patches; coral-red fluorescence under Wood's lamp [^112tv9eB] | - Brown discoloration <br/> - Coral-red fluorescence |
| Hidradenitis suppurativa | Painful, recurrent nodules and abscesses in axillae and inframammary folds [^notfound] | - Recurrent <br/> - Scarring <br/> - Sinus tracts |
| Candidiasis | Moist, erythematous rash with satellite pustules [^notfound] | - Satellite pustules <br/> - Moisture-associated |
| Bacterial infections (cellulitis, impetigo) | Erythematous, warm, tender rash; may have crusting or bullae [^114gT6rK] | - Warmth <br/> - Tenderness <br/> - Systemic symptoms |

---

## Less common but serious conditions

- **Paget's disease of the breast**: Eczematous, scaly rash of the nipple-areolar complex; may be associated with underlying ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer [^116gPRsY].

- **Inflammatory breast cancer**: Rapid onset of erythema, edema, and peau d'orange with induration; may mimic cellulitis [^114E9J8K].

- **Cutaneous metastases**: Firm, indurated nodules or plaques; may be the presenting sign of internal malignancy [^114gT6rK].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured approach includes a focused **history** covering onset, duration, symptoms, exposures, comorbidities, and prior treatments, and a thorough **physical examination** assessing morphology, distribution, and systemic signs [^11413nH8]. Use KOH prep, bacterial cultures, and Wood's lamp as indicated, and perform a biopsy for persistent, indurated, or non-healing lesions to exclude malignancy [^117CSpVd] [^1138Ngzd].

---

## Management strategies

- **Intertrigo**: Keep area dry, use barrier creams, topical antifungals or antibiotics as indicated [^notfound].

- **Inverse psoriasis**: Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or biologics for refractory cases [^notfound].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Identify and avoid allergens, topical corticosteroids [^notfound].

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: Topical or systemic antibiotics, intralesional steroids, biologics, or surgery [^notfound].

- **Paget's disease or inflammatory breast cancer**: Immediate referral to oncology, surgical oncology, or dermatology for biopsy and imaging [^113HtXJL] [^112TN2sj].

---

A rash under the breast most commonly reflects intertrigo, inverse psoriasis, contact dermatitis, erythrasma, hidradenitis suppurativa, or candidiasis, but persistent or indurated lesions require **biopsy** to exclude Paget's disease or inflammatory breast cancer [^112TN2sj] [^114E9J8K].

### Tuberculosis mastitis presenting as bilateral breast masses [^114iQSJ8]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis mastitis can be a challenging diagnosis, often presenting with clinical and imaging findings that are suspicious for malignancy. We present a case of a 49-year-old female with a breast mass initially diagnosed as idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. Failure to respond to standard treatments, development of new breast masses, and discovery of a concurrent ulcerating thigh rash with similar histologic findings as the breast masses prompted further investigation, which ultimately lead to the diagnosis of tuberculosis mastitis. There was rapid resolution of both breast and skin symptoms after initiation of empiric drug therapy.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^117CSpVd]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Persistent pain with breastfeeding — laboratory testing may be considered for selected findings. Laboratory studies, such as milk and nipple cultures, may be considered based on the history and physical exam findings including acute mastitis or mastitis that is not resolving with antibiotics, persistent nipple cracks, fissures, or drainage, erythema or rashes suggesting viral or fungal infection, and breast pain out of proportion to examination (appear normal, but very tender, breasts or nipples).

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Docetaxel [^112gCpGA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluid retention

Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Cutaneous reactions

Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling.

Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain.

Neurologic reactions

Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Gastrointestinal reactions

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3%-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.

Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.

Cardiovascular reactions

Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension have occurred. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal.

Infusion site reactions

Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein.

### Spectrum of imaging findings in Paget's disease of the breast – A pictorial review [^116gPRsY]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paget's disease of breast is a rare malignancy accounting for 1–3% cases of breast cancer and was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. Almost 80–90% of cases are associated with underlying malignancy in the form of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancer. The surgical management is individualized and is based on imaging and histopathological findings. In this pictorial essay, we describe the spectrum of imaging findings in biopsy proven cases of Paget's disease of breast.

Discussion

Paget's disease is an unusual breast malignancy where clinical features may be the only sign of cancer during the initial presentation. Imaging plays an important role in evaluating the extent of involvement and in deciding upon patient management.

Clinical Findings

Paget's disease of breast is commonly seen in the fifth or sixth decade of life, although it can also be seen in adolescents and the elderly. It is more common in males compared to females and is usually unilateral. The patients present clinically with changes in the nipple and areolar region in the form of erythema, ulceration, eczematous changes and induration of skin that may be associated with nipple retraction and blood stained nipple discharge. Some of these patients may first approach a dermatologist for treatment of eczema. In cases presenting only with eczema, there is an initial phase of clinical improvement with symptomatic treatment, which causes a delay in diagnosis. A biopsy from the nipple areolar region is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes allergic contact dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus and psoriasis. Advanced cases of Paget's disease may present with a well-demarcated round or ovoid eczema-like plaque that is easily distinguished from the surrounding normal skin. In some cases, a palpable mass may be felt clinically, which is important since approximately 90–95% of these patients have an underlying invasive cancer. One must not confuse cases of Paget's disease with inflammatory carcinoma in which there is diffuse erythema involving the entire breast with secondary involvement of nipple and areola.

### Epidermotropic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon presenting as a diffuse erythematous petechial rash [^111VTWYB]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is estimated that only 0.7% to 9.0% of all malignancies metastasize to the skin. Breast and lung carcinomas are the most common primary noncutaneous malignancies that metastasize to the skin in females and males, respectively, as they are the most frequent types of cancer worldwide. However, the most common cutaneous metastasis is melanoma, which comprises 45% of all cutaneous metastases. Less than 4% of cases are caused by a primary gastrointestinal malignancy.

The most common location for cutaneous metastases of colorectal cancer is the abdominal wall. Less frequently, it might involve the pelvis, back, chest, upper extremities, hallux, or head and neck area. However, very few cases have been labeled as an epidermotropic colorectal adenocarcinoma. The most commonly reported clinical appearance is of a single or multiple flesh-colored firm nodules (ie, Sister Mary Joseph nodule). In rarer cases, it may present as an indurated erythema with well-demarcated borders mimicking infection (ie, carcinoma erysipelatoides). A diffuse erythematous petechial rash, as seen in our patient, is an uncommon presentation. On histology, a nodular or infiltrative tumor is seen. However, it is often limited to the dermis with epidermal involvement much less frequently seen.

Melanoma is the most common tumor to show epidermotropic cutaneous metastasis. Other solid tumors, such as epithelioid sarcoma and primary lung carcinoma have also been reported. The prevalence of epidermotropic carcinomas from the gastrointestinal tract is not well described in the literature. A case of metastatic cecal carcinoma with epidermotropism has been reported in Japan. Management may range from a wide local excision for isolated lesions to a palliative approach for extensive cutaneous metastases. Life expectancy after diagnosis of cutaneous metastases from adenocarcinoma of colon, ranges from 1 to 34 months.

In overall, it is important to consider an epidermotropic metastatic carcinoma when a tumor with epidermal involvement is seen on a skin biopsy. Our case additionally emphasizes the importance of including cutaneous metastases on the clinical differential diagnosis of an erythematous petechial rash in a patient with history of an internal malignancy.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^113rFKjy]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — Herpes zoster in lactating women is characterized by "Pain and vesicular rash following a dermatome", and management notes that "Oral antiviral therapy such as acyclovir or valacyclovir should be used in doses recommended for treating Herpes zoster", and to "Avoid breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to infants from an affected breast/nipple until the lesions are healed".

### Dermatoses of the breast in lactation [^1131xaKZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Dermatoses of the breast during lactation can be difficult to diagnose because of their overlapping clinical appearances. It is important to properly diagnose and treat nipple dermatitis since it can be a significant source of pain when nursing. Poorly controlled nipple pain in nursing mothers is one of the primary reasons for breastfeeding to be discontinued earlier than is recommended. Therefore, it is relevant for practicing dermatologists to be aware of certain facts in a patient's history, specific physical exam findings, and the most appropriate laboratory tests used to diagnose these conditions. In addition, the therapeutic approach should be effective and safe for the mother and infant. This review article provides dermatologists with a detailed discussion on the clinical features and management of various breast dermatoses seen in lactation, including atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, bacterial infections, yeast infections and herpes simplex virus infections.

### Multiple cutaneous metastases from male breast carcinoma [^112646MD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Skin involvement as a symptom, or even the presenting sign, of this breast cancer in men is not well known by dermatologists. In fact, a review of the English-language literature reveals few references about this subject. We report a case of breast carcinoma in a 58-year-old man with rapidly progressive cutaneous metastases that did not respond to any treatment schedules.

### Purpuric eruption of the breasts, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks [^116VVnPX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old female smoker presented to the emergency department with photosensitivity, rash, fatigue, and abdominal pain with diffuse lymphadenopathy. She noted 2 years of violaceous mottling of the skin, but in the months prior to admission had developed deeper, tender nodules in these areas. Laboratory workup was notable for anemia, leukopenia, and positive anti-Smith and antinuclear antibodies. Antiphospholipid antibodies and HIV screen were negative. Physical examination revealed purpuric patches and indurated nodules with superimposed petechiae and ecchymoses on the bilateral breasts, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks, with fixed, non-blanching livedoid patches of the trunk and legs (Fig 1). Superficial erosions on the hard palate, patchy erythema of the cheeks and neck, and a diffuse non-scarring alopecia of the scalp without erythema or scale were noted. A punch biopsy was performed (Fig 2).

### Skin diseases of the breast and nipple: inflammatory and infectious diseases [^1112Bfzt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Certain dermatologic conditions are unique to the breast and nipple, whereas others may incidentally involve these structures. All require a nuanced approach to diagnosis and treatment because of the functional, sexual, and aesthetic importance of this area. The lactating patient requires special management because certain treatment options are contraindicated. All dermatologic conditions involving the breast and nipple require careful evaluation because malignancy of the breast can be mistaken for a benign condition or may trigger the development of certain dermatologic conditions. The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews common and uncommon inflammatory and infectious conditions of the breast and nipple and provides insight into both the diagnosis and the treatment of this heterogeneous group of diseases. For the purposes of this article, these conditions are divided into 4 distinct categories: 1) dermatitis; 2) radiation-induced changes; 3) mastitis; and 4) miscellaneous dermatologic conditions of the breast and nipple.

### Paederus dermatitis acquired in the Gambia [^111K78jh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of a sudden-onset painful rash on both arms, diarrhea, and a hoarse voice after recent travel to Senegal and the Gambia. The symptoms started on the second day of her trip to the Gambia. There was no relevant past medical history.

On examination, there were multiple erythematous and hyperpigmented patches with mild peripheral scaling on the right upper limb, the medial aspect of the left arm, and the left breast. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Photographs of early lesions showed central desquamation. The distribution of the lesions on the distal right arm and proximal right forearm (Figure 1A) and those on the left arm and breast (Figure 1B) exhibited the characteristics of "kissing lesions". These are discrete, well-defined lesions occurring in mirror-image locations on opposing skin surfaces. This is consistent with a diagnosis of paederus dermatitis, likely acquired in the Gambia. The rash was treated with clobetasone butyrate 0.05% cream twice daily and emollients.

Figure 1.
Distribution of lesions (A) on the distal right arm and proximal right forearm, as well as those (B) on the left arm and breast.

The diarrhea and hoarse voice resolved spontaneously. Salmonella DNA was detected in the stool. A respiratory viral swab result was negative, and HIV and syphilis serology results were also negative. Paederus dermatitis is an acute irritant dermatitis caused by contact with the hemolymph of rove beetles (Paederus sp), which contain a vesicant toxin called pederin. Direct skin contact is not necessary; lesions often appear in areas where the beetle has been crushed or moved. Paederus species are widely distributed, and outbreaks have been reported in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Australasia.

A complete skin examination is essential for identifying dermatoses in returned travelers. Appositional patterns should prompt clinicians to consider toxic or irritant dermatitis. There are many other causes of kissing lesions, including candidiasis, impetigo, intertrigo, syphilis, viral warts, molluscum contagiosum, and Lipschütz ulcers.

### Understanding breast implant illness, before and after explantation: a patient-reported outcomes study [^116PHZsm]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

A retrospective study evaluating patients requesting removal of their breast implants from 2017 to 2018 (24 months) was conducted. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Case SPARTA IRB 20181267) prior to its initiation. Data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, implant size, fill, texture, and symptoms. Inclusion criteria included all patients who presented to a single practice location requesting breast implant removal due to presumed symptoms related to the implant. Exclusion criteria included patients requesting implant exchange, implant pocket exchange, implant replacement, or patients treated with partial capsulectomy. The plastic surgery practice from which this cohort was drawn consists primarily of BII patients, referred by a variety of sources including BII support groups, former patients, rheumatologists, functional medicine providers, and naturopathic providers. Patient symptoms on all patients were quantified using a patient-reported outcome measure rating 11 common symptoms both preoperatively and at each postoperative visit. The 11 symptoms included on the survey with this exact wording were: (1) numbness and tingling in the extremities; (2) joint and/or muscle pain; (3) hair loss; (4) memory loss/cognitive problems; (5) dry eyes and/or blurred vision; (6) chronic fatigue; (7) breast pain; (8) rashes and/or hives; (9) food sensitivity/intolerance; (10) flu-like symptoms and/or low-grade fever; (11) difficulty breathing. Patients were asked to rate symptoms on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (very severe).

### Male mammary paget disease: a tale of 2 contrasting cases [^113mpVjG]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammary Paget disease (MPD) comprises 1.45% all male breast cancers, compared with only 0.68% of all female breast cancers. Patients usually present in the fifth and sixth decades of life with ulceration, eczematous changes, discharge, bleeding, itching, and induration of the nipple and areola. Typically, there is a delay in definitive diagnosis and treatment from the onset of symptoms because most patients are initially treated for a rash. At the time of diagnosis, about half of the patients may have palpable breast mass, positive lymph nodes, or both. In this article, we present 2 cases of male MPD representing the extremes of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic spectrum of the disease. One patient presented with a rash of the nipple of several months duration without an underlying lesion, whereas the other presented with sensitivity and pain of the nipple for 1 year and an underlying mass. Biopsies were diagnostic of MPD in both cases, and definitive surgery revealed an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ in the first case and an invasive ductal carcinoma in the second, highlighting the importance of early biopsy to initiate appropriate management.

### Urticaria heralding breast cancer: case report and literature review [^113MeNSt]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, only 3 case reports in the literature describe urticaria as a paraneoplastic syndrome of breast cancer. The first case reported in the literatureis that of a 56-year-old woman who presented to medical attention after 7 months of generalized urticaria. She was known for recurrent basal cell carcinomas, genital herpes, renal agenesis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Her symptoms failed to resolve with antihistamines and oral corticosteroids. Further workup with complete blood count, hepatic function, renal function, inflammatory markers, chest x-ray, and urinalysis were normal. Screening with PAP smear was normal, but mammography and ultrasound revealed a right breast lesion that was biopsied and positive for invasive mucinous carcinoma, grade 1, and ductal carcinoma in situ, estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-negative, and HER2neu negative. She was treated with surgical resection, and her urticaria resolved within 2 days. Follow-up 4 months later revealed no recurrent urticaria despite no antihistamine or corticosteroid use. The second case reportedin the literature is of a 58-year-old woman who presented with a 1-week history of urticaria on her palms that failed to resolve with topical steroids and antihistamines. Her medical history included cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, Graves' disease, and osteoarthritis. Her symptoms gradually progressed during the following weeks to extend to her entire arms, abdomen, pubic area, buttocks, and face. She was treated with systemic steroids, which led to a partial improvement in her symptoms. Biopsy of one of the cutaneous lesions was consistent with urticaria. A thorough workup with thyroid function, antinuclear antibodies, serum protein electrophoresis, Lyme disease serology, urine cytology, and CT urogram, and pap smear were normal. She ultimately had a mammography that revealed 4 left breast lesions that were biopsied and positive for grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, HER2neu negative. She was treated with a left breast mastectomy and was tapered off systemic corticosteroids. One-month postsurgery, she had no evidence of urticaria and remained urticaria-free at follow-up 4 months later. The third case reported in the literatureis that of a 49-year-old woman without any medical history who presented with an abnormal screening mammography showing left breast calcifications. She also reported a 3-month history of lateral arm urticaria. She was not known for urticaria or any other dermatologic conditions previously. Excisional left breast biopsy showed multifocal invasive lobular carcinoma, grade 1. She was treated with a left breast mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The sentinel lymph node was positive, and she went on to have a left axillary lymph node dissection. The final pathology showed multifocal and multicentric invasive lobular carcinoma, T2, grade 2, 2/28 lymph nodes positive, N1, margins negative, estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, Her2neu negative. Her left arm urticaria improved immediately after surgical resection. She received adjuvant dose-dense Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, adjuvant locoregional radiation therapy, and adjuvant hormonotherapy. Twenty-three months later, she presented with recurrent severe right arm urticaria and a workup with mammography revealed right breast microcalcifications that were biopsied and positive for atypical lobular hyperplasia. Given her history, she opted to undergo right breast mastectomy with surgical pathology confirming positive for invasive tubular carcinoma, grade 1, pT1aNx, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative. Her right arm urticaria again resolved immediately after surgery and she resumed hormone therapy.

### Epidermotropic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon presenting as a diffuse erythematous petechial rash [^115KT23s]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidermotropic metastases from colorectal adenocarcinoma are very uncommon. Frequently, these metastases appear within 2 years after resection of the primary tumor and just like renal, breast, ovarian, and bladder cancer, disseminate to the skin through lymphatic and blood. The early recognition of cutaneous metastases establishes the management and prognosis for the patient by indicating a potential relapse. Less frequently, these findings are the first manifestation of the malignancy, facilitating an immediate therapeutic action.

We present an 87-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of colonic adenocarcinoma, who presented to her primary care physician with an abdominal diffuse erythematous petechial rash of unknown etiology.

### Estradiol acetate (Femring) [^116A7NqX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

A few cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. TSS is a rare, but serious disease that may cause death. Warning signs of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-rash on face and body.
Cases of ring adherence to the vaginal or bladder wall, making ring removal difficult, have been reported in women using vaginal rings and may require surgical removal of the device. Women should be carefully evaluated for vaginal or bladder wall ulceration or erosion. Cases of vaginal erosion and vaginal ulceration have been reported with other estradiol vaginal rings. If an ulceration or erosion has occurred, consideration should be given to leaving the ring out and not replacing it until healing is complete to prevent the ring from adhering to the vaginal tissue.
A few cases of bowel obstruction associated with vaginal ring use have been reported. Persistent abdominal complaints consistent with obstruction should be carefully evaluated.
A few cases of inadvertent ring insertion into the urinary bladder, which may require surgical removal, have been reported for women using vaginal rings. Persistent unexplained urinary symptoms should be carefully evaluated.

The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Femring. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Case report of a woman with anastrozole-associated radiation recall [^114k2C9d]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Description

Patient description: a 49-year-old female with a history of inflammatory arthritis presented with a diagnosis of stage 1A invasive mammary carcinoma of the left breast, pT1c pN0(sn)M0 G1, estrogen receptor (ER)+, progesterone receptor (PR)+, HER2−, and Oncotype DX score 10. She then received RT to a dose of 4256 cGy in 16 fractions prescribed to the entire left breast. She did not receive any boost radiation. She tolerated RT, with the only side effect being grade 1 dermatitis. Ten days following the completion of RT, the patient began treatment with anastrozole 1 mg by mouth daily. In the following 2 weeks, she noted the emergence of a rash in the inframammary fold (Fig. 1), which gradually worsened. Initial management included the application of a topical corticosteroid; however, this intervention failed to yield any improvement. The patient further reported the appearance of raised, erythematous lesions on the skin of the upper left breast. Triamcinolone ointment was subsequently prescribed, but it also proved ineffective in alleviating the rash. Around 28 days after taking anastrozole, the rash expanded to involve the entire breast, extended to the left axilla (Fig. 2), chest, upper abdomen, bilateral arms, lower back (Fig. 3), and into the hairline on the back of the head and neck (Fig. 4).

Figure 1
Initial inframammary fold rash 14 days after Arimidex starts.

Figure 2
The rash involves the entire breast, extending to the left axilla at 28 days after Arimidex starts.

Figure 3
The lower back 28 days after Arimidex starts.

Figure 4
The hairline on the neck 28 days after Arimidex starts.

Notably, the rash transitioned from being painful to pruritic. In response to the worsening condition, the patient was administered Keflex (cephalosporin), a broad-spectrum antibiotic, 4 times daily to address any secondary bacterial skin infection. As the rash continued to progress and exhibited resistance to topical treatments, the decision was made to discontinue anastrozole, given its potential association with radiation recall. Following the discontinuation of Arimidex, the patient experienced a marked improvement in the rash after 16 days, and her symptoms subsided. Consequently, she transitioned to tamoxifen, an alternative hormonal therapy for breast cancer. There was no evidence of radiation recall to this agent, which she tolerated well and without issue.

### Pruritic scaly rash of the inframammary folds [^117Wxbao]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old female presented with a rash in the bilateral inframammary folds for 3 months. She complained of itching and burning in the affected area. Her past medical history was notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and transient ischemic attack. On physical examination, the inframammary folds had well-demarcated hyperkeratotic brown scaly papules coalescing into plaques (Fig 1). A skin biopsy was performed (Fig 2. H&E, 20x).

Question 1: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hailey-Hailey disease
B. Erythrasma
C. Granular parakeratosis
D. Inverse psoriasis
E. Darier disease

Answers:
A. Hailey-Hailey disease – Incorrect. Also known as benign familial pemphigus, it is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by impaired keratinocyte adhesion, which results in intraepidermal acantholysis. The typical locations affected include the sides and back of the neck, axillary, inguinal, and perineal folds.
B. Erythrasma – Incorrect. A bacterial skin infection caused by gram-positive Corynebacterium minutissimum. It presents as reddish-brown scaly macules and patches most commonly in the inguinal folds.
C. Granular parakeratosis – Correct. This is a rare disease; the exact pathogenesis is unknown and the etiology is not well understood. It is characterized by reddish-brown hyperkeratotic papules and scaly erythematous patches. Granular parakeratosis occurs in the flexures and occluded sites, most commonly in the axillae.
D. Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect. Inverse psoriasis is characterized by moist red plaques occurring in body folds, most commonly in the anogenital, axillary, and inframammary regions.
E. Darier disease – Incorrect. Also known as follicular dyskeratosis, it is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by reddish-brown confluent papules in seborrheic areas and partly macerated papillomatous plaques in intertriginous areas.

### Case report of a woman with anastrozole-associated radiation recall [^112pwtsL]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The case we presented underscores the imperative need to further our understanding of radiation recall in the context of breast cancer treatment. Radiation recall, characterized by infrequent and unpredictable acute inflammatory reactions within previously irradiated areas, can be incited by a wide range of medications. Despite its rarity, radiation recall has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life and treatment outcomes. Given the diverse array of medications capable of triggering this phenomenon, it deserves increased attention and the development of a comprehensive treatment approach. Our case report illustrates a breast cancer patient grappling with radiation recall induced by anastrozole treatment subsequent to RT, revealing the challenges inherent in identifying and implementing appropriate treatment interventions for this intricate reaction.

While radiation recall is conventionally associated with many medications, such as antimetabolite and taxane cancer drugs, its occurrence in conjunction with anastrozole represents a relatively uncommon event with limited representation in the medical literature. Thus, this case report extends the boundaries of our understanding of radiation recall, emphasizing its potential association with a broader spectrum of medications.

The complexities in addressing radiation recall are vast and further demonstrate the difficulty in identifying effective treatment. In past literature, topical corticosteroids were effective in treating radiation recall dermatologic reactions. However, in this case, the initial interventions, including the use of topical corticosteroids and triamcinolone ointment, proved ineffective in alleviating the maculopapular rash. In fact, the rash not only remained but subsequently spread even during corticosteroid therapy. The widespread inflammatory response secondary to the initial RRD in this setting is less clear, as this phenomenon is poorly described in the literature. Morphea, an uncommon but notable side effect of RT, is a localized scleroderma-like reaction that results in skin thickening and hardening. This condition is often associated with underlying autoimmune disorders, which can predispose patients to its development. Differentiating morphea from RRD is essential, as the latter typically presents as a more acute inflammatory response limited to previously irradiated areas following the administration of certain drugs. In contrast, morphea manifests gradually and is characterized by fibrotic changes rather than acute inflammation. In this patient's case, a differential diagnosis was considered to distinguish between radiation recall and morphea. Clinical assessment, patient history, and the temporal relationship between drug administration and symptom onset were crucial in making this distinction, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of radiation recall.

### Beyond skin rash: alpelisib-induced anaphylactic reactions [^116zTYEk]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpelisib is a specific oral PI3K inhibitor used combined with fulvestrant for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2-/PIK3CA-mutated metastatic breast cancer. Adverse drug reactions with alpelisib are common, including hyperglycemia and rash. Here we describe extraordinary and life-threatening reactions beyond skin rash in two patients with progressive PIK3CA-mutated metastatic cancer in whom alpelisib was initiated. Case-A (vaginal cancer): After 10 days on treatment, she developed dry eyes, generalized rash and itching. Alpelisib was interrupted and symptomatic treatment initiated. Because of an initial tumor response, a rechallenge was done. Ninety minutes after a reduced dose of alpelisib, she developed an anaphylactic reaction with angioedema, hypotension, and skin rash. Case-B (breast cancer): After 11 days on treatment, she developed skin rash and alpelisib was interrupted. At re-initiation, she felt tingles in her face and ears and some skin erythema. Given the mild rash, a second rechallenge with premedication was performed. Ninety minutes after a reduced dose of alpelisib, she developed a type-1 allergic reaction with angioedema, tingles, and skin rash. In both cases, a type-1 allergic reaction was diagnosed and symptomatic treatment was initiated, alpelisib was permanently discontinued and the patients fully recovered the next week(s). This report underlines the critical importance to consider type-I allergic reactions in the differential diagnosis in cases of rash associated with alpelisib. Even if a reaction develops after days on treatment, a type-I allergic reaction cannot be excluded. A rechallenge can be dangerous and should always be well contemplated or even avoided.

She reported pruritus and occasional fissuring after scratching. She was treated previously with nystatin powder, clotrimazole cream, and oral fluconazole for 4 weeks with minimal improvement.

Question 1: What is the diagnosis?
A. Mycosis fungoides
B. Inverse psoriasis
C. Dermatophytosis
D. Erythrasma
E. Candidiasis

Answers:
A. Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect. Mycosis fungoides classically appears as patches. It takes years to develop and most cases occur in whites (70%; Hispanics, 9%).
B. Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect. Inverse psoriasis presents with erythematous, shiny, moist plaques in intertriginous areas but with no scale.
C. Dermatophytosis – Incorrect. Dermatophytosis often occurs with onychomycosis; lack of response to antifungals makes this diagnosis less likely.
D. Erythrasma – Correct. Erythrasma presents with erythematous to tan, asymptomatic or pruritic scaly plaques in intertriginous areas and is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Risk factors include obesity, poor hygiene, warm climate, and diabetes mellitus.
E. Candidiasis – Incorrect. Candidiasis has satellite papules and would have improved with antifungals.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Malignant intertrigo: a subset of toxic erythema of chemotherapy requiring recognition [^117WQsTZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Report of cases

Six patients with various malignancies undergoing chemotherapy presented with intertriginous rashes (Table I and Fig 1). Involved areas included cervical, inframammary and inguinal folds, and axillae, abdomen, antecubital fossae, perineum, buttocks, and thighs. Physical examination found sharply demarcated, erythematous-to-dusky patches and plaques with focal scaling, crusting, and erosions. These lesions were painful and exquisitely tender. Histopathology results showed subtle interface dermatitis with variable epidermal dysmaturation and necrosis, along with perivascular and periadnexal chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Three of these cases showed eccrine squamous syringometaplasia.

Several patients were initially misdiagnosed in the outpatient or emergency setting with infections, contact dermatitis, and, in one case, atypical Stevens-Johnson syndrome, leading to treatments with antimicrobials and corticosteroids, both topical and intravenous. At the time of diagnosis of TEC, higher potency topical corticosteroids, astringent wound care, and analgesia were administered for palliation and to aid resolution. Further recommendations included keeping affected areas dry and cool and application of an aluminum chloride solution both after healing and before restarting chemotherapy.

Two of the patients were treated for renal cell carcinoma, one of whom was additionally treated for rectal adenocarcinoma. The other patients were each treated for different malignant diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, and ovarian adenocarcinoma, in addition to the two other cancers mentioned above. Each patient also underwent a distinct treatment regime; therefore, multiple chemotherapeutic classes are represented in this series, including antimetabolites, anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and several others.

### Sweet syndrome induced by radiations during breast cancer treatment [^111SfdhH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

During the follow-up of a woman treated by radiotherapy for an in situ carcinoma of her left breast, radio-induced skin lesions were diagnosed. They appeared not to be simple radiodermatitis but radio-induced Sweet syndrome. Discussions were led on the benefit of completing the last session of radiotherapy for such a low-grade malignancy while considering the risk of complication from radio-induced disease. General and local corticotherapy rapidly eradicated the fever and asthenia, while the skin lesions disappeared gradually. Moreover, biological improvement was noticed.

### Erythema multiforme-like targetoid eruption in two patients treated with capivasertib for metastatic breast cancer [^116Sx2qn]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 60-year-old woman with metastatic infiltrating ductal carcinoma (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, HER2-negative) presented with a 2-day history of rash. Physical examination revealed edematous targetoid plaques on her chest, face, back, arms, legs, and palms (Fig 3). There was no mucosal involvement, and the Nikolsky sign was negative. She had started capivasertib 400 mg twice daily (4-days-on, 3-days-off) 8 days prior and developed the rash day 2 of the second week. She had received IV ceftriaxone 2g IV and levofloxacin for a urinary tract infection 2 days prior to the rash. An EM-like reaction to capivasertib was suspected, with differential diagnoses including serum sickness-like reaction to ceftriaxone, dermal hypersensitivity, and urticaria. Biopsy showed a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, with thin epidermis and vacuolar change but no dyskeratosis (Fig 4).

Capivasertib was discontinued, and she was started on prednisone 60 mg daily and triamcinolone 0.1% cream daily. Her rash cleared within 5 days, and prednisone was tapered. Nine days after the rash resolved, the patient was restarted on capivasertib at a lower dose, 320 mg twice daily without recurrence of the rash.

### Amivantamab, a bispecific epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with ulcerative intertrigo [^116tVBRr]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient developed recurrent erosive and ulcerative intertriginous eruptions reminiscent of granuloma inframammary adultorum and granuloma gluteale adultorum, forms of erosive papulonodular dermatosis thought to result from irritant dermatitis associated with skin occlusion, especially in patients requiring diapers or using excessive occlusive topicals. The name refers to macro-appearance; biopsy does not show granulomas. Instead, biopsy typically shows dense, mixed intradermal infiltrate with nonspecific histology. A similar eruption was described in a patient treated with amivantamab for nonsmall cell lung cancer who developed penile and inguinal ulcers. Unlike symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, a recognized dAE of amivantamab, granuloma inframammary, and gluteale adultorum present with discrete, erythematous to violaceous eroded papules and nodules rather than erythematous patches. Although the punched-out ulcerations could be consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, they appeared in an atypical location for pyoderma gangrenosum and biopsy did not show characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate.

A common factor between this patient's unusual rash and dAEs associated with amivantamab is the presence of granulation tissue on biopsy. One case series describes Erosive Pustular Dermatosis-like eruptions in patients taking amivantamab that showed "florid granulation tissue" on biopsy, which may be linked to dysfunctional growth and differentiation of keratinocytes caused by EGFR inhibition. Additionally, suggestive of a causal link between amivantamab and this patient's ulcerative intertrigo is the appearance of a dose-dependent relationship, as she had a recurrence of a milder rash with half-dose amivantamab and no recurrence with a quarter dose.

This patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, type II, and obesity, which both contribute to the development of intertriginous rashes. Notably, she previously experienced a rash beneath her breasts and in her groin after treatment with mobocertinib, another tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. At the time, it was presumed to be a yeast infection; mobocertinib treatment was stopped for other reasons and a Dermatology referral was never placed. The prior rash associated with mobocertinib may indicate patient-specific risk for dAE in intertriginous regions, which could be linked to known risk factors for intertriginous rash.

### Annular lichenoid eruption following treatment with casirivimab / imdevimab for COVID-19 [^116HFmyR]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, traumatic brain injury, and breast cancer in remission presented with a rash on her right arm 1 week following treatment with REGN-COV2 for a moderately symptomatic case of COVID-19. She met eligibility criteria for the investigational therapy REGN-COV2 due to her history of breast cancer and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. She had completed the two-part Moderna vaccination approximately 2 weeks prior to receiving REGN-COV2. Her history was pertinent for allergies to penicillin and procaine, which had resulted in an unspecified rash. Her medication list included other drugs for chronic diseases including losartan (7 years), atorvastatin (3 years), levothyroxine (5 years), and zonisamide (4 years). She had been taking these medications consistently without noted issues. She reported no over-the-counter medications and had not taken any other prescription or over-the-counter treatments for COVID-19 prior to the onset of the eruption. Dietary supplements included a multivitamin and iron, but otherwise no other vitamins, supplements, or herbal preparations. With the exception of the COVID-19 vaccine, she had not received any new vaccinations over the past 2 years. Her presenting rash consisted of edematous well-demarcated targetoid to annular and arcuate erythematous plaques on the right arm (Fig 1, A), right palm (Fig 1, B), and lower legs. The eruption had spontaneously improved approximately 1 mo following antibody administration and subsequently resolved with triamcinolone cream. Approximately 2 mos later, a similar rash reappeared in the same locations on the right arm (Fig 1, C) and right palm (Fig 1, D). A punch biopsy of the right elbow lesion was obtained, which demonstrated lichenoid interface dermatitis with occasional eosinophils, consistent with a lichenoid hypersensitivity reaction (Fig 2). The rash subsequently improved with clobetasol ointment.

### Risk and predictors of psoriasis in patients with breast cancer: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^1131KzkB]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Key results

The incidence of psoriasis was 17% higher in breast cancer patients compared to the matched reference individuals in this study. The relative risk of psoriasis was seen within the first year after diagnosis and was mainly attributed to an increased risk of psoriasis vulgaris (33% higher). Treatment-specific analyses indicated an increased risk of psoriasis in patients treated with radiotherapy and mastectomy. Apart from treatment-specific effects, we identified genetic predisposition, obesity, and smoking as independent risk factors for psoriasis in patients with breast cancer.

Interpretation

Previous studies have reported a higher risk of skin disorders such as dermatitis and skin infection in patients with breast cancer. We found a slightly increased risk of psoriasis in breast cancer patients as compared to the general population. However, the overall incidence of psoriasis is low, and the absolute risk differences observed were also rather small. Of note, the cumulative incidence estimates of the current study are based on primary clinical diagnoses of psoriasis from the patient register (1%) and are lower than the estimate reported in a previous study (13%) using skin screening results. The use of a clinical definition may have resulted in underestimation of the incidence estimates while capturing the more severe cases.

The increased risk of psoriasis after breast cancer is clinically plausible, as some treatments for breast cancer can cause dermatological side effects. In the regional cohort, we found an association between radiotherapy and risk of psoriasis. Skin trauma (a burn, scratch, bruise, cut, etc.) has been reported as a triggering factor for 43–76% of incident psoriasis cases. The highest risk of psoriasis within the first year after diagnosis could also partly be explained by trauma caused by ionizing radiation. Compared to lumpectomy, we observed a significantly higher risk of psoriasis in breast cancer patients with mastectomy in the multivariable model. Patients with mastectomy usually experience more wound complications and delayed wound healing. As the two main pathogenic features of psoriasis (abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and hyperproliferation of keratinocytes) are also secondary to the altered development of the normal wound healing process, prolonged wound healing could trigger psoriasis onset. Additionally, an increased risk of psoriasis could be explained by psychological reactions to the disease diagnosis and treatment decision, since a severe stressful life event has been identified as a potential trigger for psoriasis. Both factors (treatment and stress reaction to the actual diagnosis) could potentially explain the observed peak in psoriasis incidence shortly after diagnosis.

### Metastatic spread of serous ovarian carcinoma to the bilateral breasts: a rare presentation [^113wNDCZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Many different aetiologies make up the differential diagnosis for this unusual case. The most common causes for breast redness include infection, malignancy, trauma, dermatological conditions and venous hypertension with infections and mastitis being the most common. Our initial diagnosis for our patient was a primary breast cancer or a metastatic cancer which had spread to the breast. A PET scan revealed activity in the right breast and a skin biopsy consisted with metastatic ovarian cancer. Other diagnoses including infection were dismissed after the breast biopsy revealed cancer and the right breast did not seem infected. Several small skin nodules were noted, which were more consisted with a recurrent cancer. If the biopsies had been negative, though, cellulitis would have been number one on the differential diagnosis. Finally, the patient denied any recent trauma to the breast, which could account for the skin redness or any history of eczema or a skin allergic reaction. An allergic reaction could have been treated with steroid creams or oral medication. Finally, the patient denied any history of venous hypertension. A recent CT scan revealed no evidence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or superior vena cava syndrome and the patient did not have a right arm shunt for dialysis. Again, secondary to the positive skin biopsy, this diagnosis of venous hypertension was placed lower on the differential.

### Beyond skin rash: alpelisib-induced anaphylactic reactions [^113sKrYc]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Alpelisib is a specific oral PI3K inhibitor used combined with fulvestrant for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2–/ PIK3CA- mutated metastatic breast cancer. Adverse drug reactions with alpelisib are common, including hyperglycemia and rash. Here we describe extraordinary and life-threatening reactions beyond skin rash in two patients with progressive PIK3CA- mutated metastatic cancer in whom alpelisib was initiated. Case-A (vaginal cancer): After 10 days on treatment, she developed dry eyes, generalized rash and itching. Alpelisib was interrupted and symptomatic treatment initiated. Because of an initial tumor response, a rechallenge was done. Ninety minutes after a reduced dose of alpelisib, she developed an anaphylactic reaction with angioedema, hypotension, and skin rash. Case-B (breast cancer): After 11 days on treatment, she developed skin rash and alpelisib was interrupted. At re-initiation, she felt tingles in her face and ears and some skin erythema. Given the mild rash, a second rechallenge with premedication was performed. Ninety minutes after a reduced dose of alpelisib, she developed a type-1 allergic reaction with angioedema, tingles, and skin rash. In both cases, a type-1 allergic reaction was diagnosed and symptomatic treatment was initiated, alpelisib was permanently discontinued and the patients fully recovered the next week(s). This report underlines the critical importance to consider type-I allergic reactions in the differential diagnosis in cases of rash associated with alpelisib. Even if a reaction develops after days on treatment, a type-I allergic reaction cannot be excluded. A rechallenge can be dangerous and should always be well contemplated or even avoided.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^112TN2sj]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Nipple and areolar conditions in lactation — Paget's disease is an eczematous oozing itching lesion of the nipple–areolar complex (NAC) usually associated with underlying breast malignancy, and if Paget's disease is suspected, referral to a breast surgeon for punch biopsy and diagnostic imaging is required. Nipple adenoma, also known as erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, nipple papillomatosis, or papillary adenoma of the nipple, presents with a nipple mass, nipple erosion, and/or nipple discharge and can mimic Paget's disease; nipple adenomas are benign lesions although they may be associated with preinvasive or invasive lesions. Dermatitis may be localized to the NAC or involves the skin of the breast, and the risk of dermatitis may be increased in a breastfeeding patient with a history of atopy and allergy, including allergy to ingredients in nipple creams such as lanolin or to substances the child is touching or ingesting. Nipple bleb is an inflammatory lesion that may resolve spontaneously; management for more tenacious blebs includes warm compresses, steroid cream, or procedural unroofing, and if persistent and/or causing plugging and mass-like obstruction, imaging may be warranted in certain patients.

### Inflammatory breast cancer, best practice in the community setting [^115GBkfu]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

How can we accurately diagnose IBC?

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of IBC continues to be a significant challenge. To address this, Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, in collaboration with the IBC Research Foundation and the Milburn Foundation, assembled a panel of experts to develop a diagnostic scoring system by expert consensus (Table 1). This system evaluates clinical characteristics and variations in established conditions to provide a more consistent and accurate diagnosis of IBC. The primary goal of the IBC Scoring System is to facilitate prompt, precise, and consistent identification of IBC in clinical settings.

The scoring system assesses several clinical features, each rated on a scale of 1 to 3 based on the severity or presence of symptoms. These features include the timing of signs/symptoms, skin edema or thickening, swelling/engorgement of the breast, erythema or other skin discoloration (such as pink, red, darkened, bruising/purplish, or serpiginous), nipple abnormalities, lymphatic emboli, and breast imaging. Given the dynamic nature of IBC, clinical breast exams may change over time, potentially affecting the total score. To ensure diagnostic accuracy, the score should reflect the highest level observed, even if specific symptoms are absent. A higher score correlates with a more classic and definitive diagnosis of IBC.

### High-grade pelvic-type serous carcinoma presenting as a breast rash [^111WacjG]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metastasis of pelvic serous cancer to the skin is extremely rare. Its presentation as a rash is also infrequent. The incidence of primary fallopian tube carcinoma or other pelvic serous carcinomas among breast cancer survivors is similarly low. We report the first known case of a patient in whom these 3 exceptional conditions converged as a high-grade primary fallopian tube carcinoma presenting to dermatology as a rash of the breast following a history of breast carcinoma.

### Unilateral nipple hyperkeratosis [^114VR3vU]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old man with a medical history significant for gynecomastia presented with concern of a new mole on the right nipple, present for approximately 1 year. The patient reported breast fullness and tenderness along with growth of the lesion without nipple discharge. Physical examination found a hyperkeratotic right nipple overlying a tender and indurated erythematous plaque with nipple retraction (Fig 1, A and B) compared with the uninvolved left nipple (Fig 1, C). Subsequent punch biopsy is represented in Fig 2, A.

Question 1: What the most likely diagnosis?
A. Nipple eczema
B. Male breast cancer
C. Gynecomastia
D. Pyogenic granuloma
E. Montgomery tubercles

Answers:
A. Nipple eczema – Incorrect. Nipple eczema is a term used to describe an underlying dermal perivascular lymphoid infiltrate localized to the nipple area. It can be caused by irritant/allergic contact dermatitis or a feature of atopic dermatitis. It presents as pruritic erythematous plaques on the nipple and may have scale, crust, oozing, and fissuring. Treatment is directed by the underlying etiology.
B. Male breast cancer – Correct. The most common clinical presentation of male breast cancer is a painless retroareolar mass. Although cutaneous manifestations are uncommon, involvement of the skin may be the first presenting sign. When the malignant cells involve the epidermis, the condition is termed Paget disease of the breast. Some early signs and symptoms include nipple retraction, ulceration, discharge, fixation to the skin or muscle, crusting, pruritus, edema, and pain. The punch biopsy also shows invasive adenocarcinoma involving the dermis with perineural invasion.
C. Gynecomastia – Incorrect. Gynecomastia is the most common palpable breast mass, breast enlargement, or breast pain in men. Guidelines for imaging in the evaluation of breast masses in men without symptoms of gynecomastia are published by the American College of Radiology. Men younger than 25 should initially undergo ultrasonography for indeterminate masses on physical examination, followed by mammography for suspicious finding. In contrast, men older than 25 with questionable physical examination findings should undergo mammogram as the initial diagnostic test, with ultrasonography reserved for inconclusive or suspicious findings.
D. Pyogenic granuloma – Incorrect. Pyogenic granuloma, or lobular capillary hemangioma, is an acquired benign vascular lesion that can affect either the skin or mucous membranes. Although the overall etiology is not completely understood, it often occurs in the setting of injury, hormonal factors, or certain medications. Lesions typically are small, glistening, yellow-to-bright-red, friable, dome-shaped papules that can rapidly grow. Treatment is through curettage of the base with removal of all abnormal tissue.
E. Montgomery tubercles – Incorrect. Montgomery tubercles are sebaceous glands that are found around the areola of the nipple. They can become enlarged and appear as flesh-colored papules. These are not a pathologic finding.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### High-grade pelvic-type serous carcinoma presenting as a breast rash [^114VBtEt]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Metastasis of any nonmammary tumor to the breast is very uncommon, comprising less than 1% of all breast carcinomas. Breast metastases from serous pelvic carcinomas are a tiny subset of this group, with only sporadically published cases. The largest study of this topic, by Recine et al, found 18 ovarian or peritoneal serous carcinomas that metastasized to the breast. Of these, only 3 patients did not have a prior diagnosis of ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma, which factored into the differential diagnosis, and only one presented with an erythematous rash similar to that of our patient. Panse et alrecorded 2 cases described as the first presentation of serous carcinoma to metastasize to the breast in patients with a history of both pelvic and breast carcinomas. Our patient, with a history of breast carcinoma but not a previous pelvic serous carcinoma, thus stands apart from previous cases described. Moreover, the majority of reported serous metastases to the breast presented with an accompanying mass, enlarged lymph node, pain, or ascites. Our patient's anomalous presentation was compounded by the highly uncommon occurrence of a skin rash as the initial presenting symptom of serous pelvic carcinoma. Furthermore, 2 of the stains studied, pax 8 and WT1, did not show the characteristic findings that would be expected with this type of tumor. Specifically, the vast majority of pelvic-type, high-grade serous carcinomas stain strongly and diffusely positive for pax 8 and WT1 (95% of tumors stain positive for pax 8, and 97% of tumors stain positive for WT1). In contrast to the expected staining, the current tumor showed variable staining, which ranged from areas that were completely negative to focal areas that were weakly positive. The plethora of rarities in this case highlights this case's importance to the development of future differential diagnoses. Our patient's history of ipsilateral breast carcinoma could have mistakenly led to deeming her breast findings a recurrence rather than a metastasis. Given that the 5-year survival rate of patients with stage IV fallopian tube serous carcinoma is exceedingly low, correctly identifying the metastatic serous nature of this carcinoma was essential in enabling the proper chemotherapy regimen to be swiftly implemented.

### Treatment of refractory hailey-hailey disease with oral upadacitinib and topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream [^114QshBv]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), also known as benign familial chronic pemphigus, is a rare, inherited skin disorder characterized by recurrent blisters and erosions, particularly in intertriginous areas such as the groin, neck, lower back, and under the breasts. The disease is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, which encodes for a calcium pump in the Golgi apparatus, leading to impaired keratinocyte adhesion and resulting in the characteristic acantholysis seen in HHD. The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern often results in a family history of the condition, although with variable expressivity.

HHD typically manifests in adulthood, although symptoms can appear earlier. The disease course is chronic with periods of exacerbation and remission, often triggered by sweating, minor trauma, and secondary infections. The condition significantly impacts the quality of life due to its chronic nature and the discomfort associated with flare-ups. HHD can be misdiagnosed as candidiasis, inverse psoriasis, tinea, impetigo, or contact dermatitis, which could result in improper treatment. Standard treatment options for HHD primarily focus on symptomatic relief, including the use of topical steroids, antibiotics, and antifungals to manage secondary infections. However, these treatments often provide only temporary relief and do not address the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms driving the disease.

Recent advances in understanding the molecular pathways involved in HHD have led to the exploration of targeted therapies, particularly immunomodulators. Upadacitinib and ruxolitinib have emerged as potential therapeutic options due to their ability to inhibit the Janus kinase (JAK) pathway, a known pathway in the pathophysiology of HHD. Upadacitinib, an oral JAK1 inhibitor, is Food and Drug Administration–approved in treating various inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis. In addition, ruxolitinib, a topical JAK1/2 inhibitor, is Food and Drug Administration–approved for treatment of atopic dermatitis. This case report presents the successful management of refractory HHD using a combination of oral upadacitinib and topical ruxolitinib cream, highlighting the potential of JAK inhibitors in treating this condition.

### Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema secondary to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor gefitinib [^114k9smY]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case

A 72 year-old woman known for having lung adenocarcinoma metastatic to the brain presented to the emergency department for a 2-month history of a severe skin eruption involving the gluteal, inguinal, axillary, and inframammary areas. The lesions were pruritic and became significantly more painful over the week preceding her presentation to the emergency department. No systemic symptoms were reported. The patient was started on gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, 4 weeks before the onset of the eruption.

Examination found well-defined V-shaped erythema of the gluteal and inguinal/perigenital areas extending to the medial thighs symmetrically. The inframammary and axillary folds presented a similar erythematous eruption bilaterally. Red satellite lesions, purulent discharge, and honey-colored crusting suggested secondary infection of the eruption (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Erythematous plaques with honey-colored crust and green discharge over the inframammary areas (A), inguinal fold and medial thigh (B), and axial folds bilaterally (C). The eruption started four weeks after the beginning of gefitinib. Culture showed growth of Klebsiella spp. Enterococcus spp. and Candida albicans.

The patient had stage IV non–small cell lung cancer diagnosed 9 months before presentation. Medical history includes a remote history of breast cancer surgically resected in 1987. Her dermatologic history was notable for a remote episode of shingles. In addition, during a previous hospitalization, the patient had a documented allergic reaction to amoxicillin, which caused a generalized erythematous eruption that resolved 2 weeks after the discontinuation of the antibiotic. Medications before the initiation of gefitinib treatment included levothyroxine.

Histopathology and skin cultures

The skin biopsy results showed extensive dermal inflammatory infiltrate, mainly composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, with prominent papillary dermal edema and minimal epidermal changes, consistent with a drug eruption (Fig 2). Culture of skin swabs found growth of Klebsiella spp. Enterococcus spp. and Candida albicans.

A and B, Histopathology findings show extensive dermal inflammatory infiltrate, mainly composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils with prominent papillary dermal edema and minimal epidermal changes, consistent with a drug eruption.

Laboratory data

Laboratory values at the time of admission were significant only for electrolyte abnormalities (potassium, 2.4 mmol/L; magnesium, 0.65 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.55 mmol/L). Results of a complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and a venous blood gas were all within normal limits.

### Koebner phenomenon: consideration when choosing fractionation for breast irradiation [^116zwtzN]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The patient was treated in the prone position with hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) of 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions with a 10 Gy boost to the right breast starting November 21. She completed treatment on December 21 without treatment breaks. During the second week of treatment, using daily Hydrophor and topical hydrocortisone as needed, the patient developed grade 1 erythema and pruritus of the right breast. After her left-sided seroma drainage resolved, she started adjuvant hypofractionated WBRT of 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions to the left breast on January 5, which she completed on January 27 without treatment breaks. During the second week of treatment, the patient developed grade 1 erythema of the left breast. Her right breast erythema improved with mild hyperpigmentation.

The patient was seen for routine follow-up on March 1 approximately 1 month after completing her left breast radiation course. The patient noted that the erythema in her left breast was resolving (Fig 1a); however, over the course of the following few days, she noted a new rash on her right breast (Fig 2a) in the distribution of her radiation field (Fig 2b), along with similar rashes in her right inguinal region (Fig 1b) and her left wrist. The patient's psoriasis had been inactive for more than 5 years. She was seen by her dermatologist, who suspected Koebner phenomenon. The patient underwent biopsy of the right inguinal rash; pathology demonstrated psoriasiform dermatitis consistent with psoriasis. She was started on a course of topical corticosteroids with complete resolution of her symptoms.

### Cutaneous metastasis of uterine carcinosarcoma mimicking drug eruption [^115i4AnZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights the importance of considering skin metastasis when evaluating a rash in a patient with a history of cancer. Special attention should be given if the rash is indurated, persistent, or recalcitrant to standard therapy. While the classic presentation of cutaneous metastases is a dermal nodule, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in such patients and keep skin metastasis in their differential regardless of lesion morphology.

In general, cutaneous metastases are uncommon, occurring in 1% to 10% of cancer patients. Cutaneous metastases represent an uncommon, deadly, and late-developing complication in most patients. Studies regarding frequency of metastases have varying results given inherent biases in retrospective reviews with regard to patient population and primary malignancies. It is generally accepted that in women, breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma represent the most frequent primary tumors, while in men, lung cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma are the most common. The prevalence of cutaneous metastases from endometrial cancer has been reported at about 0.8%.

UCS is classified as a high-risk endometrial carcinoma, arising from a malignant epithelial clone that subsequently dedifferentiates to form the sarcomatous element of this tumor. It is composed of various possible mixtures of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components — our patient's primary tumor consisted of 80% sarcoma and 20% carcinoma. UCS demonstrates a predilection for lymphatic spread, and positive extrauterine nodes are common at the time of presentation.

The carcinomatous element of UCS is noted to be highly aggressive and play a dominant role in metastasis; indeed, our patient's cutaneous metastases displayed only epithelial elements. Clairwood et al described a case of metastatic UCS presenting as firm fixed nodules on the cheek, back, and flank. Intriguingly, the metastatic lesion in this case was comprised solely of sarcomatous elements. Cho et al previously reported a case of metastatic UCS to the scalp in a 43-year-old woman presenting as a solitary, painless, hard papule that developed over 2 to 3 months. Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated predominant sarcomatous elements. This illustrates the varied presentations of cutaneous metastases in primary UCS and emphasizes the importance of prompt identification in guiding further management.

In conclusion, we present this case of rare cutaneous metastases from UCS to illustrate the varied clinical morphology that cutaneous metastases can display. It is important to keep cutaneous metastases on the clinical and pathologic differential diagnoses, despite their rarity. Biopsy and histopathologic review remain critical diagnostic tools in the diagnosis of cutaneous metastases.

Acute radiation dermatitis and locoregional effects — context: Because radiation is a localized, targeted therapy, side effects are most often locoregional within the targeted area. The most common side effect in patients with breast cancer is acute skin irritation. Late changes to normal tissue can occur years after therapy and can include soft tissue fibrosis, lymphedema, lung, heart and chest wall damage.

### Erythema multiforme-like targetoid eruption in two patients treated with capivasertib for metastatic breast cancer [^1112ZWYx]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 76-year-old woman with metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-negative) presented with rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Ten days prior, she started on capivasertib 400 mg twice daily (4-days-on, 3-days-off) and fulvestrant. She developed diarrhea soon after, requiring diphenoxylate/atropine and loperamide. During the second week of capivasertib, a pruritic rash appeared, spreading to her face, chest, abdomen, back, upper extremities, thighs, and groin.

In the emergency department, physical examination revealed numerous erythematous papules and typical targets on > 30% body surface area without bullae or vesicles (Fig 1). Nikolsky sign was negative. Limited mucosal involvement was noted with a small erosion on the upper lip and vaginal introitus, and she reported significant oral pain and dysuria. Ophthalmology found no ocular involvement. She was diagnosed with a grade 3 drug eruption and received systemic steroids (one dose of intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg daily) and topical steroids. Biopsies showed a superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils, mild vacuolar interface dermatitis, and spongiosis (Fig 2).

Fig 1
Erythematous papules and typical target lesions on the back (Case 1).

Fig 2
Vacuolar interface dermatitis with a superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and a few eosinophils (Case 1).

Her symptoms improved rapidly with treatment, and she was discharged after 3 days with instructions to continue prednisone 60 mg daily with a taper. Five days postdischarge, her lesions had resolved. An attempt to resume capivasertib at a reduced dose of 200 mg twice daily led to rash recurrence despite prednisone 20 mg daily. The rash improved with a one-time dose of prednisone 40 mg, and capivasertib was permanently discontinued.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^1138Ngzd]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4-week history of an itchy, painful, pink-red progressively worsening rash on her chest and neck (Fig 1). Her history included remote breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with known axillary nodal involvement. At presentation, she was undergoing treatment of her metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed for the last 6 months, and had undergone radiation to axillary lymph node metastases in previous months. Physical examination found thin pink-red plaques around her neck and chest. She denied fever or chills. She was prescribed a 2-week prednisone taper and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment with 1-month follow-up arranged where she demonstrated no response to treatment.

Question 1: What is the best next step in caring for this patient?
A. Perform biopsy of lesion.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin.

Answers:
A. Perform biopsy of lesion – Correct. In this patient with history of malignancies, biopsy should be done of the lesion to rule out metastasis of internal malignancy.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily – Incorrect. This patient had attempted oral and topical steroids with no relief of symptoms/rash. At this point, another round of steroids would be inappropriate.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction – Incorrect. This would be appropriate if herpes zoster was suspected. This patient's rash does not consist of papules or vesicles expected of herpes zoster and does not follow a dermatomal distribution.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve – Incorrect. This patient's rash has persisted for greater than 4 weeks. Her history of malignancy is concerning, and as such reassurance would be inappropriate at this time.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin – Incorrect. This would be the correct option if erysipelas or severe cellulitis was suspected. We would expect this patient to display acute-onset systemic symptoms such as fever; her rash developed slowly over 4 weeks and not as acutely as one would expect with erysipelas.

### Docetaxel anhydrous [^116xm876]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous Reactions

Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling.

Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain.

Neurologic Reactions

Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Gastrointestinal Reactions

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3%-5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.

Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids.

Cardiovascular Reactions

Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension have occurred. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m2in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal.

Infusion Site Reactions

Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein.

### Orthopoxvirus testing challenges for persons in populations at low risk or without known epidemiologic link to monkeypox-United States, 2022 [^115NsQCd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of Patients

Patient A, a healthy pregnant woman (estimated 37 weeks' gestation) was evaluated for labor and was noted to have a pruritic erythematous rash on her arms, abdomen, upper back, calves, and shins. Her lesions, not typical for monkeypox, had irregular borders, and were different sizes and in different stages of development (i.e. tan papules, crusted papules, pustules, and hyperpigmented macules) in the same anatomic locations, with reported onset 5 weeks earlier. No genital lesions were present. She did not report typical prodromal signs or symptoms of monkeypox (e.g. body aches, lymphadenopathy, fever, or chills). A household member was reported to have a similar rash, with onset 4 days before that in patient A; that person's rash resolved within 1 week, and no testing was performed; no epidemiologic link to a person with monkeypox was identified. Patient A had no interstate or international travel during the 3 weeks preceding rash onset. She reported varicella infection and receipt of smallpox vaccination as a child. Tests for varicella-zoster virus, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis were performed, all with negative results. A swab from a pustular forearm lesion, obtained 53 days after rash onset yielded a positive NVO test result (Table). Two days after receiving the result, the woman had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a healthy neonate. The state health department and CDC clinicians recommended several measures until lesions resolved: 1) initiation of monkeypox infection-control precautions in the hospital, 2) precautions to prevent skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant, 3) designation of another household member as the primary caregiver, 4) delay of breastfeeding, and 5) disposal of breast milk. Because of concern for congenital or perinatal transmission, vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) was administered to the neonate under a single patient emergency Investigational New Drug application. Further testing with a Clade II (i.e. West African) MPXV–specific real-time PCR LDT was inconclusive. Because of the discordant results, serum from patient A obtained on day 42 after rash onset was sent to CDC for serologic analysis; no antiorthopoxvirus antibodies were detected, arguing against orthopoxvirus infection. The recommendations restricting contact with the baby and for delaying breastfeeding were discontinued after rash resolution when the infant was aged 21 days (Figure). The patient's skin lesions were most likely attributable to bed bugs, which was a diagnosis that the clinical care team considered initially but set aside upon receipt of the positive NVO result.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^115RrAeq]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most likely internal malignancy that has caused this skin lesion for this white woman?
A. Gastric adenocarcinoma
B. Hepatocellular carcinoma
C. Lung cancer
D. Breast cancer
E. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma

Answers:
A. Gastric adenocarcinoma – Incorrect. The skin is an unusual location for metastasis from visceral neoplasms, the incidence ranging from 0.7% to 9%. The incidence of cutaneous metastasis from carcinomas of the upper digestive tract has been reported to be less than 1%. Umbilical metastasis, Sister Mary Joseph nodule, is the typical site for a cutaneous tumor resulting from metastasis of gastric cancer.
B. Hepatocellular carcinoma – Incorrect. In one study, skin metastases were shown to account for only 2.7% of cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma and no cases in noncirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma. This patient does not have a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and no known risk factors for cirrhosis such as alcohol abuse or hepatitis.
C. Lung cancer – Incorrect. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer. Although this patient has a history of lung cancer, the correct answer is D because in women, breast cancer is more likely than lung cancer to develop cutaneous metastases. Although it would have been statistically more likely for this cutaneous metastasis to have stemmed from her breast cancer, upon biopsy, this patient was found to actually have cutaneous metastasis of her lung adenocarcinoma. Lung cancer is rarely a source of cutaneous metastasis in women.
D. Breast cancer – Correct. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women and is the most common solid organ malignancy to metastasize to the skin in women, most often to the chest wall, either from direct extension of underlying tumor or by lymphatic spread. Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma frequently metastasize to the skin in women. In men, melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer are the most common sources of cutaneous metastases. Because of the high incidence of breast cancers relative to other internal malignancies, breast cancer accounts for almost 33% of all solid organ malignancy cutaneous metastases.
E. Primary CNS lymphoma – Incorrect. Primary CNS lymphomas are found to carry risk for secondary malignancies, including nonmelanoma skin cancers. However, this patient is unlikely to have a primary CNS lymphoma without history of immunodeficiency, and this skin lesion is unlikely to be a nonmelanoma skin cancer based on its appearance.

### Exemestane [^115A15VS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of advanced breast cancer, the most common adverse reactions included hot flushes (13% vs. 5%), nausea (9% vs. 5%), fatigue (8% vs. 10%), increased sweating (4% vs. 8%), and increased appetite (3% vs. 6%) for exemestane and megestrol acetate, respectively.

Table 4 shows the adverse reactions of all CTC grades, regardless of causality, reported in 5% or greater of patients in the study treated either with exemestane or megestrol acetate.

Table 4. Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions of all Grades* and Causes Occurring in ≥ 5% of Advanced Breast Cancer Patients In Each Treatment Arm in the Comparative Study

* Graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria

Adverse reactions of any cause (from 2% to 5%) reported in the comparative study for patients receiving exemestane 25 mg once daily were fever, generalized weakness, paresthesia, pathological fracture, bronchitis, sinusitis, rash, itching, urinary tract infection, and lymphedema.

Additional adverse reactions of any cause observed in the overall clinical trials program (N = 1058) in 5% or greater of patients treated with exemestane 25 mg once daily but not in the comparative study included pain at tumor sites (8%), asthenia (6%), and fever (5%). Adverse reactions of any cause reported in 2% to 5% of all patients treated with exemestane 25 mg in the overall clinical trials program but not in the comparative study included chest pain, hypoesthesia, confusion, dyspepsia, arthralgia, back pain, skeletal pain, infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, rhinitis, and alopecia.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of exemestane. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Immune system disorders - hypersensitivity

Hepatobiliary disorders - hepatitis including cholestatic hepatitis

Nervous system disorders- paresthesia

Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder - tendon disorders including tendon rupture, tendonitis, and tenosynovitis

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders- acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, urticaria, pruritus

Persistent pain with breastfeeding — differential diagnosis and nipple damage notes include that the potential causes of persistent breast and nipple pain are numerous, may occur concurrently or sequentially, and include nipple damage, dermatosis, infection, vasospasm/Raynaud's phenomenon, and allodynia/functional pain. Nipple damage is described as epidermal compromise that increases the risk of developing infection and pain, and breastfeeding or using a breast pump to express milk can induce an inflammatory response in nipple skin, which may result in erythema, edema, fissures, and/or blisters.

### Slowly progressive chest rash in an elderly woman [^112zoshZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old woman with remote history of breast cancer treated with lumpectomy presented to the dermatology department for eczema on her legs. Incidentally, breast skin changes were noted on examination, and she admitted to approximately 1 year of thickening, itchy breast skin. Her left breast was markedly indurated with hyperpigmented brown-to-erythematous plaques, subtle peau d'orange appearance, and shotty left axillary lymphadenopathy (Fig 1, A). She declined biopsy and treatment at that time. Fifteen months later, her rash had slowly progressed (Fig 1, B), with erythematous nodules spreading medially and superiorly on her chest skin. She remained otherwise well, living independently.

Question 1: What is this patient's most likely diagnosis?
A. Metastatic breast cancer
B. Metastatic lung cancer
C. Lymphedema
D. Eczema
E. Cellulitis
Answers:
A. Metastatic breast cancer – Correct. The patient's markedly indurated skin and axillary lymphadenopathy are consistent with carcinoma en cuirasse, a form of breast cancer metastatic to skin with infiltrative disease causing firm "cuirasse" or "armorlike" changes. Further history showed that 17 months before her initial dermatology visit, the patient had had a mammogram highly suspicious for recurrent carcinoma, and 9 months prior, a left breast tissue and skin biopsy showed invasive lobular carcinoma estrogen receptor (ER) + /progesterone receptor (PR) + /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) − (Fig 2).
B. Metastatic lung cancer – Incorrect. Less often, the primary malignancy in patients with carcinoma en cuirasse may be from lung, oral mucosa, gastric, or colorectal cancer. Compared with breast cancer, in lung and gastrointestinal cancer, cutaneous metastases occur earlier and are more likely to be associated with visceral metastases that worsen prognosis.
C. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Fifteen years ago, the patient's breast cancer was treated with lumpectomy and partial mastectomy of the left breast, after which she declined chemotherapy and radiation. The timing of her symptoms and induration rather than edema on examination make infiltrative malignancy more likely than lymphedema.
D. Eczema – Incorrect. Although the patient complained of itch, the morphology findings show minimal epidermal change (no scale). Further, the distribution of the rash by the previous site of breast cancer makes this case more concerning for recurrent carcinoma.
E. Cellulitis – Incorrect. Although inflammatory metastatic breast cancer may mimic cellulitis (carcinoma erysipeloides), the timing (> 1 year), lack of symptoms (no pain, no warmth), and overall appearance make cellulitis unlikely.

### A patient with fever and umbilicated papules [^113VieuK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following has the most common association with this condition?
A. Inflammatory bowel disease
B. Hematologic malignancy
C. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
D. Solid-organ malignancy
E. Idiopathic

Answer:
A. Inflammatory bowel disease – Incorrect. Patients presenting with Sweet syndrome and concurrent gastrointestinal complaints should be evaluated for inflammatory bowel disease because both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be associated with Sweet syndrome.
B. Hematologic malignancy – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is more likely to occur in patients with hematologic malignancy than in patients with solid-organ tumors. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common associated hematologic malignancy, and it can precede, follow, or appear concurrently with Sweet syndrome.
C. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor – Incorrect. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the culprit in the majority of drug-induced Sweet syndrome. Recurrence of the syndrome may develop when the patient is rechallenged with the inciting agent.
D. Solid-organ malignancy – Incorrect. Breast, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal carcinomas are the most frequently reported solid organ tumors with Sweet syndrome.
E. Idiopathic – Correct. In most cases, no underlying trigger can be identified, and the diagnosis relies on fulfilling the diagnostic criteria and ruling out infectious etiologies.

### Cutaneous lupus erythematosus mimicking radiation dermatitis in a patient with breast cancer [^111e2oZp]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Radiation dermatitis is an expected occurrence after radiation treatment, affecting 95% of patients receiving radiotherapy. Diagnosis is generally clinical, based upon the finding of erythema and dry/moist desquamation in a patient with a recent history of radiation therapy. Usually, a skin biopsy is not required for the diagnosis of radiation dermatitis. Prophylactic low-to-medium-potency (groups 4 to 6) topical corticosteroids are generally recommended for patients undergoing radiation therapy.

The differential diagnosis of radiation dermatitis includes other skin conditions that can develop during or after completing treatment. Commonly considered diagnoses include allergic contact dermatitis, intertrigo, radiation port dermatophytosis, radiation recall dermatitis, herpes zoster, graft-versus-host disease, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. As seen in the case of our patient, a skin biopsy may also be prudent, if the patient is not improving as expected with current management or if dermatitis progresses beyond the field of radiation.

### Beyond skin rash: alpelisib-induced anaphylactic reactions [^116R63S8]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Case A:

A 54-year-old woman with metastatic vaginal cancer was referred to our center because of progression on previous treatments including carboplatin/paclitaxel, capecitabine, chemo-radiation and nivolumab. In search of actionable tumor mutations, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed, which identified an activating mutation in the PIK3CA gene. At present alpelisib is not registered, nor reimbursed for the treatment of tumors other than breast cancer with PIK3CA mutations. However, patients could be enrolled in The Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP) trial, a nationwide clinical trial which facilitates the use of approved targeted therapies beyond their original label in cohorts of molecularly similar cancers and evaluates effectiveness and safety of this approach (NCT02925234).

After baseline study screening, treatment with alpelisib 300 mg QD was started (without prophylactic antihistamines). After 10 days of treatment, the patient developed dry eyes, an itching skin and a generalized rash on arms, legs, chest, and back. We advised to interrupt alpelisib and scheduled a visit the next day. On physical examination the patient was hemodynamically stable and her skin was erythematous in a maculopapular pattern covering > 30% of her body surface area (BSA), assessed as a grade 3 maculopapular rash (CTCAE v.5) (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Pictures of the patient described in case A: Upper left panel: erythematous maculopapular rash with (very) mild edema in the face an eyelids (not shown for privacy reasons) (photo taken on day 13 after start of alpelisib). Upper right panel: erythematous maculopapular rash of the left arm (photo taken on day 13). Central panels (day 6 after rechallenge, day 34 after initial start of alpelisib): Bulla of the left arm with erythema (central – left), bulla on back with erythema (central panel – right) and pubis (not shown). Assessment by dermatologist, most likely Bullous toxicoderma. Lower panel left: Peeling skin, or desquamation of left forearm with a white shade as a result of applied zinc ointment (day 6 after rechallenge) Lower panel right: some residue of peeling skin with underneath healed skin (day 14 after rechallenge).

### Breast malignancy masquerading under the cloak of acute urticaria [^116nVoya]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a common disorder characterised by well-demarcated and intensely pruritic erythematous skin swellings. Common triggers include infection, allergic reactions or medications. While often idiopathic, the presence of urticaria can be associated with underlying systemic disease. We report a case of a patient who presented with diffuse and refractory urticaria. A thorough workup was conducted to determine the aetiology including routine age-appropriate cancer screening. Mammography revealed four lesions in the patient's left breast with biopsy consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma. Disappearance of the urticarial lesions with mastectomy suggests an association between breast malignancy and urticaria. Thus, refractory urticaria with unknown cause should prompt a thorough history, physical examination and review of age-appropriate cancer screening.

### An insidious skin rash without itch [^1133E6qn]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old female with a 5-year medical history of breast infiltrating lobular carcinoma was admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit ward for left hemiparesis secondary to neurosurgical removal of frontal and right parietal metastatic lesions. After the intervention, prophylactic treatment with the antiepileptic diphenylhydantoin 100 mg/tid was started. On 38th day of drug administration an erythema without itch appeared in jugular and parasternal region and absent in the clothing covered areas, suggesting a contact dermatitis. Next day, the erythema extended to the neck with poorly delineated red plaques. During the following 4 days the patient presented oral stomatitis with fetid breath, atypical targetoid and erythematous confluenced macules. The clinical picture rapidly worsened with vesiculate, bullate lesions and frank skin erosions. The patient was sent to a Dermatology Burn Unit where a therapy with corticosteroids, antibiotics, fluids, albumin and immunoglobulins was administrated. Complete clinical resolution was observed after 1 month without long-term sequelae. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare (incidence about 0.01%) adverse drug reaction related to idiosyncratic mechanism, burdened by a mortality rate ranging from 3.2 to 90%. In our patient, TEN covered 63% of body surface, a condition associated with a death risk of 58.3% according to the specific severity illness scale SCORTEN. The disease onset may be insidious, and it could appear as a skin rash without itch; the cutaneous manifestations appear quite lately, then the disease quickly progresses. Early recognition of the disease, especially in oncologic patients, is critical for effective management of this condition in terms of mortality reduction.

EGFR inhibitor–associated rash and therapeutic response: "One of the observations made by early clinical investigators was the correlation between the development of rash and response to EGFR therapy", and "if rash proved to be a clinical marker for response, it would offer patients a motivating factor to work through the rash associated with the first 2 months of therapy in order to establish drug efficacy". Although "mixed", "the bulk of data would tend to support the correlation between rash and outcomes in patients treated with EGFR therapy", with "Positive correlations between rash and outcome" reported for "cetuximab", "erlotinib", "gefitinib", and "panitumumab". "Data support not only an increase in response but an increase in survival for those patients experiencing a rash".

### A case of recurrent fixed drug eruption triggered by a hormonal intrauterine device [^114W7fPJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case

A 35-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left upper breast associated with intermittent pruritus (Fig 1). She had recently undergone a left breast ultrasound and mammography, which were negative. Medications included a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, which was inserted approximately 8 weeks after giving birth and less than 4 weeks preceding the development of the rash. Notably, she reported a similar rash in the same location following hormonal IUD placement after a previous pregnancy, with resolution upon IUD removal. Physical examination revealed a 5 cm × 3.5 cm erythematous thin plaque with central dusky hyperpigmentation on the left breast.

Fig 1
Fixed drug eruption. Erythematous thin plaque with central dusky hyperpigmentation on the left breast.

A punch biopsy was performed which demonstrated interface dermatitis with a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate (Fig 2). Extensive tagging along the dermal-epidermal junction was noted, along with basal vacuolar degeneration and necrotic keratinocytes. Rare eosinophils were present. Autoimmune testing was positive for antinuclear and anti-Sjogren's-syndrome-related antigen A/Ro antibodies, though lack of other symptoms or findings did not support tumid lupus. Following the replacement of the hormonal IUD with a copper IUD, the patient experienced complete resolution of her rash without any further recurrence.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: interim guidance [^114rQ9Ve]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

### Etravirine (Intelence) [^116g3Fyo]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe Skin Reactions

Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported with INTELENCE. Rash has been reported most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking INTELENCE and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on your right side below your ribs). Patients should understand that if severe rash occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug Interactions

INTELENCE may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, including St. John's wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Fat Redistribution

Inform patients that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including INTELENCE, and that the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Pregnancy Registry

Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant individuals exposed to INTELENCE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Instruct mothers with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^112iuYN3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast implant-associated malignancies — presentation, timing, and implant type associations are summarized as follows: BIA-ALCL commonly presents with delayed periprosthetic fluid and breast asymmetry occurring > 1 year after implantation, and rarely, BIA-ALCL can present with a mass, regional lymphadenopathy, oozing skin rash, and/or capsular contracture. Similar symptoms can also be seen in breast implant associated squamous cell carcinoma (BIA-SCC), another rare implant associated malignancy. Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7–9 years after implantation) and BIA-SCC (average 22 years after implantation). The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured implants, and rare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported.

### Delayed development of toxic shock syndrome following abdominal tissue expansion in a pediatric reconstruction patient: case report [^1166otVj]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal postoperative complication, and even more so if the diagnosis is delayed. We present the case of a 7-month-old male infant who developed TSS as a complication of tissue expansion using an external port device. There have been 5 documented cases of TSS after tissue expander or breast prosthesis placement occurring in the adult population, however, there has not been a reported case of TSS in an infant. The long interval to development of TSS like symptoms, 4 months in this case, should not exclude TSS from the differential diagnosis. In a pediatric patient, a diffuse macular rash without the severe systemic symptoms on initial presentation can present as a diagnostic challenge. New diagnosis techniques are discussed that can shorten the time to a diagnosis of TSS. In this case, because the local bacterial count was low, the expanded tissue was transferred without complication.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^117PBZQH]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Nipple dermatitis and pain are common postpartum issues with several aetiologies. Symptoms may be due to modifiable factors such as improper latch techniques or flange size. Other causes include dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis or infectious aetiologies such as HSV, bacterial infections or candida. After a thorough history is obtained, a thorough physical exam including a breast exam is necessary to identify any swelling, erythema, ulcers, fissures, vesicles or masses.

The most common cause of nipple fissure is poor latch technique, which includes suboptimal infant positioning and either excessive or inadequate sucking by the neonate. Similarly, incorrect use of a breast pump or a poorly fitted flange can cause nipple trauma and pain, which can be addressed with the help of lactation specialists. Our patient had preterm infants and had attempted direct breastfeeding during her hospital course but was primarily pumping to express breastmilk, putting her at increased risk of nipple trauma.

Pre-existing skin breakdown at the nipple can serve as the entry point for pathogens; conversely, inflammation and irritation due to infection can precipitate nipple cracking. Our patient had some erythema at the site of the fissure, but in the absence of streaking erythema, purulent discharge or systemic symptoms, secondary or bacterial infection was lower on the differential. Further, her symptoms were not consistent with candidiasis since the patient did not have burning or constant breast pain, no recent antibiotic use and no history of recent vaginal thrush.

Other alternative diagnoses to consider in breastfeeding mothers who present with breast pain would include local manifestations of dermatosis such as eczema or psoriasis or Paget disease of the breast. These dermatoses can present as a cracked, pruritic and burning nipple, but are usually more gradual. They are most common in women who have a pre-existing skin condition or because of nipple irritation. Physical examination typically reveals a red, scaly rash of the areola and nipple. These dermatoses may present similar to herpes simplex breast lesions. However, this patient's breast symptoms were isolated to the single nipple fissure (figure 1), came on quickly, had no evidence of breast skin thickening, and she did not have any known pre-existing skin conditions.

### Comparison of the effect of human milk and topical hydrocortisone 1% on diaper dermatitis [^116fJvgt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin problems in infants and children, affecting between 7% and 35% of infants. This randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy of hydrocortisone 1% ointment with that of human breast milk in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants ages 0 to 24 months. Infants with diaper rash were treated with either hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 70) or human breast milk (n = 71) for 7 days. Improvement in the rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3 and 7; there was no significant difference in total rash scores on days 3 and 7. Treatment with human breast milk was as effective as hydrocortisone 1% ointment alone. Human breast milk is an effective and safe treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^116HYrH7]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Cat-scratch disease

Although granulomatous lymphadenitis of the axilla has multiple causes, only a few specifically have a preference for the axilla and typically spare the breast parenchyma. Cat-scratch disease, or cat-scratch fever, is one of those processes. It is caused by a bacterial infection and most commonly occurs in children after a cat scratches or bites an arm. It has worldwide distribution and has been described in all areas of North America. In northern temperate zones, it occurs more often from August through October, usually in humid, warm locales. There are an estimated 22,000 new cases of cat-scratch disease per year in the United States.

Clinical

Cat-scratch disease is usually limited to one side of the body and commonly presents as tender, swollen lymph nodes near the site of the bite or scratch. Regional lymphadenopathy occurs 1–3 weeks after inoculation. A vesicle or an erythematous papule may form at the site of initial infection, and regional lymphadenopathy (85%), axillary lymphadenopathy (27%), and fever, headache and malaise (77%) often develop. It may take 7–14 days before symptoms appear, and most cases are self-limited, resolving within 1 month with or without treatment. The lymphadenopathy may, however, persist for several months after the other symptoms have disappeared.

Mammography/ultrasound

Lymph nodes are enlarged on mammography. On ultrasound they are hypoechoic lobular or oval masses with central hyperaemia and occasional adjacent fluid. The presence of asymmetry and a hyperechoic hilum may differentiate cat-scratch disease from other aetiologies (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11
Cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae). A 59-year-old woman had a 1-month history of a left axillary mass. Ultrasound-guided biopsy showed follicular hyperplasia with non-necrotising epithelioid granulomas. B. henselae (cat-scratch disease) titre was more than 1:1,024, consistent with recent infection. a Left mediolateral-oblique view with magnified image showed a new left axillary mass (arrow). b Ultrasound showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla with lobulated margins, thickened cortices and increased cortical vascular flow

Histology

Cat-scratch disease is characterised by granulomatous inflammation on histological examination of the lymph nodes. Breast parenchymal involvement occurs less commonly; when it does, it presents as a palpable mass with enlarged lymph nodes within the axilla in 38% of patients.

### A systematic review of zosteriform rash in breast cancer patients: an objective proof of flap reinnervation and a management algorithm [^113Ccg5L]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Zosteriform rash in cancer patients provides objective clues to the process of reinnervation of the reconstructed breast. This rash should also raise suspicion for metastasis, which can be confused with herpes zoster.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to explain the reconstruction flap sensory reinnervation mechanism based on the clinical findings and provide a diagnostic and management algorithm of zosteriform rash in breast cancer patients.

Methods

On November 15, 2017, we conducted a search of published articles in MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. All the articles describing a zosteriform rash in a patient with a history of breast cancer were included in this review.

Results

Eleven articles from the literature and 1 case from our practice were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. Five patients had a breast reconstruction with a flap. The flap skin was affected by the rash in 4 of these patients, providing an objective proof of the reinnervation of the reconstructed breast. In 6 patients, the presentation was typical, and the diagnosis of herpes zoster was made without additional diagnostic testing. In 4 cases, the eruption was atypical, and a biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis of a cancer metastasis. In 2 patients, the rash was multidermatomal, and a polymerase chain reaction was done to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated herpes zoster.

Conclusions

Zoster reactivation in breast reconstructed patients is an objective proof of the reinnervation of the skin flap. Moreover, zosteriform rash in cancer patients should raise suspicion for metastasis, which can be confused with herpes zoster.

### Dirofilariasis presenting as pleural effusion: a rare case report with unusual manifestations and treatment modalities [^117BtR22]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A month after administering treatment, a chest x-ray revealed no pathological findings and the pleural effusion had resolved. However, the patient presented with an emerged, painful, palpable right breast mass in the same location where the rash was observed. Ultrasound imaging revealed a 1,5 × 2 cm nodule, surgically removed, revealing parasites that were consistent with Dirofilaria repens but not definitively identified at that time. Pharmacological treatment for dirofilariasis was not further prescribed. Subsequent follow-up visits indicated no recurrence of new subcutaneous and pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion, maintaining the patient's overall health stability.

Case report

A 61-year-old woman with a remote history of breast cancer in remission presented with a worsening cutaneous eruption that began 5 days after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On the day following her vaccination, she experienced subjective fever, fatigue, generalized myalgia, nausea, and headache that lasted for 4 days. On day 5 following vaccination, she noticed a pruritic cutaneous eruption on her abdomen, which generalized over the next 5 days. Diffuse erythematous morbilliform papules and plaques were noted over the neck, trunk, and proximal aspects of the extremities. In addition, there were faintly targetoid erythematous-to-violaceous plaques over the distal aspects of the extremities extending onto the palms and soles (Fig 1, A and B). There was no lymphadenopathy or mucosal involvement; however, the patient was jaundiced. The patient was admitted to a local hospital, and she was subsequently transferred to our institution for inpatient dermatologic care.

### T cell-mediated acute localized exanthematous pustulosis caused by finasteride [^115Bsvbf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented with multiple erythematous nonfollicular papules partially confluent to plaques on his breast and lower abdomen that had been present for 1 month. Grouped pustules were present under the right breast. The patient had been taking finasteride over the past 3 months for androgenetic alopecia. His medical history was negative for psoriasis. Our initial differential diagnosis included dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, allergic contact dermatitis, infectious folliculitis, varicella zoster virus infection, fixed drug eruption, and IgA pemphigus. The white blood cell count and differential were within the normal limits. Results of viral cultures and PCR, as well as bacterial and fungal cultures of skin lesions proved negative. A lesional biopsy specimen showed a slight psoriasiform acanthosis in association with spongiosis and infiltration of both the epidermis and dermis by neutrophils and eosinophils, resulting in formation of subcorneal, intraepidermal, and subepidermal pustules. The results of direct immunofluorescence were negative, excluding an IgA pemphigus. The result of a lymphocyte transformation test was positive for finasteride. On the basis of the time relationship between the administration of finasteride and the development of the skin disease in combination with symptoms resolution on cessation of the drug, the histologic findings, and the positive lymphocyte transformation test result, we consider this to be an unusual type of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis defined as acute localized exanthematous pustulosis caused by finasteride. Within 4 weeks after withdrawal of finasteride, the rash resolved without any specific therapy. Transient discrete residual hyperpigmentation and scaling were present. The patient refused an oral provocation challenge.
