## Question

In amniotic fluid in the treatment of polyhydramnios, what common complications are caused?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what common complications are caused by amniotic fluid in the treatment of polyhydramnios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to complications of the polyhydramnios itself versus complications of the treatments that involve amniotic fluid manipulation, namely amnioreduction. Then, I should verify the most authoritative sources on amnioreduction complications and quantify them. Next, I will consider procedure-related risks like preterm labor, membrane rupture, and infection. After that, I should review maternal and fetal outcomes that may be influenced by amnioreduction. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful list of common complications with frequencies where available and note any modifiers such as etiology or timing of the procedure.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Polyhydramnios is an excess of amniotic fluid, and the principal intervention that "uses" amniotic fluid in its treatment is amnioreduction, which removes large volumes of fluid to relieve maternal symptoms. I should confirm that the question is about amnioreduction-related complications rather than the disease process itself, and I will keep both in mind as I proceed [^927e16b4] [^a9dbde4d].

> Now, I need to check the highest-quality data on amnioreduction complications. The 2023 retrospective cohort in pregnancies with moderate to severe polyhydramnios reported a 10.9% overall complication rate among procedures, with preterm delivery within 48 hours in 5.4% of cases, which is the most consistently cited acute risk. Wait, let me verify the denominator and timing; yes, that 5.4% refers to procedures, not patients, and reflects immediate post-procedural preterm birth, which aligns with physiologic plausibility given uterine decompression and mechanical stimulation [^a9dbde4d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefit or harm. I should confirm whether amnioreduction prolonged pregnancy or reduced adverse outcomes. The same study found no prolongation of gestation and actually showed an earlier median gestational age at delivery in the amnioreduction group, suggesting that while symptom relief is achievable, the procedure itself does not extend pregnancy and may be temporally associated with earlier delivery in some contexts, so counseling should be balanced [^a9dbde4d].

> Next, I should review other procedure-related risks. Membrane rupture, chorioamnionitis, and bleeding are recognized risks of invasive amniotic procedures, though precise rates vary by series and technique. Let me consider corroborating data; in a large retrospective series of 271 amnioreductions, 4.1% had unplanned preterm birth within 48 hours, and while infection and bleeding were not quantified separately, they are biologically plausible and consistent with invasive obstetric procedures, so I should include them as potential complications even if exact frequencies are not specified in that cohort [^499ab0a5].

> I will now examine maternal outcomes that may be influenced by amnioreduction. The 2023 comparative study suggested lower rates of uterine atony in the amnioreduction group, which could reflect reduced uterine overdistension after fluid removal. But wait, I should double-check that this was an association and not a randomized effect; yes, it is observational and hypothesis-generating, so I should present it cautiously while acknowledging that other series have linked polyhydramnios itself to postpartum hemorrhage, which complicates attribution to the procedure versus the disease [^a9dbde4d] [^b56e161a].

> Let me consider fetal and neonatal implications. Immediate preterm delivery within 48 hours is the most concrete risk, and beyond that, neonatal respiratory morbidity is higher in pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios even when idiopathic, so amnioreduction does not eliminate baseline neonatal risk. I should confirm that this respiratory signal persists after adjustment; indeed, term idiopathic polyhydramnios is associated with a fourfold increase in composite neonatal morbidity driven largely by respiratory morbidity, which informs anticipatory neonatal planning rather than arguing against indicated amnioreduction [^234386af].

> But wait, what if the polyhydramnios is due to a placental tumor or chorioangioma. I need to ensure I flag special-case risks. Case reports describe placental abruption after rapid amnioreduction in the setting of chorioangioma, so abrupt decompression in select pathologies may precipitate abruption; this is not a generalizable risk but should prompt individualized risk assessment and cautious technique when a chorioangioma is present [^5365968a].

> Next, I should review recurrence and the need for repeat procedures. In a large series, 45.6% required more than one amnioreduction, indicating that a substantial fraction need serial drains, which increases cumulative procedural exposure and the chance of complications over time. I should confirm that this repetition reflects disease severity rather than procedure failure per se; yes, repeated procedures are typically needed when the underlying cause persists or when symptoms recur with fluid reaccumulation [^499ab0a5].

> Let me synthesize the common complications with frequencies where available. The most consistently reported complication is preterm delivery within 48 hours, occurring in about 5.4% of procedures, with an overall procedural complication rate around 10.9% in contemporary series. Other recognized risks include membrane rupture, chorioamnionitis, bleeding, and, in select cases, placental abruption, while repeated procedures are common and may compound risk, and baseline neonatal respiratory morbidity remains elevated in polyhydramnios even after amnioreduction [^a9dbde4d] [^499ab0a5] [^5365968a] [^234386af].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling points and context. Amnioreduction is indicated for severe maternal symptoms from polyhydramnios, not to prolong pregnancy, and patients should be counseled on the 5–6% risk of delivery within 48 hours, the possibility of needing repeat procedures, and the need for neonatal preparedness given higher respiratory morbidity in polyhydramnios. Hold on, I should verify guideline alignment; SMFM recommends amnioreduction only for maternal indications such as dyspnea or severe discomfort, which matches this risk–benefit framing and supports shared decision-making [^927e16b4] [^a9dbde4d].

Polyhydramnios is associated with **increased risks of preterm labor, placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and fetal malpresentation** [^c6d6c596] [^b56e161a] [^82f1a113]. It also raises the likelihood of **cord prolapse, neonatal respiratory distress, and perinatal mortality**, especially when severe or linked to fetal anomalies [^b3a5b67c] [^234386af] [^3bb62171]. Management is tailored to severity and etiology, with amnioreduction reserved for severe symptomatic cases and close maternal-fetal surveillance for milder forms [^927e16b4] [^a9dbde4d].

---

## Maternal complications

- **Preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes (PROM)**: Polyhydramnios increases the risk of preterm labor and PROM, likely due to uterine overdistension and increased intrauterine pressure [^8081f2f0].

- **Placental abruption**: There is an increased risk of placental abruption, particularly in severe polyhydramnios or when associated with fetal anomalies [^c6d6c596] [^5365968a].

- **Postpartum hemorrhage**: Polyhydramnios is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, likely due to uterine atony resulting from overdistension [^b56e161a] [^9faf303f].

- **Maternal respiratory distress**: Severe polyhydramnios can cause significant maternal respiratory discomfort due to diaphragmatic compression [^927e16b4].

---

## Fetal complications

- **Fetal malpresentation**: Polyhydramnios increases the risk of malpresentation, including breech presentation, due to increased fetal mobility in the overdistended uterus [^b3a5b67c] [^22b6161a].

- **Cord prolapse**: The risk of cord prolapse is significantly increased, particularly in the setting of membrane rupture or preterm labor [^b3a5b67c].

- **Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)**: Polyhydramnios is associated with an increased risk of neonatal RDS, even in term infants, possibly due to impaired fetal lung development or compression [^234386af] [^c6d6c596].

- **Perinatal mortality**: Polyhydramnios is associated with increased perinatal mortality, particularly when associated with fetal anomalies or severe hydramnios [^3bb62171] [^b56e161a].

---

## Management and monitoring

Management of polyhydramnios depends on the severity, etiology, and maternal-fetal status. Mild cases are typically managed conservatively with **close surveillance**, whereas severe symptomatic cases may require **amnioreduction** or pharmacological interventions [^927e16b4] [^a9dbde4d]. Amnioreduction, while effective in relieving maternal symptoms, carries risks such as preterm labor, placental abruption, and infection, and should be performed cautiously [^a9dbde4d] [^5365968a].

---

Polyhydramnios is associated with significant maternal and fetal complications, including preterm labor, placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, fetal malpresentation, cord prolapse, neonatal respiratory distress, and increased perinatal mortality. Management should be individualized, with **conservative management for mild cases** and **intervention for severe or symptomatic cases**.

### Clinical relevance of sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: polyhydramnios [^be125960]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid within the amniotic cavity. The etiology of polyhydramnios may be idiopathic, the consequence of fetal structural anomalies, or the consequence of various fetal and maternal conditions. The clinical importance of polyhydramnios is found in its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and the risk of perinatal mortality. The antenatal management of polyhydramnios can be challenging as there are no formalized guidelines on the topic. The purpose of this review is to provide a literature-based overview on the subject of polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, demonstrate its clinical implications, and describe a practical approach to its management.

### Amniotic fluid abnormalities [^cac12d54]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of amniotic fluid reflects contributions from many fetal systems, many functional roles, and multiple interactions with fetal maturation, obstetric, and maternal factors. Simple ultrasound measurement, probably done best with the maximum vertical pocket method, has a clinical role in fetal surveillance, substantiated by extensive level II and some level I evidence. Interventions (amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios, amnioreduction for polyhydramnios) have not been studied effectively in controlled fashion, with the exception of intrapartum applications, where effective reduction of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and perinatal impacts of meconium aspiration may follow amnioinfusion. A wealth of research opportunities exists into regulation of amniotic fluid constituents and their relation to preterm delivery.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^24057846]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Isolated oligohydramnios are associated with an increased risk of placental abnormalities. Zilberman et al. investigated the extent of oligohydramnios. Abnormally reduced amniotic fluid volume was associated with an increased rate of fetal cardiac arrhythmias, more frequent need for induction of labour, and worse neonatal outcome. Oligohydramnios are also associated with more frequent cesarean section in low-risk pregnancies and an increased rate of low birth weight neonates. Fetal weight estimation may also be confounded by lower than average amniotic fluid, and in oligohydramnios, birth weight may be overestimated even shortly before term. If the height of the uterine fundus is lower than expected based on the calculated gestational age, reduced volume of amniotic fluid should be considered, and measurement is recommended.

Severe oligohydramnios can trigger pulmonary hypoplasia. An international study found that children with reduced amniotic fluid volume had an 8% higher rate of clinical airway treatment and an 80% higher incidence of respiratory failure compared to children with no oligohydramnios detected. Severe oligohydramnios can also have long-term neurological consequences for the newborn, which may be reflected in movement disorders.

### Amnioreduction vs expectant management in pregnancies with moderate to severe polyhydramnios [^a9dbde4d]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The rate of polyhydramnios is higher in pregnancies complicated by congenital anomalies. These pregnancies have higher rates of peripartum complications. Amnioreduction is offered to relieve maternal symptoms such as dyspnea, abdominal and respiratory discomfort, and other issues like satiety.

Objective

This study aimed to report the rates of amnioreduction and its associated complications in pregnancies with moderate to severe polyhydramnios secondary to fetal anomalies. We also sought to determine if amnioreduction provided additional benefits, including prolongation of pregnancy and a decrease in the rates of peripartum morbidities associated with moderate to severe polyhydramnios.

Study Design

This was a retrospective review of anomalous singleton pregnancies with moderate to severe polyhydramnios that were evaluated and delivered at a single center between 2013 and 2021. Peripartum outcomes were compared between pregnancies that underwent amnioreduction and those that were expectantly managed. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. A multiple regression model was created to understand the effects of amnioreduction on gestational age at delivery.

Results

A total of 218 singleton pregnancies met the inclusion criteria of moderate to severe polyhydramnios in the study period. Of those, 110 patients (50.5%) underwent amnioreduction and 108 patients (49.5%) opted for expectant management. A total of 147 procedures were performed at a median gestational age of 32.5 weeks and a median of 1900 mL of amniotic fluid was removed per procedure. Complications occurred in 10.9% (n = 16) of procedures, including preterm delivery within 48 hours in 5.4% cases (n = 8). The median amniotic fluid index was higher in the amnioreduction group than in the expectant group (38.9 cm vs 35.5 cm; P < .0001). Patients who underwent amnioreduction had an earlier median gestational age at delivery (36.3 weeks vs 37.0 weeks; P = 0.048), however, the rates of spontaneous preterm delivery were similar. A higher percentage of women in the amnioreduction group had vaginal delivery (49.4% vs 30.5%; P = 0.01) and lower rates of uterine atony (2.4% vs 13.7%; P = 0.006). In the multiple linear regression analysis, the gestational age at delivery positively correlated with gestational age at amnioreduction after controlling for amniotic fluid volume (P < .0001; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.71). In addition, the patients in the amnioreduction group were twice as likely to have a vaginal delivery (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Amnioreduction in the setting of moderate-severe polyhydramnios has a reasonably low rate of complications but does not provide any benefits in terms of prolonging the pregnancy. The procedure may increase the likelihood of vaginal delivery and lower the rates of uterine atony.

### SMFM consult series # 46: evaluation and management of polyhydramnios [^927e16b4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios, or hydramnios, is an abnormal increase in the volume of amniotic fluid. Identification of polyhydramnios should prompt a search for an underlying etiology. Although most cases of mild polyhydramnios are idiopathic, the 2 most common pathologic causes are maternal diabetes mellitus and fetal anomalies, some of which are associated with genetic syndromes. Other causes of polyhydramnios include congenital infection and alloimmunization. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the evaluation and management of polyhydramnios. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we suggest that polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies be defined as either a deepest vertical pocket of ≥ 8 cm or an amniotic fluid index of ≥ 24 cm (GRADE 2C); (2) we recommend that amnioreduction be considered only for the indication of severe maternal discomfort, dyspnea, or both in the setting of severe polyhydramnios (GRADE 1C); (3) we recommend that indomethacin should not be used for the sole purpose of decreasing amniotic fluid in the setting of polyhydramnios (GRADE 1B); (4) we suggest that antenatal fetal surveillance is not required for the sole indication of mild idiopathic polyhydramnios (GRADE 2C); (5) we recommend that labor should be allowed to occur spontaneously at term for women with mild idiopathic polyhydramnios; that induction, if planned, should not occur at < 39 weeks of gestation in the absence of other indications; and that mode of delivery should be determined based on usual obstetric indications (GRADE 1C); and (6) we recommend that women with severe polyhydramnios deliver at a tertiary center due to the significant possibility that fetal anomalies may be present (GRADE 1C).

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^100863f4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Oligohydramnios — definitions and delivery timing — Commonly used definitions of oligohydramnios include a single deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid of 2 cm or less and an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less, and the use of a percentile of amniotic fluid should not be used in management decisions; randomized controlled trials indicate that using the deepest vertical pocket measurement, as opposed to the amniotic fluid index, to diagnose oligohydramnios is associated with a reduction in unnecessary interventions without an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes. In the setting of otherwise uncomplicated isolated and persistent oligohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket measurement less than 2 cm), delivery at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later is recommended, whereas in pregnancies at less than 36 0/7 weeks of gestation with intact membranes the decision to proceed with expectant management or delivery should be individualized based on gestational age and the maternal and fetal condition; if delivery is not undertaken, follow-up amniotic fluid volume measurements, NSTs, and fetal growth assessments are indicated, and if the oligohydramnios results from fetal membrane rupture, follow-up amniotic fluid volume assessment often may be safely omitted.

### Management of oligohydramnios in pregnancy [^934418d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of oligohydramnios in pregnancy is problematic. The various mechanisms that control amniotic fluid, the inability to precisely measure and quantify the amount, and the relevance of a "decreased" amount of fluid make the management of this finding unclear. Given the limited amount of data, the single deepest vertical pocket may be a better method than the amniotic fluid index to define oligohydramnios. A large prospective study is needed to develop the most optimal management recommendations, especially for idiopathic oligohydramnios at or near term.

Literature-based evidence

Our literature search identified two Cochrane reviews, one other review, and 15 other interventional or observational trials of amniotic fluid assessment to identify polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios that reported perinatal outcomes (Table 12 and Table 13).

Polyhydramnios

Several observational studies explored the association of polyhydramnios with perinatal mortality, with inconsistent findings. Several observational studies observed that polyhydroamnios was an independent risk factor for both perinatal mortality and intrapartum morbidity [LOE: 2-]. A retrospective cohort study by Dashe et al. documented a fetal death rate of 4% in pregnancies with polyhydramnios diagnosed by AFI, of which 40% were unrelated to fetal malformations [LOE: 2-]. Magann et al. conducted a review of idiopathic polyhydramnios including 4 studies that evaluated perinatal mortality with polyhydramnios after correcting for congenital anomalies. In the larger studies, idiopathic polyhyramnios was associated with macrosomia and a statistically significant 2- to 5-fold increase in the risk of perinatal mortality [LOE: 2+] (Additional file 14). A retrospective logistic regression analysis of SGA and appropriate-weight fetuses with and without polyhydramnios determined that the combination of SGA and polyhydramnios was an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality compared to normal weight-for-age infants with normal AFI values (OR = 20.55; CI: 12.6–33.4). The association may not apply to certain subsets of high-risk pregnancies, as a similar study among women with gestational diabetes who had AFI performed antenatally found no elevated risk of perinatal morbidity or mortality among pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios compared to gestational diabetics without polyhydramnios [LOE: 2-]. No intervention studies subsequent to diagnosis of polyhydramnios were identified.

### Comparing pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal outcomes in women with idiopathic polyhydramnios: a prospective cohort study [^84e1e0a1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Accordingly, in the current study, idiopathic polyhydramnios was associated with maternal and fetal complications and increased perinatal complications, thus undermining the fact that pregnancies due to idiopathic polyhydramnios are at higher risk and should therefore be closely monitored. According to this study, idiopathic idiopathic polyhydramnios may be increases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean delivery, and respiratory distress. So, it is better patients with polyhydramnios closely monitored and followed up.

### Assessment of amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy [^518f3334]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid (AF) is an integral part of the fetal environment and is essential for fetal growth and development. Pathways of AF recirculation include the fetal lungs, swallowing, absorption through the fetal gastrointestinal tract, excretion through fetal urine production, and movement. In addition to being a marker for fetal health, adequate AF is necessary for fetal lung development, growth, and movement. The role of diagnostic imaging is to provide a detailed fetal survey, placental evaluation, and clinical correlation with maternal conditions to help identify causes of AF abnormalities and thereby enable specific therapy. Oligohydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal growth restriction as well as genitourinary issues, including renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and bladder outlet obstruction. Premature preterm rupture of membranes should also be clinically excluded as a cause of oligohydramnios. Clinical trials evaluating amnioinfusion are underway as a potential intervention for renal causes of oligohydramnios. Most cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, with maternal diabetes being a common cause. Polyhydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal gastrointestinal obstruction and oropharyngeal or thoracic masses, as well as neurologic or musculoskeletal anomalies. Amnioreduction is performed only for maternal indications such as symptomatic polyhydramnios causing maternal respiratory distress. Polyhydramnios with fetal growth restriction is paradoxical and can occur with maternal diabetes and hypertension. When these maternal conditions are absent, this raises concern for aneuploidy. The authors describe the pathways of AF production and circulation, US and MRI assessment of AF, disease-specific disruption of AF pathways, and an algorithmic approach to AF abnormalities. © RSNA, 2023 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### A review of amniotic fluid dynamics and the enigma of isolated oligohydramnios [^28a0e38a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Traditionally, oligohydramnios has been implemented as a sign of potential fetal compromise and associated with an increased incidence of adverse perinatal morbidity and mortality. Decreased amniotic fluid volume is especially of concern when it occurs in conjunction with structural fetal anomalies, fetal growth restriction, postdates pregnancies, and maternal disease. Consequently, following ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios at term, delivery is routinely advocated even in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies with an appropriate-for-gestational-age fetus, irrespective of the presence of reassuring fetal evaluation and the absence of maternal disease. Numerous factors complicate the ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios. These include a lack of complete detailed understanding of the physiology of the dynamics of oligohydramnios, the transient condition at times of decreased amniotic fluid volume, generally poor performance of ultrasonography in detecting oligohydramnios, an array of different ultrasound diagnostic criteria, and varying ultrasonographic thresholds. In light of the latter and the lack of prospective randomized data, is unclear that the practice of effecting delivery for isolated oligohydramnios at term is justified. This article presents physiologic dynamics of amniotic fluid, factors that may affect amniotic fluid volume, possible pitfalls in the ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid volume, and the clinical significance of oligohydramnios. In addition, the literature regarding perinatal outcome associated with oligohydramnios and current available data supporting expectant noninterventional management of cases complicated by isolated oligohydramnios at term are discussed.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^3216d10c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyhydramnios, or an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, affects less than 2% of pregnancies in high-income countries. Polyhydramnios can be associated with adverse outcomes such as perinatal mortality, prematurity, shoulder dystocia, and respiratory distress syndrome, and is therefore an important health concern. Polyhydramnios can result from maternal conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes, infections and medication exposure. Fetal conditions that affect the fetus's ability to swallow or obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies can also result in polyhydramnios.

In many low and low-middle income countries (LMICs), the incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown. The use of ultrasound during prenatal care is limited in many LMICs due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining ultrasound equipment, and lack of trained providers to perform and interpret these studies. As a result, certain pregnancy-related conditions that are usually detected by ultrasound go undiagnosed, including polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios and fetal growth abnormalities. These conditions can lead to adverse perinatal events, and therefore should be recognized in order to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with polyhydramnios may be worse in LMICs due to limitations in emergent obstetric care and intensive care for infants born prematurely. Understanding the epidemiology of polyhydramnios in LMICs might lead to strategies for reducing perinatal and peripartum morbidity and mortality.

Pregnant women in LMICs may have different underlying risk factors for polyhydramnios when compared to women in high-income countries. Women in LMICs have different nutritional status, infection exposures, prevalence of diabetes and incidence of fetal anomalies than women in high-income countries. These differences in exposure might alter the prevalence of polyhydramnios in these regions. These maternal characteristics might also contribute to worse perinatal outcomes.

In this paper, we report the incidence of polyhydramnios among women in five LMICs. We also report maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios and the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among those affected.

### Amnioreduction in the management of polyhydramnios complicating singleton pregnancies [^499ab0a5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of amnioreduction to the management of singleton pregnancies that are complicated by symptomatic polyhydramnios.

Study Design

Retrospective review of all singleton pregnancies that received at least 1 amnioreduction for polyhydramnios from 2000–2012 at a single obstetric unit that provides a statewide service. The indications, procedural techniques, and pregnancy outcomes were evaluated.

Results

One hundred thirty-eight women with polyhydramnios (maximal vertical pocket [MVP], ≥ 8 cm) had 271 amnioreduction procedures during the study period. The median gestation at the first drain was 31.4 weeks (interquartile range, 28.4–34 weeks) and a median of 1 procedure (interquartile range, 1–2 procedures) was performed per pregnancy. Sixty-three women (45.6%) required > 1 amnioreduction. The median volume removed per pregnancy was 2100 mL (interquartile range, 1500–4260 mL). The median duration from the first amnioreduction until delivery was 26 days (interquartile range, 15–52.5 days). There was no significant association between gestation at delivery and the volume per procedure or total volume that was removed. Earlier gestation at first drain was associated positively with earlier gestations at delivery. In 4.1% of amnioreduction procedures (11/271 procedures), there was an unplanned preterm birth within 48 hours. The median gestation at delivery was 36.4 weeks (interquartile range, 34–38 weeks). The final diagnoses were gastrointestinal malformations (21%), idiopathic polyhydramnios (20.3%), chromosomal anomaly (15.2%), syndromic condition (13.7%), and neurologic condition (8%).

Conclusion

Amnioreduction has a useful role in the management of polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies. Complications are uncommon, and delivery typically occurs near term.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^a3b71a90]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study identified the incidence of polyhydramnios in LMICs, and confirmed its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal mortality. We identified a high incidence of polyhydramnios in the DRC compared to other LMICs. These findings should be replicated, in order to better understand the higher than expected incidence of polyhydramnios in this area. If these findings are replicated, the identification of polyhydramnios during pregnancy could direct essential medical care to the women and infants most at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. In areas where resources for C-section are limited, a system that identifies women with polyhydramnios, and directs limited reources to these mothers, might reduce neonatal mortality rates in these high risk pregnancies. Identification of polyhydramnios during pregnancy, and appropriate treatment or referral could prevent subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal death. Our findings have underscored the importance of understanding the etiology of polyhydramnios in this environment and a case-control trial is underway to evaluate this finding.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^e9e74c39]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that if the ultrasound examination reveals less or more amniotic fluid than the average, increased attention should be paid to ultrasound examination of the urogenital system, abdominal organs, skull and spine, and limbs and skeletal system of the intrauterine fetus. In the case of polyhydramnios, fetal echocardiography is recommended. The attention of the neonatologist or pediatrician should also be drawn to abnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid at delivery, as further examination of the newborn may be warranted in these cases.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^88450fa6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study was not designed to investigate the causal factors for polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios results from a disruption of the equilibrium between the production and resorption of amniotic fluid. Imbalances could result from increased production of fluid through fetal urination and production of fetal lung fluid or from impaired reabsorption from impaired fetal swallowing and diminished intramembranous and intravascular absorption. Although mild polyhydramnios is often idiopathic, reported causes of moderate and severe polyhydramnios include: fetal malformations and genetic anomalies (8–45%), maternal diabetes mellitus (5–26%), multiple pregnancies (8–10%), fetal anemia (1–11%), and other causes, including viral infections, Bartter syndrome, neuromuscular disorders and maternal hypercalcemia. Although our study could not determine the etiology of polyhydramnios, we observed a trend toward more amniotic fluid with larger birth weights. It is unknown if this trend is caused by maternal diabetes or another etiologic factor that was not tested in the course of this study, and is not tested as part of routine antenatal care in the areas studied. Other factors, including sociodemographic and ethnic factors might contribute to polyhydramnios, but were not evaluated in this study. Additional investigation is warranted to determine the etiology of polyhydramnios in LMICs, and to determine the differential exposures that led to the higher incidence of polyhydramnios observed in this study in the DRC.

### Analysis of risk factors of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^4b362ddb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Common maternal complications include placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and HELLP syndrome, while fetal complications mainly include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal distress, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, abnormal diastolic blood flow signals, premature delivery, and stillbirth. (1) Diagnostic criteria for placental abruption: the placental abruption surface does not exceed 1/3 of the placental area, the signs are not obvious, the main symptoms are a large amount of vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain or mild abdominal pain, and the fetal heart rate is normal; (2) Diagnostic criteria for postpartum hemorrhage: the amount of blood loss reaches or exceeds 500 mL within 24 h after delivery of the fetus. (3) Diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction (FGR): fetal head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference are measured by ultrasound, and fetal weight (EFW) is estimated by substituting the HadlockC formula, and FGR is diagnosed if EFW is less than the 10th percentile of the same gestational age. (4) Diagnostic criteria for fetal distress: the fetus in the womb due to acute or chronic hypoxia endangering health and life syndrome, mainly manifested as abnormal fetal heart rate during delivery, amniotic fluid meconium contamination and abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring (late deceleration, frequent mutation deceleration), abnormal fetal movement (hypoxia in the initial stage of frequent fetal movements, then weakened and reduced, and then disappeared). Intrauterine distress is diagnosed if any of the above are achieved. (5) Diagnostic criteria for oligohydramnios: those with less than 300 mL of amniotic fluid in the third trimester of pregnancy are called oligohydramnios. The prenatal diagnosis of oligohydramnios is mainly determined by the maximum depth (AFV) of the dark area of the amniotic fluid and the index of amniotic fluid (AFI) by color ultrasound, with AFV ≦ 2 cm being oligohydramnios and AFI ≦ 5 cm being the standard for oligohydramnios. Hypohydramnios can be clearly diagnosed if the total amount is less than 300 mL when the membrane is broken and the amount of amniotic fluid is collected by various methods after delivery. Polyhydramnios: The amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy is more than 2000 ml, which is called polyhydramnios. The prenatal diagnosis of polyhydramnios is mainly determined by the maximum depth (AFV) of the dark area of the amniotic fluid and the amniotic fluid index (AFI) monitored by color ultrasound, AFV ≧ 8 cm is diagnosed as polyhydramnios, and AFI ≧ 25 cm is diagnosed as polyhydramnios. A total amount of more than 2000 mL of amniotic fluid collected postpartum confirms the diagnosis of polyhydramnios.(6) Premature delivery: It refers to delivery at 28 weeks of gestation and less than 37 weeks of gestation, resulting in premature infants with a birth weight between 1,000 and 2,499 g.

### Maternal hydration for increasing amniotic fluid volume in oligohydramnios and normal amniotic fluid volume [^8ea6fa74]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid) may be responsible for malpresentation problems, umbilical cord compression, concentration of meconium in the liquor, and difficult or failed external cephalic version. Simple maternal hydration has been suggested as a way of increasing amniotic fluid volume in order to reduce some of these problems.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of maternal hydration on amniotic fluid volume and measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. Date of last search: September 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing maternal hydration with no hydration in pregnant women with reduced or normal amniotic fluid volume.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by both reviewers.

Main Results

Two studies of 77 women were included. The women were asked to drink two litres of water before having a repeat ultrasound examination. Maternal hydration in women with and without oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic volume (weighted mean difference for women with oligohydramnios 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.56; and weighted mean difference for women with normal amniotic fluid volume 4.5, 95% confidence interval 2.92 to 6.08). Intravenous hypotonic hydration in women with oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic fluid volume (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 3.24). Isotonic intravenous hydration had no measurable effect. No clinically important outcomes were assessed in any of the trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Simple maternal hydration appears to increase amniotic fluid volume and may be beneficial in the management of oligohydramnios and prevention of oligohydramnios during labour or prior to external cephalic version. Controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical benefits and possible risks of maternal hydration for specific clinical purposes.

### Prenatal ultrasound factors and genetic disorders in pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios [^acf78355]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study is to examine the incidence of chromosomal or genetic abnormalities in pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios and to assess the value of prenatal ultrasound findings in the prediction of cases associated with such disorders.

Methods

We searched the prenatal records of all patients delivered in our hospital with a diagnosis of polyhydramnios during pregnancy. For each case, maternal characteristics, ultrasound findings, and genetic testing results were recorded. A postnatal follow-up program of at least 6months, including a clinical assessment by a clinical geneticist, was carried out in all cases.

Results

On a total of 195 cases, genetic testing and clinical examination identified a chromosomal or genetic disease in 26 (13.3%) cases. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that significant predictors of a genetic disorder were a deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid of ≥ 13.0cm (OR 4.306, 95%CI: 1.535–12.079) and reduced fetal movements (OR 25.084, 95%CI: 4.577–137.461), but not the presence of a structural defect.

Conclusion

A postnatal clinical follow-up program can reveal chromosomal or genetic disorders in about 13% of neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of polyhydramnios. The severity of polyhydramnios and the reduction of fetal movements are independently associated with the presence of such diseases. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^60abdf4b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

By demonstrating a high incidence of polyhydramnios in the DRC, we identify a critical gap in knowledge about the etiology of polyhydramnios and the site specific risk factors that contribute. Also, given the high rate of polyhydramnios, and the association with fetal malposition and obstructed labor, this represents an important publc health problem. In order to prevent pregnancy complications that result from antenatal conditions, like polyhydramnios, women need appropriate antenatal care to identify these conditions and appropriate referral for treatment to facilities with the capability to treat those conditions, including performing C-sections when warranted. Despite the high incidence of polyhydramnios in the DRC compared to other sites, few C-sections were performed. In this study, the percentage of C-sections performed in the DRC was 1.5% compared to 13% in the other sites, which likely represents inadequate resources to perform C-sections in the area. In areas such as these, where resources for C-section are limited, direction of these resources to the highest risk patients might improve perinatal health. Therefore, the use of antenatal ultrasound to assist in the diagnosis of polyhydramnios may encourage appropriate referrals of high risk patients to delivery facilities capable of caring for these high risk patients.

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) — obstetric complications and management considerations include that polyhydramnios and preterm birth occur frequently, with reported incidences as high as 29% and 66%, respectively; if polyhydramnios causes maternal respiratory symptoms, options have included a short course of a prostaglandin inhibitor or serial amnioreduction, but both lack evidence of benefit and have potential complications and should be used judiciously; tocolytic agents are a consideration < 24 weeks when contractions follow a known inciting event such as an invasive procedure; because prematurity is likely to worsen the prognosis, we recommend that preterm delivery be undertaken only for obstetric indications.

### Comparing pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal outcomes in women with idiopathic polyhydramnios: a prospective cohort study [^8d1e96ea]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amniotic fluid plays an important role in the normal growth of the fetus during pregnancy and childbirth and has certain consequences on the future health of children. The most common techniques used to measure ultrasound amniotic fluid volume include the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) or amniotic fluid index (AFI). The MVP is the vertical dimension (in centimeters) of the largest pocket of amniotic fluid that does not consistently contain the umbilical cord or fetal organs. AFI is calculated by dividing the uterus into four quadrants. The four maximum vertical diameters of the amniotic fluid pocket are summarized for the final index. Polyhydramnios has been identified as an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid for gestational age and may be associated with a variety of fetal or maternal disorders. Risk factors of polyhydramnios include maternal diabetes, fetal heart failure, abnormal swallowing, and congenital infection.

In about 70% of cases, none of the above is considered a cause of polyhydramnios and is referred to as idiopathic condition. However, the association between idiopathic polyhydramnios and the perinatal adverse outcome is not well recognized. In some studies, an association has been observed between idiopathic polyhydramnios and macrosomia infants for gestational age, the incidence of malpresentation, and cesarean delivery, but without an increase in other side effects. In contrast, it has been shown in another studies, increase in perinatal mortality as well as a twofold increase in neonatal complications in the first year of life was reported. A relevant cohort study showed that pregnancies diagnosed with idiopathic polyhydramnios at the time of hospitalization and an increase in delivery at > 34 weeks, risk of induction of labor, cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, and operative vaginal delivery.

To date, idiopathic polyhydramnios is a matter of debate in obstetric practice, as perinatal outcomes idiopathic polyhydramnios is conflicting in literature and therefore this issue remains unsettled. It should be noted that no prospective study- related perinatal outcomes in idiopathic polyhydramnios were performed on this population. On the other hand, according to the above studies various complications have been reported, which gestational age is an important factor. Since prematurity is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in infants, we restrict our population to gestational age ≥ 34 weeks (late prematurity) for controlling prematurity factors in our study outcomes.

Considering the above contradictory evidence, we aimed to perform the first prospective cohort studying the assessment of perinatal outcomes and idiopathic polyhydramnios in an Iranian population.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^5fccdf61]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid volume evaluation using ultrasonography — objective methods and diagnostic thresholds are detailed with preference for the deepest vertical pocket. It is recommended that objective, rather than subjective, measurements of amniotic fluid volume be used, especially in the third trimester. To qualify as a measurable amniotic fluid pocket with either method, the width of the pocket must be at least 1 cm. Oligohydramnios is described in various ways, including absence of a vertical pocket of at least 2 cm and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of less than 5 cm; best available evidence supports using the deepest vertical pocket method of measurement because it leads to fewer interventions with no increase in poor perinatal outcomes compared with use of the AFI, and only the deepest vertical pocket method should be used with multiple pregnancies. Polyhydramnios commonly is described by an AFI greater than or equal to 24 cm or a maximum deepest vertical pocket of equal to or greater than 8 cm; idiopathic polyhydramnios represents 50–60% of cases.

### Comparing pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal outcomes in women with idiopathic polyhydramnios: a prospective cohort study [^2f862ede]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

In mild cases of idiopathic polyhydramnios, simple control and follow-ups, continuous ultrasound, and conservative treatment methods are recommended. The present study did not require any treatment process for this group. In cases with moderate to severe idiopathic polyhydramnios and maternal distress and gestational age less than 37 weeks, hospitalization and partial treatment measures to alleviate the mother's discomfort like amnioreduction or pharmacological intervention, the patient's consent and physician's assessment of the scenario varied. In this study, we conducted the intervention using fetal symptoms (including enlarged uterus pressing on the cervix which causes preterm delivery) in addition to maternal symptoms based on the measurement of cervical length and cervix funneling. We followed the approach of previous protocols in which the administration of indomethacin at a dose of 1.5 mg per body weight per day for 1 week is prescribed for pregnancies less than 32 weeks. In terms of gestational age (38–42 weeks), induction of labor / cesarean section was performed (depending on the indications of the obstetrician e.g. fetal distress). Considering our inclusion criteria(i.e.g.estational age > 34 weeks of pregnancy), referring to patient's history, up to 200 mg of indomethacin was prescribed for 14 patients (100%) in case the group with moderate- severe polyhydramnios at a gestational age of less than 32 weeks. Amnioreduction was conducted in 2 patients (14.28%) in the case group with moderate- severe polyhydramnios. All patients with mild polyhydramnios were managed without treatment (expected management) until the term. All parameters were compared within groups (Tables 2 and 3).

Statistical analysis

Demographic data of the groups were expressed as mean ± SD or number (percentage) and a comparison of these data was performed by × 2, Fisher, U-Manwithney, and t-test. The normality of the distributions was tested using the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test. Logistic regression was specified to evaluate obstetric and neonatal outcomes in patients between two groups. Confounding factors were gestational age, BMI, age, gravid. Results from the final model are presented as an odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. P values were set as 0.05 for all analyses. The statistical program for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 21; SPSS, Chicago, IL). There were no missing values. Therefore, no missing imputation technique was used. This manuscript was prepared under STROBE guidelines for observational studies.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^435bc9fd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of our study was to evaluate the correlation between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and adverse placental mediated complications in subsequent delivery. We therefore investigated a cohort of second deliveries at our institution as described, excluding previous deliveries with adverse placental mediated outcomes to avoid a confounding effect for subsequent delivery. We demonstrated a significantly higher rate of oligohydramnios, small for gestational age neonates and overall placental disorders in subsequent delivery, following isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery, as the odds ratio was almost double than of controls. No additional differences were noted in other adverse outcomes.

A debate regarding the pathogenesis and significance of oligohydramnios exists. While some consider this to be a variant of common clinical presentation, especially in the context of term pregnancy, others regard this entity as abnormal, and view it as a form of placental insufficiency. In some studies, isolated oligohydramnios at term was found to be related to higher rates of adverse outcomes like meconium aspiration syndrome, cesarean delivery for fetal distress and admission to NICU. Yet, the interpretation of these results must also account for the effects of iatrogenic interventions and lower weight fetuses. In a different study, expectant management of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm was associated with similar neonatal outcomes as compared to pregnancies with normal AFI, although an increased risk of new onset fetal growth restriction and lower birthweight was noted. This finding may suggest that in women with isolated oligohydramnios, reduced amniotic fluid volume can be the first sign of placental insufficiency. Nevertheless, others did not demonstrate any adverse outcomes with isolated oligohydramnios. An important adverse outcome that could not be evaluated in most studies regarding oligohydramnios was the risk of intrauterine fetal death, due to its rarity and insufficient sample size to address this outcome. Casey et al. showed a significant association between stillbirth and oligohydramnios, that persisted after exclusion of malformed fetuses from the analysis. Yet, they couldn't confirm that intervention may reduce this risk. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a randomized interventional trial will ever be able to address this specific complication.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^d1549e75]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oligohydramnios is the commonest amniotic fluid disorder, characterized by reduced amniotic fluid or amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age. Oligohydramnios is associated with poor maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress, birth asphyxia, prolonged labor, and increased risk of caesarean section, often arising from umbilical cord compression, meconium aspiration, or uteroplacental insufficiency. In low-and middle-income countries, oligohydramnios accounts for approximately up to 6.5% of still births.

Oligohydramnios occurs in about 1–5% of term pregnancies worldwide; however, the prevalence rises to more than 12% in post-term pregnancies. In Africa, prevalence rates of oligohydramnios ranging from 4 to 23% have been reported previously. Additionally, several maternal, placental, and fetal factors, including ruptured amniotic membranes, fetal abnormalities, genetic factors, maternal illnesses, nutrition status, multiple pregnancies, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and use of certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have been found to be associated with oligohydramnios.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^8da56fce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Findings of this study confirms that maternal risk factors which were associated with amniotic fluid disorders included diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes. Regarding the maternal and fetal outcomes, the results indicated that oligohydramnios associated with gestational age at term and neonatal birth weighted < 2.5 kg, and polyhydramnios associated with gestational age at late term and neonatal birth weighted > 2.5 Kg. Regarding the mode of delivery, it was found that CS was higher among pregnancies which were complicated due to polyhydramnios while oligohydramnios was mostly associated with vaginal deliveries.

### A clinical scoring system to predict the need for extensive resuscitation at birth in very low birth weight infants [^68d3b237]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormally decreased amniotic fluid volume may reflect fetal dysfunction that prevents normal urination, or it may represent a placental abnormality severe enough to impair perfusion. Second-trimester rupture of the fetal membranes may also result in oligohydramnios. Few studies have investigated the correlation between oligohydramnios and resuscitation. Aziz et al. showed that oligohydramnios is a significant risk factor for positive pressure ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Our analyses show that oligohydramnios is associated with extensive resuscitation in VLBW infants, and was one of the significant predictors of our model. Our data suggest that infants born to mothers with oligohydramnios who also have other unfavorable maternal and fetal conditions (e.g. fetal or placental insufficiency, premature rupture of membrane) have a worse prognosis at birth, and need more extensive resuscitation in the delivery room, compared with infants born to women with isolated oligohydramnios. This conclusion is consistent with the findings by Zhang et al.

Common underlying causes of polyhydramnios include fetal congenital anomalies (approximately 15%) and diabetes (15–20%). Polyhydramnios is often a component of hydrops fetalis. Data regarding early neonatal complications from idiopathic polyhydramnios are conflicting. Some studies have found higher rate of newborn resuscitation with idiopathic polyhydramnios. However, Panting-Kemp et al. showed that idiopathic polyhydramnios is unassociated with low 5-min Apgar score. Our analyses support the notion that polyhydramnios is associated with extensive resuscitation in VLBW infants.

Our study aim was to develop a prediction model for extensive resuscitation using factors that can be clinically established before delivery. The variables we included were: gestational age, amniotic fluid, and antenatal steroid use. Our data suggest that the delivery by a woman with abnormal amniotic fluid volume, or in whom less antenatal steroid has been administered — despite gestational age > 27 weeks — should be prepared for extensive delivery room resuscitation. It should be attended by a team composed of at least three well-trained personnel with full resuscitation skills, and that equipment and supplies needed for extensive resuscitation should be prepared.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^6fc5eb5c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Amnioinfusion is a procedure whereby fluid (either saline or Ringer's lactate) is added to the uterine cavity transcervically via catheter, when the membranes have ruptured, or transabdominally using a needle if amniotic membranes are still intact. The procedure is often performed in an effort to prevent or relieve umbilical cord compression during labour associated with low amniotic fluid volume (oligohydramnios); the infusion of fluid also dilutes meconium detected in the amniotic fluid. Dilution of meconium is thought to minimize the risk of meconium aspiration, as thick meconium in cases of oligohydramnios is associated with significant perinatal mortality and morbidity. Amnioinfusion may impact fetal survival via one or both of these mechanisms and the two can be difficult to differentiate. Amnioinfusion has also been used in an effort to prevent ascending infection in cases of premature rupture of membranes (PROM), or to facilitate external cephalic version at term, though the impact of amnioinfusion for external cephalic version on perinatal outcomes has not been examined. The evidence for whether amnioinfusion for this variety of indications has any impact on perinatal mortality outcomes has not been systematically compiled.

Literature-based evidence

The literature search identified 2 Cochrane reviews and 11 other interventional/observational studies, presented below by indication (Table 9).

### The risk factors of procedure-related complications after amniocentesis in twin pregnancies: a retrospective analysis [^7ac0b3ef]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we excluded pregnancies diagnosed with TTTs, patients with polyhydramnios, which is considered a potential risk, were not excluded. As is well known, TTTs, for which polyhydramnios is an important manifestation, is one of most serious complications with adverse perinatal outcome for monochorionic twin pregnancies. In our study, polyhydramios was a risk factor of procedure-related complications after amniocentesis in the monochorionic twin pregnancies. It means monochorionic twin pregnancy with polyhydramnios should be treated with caution. Notably, some studies have demonstrated that the degree of polyhydramnios is associated with an increased likelihood of preterm delivery, especially at < 34 weeks. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear.

Several risk factors for adverse outcomes have been associated with amniocentesis. A large cohort study focused on the fetal loss rate up to the 24th gestational week after amniocentesis in singleton pregnancy and determined that the risk factors were maternal age, vaginal bleeding during the current pregnancy, history of second-trimester termination of pregnancy, history of first-trimester abortions, and stained amniotic fluid. Compare to study in singleton pregnancy, only the hemorrhage during this pregnancy was the risk factor in the monochorionic twin group in our study. The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear. Interestingly, it is widely believed that the outcomes of ART pregnancies are less favorable than those of spontaneous pregnancies. However, a report has shown that the conception method did not influence the pregnancy loss rate after amniocentesis in twins, and our results were consistent with this finding.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^a9971798]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of fetal malformations at birth is around 2–3%. Overall, polyhydramnios occurs in 1–2% of pregnancies, but the causes of polyhydramnios remain unknown in the majority of cases. Polyhydramnios may be due to a congenital abnormality in 20% of cases, but in 60–70% of cases it is idiopathic, i.e. there is no identified cause of the increased amount of amniotic fluid.

Among the fetal malformations, amniotic fluid volume abnormalities may be associated with craniospinal, craniofacial, cardiac developmental, and other thoracic abnormalities, abdominal and abdominal wall disorders, urogenital disorders.

In the case of less than average amniotic fluid, oligohydramnios, the amount of amniotic fluid is below normal (less than 500 mL in the second and third trimesters). The possible causes of oligohydramnios are various and include: fetal abnormalities, premature rupture of the membranes, placental insufficiency, deteriorating fetal circulation, insufficient maternal fluid intake, starvation and smoking. More than average amniotic fluid, polyhydramnios, is considered to be the case when there is a larger amount of amniotic fluid. Between 26 and 38 weeks, the volume of amniotic fluid exceeds 1500 mL and is still above 1000 mL after the 38th week. It may be caused by an underlying maternal disease, a pregnancy-related condition (diabetes mellitus, diabetes gestationis), infection, fetal developmental abnormalities causing overproduction of amniotic fluid or impeding absorption or circulation, fetal circulatory abnormalities, twin pregnancies. The co-occurrence of fetal retardation and polyhydramnios may indicate chromosomal abnormalities and therefore cytogenetic testing is recommended. Most cases of mild polyhydramnios are idiopathic, and the two most common pathological causes of polyhydramnios include maternal diabetes mellitus and various fetal anomalies that may be associated with genetic syndromes. The role of maternal diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes in the development of polyhydramnios has been highlighted also by other authors. When polyhydramnios is associated with fetal macrosomia, the most common maternal etiology is inadequately controlled and managed diabetes mellitus. Untreated maternal diabetes mellitus puts the fetus at lifelong risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome, and will have a higher rate of caesarean Sects.

### Placental abruption after amnioreduction for polyhydramnios caused by chorioangioma [^5365968a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Placental chorioangioma is the most common type of a benign placental tumour that occurs in 1% of pregnancies. A large chorioangioma is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We present a case of placental abruption necessitating preterm delivery after multiple amnioreductions for polyhydramnios caused by a large chorioangioma. If antenatal diagnosis of a significant chorioangioma is made as the cause of polyhydramnios, caution should be taken when performing rapid amnioreductions.

### Pulmonary effects of prolonged oligohydramnios following mid-trimester rupture of the membranes – antenatal and postnatal management [^6a625734]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Mid-trimester, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) with prolonged oligohydramnios remains a challenge for both obstetricians and neonatologists. Although survival rates have improved, morbidity remains common particularly due to pulmonary insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension. The aetiology of abnormal lung development is unknown but may depend critically on pulmonary vascular development. Antenatal evaluation of at-risk foetuses by three-dimensional ultrasound and MRI is possible but the techniques need to be further assessed. Antenatal corticosteroids given in cases of PPROM reduce the incidence of neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis without increasing maternal or neonatal infection. The true risk-benefit ratio of antibiotics, tocolysis and strategies to normalise amniotic fluid volume remains less clear. There is no consensus regarding the optimal ventilation strategy to support infants with pulmonary insufficiency following PPROM, and further work is required to determine whether and which pulmonary vasodilators improve long-term outcome in these infants.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^185d2ed5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

No obvious relation was established between high body mass index (BMI above 25) and amniotic fluid disorders. Besides, more than half of the sample were obese 57.9, and 32.4% were overweight. Correspondingly, another research conducted in 2016 revealed that KSA is considered as the 15th most obese country with rate of 33.7% among population, thus no relation can be established. However, there were increased cases of poly and oligohydramnios and congenital anomalies in this study, this could be because majority of them are obese or overweight as maternal obesity is linked to pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes.

It has been noted that the occurrence of polyhydramnios was highly related to chronic disease of diabetes mellitus with P -value equal to 0.005. Similar value was shown with mothers who suffered from gestational diabetes mellitus, as outlined in one of the relevant articles that the most notable maternal risk factor behind polyhydramnios is diabetes mellitus which was also associated with the cases represented oligohydramnios. Hence, it can be said that past maternal history of diabetes mellitus is the main risk factor behind amniotic fluid disorders according to the research outcome. Other maternal chronic diseases showed no effect on amniotic fluid index although it might cause other risks on the fetus. Similarly, no association was found between hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and oligohydramnios, which could be due to the mild cases or treatment received by the mothers.

This study has important implications, as the findings may help medical experts in providing proper counselling regarding pregnancy related complications found among most of the Saudi women. It will further help medical experts to consider all the risk factors associated to the amniotic fluid disorders and its impact on maternal and fetal outcome. These findings may serve as highly useful in reducing the risks associated to the amniotic fluid disorders. The study was limited as it was a single center study. Also, the effects of treatment for chronic conditions of mothers and its impact on the amniotic fluid disorder was not studied due to the availability of limited data.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^f75528ac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, ultrasound screening and targeted ultrasound examinations have played the most important role in the detection of fetal malformations. Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging procedure in the world, it is extremely safe, and with the development of ultrasound systems, it has been associated with increasing imaging performance. According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios are the two most commonly detected ultrasound abnormalities during pregnancy.

The possible causes of poly- and oligohydramnios are discussed in several publications. Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios may be associated with fetal anatomical abnormalities, fetal chromosomal abnormalities. In a study spanning four years, Hentemann et al. investigated 140 pregnancies associated with various developmental abnormalities detected by ultrasound, the authors highlighted the importance of karyotyping from amniotic fluid in cases of detected developmental abnormalities and oligohydramnios. Kouamé et al. point out that when polyhydramnios is detected, particular care must be taken during ultrasound examination in order to detect any fetal abnormalities that may be present.

### Idiopathic polyhydramnios: severity and perinatal morbidity [^b56e161a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

ObjectiveTo estimate the association between the severity of idiopathic polyhydramnios and adverse outcomes. Study DesignRetrospective cohort study of deliveries at one hospital from 2000 to 2012 with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) measurement ≥ 24+0 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies complicated by diabetes, multiples, or fetal anomalies were excluded. Exposure was the degree of polyhydramnios: normal (AFI 5–24 cm), mild (≥ 24–30 cm), and moderate-severe (> 30 cm). Primary outcomes were perinatal mortality, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and postpartum hemorrhage. ResultsThere were 10,536 pregnancies: 10,188 with a normal AFI, 274 mild (78.74%), and 74 moderate-severe polyhydramnios (21.26%). Adverse outcomes were increased with idiopathic polyhydramnios: NICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.77–4.99), postpartum hemorrhage (AOR 15.81, 95% CI 7.82–31.96), macrosomia (AOR 3.41, 95% CI 2.61–4.47), low 5-minute Apgar score (AOR 2.60, 95% CI 1.57–4.30), and cesarean (AOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.74–2.69). There were increasing odds of macrosomia (mild: AOR 3.19, 95% CI 2.36–4.32; moderate-severe: AOR 4.44, 95% CI 2.53–7.79) and low 5-minute Apgar score (mild: AOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.23–4.08; moderate-severe: AOR 3.93, 95% CI 1.62–9.55) with increasing severity of polyhydramnios. ConclusionIdiopathic polyhydramnios is independently associated with increased risks of morbidity. There appears to be a dose-response relationship for neonatal macrosomia and low 5-minute Apgar score risks.

### Idiopathic polyhydramnios and neonatal morbidity at term [^234386af]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Idiopathic polyhydramnios is among the most common etiologies of polyhydramnios. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the relationship between polyhydramnios and neonatal morbidity. We investigated the association between pregnancies with and without idiopathic polyhydramnios and neonatal morbidity at term.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of singleton, term (i.e., ≥ 37 0/7 weeks) pregnancies from 2014 to 2018. Pregnancies complicated by fetal anomalies, pregestational diabetes, and multifetal gestation were excluded. Pregnancies complicated by idiopathic polyhydramnios were defined by the deepest vertical pocket (DVP) ≥ 8cm or amniotic fluid index (AFI) ≥ 24cm after 20 weeks' gestation and were compared with women without polyhydramnios at time of delivery. These groups were matched 1:2 by gestational age within 7 days at delivery and maternal race. The primary outcome was a composite neonatal morbidity (neonatal death, respiratory morbidity, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, therapeutic hypothermia, seizures, and umbilical artery pH < 7.10). Outcomes were compared between pregnancies with and without idiopathic polyhydramnios. Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios were estimated using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Idiopathic polyhydramnios was diagnosed in 192 pregnancies and were matched to 384 pregnancies without polyhydramnios. After adjustment for obesity, women with pregnancies complicated by idiopathic polyhydramnios had an increased risk of composite neonatal morbidity 21.4 versus 5.5% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3–6.7). Term neonatal respiratory morbidity was the primary driver 20.3 versus 4.2%, (aRR = 4.8, 95% CI: 2.7–8.7) and included higher use of continuous positive airway pressure 19.8 versus 3.4%, p < 0.01 and the need for supplemental oxygen at > 12hours of newborn life 6.8 versus 1.8%, p < 0.01.

Conclusion

Idiopathic polyhydramnios is associated with term neonatal respiratory morbidity at delivery and during the subsequent hours of newborn life, compared with pregnancies without idiopathic polyhydramnios. Further studies are needed to minimize neonatal morbidity at term.

Key Points

· Idiopathic polyhydramnios is associated with increased risk of neonatal morbidity at term. · Increasing idiopathic polyhydramnios severity was associated with a trend toward worsening morbidity at term. · Idiopathic polyhydramnios at term requires respiratory support at delivery and during neonatal care.

### Transabdominal amnioinfusion for improving fetal outcomes after oligohydramnios secondary to preterm prelabour rupture of membranes before 26 weeks [^d77420da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 26 weeks can delay lung development and can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, as a result of oligohydramnios. Restoring the amniotic fluid volume by transabdominal amnioinfusion might prevent abnormal lung development and might have a protective effect for neurological complications, fetal deformities and neonatal sepsis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of transabdominal amnioinfusion in improving perinatal outcome in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing transabdominal amnioinfusion with no transabdominal amnioinfusion. Cluster- or quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. In cases where only an abstract was available, we attempted to find the full articles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified.

Main Results

There are no included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to evaluate the use of transabdominal amnioinfusion in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks for improving perinatal outcome. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed. Two randomised controlled trials are ongoing but final data have not yet been published.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^bb66e6fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Delivery Complications and Fetal/Neonatal Outcomes by Polyhydramnios

a Fetal/Neonatal outcomes are calculated at the maternal level if at least one fetus/neonate has the outcome

b Odds Ratio from a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for at least one polyhydramnios finding, DRC/Other, Age, Parity and Previous LB with general estimating equations to control for cluster level effects

c Estimate from a multivariable regression model adjusting for at least one polyhydramnios finding, DRC/Other, Age, Parity and Previous LB with general estimating equations to control for cluster level effects

In a multivariable regression model, adjusting for age, parity, previous live birth and controlling for cluster level effects, the odds ratio for neonatal death in pregnancies that were complicated by polyhydramnios was 2.43 (1.15, 5.13), (Table 4). Neonatal mortality rates were higher in the DRC when polyhydramnios was present (23/1,000 vs 18/1,000). The odds of stillbirth given polyhdramnios was 1.29 (0.78, 2.12). The incidence of preterm birth was not different among pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios compared to those without polyhydramnios (11% vs 13%), and the odds ratio was not significant when adjusted for the previous variables.

Polyhydramnios was associated with a higher mean birthweight at delivery (3082 g vs 2979 g), although this was not significant in the final model. In the DRC, among pregnancies affected by polyhydramnios, a lower proportion of infants were born with low birth weight (7 vs 11%), (Table 4).

### Neonatal survival after serial amnioinfusions for bilateral renal agenesis… [^a5e2f7c0]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03101891 Bilateral renal agenesis is the most severe congenital anomaly of the fetal urinary tract, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 3000 births. With this condition, fetal anuria leads to absence of amniotic fluid by the second trimester, when placental transudate is no longer sufficient to sustain amniotic fluid volume. 1Quiz Ref ID This early-onset anhydramnios causes depressurization of the fetal airways, impairing pulmonary development and resulting in uniformly lethal pulmonary hypoplasia at birth.
2. Maternal pregnancy complications including PPROM and preterm labor were used to assess the safety and feasibility of the intervention. Neonatal/infant secondary outcomes included survival to hospital discharge receiving long-term dialysis and survival to kidney transplant.

Exploratory outcomes included respiratory and dialysis support at 30, 60, and 90 days of life and neonatal survival at 30, 60, and 90 days of life, at hospital discharge, and at transplant. No serious maternal adverse events occurred beyond hospitalization or needing to stop the intervention due to pregnancy complications. Maternal and pregnancy complications that were related to amnioinfusions included PPROM, chorioamniotic membrane separation, and vaginal bleeding. Table 3 summarizes the postnatal course, complications, and cause of death in infants with bilateral renal agenesis. All infants who had long-term dialysis access placed had peritoneal dialysis catheters placed, but multiple modes of kidney replacement therapy were listed for many.

Reasons for exposure to multiple dialysis modes include infant size too small or clinical status too unstable to accommodate peritoneal dialysis catheter placement soon after birth, or peritoneal dialysis catheter malfunction. Available autopsy reports are included in Table 3. However, survival beyond 14 days was lower, with only 35% of live-born infants surviving to hospital discharge receiving long-term dialysis, and none had undergone kidney transplant at the time of this report. Quiz Ref ID Although the results demonstrate the efficacy of the intervention to allow lung development, a significant degree of uncertainty remains regarding the longer-term burden of morbidity and mortality in surviving neonates. Notable maternal complications included PPROM and preterm delivery. All pregnancies in the intervention group and 2 of 3 in the expectant management group delivered at less than 37 weeks' gestation. There were no severe maternal obstetric complications.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^2ae98732]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study data from 2,622 fetuses with structural malformations were processed, of which 1,256 resulted in a delivery. Amniotic fluid volume abnormalities were most frequently detected in urogenital, abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies. In urogenital anomalies, oligohydramnios occurred in most cases, 34.72%, while polyhydramnios occurred in 20.14%. In abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in most cases, 31.44%, while oligohydramnios occurred in 12.38%. In craniospinal anomalies, polyhydramnios was detected in most cases, 22.08%, and oligohydramnios in 9.06%. In thoracic and pulmonary anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 19.23%, and oligohydramnios occurred in 15.38%. In the case of limb anomalies and ossification disorders, polyhydramnios occurred in 21.96% and oligohydramnios in 11.76%. In the case of craniofacial anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 12.39% of fetuses and oligohydramnios in 8.72% during pregnancy. In the case of cardiovascular anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 14.67% and oligohydramnios in 7.46%.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^bef627cb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The amniotic fluid is a protective liquid present in the amniotic sac. Two types of amniotic fluid disorders have been identified. First refers to polyhydramnios, which is an immoderate volume of amniotic fluid with an Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) greater than 24 cm. Second includes oligohydramnios, which refers to decreased AFI i.e. less than 5 cm. This study aims to; a) identify the maternal risk factors associated with amniotic fluid disorders, b) assess the effect of amniotic fluid disorders on maternal and fetal outcome c) examine the mode of delivery in pregnancy complicated with amniotic fluid disorders.

Methods

A comparative retrospective cohort study design is followed. Sample of 497 pregnant women who received care at King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz University Hospital (KAAUH) between January 2017 to October 2019 was included. Data were collected from electronic medical reports, and was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Association of qualitative variables was conducted by Chi-square test, where p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Among the collected data, 2.8% of the cases had polyhydramnios and 11.7% patients had oligohydramnios. One case of still born was identified. A statically significant association was found between polyhydramnios and late term deliveries (P = 0.005) and cesarean section (CS) rates (P = 0.008). The rate of term deliveries was equal in normal AFI and oligohydramnios group (P = 0.005). Oligohydramnios was mostly associated with vaginal deliveries (P = 0.008). Oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios were found to be associated with diabetes mellitus patients (P = 0.005), and polyhydramnios with gestational diabetes patients (P = 0.052). Other maternal chronic diseases showed no effect on amniotic fluid index, although it might cause other risks on the fetus.

Conclusion

Diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes are the most important maternal risk factors that can cause amniotic fluid disorders. Maternal and fetal outcome data showed that oligohydramnios associated with gestational age at term and low neonatal birth weight with high rates of vaginal deliveries, while polyhydramnios associated with gestational age at late term and high birth weight with higher rates of CS.

### Induction of labor in term pregnancies with isolated polyhydramnios: is it beneficial or harmful? [^b71e5ea5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in term pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios between women who had induction of labor (IOB) versus women who had expectant management.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective study included term pregnancies complicated by isolated polyhydramnios. Patients who underwent IOB were compared with those who had expectant management. The primary outcome was defined as a composite adverse maternal outcome, and secondary outcomes were various maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. Univariate analyses were followed by multivariate logistic regression.

Results

A total of 865 pregnancies with term isolated polyhydramnios were included: 169 patients underwent IOB (19.5%), while 696 had expectant management and developed spontaneous onset of labor (80.5%). Women who underwent IOB had significantly higher rates of composite adverse maternal outcome (23.1% vs 9.8%, P < 0.01), prolonged hospital stay, perineal tear grade 3/4, intrapartum cesarean, postpartum hemorrhage, blood products transfusion, and neonatal asphyxia compared with expectant management. While the perinatal fetal death rate was similar between the groups (0.6% vs 0.6%, P = 0.98), the timing of the loss was different. Four women in the expectant management group had a stillbirth, while in the induction group one case of intrapartum fetal death occurred due to uterine rupture. Multivariate analyses revealed that IOB was associated with a higher rate of composite adverse maternal outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.28–3.83]; P < 0.01).

Conclusion

IOB in women with term isolated polyhydramnios is associated with higher rates of adverse maternal outcomes in comparison to expectant management. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for the management of isolated polyhydramnios at term.

### Successful multigravid pregnancy in a 42-year-old patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and a review of the literature [^5c24ec33]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The other complications that occurred may have been attributed to the PD therapy itself. Although peritonitis remains a risk, it can still be treated successfully in pregnancy.

Despite multiple challenges faced by ESRD women on dialysis, continuous improvement in maternal–fetal care, dialysis efficiency, frequency and supportive therapy provided by nephrologist and obstetrician has paved the way towards achieving previously inaccessible targets.

Both, PD and HD are feasible modes of renal replacement therapy for pregnant CKD patients. While HD enables precise fluid control, it however may lead to marked hemodynamic instability and blood pressure fluctuations that can impair placental blood flow. PD, on the other hand provides a more gentle and continuous mode of dialysis, with less fluctuations in maternal intravascular volumes. According to Okundaye et al. the occurrence of pregnancy is more common in women on HD rather than those on PD (2.4% versus 1.1%). Once conceived however, pregnant chronic dialysis women have better hope for a successful pregnancy while on PD. The reasons include a higher residual renal function, more stable metabolic milieu and the absence of intradialytic hypotension that could potentially cause intrauterine growth retardation and fetal death. Nakabayashi conducted a survey in a Japanese dialysis unit where there were 15 pregnancies conceived on dialysis. Fetal survival was associated with the initiation of dialysis of less than 6 years of duration, residual urine production of equal or more than 50 mL per day, a gestational age of at least 33 weeks and birth weight of greater than median of 1782 grams. All patients who underwent more than 9 years of dialysis did not have a surviving infant.

Since PD delivery is very much dependant on the PD catheter, uterine enlargement during pregnancy may alter the catheter position and prescribed therapy efficiency. Respectable residual renal function greatly lessens the impact of poor solute and water clearance due to mechanical causes. The continuous removal of toxic waste and the resulting steady blood toxin levels help to maintain a stable intrauterine metabolic milieu, thus reducing the risk of developing polyhydramnios. Although the pathophysiology of polyhydramnios in ESRD patients is unknown, it seems that having a higher urea level before a HD session may induce solute diuresis by the normal fetal kidneys, thus increasing amniotic fluid production. An alternative or additional explanation may be that frequent and relatively rapid removal of solutes during HD in patients with decreased oncotic pressure may shift free water into the amniotic cavity. Once polyhydramnios develope, it increases the risk of premature labor.

Regarding patient education for premature rupture of membranes, more specifically with respect to general counseling, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider including amniotic fluid volume at the time of rupture in counseling patients and families with previable PPROM, as anhydramnios and oligohydramnios are more frequently associated with pregnancy loss and pulmonary hypoplasia compared with normal amniotic fluid volumes.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^b669583d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Medical records of 597 patients were reviewed in this study, among them 453 (91.1%) were Saudis, around 388 (78%) were ≤ 35 years old. About 288 (57.9%) of the maternal BMI scores were ≥ 30. Around 124 (24.9%) of the patients were primigravida, however 373 (75.1%) of them were multigravida. Chronic medical illnesses were reported around 74 (14.8%). These patients were also getting adequate treatment for their chronic diseases, specifically in cases when there's high risk of pregnancy or mother's health being affected. Majority of the cases i.e. 425 (85.5%) had normal amniotic fluid index (AFI). However, 14 (2.8%) had polyhydramnios, and 58 (11.7%) had oligohydramnios (Table 1).

The results (Table 2) showed that almost half of the neonate were boys 246 (49.5%), and the other half were girls 251 (50.5%). Only one case still born was identified 0.2%, while 496 (99.8%) were born alive. Majority of the patients were delivered at term 424 (85.3%), whereas, other 31 (6.2%) and 42 (8.5%) had a preterm and late term delivery respectively. The APGAR score of < 7 at 1 min and 5 mins interval was found in 3 and 2 children respectively. About 405 (81.6%) of them were admitted to nursery and the rest 91 (18.3%) were admitted to NICU. While, the congenital anomalies were diagnosed in 31(6.3%) of neonates.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^1ee646ee]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Amniotic Fluid Volume (AFV) reflects the state of pregnancy and possible adverse complications and outcome, due to which assessment of AFV has been part of every second and third trimester ultrasound examination. There are three standard methods for AFV assessment, first includes qualitative and other two are semiquantitative. Qualitative assessment is the first step in which the ultrasonographer subjectively report if the pregnancy is normal, oligo or polyhydramnios. With experienced examiners, the quality of the test can be equal to the semiquantitative tests [single deepest pocket (SDP), amniotic fluid index (AFI)] which are performed when there is an abnormality found in the qualitative test, specifically among patients with increased risk of pregnancy complications and patients in third trimester. Both SDP and AFI are good indicators for normal AFV. However, AFI overly diagnose oligohydramnios, and SDP overly diagnose polyhydramnios.

Due to the observed increase in cases of poly and oligohydramnios, this study estimated the effect of amniotic fluid disorders on prenatal outcome and reassess the reasons associated with it in Saudi Arabia. Besides, the relationship between maternal demographics and its effect on amniotic fluid disorders in Saudi Arabia are further observed.

Specific objectives

To identify the maternal risk factors associated with amniotic fluid disorders.
To assess the effect of amniotic fluid disorders on maternal and fetal outcome.
To identify the mode of delivery in pregnancy complicated with amniotic fluid disorders.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^28f53c81]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Association between intrauterine detectability of fetal abnormalities and amniotic fluid volume

Changes in amniotic fluid volume have been shown to affect the detectability of fetal anatomical abnormalities. Ultrasound screenings are also affected by the difficulty of the examination.

In the case of polyhydramnios, the fetus, and thus the fetal anatomical abnormalities, are easier to visualize during ultrasound examination, whereas in the case of oligohydramnios, ultrasound examination is more difficult. This explains why we have seen an upward trend in the detection of anatomical abnormalities in all organ groups in the case of polyhydramnios. Thus, a higher proportion of fetal anatomical abnormalities were detected with greater efficiency when associated with polyhydramnios. The difference was significant for craniofacial abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities, and thoracic abnormalities, with an increase in the rate of in utero detection from 32.57 to 51.85% for craniofacial abnormalities, from 62.1 to 79.69% for cardiovascular abnormalities, and from 56.41 to 74.19% for thoracic abnormalities.

Changes in amniotic fluid volume alone may also alert to an underlying fetal abnormality. It is often observed that the abnormality in amniotic fluid volume is the reason for sending the expectant mother for our genetic counselling, and that subsequent ultrasound scans and fetal echocardiography reveal additional fetal anatomical abnormalities.

Oligohydramnios, although it can raise awareness of fetal abnormalities, can also complicate ultrasound examination, which explains why we saw a non-significant upward trend in the detection of abnormalities only in cardiovascular, urogenital, limb and ossification disorders and disorders with subcutaneous oedema, and a downward trend in the detection of all other organ systems. This decreasing trend was significant in all cases, i.e. craniospinal, craniofacial, thoracic, abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies.

### Serial third-trimester ultrasonography compared with routine care in uncomplicated pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial [^4822df31]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Among uncomplicated pregnancies, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations identified significantly more cases with a composite of fetal growth or amniotic fluid abnormalities (27%) than did routine fundal height measurements (8%).

Methods

Women without complications between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation were randomized (NCT0270299) to either routine care (control arm) or ultrasound examination every 4 weeks (intervention arm). The primary outcome was a composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth: oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; fetal growth restriction; or large for gestational age. The secondary outcome was the presence of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity among the two groups. A total of 206 participants was needed to have 80% power to detect an increase in the primary composite outcome from 10% in control to 25% in the intervention group (baseline rate 10%; two-tailed; α = 0.05; loss to follow-up 5%). All women were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Fisher exact, χ tests, or two-sample t tests were used to assess group differences.

Results

From July 11, 2016, to May 24, 2017, 852 women were screened for eligibility and 206 were randomized as follows: 102 in routine care and 104 in serial ultrasound examinations. The two groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The primary composite outcome was significantly higher among women who were in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group (27% vs 8%; relative risk 3.43, 95% CI 1.64–7.17); five women (95% CI 3–11) were needed to identify at least one of the composite ultrasound abnormalities. Although we were underpowered to detect a significant difference, the following secondary endpoints occurred with similar frequency in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group: induction resulting from abnormal ultrasound examination findings (14% vs 6%), cesarean delivery in labor (5% vs 6%), and prespecified composite maternal morbidity (9% in both groups) and composite neonatal morbidity (1% vs 4%).

Conclusion

Among uncomplicated pregnancies between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations were significantly more likely to identify abnormalities of fetal growth or amniotic fluid than measurements of fundal height and indicated ultrasound examination. No differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted, although we were underpowered for these endpoints.

### Idiopathic polyhydramnios and postnatal outcomes of children: the role of exome sequencing [^d92d63b0]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of our study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of children born from a pregnancy complicated by idiopathic polyhydramnios. The secondary objective was to investigate factors associated with adverse outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study in two prenatal diagnosis centers between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2020. Inclusion criteria were pregnancies with a diagnosis of idiopathic polyhydramnios, defined by a deepest pocket greater than 8 cm, no detectable abnormality at ultrasound and a negative amniotic fluid assessment including karyotype, chromosomal microarray, biochemical assays (electrolytes and digestive enzymes), and viruses (parvovirus B19 and cytomegalovirus). One-year outcomes of these children were collected. The primary endpoint was adverse postnatal outcome, defined by at least one of the following criteria: stillbirth, neonatal death, or serious and incurable condition diagnosed in the first year of life.

Results

Of the 245 women referred for isolated polyhydramnios, 73 were diagnosed with idiopathic polyhydramnios after prenatal investigations. The mean age at follow-up of children was 28 months (95% CI 20–36). An adverse outcome occurred in 25% of cases (18/73), with one stillbirth, two neonatal deaths, and 15 severe conditions diagnosed postnatally, including a rate of monogenic disorders of 8.2% (6/73). Pediatric follow-up was normal for 75% of the children (55/73), including a rate of 9% (5/55) of curable conditions. Repeated amnioreduction was independently associated with an adverse outcome.

Conclusion

Pregnant women with polyhydramnios should be informed of the increased risk of 25% of perinatal mortality and serious conditions diagnosed after birth.

### Ketoprofen [^40a0efc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal

impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment,

although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID

initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation.

Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and

delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function,

invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.

If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit

ketoprofen capsules use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider

ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if ketoprofen capsules treatment extends beyond 48

hours. Discontinue ketoprofen capsules if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to

clinical practice [see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].

### Transient idiopathic polyhydramnios: maternal and perinatal outcomes: maternal and perinatal outcomes [^07ac513f]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies with transient and persistent idiopathic polyhydramnios to those with normal amniotic fluid volume.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included subjects delivering a singleton pregnancy between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2020, with sonography ≥ 26weeks' gestation demonstrating transient or persistent idiopathic polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index [AFI] ≥ 24.0cm) or normal AFI (referent group). The primary maternal outcome was a composite of spontaneous preterm delivery < 37weeks, cesarean delivery for malpresentation, abnormal labor progress, or nonreassuring fetal status, operative vaginal delivery, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and umbilical cord prolapse. The primary perinatal outcome was a composite of birthweight > 4500g, fetal or neonatal death, 5-minute Apgar score < 7, and neonatal intensive care unit admission for > 24 hours.

Results

Patients with transient polyhydramnios (n = 259) exhibited maternal outcomes similar to those of the referent group (n = 435) but had significantly increased odds for the primary perinatal outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.53; P = 0.008) and for birthweight ≥ 4500g (OR 8.70, 95% CI 1.89–40.0; P = 0.005). Persistent polyhydramnios (n = 176) was significantly associated with both the primary maternal (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.27–2.95, P = 0.002) and primary perinatal outcome (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.40–3.30; P < .001), and individually with cesarean delivery for abnormal labor (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.55–6.68; P = 0.002) and birthweight ≥ 4500g (OR 8.97, 95% CI 1.84–43.6; P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Transient idiopathic polyhydramnios does not impact maternal outcomes but is associated with increased odds of newborn birthweight > 4500g. Persistent polyhydramnios is associated with both adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^99a3690f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In low-resource settings, paediatric facilities for the management of meconium aspiration syndrome are scarce and interventions to prevent meconium aspiration are needed. Amnioinfusion, as one preventive option, is comparatively more feasible than management of meconium aspiration syndrome in settings with limited intrapartum facilities. Pooled data from the Hofmeyr meta-analysis support the use of amnioinfusion for meconium stained amniotic fluid to reduce the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome, with a trend toward reduced perinatal mortality. However, the only large RCT on this subject by Fraser et al, performed after the Cochrane review, found no statistically significant impact on either meconium aspiration syndrome or perinatal mortality, suggesting the possibility of small study bias (an overrepresentation of published small trials favouring a treatment effect) in the Cochrane review.

For other antepartum and intrapartum indications for amnioinfusion, including PROM, oligohydramnios with intact membranes, alleviation of umbilical cord compression, and prevention of infection after membrane rupture, the available evidence is too limited to formulate recommendations on the use of amnioinfusion. Some small studies show promising differentials in mortality and other outcomes between intervention and control groups, but larger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine the impact of amnioinfusion on these outcomes.

Further studies of amnioinfusion are needed to confirm the obstetric indications and administration techniques by which amnioinfusion might reduce perinatal mortality. When performing amnioinfusion in low-resource settings, providers should remain vigilant about the risk of infection if aseptic conditions are not maintained.

### Association of isolated polyhydramnios at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation and pregnancy outcome [^c6d6c596]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate pregnancy outcome among women with isolated polyhydramnios at admission for labor at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study at a tertiary medical center between 2007 and 2012. Isolated polyhydramnios was defined as amniotic fluid index (AFI) greater than 25 cm at admission in the absence of gestational or pregestational diabetes mellitus or fetal structural or chromosomal anomalies. Women with isolated polyhydramnios were compared with women with a normal AFI (5–25 cm).

Results

Overall, 31,376 women were eligible for analysis, of whom 215 (0.7%) had isolated polyhydramnios and 31,161 normal AFI. Women with isolated polyhydramnios had higher rates of labor induction (7.9% compared with 4.8%, P = 0.04) and cesarean delivery (12.1% compared with 5.1%, P < .001). They also had higher rates of placental abruption (0.9% compared with 0.2%, P = 0.02), abnormal or intermediate fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings (7.0% compared with 3.2%, P = 0.002), and prolonged first stage of delivery (6.0% compared with 1.4%, P < .001). Isolated polyhydramnios was also associated with higher rates of shoulder dystocia (1.9% compared with 0.3%, P < .001) and respiratory distress syndrome (0.5% compared with 0.03%, P = 0.001). On a multiple logistic regression model, isolated polyhydramnios was an independent risk factor for labor induction (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–2.8), cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7–4.0), prolonged first stage of delivery (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.97–6.7), abnormal or intermediate FHR tracings (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6–4.5), placental abruption (adjusted OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.00–35.4), shoulder dystocia (adjusted OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.2–9.7), and respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 38.9, 95% CI 4.6–332.6). Mild isolated polyhydramnios (AFI 25.1–30.0) was independently associated with cesarean delivery, prolonged first stage of delivery, placental abruption, abnormal or intermediate FHR tracings, and shoulder dystocia.

Conclusion

Isolated polyhydramnios at admission for labor at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.

### Outcomes from polyhydramnios with normal ultrasound [^bce2081c]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the short- and long-term outcomes of children from pregnancies complicated with polyhydramnios, defined as amniotic fluid index (AFI) > 24 cm, and with a normal detailed ultrasound examination.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined 134 children aged 4 to 9 years with polyhydramnios and normal detailed ultrasound examination during pregnancy compared with 268 controls with normal AFI and normal detailed ultrasound examination matched for maternal age, year of delivery, gestational week at delivery, and presence or absence of diabetes. The primary outcome was the rate of malformations diagnosed postnatally. Additional outcomes were obstetrics outcomes, genetic syndromes, and neurodevelopment.

Results

Polyhydramnios was associated with increased risk for cesarean delivery (CD) and birth weight > 90th percentile. This elevation in CD was attributed to increased rate of elective CD due to suspected macrosomia. Polyhydramnios was associated with increased risk for congenital malformations (n = 25 [19%] compared with 27 [10%], respectively; P = 0.016) without a statistically significant increase in the rate of major malformations (11 [8%] vs. 10 [4%]; P = 0.057). Genetic syndromes were more prevalent in the polyhydramnios group (5 [3.7%] vs. 2 [0.75%]; P = 0.043), as were neurologic disorders and developmental delay (9.7% vs. 3%; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Despite a normal detailed ultrasound examination, polyhydramnios is associated with increased rate of fetal malformations, genetic syndromes, neurologic disorders, and developmental delay, which may be diagnosed only after birth.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^77b75f83]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 305 (1.6%) cases of polyhydramnios among 18,640 women. The incidence of polyhydramnios ranged from 0.3% in Guatemala to 10% in DRC (Table 1). Of the women identified with polyhydramnios, 229 (75%) were from the DRC. Compared to women without polyhydramnios, women with polyhydramnios were more often older than 35 years (10% vs 7%, p < 0.001), had more than 2 previous live births (71% vs 52%, p < 0.001), had a previous live birth (98% vs 94%, < 0.001) and lower mean maternal weight (55.8 kg vs 56.5 kg, p = 0.005), Table 2. These trends persisted when the DRC data were evaluated separately from the other sites, with the exception of mean maternal weight. In the DRC, the mean maternal weight was higher among the women with polyhydramnios compared to the women without polyhydramnios (54.5 kg vs 53.5 kg). In a multivariable model evaluating maternal characteristics and polyhydramnios, evaluating DRC site vs. other sites, age, parity, previous live birth, and using GEE to control for cluster level effects, the DRC had an odds ratio of 22.6 (14.87, 34.35), (Table 3).

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^7ec744e4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The above results were based on the data obtained from the electronic medical records of 597 patients admitted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at KAAUH, during January 2017 to October 2019. According to the results, 14.8% of the sample had different chronic medical illness, where 75.1% were multigravida. Besides, 14 (2.8%) of the sample were diagnosed as polyhydramnios and 58 (11.7%) of the cases were oligohydramnios based on their amniotic fluid index. Regarding the mode of delivery, 10 (71.4%) of polyhydramnios cases required caesarean section, and almost all cases of abnormal amniotic fluids showed no significant association with congenital malformation. The most significant maternal risk factors associated with amniotic fluid disorders include diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes.

Majority of the mothers had live born neonates, and only single case (0.2%) of stillbirth was documented with no obvious reason due to the lack of data. Similarly, a study conducted at King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital in Jeddah showed that 5356 out of 5432 patients enrolled in the study had liveborn neonates, which represented 98.6%, this difference in percentage might be due to the large sample size enrolled in their study in comparison to the enrolled sample used in this research. More than 20% neonates of total deliveries got admitted in NICU due to various medical reasons such as lower APGAR score or congenital anomalies, out of which 18.3% of 496 liveborn neonates were admitted to NICU that were included in this study. Here, 6.2% of total babies were diagnosed with congenital anomalies, 22.6% of them were cardiovascular, while 54.8% were renal. Although, no relation was established with amniotic fluid disorders, the percentage is significantly higher compared to the previous study where 160 out of 5432 (2.9%) babies were diagnosed with congenital malformations.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^82f1a113]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding polyhydramnios, the Association Factor (AF) we developed showed a very high value for craniospinal and abdominal and abdominal wall abnormalities (AF ≥ 5), high AF for cardiovascular abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, limb abnormalities and ossification disorders (2.5 ≤ AF < 5), while AF was moderate for craniofacial, thoracic and fetal abnormalities with subcutaneous oedema. Regarding oligohydramnios, AF showed a very high value for urogenital abnormalities (AF ≥ 5). The value was moderate for craniospinal, craniofacial, cardiovascular, other thoracic, abdominal and abdominal wall abnormalities, and limb abnormalities and ossification disorders (0.5 ≤ AF < 2.5).

Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios can have an impact on perinatal outcome. Aviram et al. reported that, comparing normal and gravid women with AFI greater than 20 cm after 34 weeks of gestation, cases with polyhydramnios had a higher rate of placental abruption and abnormal fetal heart rate. Compared to normal pregnancies, polyhydramnios may be associated with higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and neonatal respiratory distress. In addition to the increased justification for cesarean section and the risk of placental abruption, other authors have also highlighted the importance of increased observation, as polyhydramnios may lead to more frequent intrauterine death and prolonged dilation (first stage of labour). Other authors point to more frequent postpartum respiratory morbidity in polyhydramnios. In association with polyhydramnios, Walter et al. measured fetal growth restriction (FGR) in 4.6% of fetuses. Burwick et al. studied cases of fetal hydrops and measured increased volume of amniotic fluid in 39.8%. Of the 337 cases of hydrops, an increased rate of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and neonatal death was observed.

### Polyhydramnios or excessive fetal growth are markers for abnormal perinatal outcome in euglycemic pregnancies [^11a0215b]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to investigate the perinatal outcome of fetuses with polyhydramnios and/or accelerated growth among women with a normal oral glucose challenge test (oGCT).

Methods

Singleton, nonanomalous pregnancies with an oGCT(< 130 mg/dL) at 24 to 28 weeks, who subsequently demonstrate polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index > 24 cm or maximum vertical pocket > 8 cm) and/or accelerated growth (abdominal circumference > 95th percentile) on two-third trimester examinations were studied. Maternal demographics, delivery, and neonatal information were recorded. Cases were compared with a reference group (normal oGCT with neither abnormal third-trimester growth nor polyhydramnios).

Results

A total of 282 pregnancies were in the study group, and 663 were in the reference group. Deliveries in the study group were at a higher risk for birth weight (BW)% > 90%, standard deviation, and postpartum hemorrhage when compared with the reference group (adjusted odds ratio: 2.3–5.6). Pregnancies complicated by both polyhydramnios and accelerated fetal growth were significantly more likely to result in a BW% > 90% (odds ratio [OR]: 18.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.9–38.6) and PPH (OR: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.4–7.6).

Conclusion

Pregnancies with normal oGCT that develop polyhydramnios and accelerated growth are at higher risk for maternal and neonatal complications. Isolated polyhydramnios without accelerated growth increases the risk for delivery complications but not neonatal morbidity.

Polyhydramnios was associated with increased risk for congenital malformations without a statistically significant increase in the rate of major malformations. Genetic syndromes were more prevalent in the polyhydramnios group, as were neurologic disorders and developmental delay. Despite a normal detailed ultrasound examination, polyhydramnios is associated with increased rate of fetal malformations, genetic syndromes, neurologic disorders, and developmental delay, which may be diagnosed only after birth.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^11f96a0a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Association of fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios

In the case of anatomical structural abnormalities of various organ systems, several publications have described that it is more often associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, but specific percentages are rarely included in the literature. In the case of craniospinal anomalies, exencephaly/anencephaly, which can be classified as neural tube defects based on literature data, is often associated with polyhydramnios. In our own material, we found polyhydramnios in 22.08% of craniospinal anomalies. In the case of craniofacial anomalies, cleft lip and palate can lead to an increase in the amount of amniotic fluid due to difficulty swallowing. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 12.39% of all craniofacial anomalies. Cardiovascular disorders are often associated with polyhydramnios according to the literature. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 14.67% of cases of heart and great vessel disorders. In the case of thoracic and pulmonary disorders, congenital pulmonary airway malformation can lead to polyhydramnios if the lesion dislocates the mediastinal structures and causes compression of the oesophagus, thereby making swallowing and circulation of amniotic fluid difficult. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 19.23% of cases of thoracic and pulmonary disorders, and oligohydramnios occurred in 15.38%. Among abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, according to the literature, in addition to oesophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and other small intestinal atresia are often associated with polyhydramnios. Among abdominal wall anomalies, gastroschisis is often associated with polyhydramnios. In all abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 31.44% of cases, and oligohydramnios occurred in 12.38%. Urogenital anomalies may be associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, and may affect the development of other organs. In all urogenital anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 20.14% of cases, and oligohydramnios occurred in 34.72%. Among limb anomalies and ossification disorders, Almeida et al. reported an exceptionally high rate of polyhydramnios (38.9%) in skeletal system anomalies. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 21.95% of all limb anomalies and ossification disorders, and oligohydramnios in 11.76%.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^4a3aacd8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

To determine the maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios a priori, we built a regression model. To evaluate the maternal characteristics, we built individual logistic models for each characteristic and the finding of polyhydramnios with GEE to control for cluster level effects, and DRC/other site and the characteristic included as explanatory variables. We then built a multivariable logistic model for polyhydramnios and all maternal characteristics that had an association with polyhydramnios (p < 0.10) as explanatory models, using GEE extensions. We excluded maternal weight from this model due to 16% missing values from Kenya and measurement variability across multiple different time points in gestation across sites. The final model included the following maternal characteristics: maternal age, parity, and previous live birth. Due to small number of cases and to avoid multiple testing, we did not analyze maternal characterisitics in each of the five LMICs separately.

We then determined the risk of selected outcomes adjusting for polyhydramnios, DRC/other site and the maternal characteristics evaluated in the previous multivariable model. For binomial outcomes, we created a multivariable logistic model with GEE extensions to control for cluster level effects, DRC/other site, maternal characteristics and polyhydramnios. We report the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, we created a regression model with GEE extensions to control for cluster level effects, DRC/other site, maternal characteristics and polyhydramnios. For these models, we report the estimates and 95% confidence intervals. We considered p < 0.05 significant, beta 0.80. All analyses were performed at the Data Coordinating Center at RTI International (Durham, NC) using SAS, Inc. version 9.4.

At each site, institutional review boards or ethics committees approved the primary study. All women provided written informed consent before the start of the study. A data monitoring committee, appointed by the NICHD oversaw and reviewed the study annually. This study was supported by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and by a grant from GE Healthcare.

### Treatments during pregnancy targeting ERBB2 and outcomes of pregnant individuals and newborns [^459f4c6b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Definition of Cases and Controls for Maternal and/or Fetal or Newborn Outcomes

Noncases within this disproportionality analysis are referred to as controls. Adverse events of interest were maternal and fetal or newborn adverse outcomes mapped directly to MedDRA-preferred terms in VigiBase. They constituted 30 individual maternal-fetal adverse outcomes regrouped into 7 categories for the purposes of this study:

Abortions: induced abortion and spontaneous abortion;
Stillbirth: fetal death;
Congenital malformation: cardiovascular malformation, fetal malformation not otherwise specified (NOS), congenital respiratory tract disorders, genetic disorders, musculoskeletal malformation, sensory defect, neurologic malformation, and genitourinary malformation;
Pregnancy complications: oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, pregnancy complication NOS, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, gestational diabetes, and pregnancy hemorrhage;
Preterm birth;
Neonatal complications: neonatal respiratory disorder, neonatal kidney failure, neonatal infection, neonatal neuronal disorder, neonatal hematologic disorder, neonatal digestive disorder, neonatal cardiovascular disorder, neonatal effusion, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal metabolic-endocrine disorder; and
Delivery complication.

Some adverse outcomes were deemed not clinically relevant (eg, somatic symptoms of pregnancy, lactation disorder, "large-for-date baby," and "postmature baby") and were discarded (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). For the independent analysis of each adverse event, cases were defined as study population reports that mentioned an adverse event. Controls were defined as all other study reports with no mention of an adverse event.

### Amniotic fluid biochemistry in isolated polyhydramnios: a series of 464 cases [^866e0388]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To report amniotic fluid biochemistry in a large series of 464 cases of isolated polyhydramnios in order to analyze both the outcome and the benefit of amniotic fluid biochemistry.

Methods

This retrospective cohort (2008–2012) included polyhydramnios cases for which amniotic fluid samples were sent to our laboratory for biochemical analysis (total protein, alpha-fetoprotein and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) so as to investigate the etiology. A Bartter index and an esophageal atresia index were defined. Final diagnoses were compared between groups to determine the association between these indices and the frequency and type of adverse outcomes.

Results

Among 464 cases of polyhydramnios considered isolated at ultrasound examination, severe fetal diseases were diagnosed in 136 (29.3%): 46 (9.9%) chromosomal anomalies, 28 (6%) Bartter syndrome, 23 (4.95%) other genetic syndromes, 22 (4.75%) swallowing disorders and 17 (3.7%) uro-nephrological disorders. Amniotic fluid biochemistry identified esophageal atresia with 66.6% (10/15) sensitivity and 100% specificity and Bartter syndrome with 85.7% (24/28) sensitivity and 84.2% specificity.

Conclusion

Isolated polyhydramnios is associated with a high risk of severe fetal diseases. Molecular cytogenetics and amniotic fluid biochemistry are helpful tools.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^fa9fb0df]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In many low and low-middle income countries, the incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown, in part because ultrasound technology is not routinely used. Our objective was to report the incidence of polyhydramnios in five low and low-middle income countries, to determine maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios, and report pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of the First Look Study, a multi-national, cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care. We evaluated all women enrolled from Guatemala, Pakistan, Zambia, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who received an examination by prenatal ultrasound. We used pairwise site comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment and multivariable logistic models with general estimating equations to control for cluster-level effects. The diagnosis of polyhydramnios was confrimed by an U.S. based radiologist in a majority of cases (62%).

Results

We identified 305/18,640 (1.6%) cases of polyhydramnios. 229 (75%) cases were from the DRC, with an incidence of 10%. A higher percentage of women with polyhydramnios experienced obstructed labor (7% vs 4%) and fetal malposition (4% vs 2%). Neonatal death was more common when polyhydramnios was present (OR 2.43; CI 1.15, 5.13).

Conclusions

Polyhydramnios occured in these low and low-middle income countries at a rate similar to high-income contries except in the DRC where the incidence was 10%. Polyhydramnios was associated with obstructed labor, fetal malposition, and neonatal death.

### The effect of uterine entry technique on chorioamniotic membrane separation in fetoscopic laser photocoagulation for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome: protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^7ff47823]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates approximately 10–15% of monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies. It results from unbalanced blood flow across shared placental vascular anastomoses, producing hypovolemia and oliguria in the "donor" twin, and volume overload with polyuria in the "recipient". The syndrome is associated with progressive fetal cardiovascular compromise and substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Diagnosis of TTTS is established by ultrasound when there is oligohydramnios in the donor sac (deepest vertical pocket [DVP] < 2 cm) together with polyhydramnios in the recipient sac (DVP > 8 cm). Disease severity is classified using the Quintero staging system, which stratifies TTTS based on progressive sonographic and physiologic findings. Stage I is defined by fluid discordance with visible bladders in both twins; Stage II by non-visualization of the donor bladder; Stage III by critically abnormal Doppler studies; Stage IV by hydrops fetalis; and Stage V by intrauterine demise of one or both twins. This framework provides a standardized approach for prognosis and management.

For Stage II–IV TTTS presenting between 16 and 26 weeks of gestation, fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) of placental vascular connections is the treatment of choice. Compared with serial amnioreduction or expectant management, this approach provides superior survival outcomes and improved long-term neurodevelopment. Although Stage I TTTS is typically managed expectantly, FLP may be considered after individualized assessment, particularly for severe maternal symptoms attributable to polyhydramnios or progressive cervical shortening.

Despite its benefits, FLP carries procedure-related risks, including preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), preterm birth (PTB), septostomy, and chorioamniotic membrane separation (CAS). Severe maternal complications are rare, occurring in fewer than 2% of fetoscopic procedures. Among these complications, iatrogenic CAS, defined as detachment of the amnion from chorion as a direct result of fetal intervention, is reported in 7.5–20.7% of pregnancies following FLP and is associated with increased risks of PPROM, earlier delivery, and neonatal morbidity.

### Polyhydramnios: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment… [^8081f2f0]. publications.aap.org (2006). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Polyhydramnios, sometimes referred to as hydramnios, is a relatively uncommon complication affecting pregnancy that refers to the presence of an excessive amount of amniotic fluid relative to gestational age. Onset may be gradual or sudden, based on the cause. Gradual onset may be largely asymptomatic. In this situation, the diagnosis is suspected when fundal height exceeds that expected for gestational age. In contrast, sudden onset of polyhydramnios often is symptomatic, characterized by contractions and significant abdominal discomfort. Polyhydramnios has potential serious consequences, primarily related to the cause, but also due to the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, such as preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. The exact incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown because mild, asymptomatic cases may be discovered only at the time of delivery and are underreported.

Several series have suggested that the incidence. Comments.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 71: management of previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [^14ba77d2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) — clinical predictors of neonatal and maternal outcomes: Residual amniotic fluid volume after PPROM is associated with differential neonatal outcomes, and compared with nonsurvivors, survivors were less likely to be born following oligohydramnios or anhydramnios; however, anhydramnios does not definitively preclude survival, with reported rates among survivors ranging from 7% to 38%. Gestational age at PPROM and oligohydramnios were found to be independent factors associated with severe respiratory morbidity in a retrospective cohort at 20 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation, and as an example of gestational-age effect, there were no surviving neonates after PPROM at < 16 weeks of gestation. Maternal risk factors have also been identified; in a case–control study at 14 0/7 to 22 6/7 weeks, maternal age > 35 years and twin gestation were associated with higher odds of composite maternal morbidity, with reported aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.48–10.8; and aOR, 5.62; 95% CI, 2.21–14.2; respectively.

### Perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed before 37 weeks of gestation [^120faf67]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies diagnosed with isolated oligohydramnios at preterm (n = 108). Pregnancy outcome was compared with a matched control group of low-risk preterm pregnancies with normal levels of amniotic fluid in a 3:1 ratio (n = 324).

Results

Pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a higher rate of preterm deliveries (26.9% vs 12.3%, P < .001), most of which were iatrogenic, and a higher rate of labor induction and cesarean delivery. Neonates with isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a lower birthweight and a higher rate of neonatal morbidity. These differences were eliminated when the analysis was limited to the subgroup of pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios that were managed expectantly and delivered spontaneously at term.

Conclusion

Adverse pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed at < 37 weeks appears to be related to a considerable degree to iatrogenic prematurity.

### Polyhydramnios with bidirectional fetal ductus arteriosus flow in a fetus with congenital diaphragmatic hernia: case report [^db35c1ff]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

The etiology of polyhydramnios may be attributed to either increased production of amniotic fluid (fetal polyuria or high-output cardiac failure) or decreased fetal swallowing (obstruction or neurological impairment). Although idiopathic polyhydramnios occurs in nearly half of all cases, it is often associated with fetal abnormalities. Fetal ductus arteriosus flow is normally from right to left. We report a case of antenatally detected bidirectional fetal ductus arteriosus flow diagnosed concomitantly with polyhydramnios. Amnioreduction was performed due to severe maternal symptoms, which resulted in correction of the fetal ductus arteriosus flow. Postnatal diagnosis of a Morgagni diaphragmatic hernia indicates that our sonographic findings collectively may have been a diagnostic clue.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^a2bd353b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of fetal growth restriction by organ system

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of fetal growth restriction (FGR), when the estimated intrauterine weightof a fetus is less than 10th percentiles of gestational age. Our results showed a higher rate of fetal growth restriction in urogenital anomalies, in almost 20% of fetuses (83/432 cases, 19.21%). In some of the organ systems, we found rates of around 10%: craniospinal anomalies (60/530, 11.32%), craniofacial anomalies (23/218, 10.55%), abdominal and abdominal wall defects (48/404, 11.88%), limb anomalies, and ossification disorders (26/255, 10.20%). Some organ systems showed lower values, below 10%: cardiovascular disorders (72/818, 8.80%), thoracic disorders (10/156, 6.41%), and disorders with subcutaneous oedema (5/243, 2.06%).

### Pregnancy-related pharmacokinetics and antimicrobial prophylaxis during fetal surgery, cefazolin and clindamycin as examples [^c4ffc7f2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis during surgery aims to prevent post-operative site infections. For fetal surgery, this includes the fetal and amniotic compartments. Both are deep compartments as drug equilibrium with maternal blood is achieved relatively late. Despite prophylaxis, chorio-amnionitis or endometritis following ex utero intrapartum treatment or fetoscopy occur in 4.13% and 1.45% respectively of the interventions. This review summarizes the observations on two commonly administered antimicrobials (cefazolin, clindamycin) for surgical prophylaxis during pregnancy, with emphasis on the deep compartments. For both compounds, antimicrobial exposure is on target when we consider the maternal and fetal plasma compartment. In contrast, amniotic fluid concentrations-time profiles display a delayed and much more blunted pattern, behaving as deep compartment. For cefazolin, there are data that document further dilution in the setting of polyhydramnios. Along this deep compartment concept, there is some accumulation during repeated administration, modeled for cefazolin and observed for clindamycin. The relative underexposure to antimicrobials in amniotic fluid may be reflected in the pattern of maternal-fetal complications after fetal surgery, and suggest that antimicrobial prophylaxis practices for fetal surgery should be reconsidered. Further studies should be designed by a multidisciplinary team (fetal surgeons, clinical pharmacologists and microbiologists) to facilitate efficient evaluation of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

### Successful antenatal treatment of MAGED2-related bartter syndrome and review of treatment options and efficacy [^5d3f0e7f]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

A new form of transient antenatal Bartter syndrome (aBS) was recently identified that is associated with the X-linked MAGED2 variant. Case reports demonstrate that this variant leads to severe polyhydramnios that may result in preterm birth or pregnancy loss. There is limited but promising evidence that amnioreductions may improve fetal outcomes in this rare condition. We report a woman with two affected pregnancies. In the first pregnancy, the patient was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate polyhydramnios in the second trimester that ultimately resulted in preterm labor and delivery at 25 weeks with fetal demise. Whole exome sequencing of the amniotic fluid sample resulted after the pregnancy loss and revealed a c.1337G > A MAGED2 variant that was considered diagnostically. The subsequent pregnancy was confirmed by chorionic villi sampling to also be affected by this variant. The pregnancy was managed with frequent ultrasounds and three amnioreductions that resulted in spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks and 6 days of a viable newborn with no evidence of overt electrolyte abnormalities suggesting complete resolution. A detailed review of the published cases of MAGED2-related transient aBS is provided. Our review focuses on individuals who received antenatal treatment. A total of 31 unique cases of MAGED2-related transient aBS were compiled. Amnioreduction was performed in 23 cases and in 18 cases no amnioreduction was performed. The average gestational age at delivery was significantly lower in cases without serial amnioreduction (28.7 vs. 30.71 weeks, p = 0.03). Neonatal mortality was seen in 5/18 cases without serial amnioreduction, and no mortality was observed in the cases with serial amnioreduction. In cases of second trimester severe polyhydramnios without identifiable cause, whole exome sequencing should be considered. Intensive ultrasound surveillance and serial amnioreduction is recommended for the management of MAGED2-related transient aBS.

### A graceful EXIT impeded by obstetrical complications [^ece740fe]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Once the uterus was exteriorised, uterine relaxation was attempted with an anaesthetic cocktail (halogenated agent, terbutaline and nitroglycerin) while maintaining stable maternal cardiovascular status with pressor infusions. Uterine relaxation was unfortunately never obtained despite maximal anaesthetic agents. As a result, the myometrial thickness compromised compression of the tissue with Bainbridge clamps, and use of the hysterotomy staples was rendered futile. Also, as a result of lack of uterine relaxation, optimisation of uteroplacental circulation was not achieved. Whether fetal bradycardia was secondary to the existing cord prolapse, increased uterine tone and/or loss of optimal uterine volume is not clear. Fortunately, there were no signs of placental abruption at any point, which would have terminated the EXIT procedure. Infusion of warm Ringer's lactate was not effective to maintain optimal uterine volume due to the myometrial contractile force in this circumstance, and the only volume maintained was secondary to the lower half of the fetus remaining within the uterus.

Fortunately, the tracheostomy was performed expeditiously without any issue. There was minimal time spent on uteroplacental bypass, which was present but suboptimal secondary to the aforementioned complicating factors. In addition, once the airway was secured, an awaiting neonatal team optimised oxygenation and ventilation.

Quality review performed after the procedure highlighted an important area for improvement, establishing the optimal gestational age to schedule an EXIT procedure. In one series of 31 EXIT procedures, the gestational age range at the time of delivery was quite variable at 29–40 weeks. There is no existing consensus as to when timing is optimal. With the diagnosis of CHAOS, polyhydramnios is common and is associated with a high risk of premature rupture of membranes and premature labour. Our EXIT occurred at 34 weeks and 5 days. An amnioreduction could have been performed prophylactically to try to avoid this complication or the EXIT could have been scheduled earlier than the planned 37 weeks of gestation. Admission to the hospital is another consideration to maximise efficient movement to the operating room in the setting of spontaneous labour. In this case, the patient did have asymptomatic polyhydramnios with a long cervix, and the risks of a late amnioreduction was considered by the team to be higher than the benefits. Active labour following an amnioreduction can certainly occur. The benefit of waiting longer to promote fetal maturity was desired, although the ability to achieve this in the setting of CHAOS is unknown.

### Monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies [^50c106df]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

About 1 in 5 twin pregnancies are monochorionic diamniotic. In these twins, transfusion imbalances may develop because of the vascular anastomoses that are invariably present. The most severe imbalance is twin-twin transfusion syndrome, which presents as a significant amniotic fluid difference diagnosed on ultrasound scan, usually before 26 weeks. Another transfusion imbalance is twin anemia polycythemia sequence, which is a severe hemoglobin difference occurring mainly after 26 weeks in previously uncomplicated pregnancies. Fetoscopic laser coagulation of the anastomoses addresses the cause of these transfusion imbalances. Beside transfusion imbalances, the monochorionic placenta may be unevenly divided, or one part may be dysfunctional, leading to an intertwin growth difference of more than 20%. Here, laser ablation of the anastomoses will usually not cure the problem, but it aims to protect the appropriately growing twin if the growth-restricted cotwin dies. In monochorionic twins, structural anomalies are twice as common as in singleton pregnancies, probably because of a teratogenic effect of the embryonic splitting or because of transfusion imbalances. In contrast, chromosomal anomalies seem less common, possibly because they more likely result in an early demise. Selective reduction is feasible in monochorionic pregnancies but carries increased risks of loss, miscarriage, and early birth than selective reduction in a dichorionic setting. Finally, if one monochorionic twin dies spontaneously, its cotwin may acutely exsanguinate into the demised cotwin, which may result in the loss of both twins or brain damage in the surviving twin. This update addresses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of these common complications in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.

### Planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby for improving outcomes [^515ce937]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal compromise in the term pregnancy is suspected when the following clinical indicators are present: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), decreased fetal movement (DFM), or when investigations such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound reveal results inconsistent with standard measurements. Pathological results would necessitate the need for immediate delivery, but the management for 'suspicious' results remains unclear and varies widely across clinical centres. There is clinical uncertainty as to how to best manage women presenting with a suspected term compromised baby in an otherwise healthy pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the effects of immediate delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing expectant management versus planned early delivery for women with a suspected compromised fetus from 37 weeks' gestation or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Of the 20 reports identified by the search strategy, we included three trials (546 participants: 269 to early delivery and 277 to expectant management), which met our inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compared outcomes in 492 pregnancies with IUGR of the fetus, and one in 54 pregnancies with oligohydramnios. All three trials were of reasonable quality and at low risk of bias. The level of evidence was graded moderate, low or very low, downgrading mostly for imprecision and for some indirectness. Overall, there was no difference in the primary neonatal outcomes of perinatal mortality (no deaths in either group, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded moderate), major neonatal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.81, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), or neurodevelopmental disability/impairment at two years of age (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.69, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). There was no difference in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (one trial, 333 infants) or meconium aspiration (one trial, 459 infants), There was also no difference in the reported primary maternal outcomes: maternal mortality (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.87, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), and significant maternal morbidity (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.22, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). The gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier in women randomised to early delivery (mean difference (MD) -9.50, 95% CI -10.82 to -8.18, one trial, 459 women) and women in the early delivery group were significantly less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, one trial, 33 women). Significantly more infants in the planned early delivery group were admitted to intermediate care nursery (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, two trials, 491 infants). There was no difference in the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, (one trial, 333 infants), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three trials, 546 infants), resuscitation required (one trial, 459 infants), mechanical ventilation (one trial, 337 infants), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23, three trials, 545 infants, evidence graded very low), length of stay in NICU/SCN (one trial, 459 infants), and sepsis (two trials, 366 infants). Babies in the expectant management group were more likely to be < 2.3rd centile for birthweight (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73, two trials, 491 infants), however there was no difference in the proportion of babies with birthweight < 10th centile (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10). There was no difference in any of the reported maternal secondary outcomes including: caesarean section rates (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, three trials, 546 women, evidence graded low), placental abruption (one trial, 459 women), pre-eclampsia (one trial, 459 women), vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), assisted vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), breastfeeding rates (one trial, 218 women), and number of weeks of breastfeeding after delivery one trial, 124 women). There was an expected increase in induction in the early delivery group (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.37, one trial, 459 women). No data were reported for the pre-specified secondary neonatal outcomes of the number of days of mechanical ventilation, moderate-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy or need for therapeutic hypothermia. Likewise, no data were reported for secondary maternal outcomes of postnatal infection, maternal satisfaction or views of care.

Authors' Conclusions

A policy for planned early delivery versus expectant management for a suspected compromised fetus at term does not demonstrate any differences in major outcomes of perinatal mortality, significant neonatal or maternal morbidity or neurodevelopmental disability. In women randomised to planned early delivery, the gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier, women were less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation, they were more likely to be induced and infants were more likely to be admitted to intermediate care nursery. There was also a significant difference in the proportion of babies with a birthweight centile < 2.3rd, however this did not translate into a reduction in morbidity. The review is informed by only one large trial and two smaller trials assessing fetuses with IUGR or oligohydramnios and therefore cannot be generalised to all term pregnancies with suspected fetal compromise. There are other indications for suspecting compromise in a fetus at or near term such as maternal perception of DFM, and ultrasound and/or CTG abnormalities. Future randomised trials need to assess effectiveness of timing of delivery for these indications.

### Midtrimester preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM): expectant management or amnioinfusion for improving perinatal outcomes (PPROMEXIL-III trial) [^f239a9cc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are signs that pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios after midtrimester PPROM might benefit from amnioinfusion. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend this procedure. The benefits might be increased neonatal survival and decreased pulmonary complications, especially pulmonary hypoplasia. Potential harms include placental abruption, premature labour and delivery, cord prolapse, chorioamnionitis, fetal loss, fetal trauma due to puncture. Of these, only the last mentioned is not a known potential complication of the underlying condition itself as well (midtrimester PPROM). Expectant management indeed carries these same risks. At present, there is no evidence on which a rational choice between expectant management or therapeutic amnioifusion can be based.

### Fetal growth restriction: ACOG practice bulletin, number 227 [^ede31b9d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Fetal growth restriction — indications for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnostic testing: Although fetal growth restriction alone may be associated with a chromosomal abnormality, the risk is increased if fetal structural abnormalities also are present, and the combination of fetal growth restriction and a structural defect should prompt patient counseling and consideration of prenatal diagnostic testing. Because earlier detection or association with polyhydramnios is more commonly linked to chromosomal abnormalities, diagnosis of fetal growth restriction before 32 weeks or fetal growth restriction with polyhydramnios or fetal malformation is an indication to offer genetic counseling and prenatal diagnostic testing.

Results

In 12 years, 41,069 deliveries and 1,957 mid-term abortion were recorded at the I. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Of the 1,957 mid-term abortions 1,440 were induced (TOP-termination of pregnancy), and 517 were spontaneous miscarriages. A total of 2,825 fetuses had some form of malformation during the observed period. Of the 2,825 cases, 203 cases were excluded from the study. Cases where no ultrasound examination was performed and the abnormality was detected only after delivery/miscarriage were excluded.

In total, data from 2,622 fetuses were processed, of which 1,256 resulted in a delivery. Of the 1,256 newborns born with malformations, 644 were born before 37 weeks of gestation, with a premature birth rate of 51.3%. Of the 2,622 cases studied, 1,366 were mid-term abortions, and post-miscarriage fetopathological examination was performed. Sixty-seven cases were spontaneous miscarriages, and in case of 1,299 fetuses, TOP was performed.

Craniospinal abnormalities occurred in 530 fetuses, and facial and neck malformations in 218 cases. The highest number of cases was cardiac and large vessel anomalies (818 cases). 156 cases of other thoracic anomalies were observed, 404 cases were included in the abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, 432 cases in the urogenital anomalies group, while 255 cases were classified in the limb and ossification anomalies group. Abnormalities with subcutaneous oedema occurred in 243 fetuses (Table 1).

Table 1
Cumulative efficacy of fetal malformation detection for all fetuses

Not all abnormalities are detected during pregnancy, and in some cases, the developmental abnormality is only detected after birth or during a fetopathological examination following a miscarriage. Over 50% of anatomical abnormalities in intrauterine fetuses were detected in craniospinal, cardiovascular, thoracic, abdominal, and abdominal wall anomalies, as well as in cases of subcutaneous oedema (Table 1).

### Amniotic fluid embolism: an Australian-New zealand population-based study [^f45c3959]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

A number of risk factors have been previously identified for AFE including advanced maternal age, polyhydramnios, multiple gestation, placental abnormalities and caesarean section. Whilst the numbers reported in this study are comparatively small, these risk factors would appear to be consistent when the women reported in this study are compared to the overall maternity population in Australia over a similar time period. In a group of control women identified from other AMOSS studies, 24.5% were aged 35 or over, 2.4% had a multiple pregnancy and 19.3% a previous caesarean delivery. Induction and/or augmentation of labour has previously been suggested as a potential risk factor for AFE, in this study 36% of women were classified as having an induction of labour whilst over a similar period of time population based Australian data showed that the overall induction rate was 26%. Whilst this supports the potential link between AFE and induction of labour, the small numbers reported here mean that this should be interpreted with caution. There were a high number of women who had had assisted conception in our study (8/33, 24% vs national figures of 3.8%), to our knowledge the use of assisted reproductive technology has not been previously examined as a potential risk factor for AFE. Whilst the higher incidence may potentially be explained by the relationship to other established risk factors such as advanced maternal age, given the potential immune mediated theories for the pathogenesis of AFE this finding warrants further investigation.

The neonatal outcomes reported in this study compare favourably to previously reported data and are notable for a low stillbirth and neonatal death rate. A number of studies have reported high stillbirth and neonatal death rates, whilst other studies have reported few or no neonatal deaths. This is a welcome finding even noting the limitation of the small number of cases. This study highlights that the neonatal outcomes associated with AFE are likely related to the birth status of the neonate at the time of the onset of the AFE episode. Those babies who were born prior to the onset of the episode were born in much better condition then those born after the onset of the AFE, with better 5 min Apgar scores and less need for NICU admission and invasive ventilation. Fetal heart rate abnormalities are a common presenting feature of AFE, highlighting the sensitivity of the fetus to any compromise of the maternal state. Appropriate resuscitation of the mother, including the performance of a peri-mortem caesarean section if indicated, is an important component of the management process.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^d998985b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal Toxicity

 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

Use of NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit ketorolac tromethamine use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if ketorolac tromethamine treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue ketorolac tromethamine if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice (see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

Use of NSAIDs, including Dolobid, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^768bf286]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Our aim was to investigate the association of different neonatal and fetal anatomical abnormalities with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios during prenatal ultrasonography.

Methods

In our study, we processed prenatal sonographic and postnatal neonatal clinical and pathological data from 2,622 fetuses with malformations over a 12-year period. We investigated the association of neonatal and fetal abnormalities with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios. To characterize the prevalence of association between a given disorder and polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, we used our proprietary "association factor" (AF) for statistical calculations.

Results

Amniotic fluid volume abnormalities were most frequently detected in urogenital, abdominal, and abdominal wall anomalies. In urogenital anomalies, amniotic fluid volume abnormalities were found in more than half of the fetuses, 54.86% (oligohydramnios 34.72%, polyhydramnios 20.14%). In abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, 43.82% of fetuses had abnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios 31.44%, oligohydramnios 12.38%). Overall, we found abnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid in over 30% of the fetuses with craniospinal, thoracic and pulmonary anomalies, limb anomalies, and ossification disorders. In craniofacial and cardiovascular anomalies, amniotic fluid volume abnormalities were only detectable in around 20%. For polyhydramnios, the "Association Factor" (AF) was very high for craniospinal, abdominal, and abdominal wall disorders, and it was high for cardiovascular, urogenital, limb, and ossification disorders. For oligohydramnios, the association factor (AF) was very high for urogenital disorders.

Conclusions

If the amniotic fluid volume during ultrasonography is less or more than average, special attention should be paid to the ultrasound examination of the fetus' urogenital system, abdominal organs, skull, spine, chest, lungs, as well as limbs and skeletal system. In the case of polyhydramnios, fetal echocardiography is recommended.

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) — definition, sonographic criteria, etiologies, and prevalence are as follows: NIHF "refers specifically to cases not caused by red cell alloimmunization," and hydrops is "defined as the presence of ≥ 2 abnormal fluid collections in the fetus," which may include "ascites, pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, and generalized skin edema (defined as skin thickness > 5 mm)." Additional sonographic findings include placental thickening, "typically defined as a placental thickness ≥ 4 cm in the second trimester or ≥ 6 cm in the third trimester," and polyhydramnios. Etiologies most commonly include "cardiovascular, chromosomal, and hematologic abnormalities, followed by structural fetal anomalies, complications of twinning, infection, and placental abnormalities." NIHF prevalence notes that it "now accounts for almost 90% of cases of hydrops, with the prevalence in published series reported as 1 in 1700–3000 pregnancies."

### Celecoxib (Celebrex) [^e1583cfe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including CELEBREX, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If CELEBREX treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue CELEBREX and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of CELEBREX during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including celecoxib, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

Human Data

The available data do not establish the presence or absence of developmental toxicity related to the use of CELEBREX.

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.

Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.

### Perinatal outcomes and predictors of neonatal mortality in preterm premature rupture of membranes: a tertiary center experience [^b02037e5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The prematurity and low birth weight contribute to probable respiratory problems and inadequate fetal immunity. Oxygen requirement and intubation were more frequent at lower gestational ages than at higher gestational ages, which was expected in line with the literature. CRP levels were also elevated in earlier gestational age groups, while maternal prenatal WBC levels were similar. Despite the high incidence of subclinical infections in the lower gestational age, two cases of late neonatal mortality due to sepsis in group IV were documented in our study. These data emphasize the occurrence of infection-related problems in this period of pregnancy. The observed pattern of increased late neonatal mortality and morbidity in Group I compared to Group II is consistent with findings in the literature.

PPROM occurring at an earlier gestational age correlates with higher neonatal complications due to loss of protective function of the amniotic membrane and reduced amniotic fluid content. Yan et al. documented RDS and neonatal sepsis rates of 24% and 13.5%, respectively, for PPROM occurring between 24–and 27 + 6 weeks. Elevated rates were noted in our analysis, likely because cases in Group I were included at 23 weeks, and 57.9% of these patients did not complete antenatal steroid treatment, while 52.6% did not receive comprehensive antibacterial therapy before spontaneous labor. Nevertheless, our neonatal complication rates are consistent with those in the study by Yan et al.

Predicting neonatal outcomes in PPROM cases and identifying newborns with unfavorable prognostic factors is of significant therapeutic relevance, and this concern is the primary outcome measure in numerous studies. In their study of the impact of PPROM on neonatal outcomes, Tanir et al. identified gestational age, Apgar scores, and umbilical cord blood pH as independent predictors of neonatal outcomes in PPROM. Goya et al. demonstrated that normal amniotic fluid volume, normal cervical length, and negative vaginal cultures serve as protective factors against unfavorable neonatal outcomes. Our study confirms previous findings and shows that the surviving newborns have a higher birth weight and gestational age and that oligohydramnios occur less frequently. Coolen et al. found that oligohydramnios increased the incidence of chorioamnionitis and NICU admissions but were not directly related to infant death. This inconsistency may be due to methodological differences, as their study only included PPROM cases between 30 and 36 weeks and excluded earlier gestational ages. Our study included a broader range (23–36 + 6 weeks) and thus allowed a more thorough analysis of protracted oligohydramnios and its impact on neonatal development.

Fetal Toxicity

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including sulindac tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including sulindac tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

Use of NSAIDs, including sulindac tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation.

Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.

If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit sulindac tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if sulindac tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue sulindac tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice (see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).

### Maternal and obstetric outcomes after Ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT): a single center experience [^9869555e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Ex-utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT) is a procedure developed to manage a range of fetal conditions, aiming to ensure the maintenance of neonatal airway and preserving the feto-placental circulation. Its goal is to enhance the neonatal ability to successfully transition and adapt to postnatal life, thereby reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, EXIT has been associated with a high risk of maternal complications. This paper provides an overview of the indications and characteristics of the EXIT procedure, as well as the obstetric outcomes and maternal complications.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of patients undergoing EXIT at our center between January 2007 and December 2022. Maternal outcomes, including demographic information, data related to the surgical procedure, surgical complications, and postoperative complications were analyzed. To assess the severity of the surgical complications, a modified Clavien-Dindo classification was used. Comparative analysis was performed by randomly selecting a sample from elective cesarean deliveries performed at our center.

Results

A total of 34 EXIT procedures were performed. According to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification, we observed no major complications, while minor maternal complications were present in 2.94% of cases. Compared to elective cesarean deliveries (n = 350), there were no significant differences in terms of maternal complications, highlighting the similarity observed in the mean decrease in postoperative hemoglobin (1.15 g/dL in EXIT vs. 1.2 g/dL in elective cesarean deliveries, p = 0.94). In EXIT group, there was a higher rate of polyhydramnios (26.47% vs 6.59%, p < 0.001), as well as the need for amnioreduction (14.71% vs 0%, p = 0.001) and preterm delivery (32.35% vs 6.02%, p = 0.001). There were no cases of endometritis, post-procedural fever, or abruptio placentae following EXIT.

Conclusions

EXIT can be considered a safe procedure when performed under adequate conditions, including appropriate uterine access and proper anesthetic management. In our series, EXIT procedure was not associated with a higher incidence of maternal complications when compared to elective cesarean delivery.
