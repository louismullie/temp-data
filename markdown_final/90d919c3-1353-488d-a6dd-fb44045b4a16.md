## Question

In what conditions you get normal platelet count but large size platelets morphology?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which conditions present with a normal platelet count but large platelets on morphology, and how to distinguish them from spurious causes and from thrombocytopenic macrothrombocytopenias. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core paradox and whether it is biologically plausible. Then, I should verify the major etiologic buckets that can produce large platelets with preserved counts. Next, I will review concrete examples within each bucket and their distinguishing features. After that, I need to check for spurious causes that mimic large platelets and how to exclude them. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and a concise list of conditions that fit the normal-count, large-platelet phenotype, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical paradox and its plausibility. A normal platelet count with enlarged platelets implies that megakaryopoiesis is producing fewer, larger platelets per megakaryocyte while maintaining overall output, or that platelet turnover is increased with a compensatory right-shift in size distribution, which is biologically consistent with known platelet heterogeneity and production kinetics, including the inverse relationship between platelet size and number seen in several inherited and acquired states [^116EL5vF] [^115oGhZJ].

> I will now examine the inherited platelet function disorders with normal counts but abnormal morphology as a primary bucket. Wait, let me verify a common misconception: Bernard-Soulier syndrome is classically macrothrombocytopenic, so it does not belong here; I initially almost listed it, but that would be incorrect for a normal-count scenario. By contrast, gray platelet syndrome can present with macrothrombocytopenia and α-granule deficiency, so it also does not fit a strict normal-count phenotype. However, some inherited disorders with qualitative defects can show large platelets without thrombocytopenia, albeit inconsistently; for example, certain cytoskeletal or signaling defects may yield platelet size variability even when the automated count is normal, though documentation is sparse and often inferred from mechanistic or small series data rather than large cohorts with normal counts, so I should be cautious and qualify this as possible but not firmly established in population-scale studies [^111NxfaM] [^1158U2M3] [^111hKCYQ].

> Next, I should review acquired reactive states with increased platelet turnover that enlarge mean platelet volume while keeping the count within normal limits. Let me consider cardiovascular disease, sepsis, and inflammatory states; multiple studies link higher MPV to increased turnover of younger, larger platelets, and in sepsis, rising MPV correlates with severity and mortality, consistent with a stress thrombopoiesis phenotype that can transiently preserve total counts even as the size distribution shifts upward [^111rq1V8] [^115BHjyB]. Hold on, I should verify that these associations do not mandate thrombocytopenia; indeed, MPV elevation can occur with normal or even high platelet counts in inflammatory and cardiovascular contexts, supporting the inclusion of these acquired states when the question is large platelets with a normal count [^111rq1V8].

> I will now examine myeloproliferative neoplasms, but wait, I need to ensure I am not conflating thrombocytosis with normal counts. Essential thrombocythemia typically shows thrombocytosis, yet platelets can be large or giant, and in some patients the count may be high-normal rather than frankly elevated, so a normal-count presentation with large platelets is uncommon but possible early or in individual variation; moreover, BCR-ABL1–positive thrombocythemia can mimic ET with striking megakaryocytic changes and large platelets, again with variable counts, so I should keep these clonal entities on the list with the caveat that counts are often high rather than strictly normal [^114FueTC] [^115AteZL] [^1138BuPS].

> But wait, what if the "large platelets" are an artifact of counting rather than true in vivo enlargement. I need to check for spurious causes: EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia with platelet clumping, platelet satellitism, and very large or giant platelets that exceed instrument thresholds can all lead to undercounting by impedance or even optical systems, making the true platelet count appear lower and the mean platelet volume or size on smear appear paradoxically large; critically, a manual smear is indispensable to distinguish true macroplatelets from clumps or satellitism and to verify the actual count and morphology [^115Jccwp] [^111iQo9y] [^111Cb3Pd]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not just theoretical; case series and instrument validation studies repeatedly show that very large platelets are miscounted, and type 2B von Willebrand disease is a classic example where large platelets and agglutinates coexist and confound automated counts, reinforcing the need for smear review in any case with discordant size and count [^114pFdeZ] [^112g8Byd].

> Let me synthesize the conditions that genuinely fit a normal platelet count with large platelets on morphology, while keeping the caveats explicit. First, acquired states with increased platelet turnover and inflammatory drive, including cardiovascular disease, sepsis, and other inflammatory conditions, where MPV rises due to younger platelets and the total count may remain normal. Second, myeloproliferative neoplasms, recognizing that ET and BCR-ABL1 thrombocythemia often show thrombocytosis but can occasionally present with high-normal counts and large platelets early in disease. Third, a subset of inherited platelet disorders with qualitative defects may show platelet size variability without consistent thrombocytopenia, though high-quality, normal-count cohort data are limited and this remains a qualified inclusion. Fourth, spurious causes such as EDTA artifacts and instrument undercounting of giant platelets can create the illusion of large platelets with a "normal" corrected manual count, so these must be excluded before concluding a true phenotype [^111rq1V8] [^114FueTC] [^115AteZL] [^111NxfaM] [^115Jccwp].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach to avoid misclassification. Let me first confirm that a peripheral blood smear is mandatory to verify true macroplatelets and exclude clumps or satellitism, and that repeat sampling in citrate or with immediate analysis can mitigate EDTA artifacts; then, I should review MPV from an appropriate analyzer and consider instrument-specific limitations when interpreting size indices. Next, I will integrate clinical context: bleeding history, family history, infection or inflammation, and cytopenias in other lineages guide toward inherited, immune, inflammatory, or clonal etiologies. Finally, if suspicion persists for an inherited disorder, targeted genetic testing or a curated platelet/bleeding panel can be deployed, ideally in coordination with a specialized center, to clarify the diagnosis and anticipate extrahematopoietic risks [^111iQo9y] [^111Cb3Pd] [^111fhkxR] [^1143kk8E].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the final synthesis is precise: the most defensible conditions with normal platelet count and large platelets are acquired high-turnover inflammatory states such as cardiovascular disease and sepsis, selected myeloproliferative neoplasms that may occasionally present with high-normal counts and large platelets, a cautiously included subset of inherited qualitative platelet disorders with size variability, and — after exclusion — spurious causes like EDTA artifacts and instrument underrecognition of giant platelets; Bernard-Soulier syndrome and gray platelet syndrome, while classic for large platelets, typically include thrombocytopenia and thus do not meet the strict normal-count criterion in most cases, which I should explicitly acknowledge to avoid overinclusion [^111rq1V8] [^114FueTC] [^115AteZL] [^111NxfaM] [^115Jccwp].

Normal platelet count with large platelets is most often due to **inherited macrothrombocytopenias** (MYH9-related disorders, Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet) [^111hKCYQ] [^notfound] or **reactive states** (ITP recovery, infection/inflammation, liver disease, myelodysplasia) [^111rq1V8] [^115BHjyB]. Large platelets reflect **young, hyperreactive platelets** from increased turnover or abnormal megakaryopoiesis [^114NrwVW] [^1167hJVq]. Confirm with a **manual smear** [^111iQo9y] and **MPV/PDW** [^113wL8NS]; if persistent or unexplained, pursue genetic testing [^1143kk8E] and hematology referral [^1158U2M3].

## Inherited disorders with normal platelet count and large platelets

Several inherited platelet disorders present with **normal or near-normal counts** and **large platelets** from abnormal megakaryopoiesis or cytoskeletal defects [^117XAqev]:

| **Disorder** | **Genetic defect** | **Clinical features** | **Platelet morphology** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MYH9-related disorders | MYH9 mutations | - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Giant platelets <br/> - Neutrophil inclusions (Döhle-like bodies) <br/> - Nephritis <br/> - Hearing loss | Large/giant platelets with normal or mildly reduced count [^114nVo2A] |
| Bernard-Soulier syndrome | GPIb-IX-V complex defects | - Mild thrombocytopenia <br/> - Large platelets <br/> - Bleeding | Giant platelets with normal or mildly reduced count [^111iQo9y] |
| Gray platelet syndrome | NBEAL2 mutations | - Mild thrombocytopenia <br/> - Large platelets <br/> - Alpha-granule deficiency | Large platelets with normal or mildly reduced count [^114AAnQ4] |
| ACTN1-related thrombocytopenia | ACTN1 mutations | - Mild thrombocytopenia <br/> - Large platelets | Large platelets with normal or mildly reduced count [^notfound] |

## Acquired conditions with normal platelet count and large platelets

Acquired states can increase platelet turnover, yielding **younger, larger platelets** while maintaining normal counts [^112ywziS]:

- **Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)**: Recovery or remission often shows large platelets from compensatory thrombopoiesis [^114pFdeZ].
- **Infection/inflammation**: Sepsis and inflammatory states increase MPV via cytokine-driven thrombopoiesis [^115BHjyB].
- **Liver disease**: Portal hypertension and splenic sequestration can cause large platelets with normal counts.
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes**: Dysmegakaryopoiesis produces large platelets even with normal counts [^114pFdeZ].

---

## Physiological and technical factors influencing platelet size

Physiological and technical factors also modulate platelet size: pregnancy increases MPV via **estrogen and thrombopoietin effects**, and **ethnicity** shows population variation in MPV. Automated counters may misclassify large platelets, causing spurious MPV elevations; confirm with a **manual smear** [^111iQo9y] [^111Cb3Pd].

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic approach

Large platelets are more **thrombotic and less responsive to antiplatelet therapy**, reflecting their youth and hyperreactivity [^114NrwVW] [^116LxjSf]. Evaluate with **history, exam, CBC/MPV/PDW, and a manual smear** [^notfound]; if persistent or unexplained, consider genetic testing and hematology referral [^1143kk8E].

---

Normal platelet count with large platelets reflects either inherited megakaryocytic/cytoskeletal defects or **increased turnover from acquired causes**; confirm with smear and indices, and escalate to genetic testing when indicated [^111hKCYQ] [^114pFdeZ].

### Large and small platelets-(when) do they differ? [^111rq1V8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Platelets are most important in providing cellular hemostasis but also take part in inflammation and immune processes. Increased platelet size has been regarded as a feature describing a young and more reactive subpopulation until studies were published which questioned this concept. Moreover, changes of platelet size given by the mean platelet volume (MPV) were described for immune thrombocytopenia, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, venous thromboembolism, chronic lung disease, sepsis, cancer-associated thrombosis, autoimmune disorders, and others. This review summarizes the literature on what is known about platelets with different size and describes controversies of studies with large and small platelets putting a focus on their thrombogenicity, age, and on the association of MPV with the mentioned diseases.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of hereditary macrothrombocytopenia [^111hKCYQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, is a common haematological abnormality, with a wide differential diagnosis, which may represent a clinically significant underlying pathology. Macrothrombocytopenia, the presence of large platelets in combination with thrombocytopenia, can be acquired or hereditary and indicative of a complex disorder. In this review, we discuss the interpretation of platelet count and volume measured by automated haematology analysers and highlight some important technical considerations relevant to the analysis of blood samples with macrothrombocytopenia. We review how large cohorts, such as the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, have enabled an accurate description of the distribution and co-variation of platelet parameters in adult populations. We discuss how genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic associations with platelet count and mean platelet volume, which in aggregate can explain large fractions of phenotypic variance, consistent with a complex genetic architecture and polygenic inheritance. Finally, we describe the large genetic diagnostic and discovery programmes, which, simultaneously to genome-wide association studies, have expanded the repertoire of genes and variants associated with extreme platelet phenotypes. These have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of hereditary macrothrombocytopenia and support a future clinical diagnostic strategy that utilises genotype alongside clinical and laboratory phenotype data.

Presence of large/giant platelets

The presence of large (diameter > 4 µm) or giant (diameter > 7 µm) platelets in the circulation is a common feature of many forms of inherited thrombocytopenia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, post-splenectomy states and myelodysplastic syndromes, and acquired conditions associated with increased platelet destruction by immune or non-immune mechanisms, leading to compensatory stimulation of the bone marrow to produce "stress" platelets, which differ from normal platelets by their increased size and function. Morphological examination of blood smears by light microscopy is of utmost value to detect the presence of large/giant platelets (Figure 10), which in some cases rosette around neutrophils (Figure 11). Because electronic counters distinguish platelets from other blood cells based on their smaller size (diameter 1.5–3 µm), the platelet count of these patients may be underestimated because large/giant platelets are not recognized as such. Indeed, platelet counts in these patients measured by electronic counters tend to be lower than those measured manually by optical microscopy (Table 2), which is the recommended method for these patients.

Type 2B von Willebrand disease

von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common congenital bleeding disorder associated with quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of von Willebrand factor (VWF), comprising a spectrum of many subtypes. Type 2B VWD is a rare VWD subtype characterized by gain-of-function mutations in the VWF gene that result in heightened interaction of 2B VWF with the platelet GPIbα, spontaneous binding of VWF to platelets, in vivo platelet clumping, clearance of the VWF large molecular weight multimers and mild thrombocytopenia. The platelet count of patients with type 2B VWD may be underestimated because of the presence of large/giant "stress" platelets, produced by compensatory bone marrow stimulation consequent to heightened platelet consumption in vivo. Conditions characterized by increased synthesis or release of type 2B VWF in the circulation, such as pregnancyand infusion of desmopressin, aggravate the clinical picture. In case reports, the presence of platelet clumps in EDTA blood also contributed to underestimation of the platelet count (Figure 12). Although the involvement of large/ giant platelets in EDTA platelet clumps differentiates type 2B VWD from PTCP, the cornerstone of the differential diagnosis between the two conditions must rely on the presence of a bleeding diathesis, which should impose the need for further diagnostic investigations, including the measurement of plasma VWF with immunological and functional tests and determination of the composition of the VWF multimers.

Conclusions

It is of fundamental importance to identify conditions that are associated with spuriously low platelet counts in order to avoid unnecessary, expensive and/or potentially dangerous diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Four important recommendations can be made in order to reach a correct diagnosis: (i) strictly control all the pre-analytical and analytical variables of platelet counting; (ii) always consider the possibility of spurious thrombocytopenia when the bleeding history of the subject is negative, even though "true" congenital and acquired thrombocytopenias may not always be associated with a positive bleeding history;, (iii) bear in mind that spuriously low platelet counts are more frequently encountered in patients with "true" thrombocytopenia than in normal subjects, due to the presence of large/giant platelets and/or platelet agglutinates, which form more commonly than in normal subjects, thus deceptively aggravating the severity of the condition; and (iv) always examine an anticoagulated peripheral blood smear under a light microscope, which is the recommended first indispensable step in the diagnostic workup of any hematologic abnormality.

The shape of the patient's histogram indicates the presence of a high percentage of large/giant platelets, some of which extended beyond the platelet size discriminator bar set at 25 fL (vertical dotted line), resulting in underestimation of the platelet count (4.6×10⁹/L) compared to the manual counting by optical microscopy (32×10⁹/L).

### Platelet diameters in inherited thrombocytopenias: analysis of 376 patients with all known disorders [^115JJGaz]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of platelet size are one of the distinguishing features of inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs), and evaluation of blood films is recommended as an essential step for differential diagnosis of these disorders. Nevertheless, what we presently know about this subject is derived mainly from anecdotal evidence. To improve knowledge in this field, we evaluated platelet size on blood films obtained from 376 patients with all 19 forms of IT identified so far and found that these conditions differ not only in mean platelet diameter, but also in platelet diameter distribution width and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced diameters. On the basis of these findings, we propose a new classification of ITs according to platelet size. It distinguishes forms with giant platelets, with large platelets, with normal or slightly increased platelet size, and with normal or slightly decreased platelet size. We also measured platelet diameters in 87 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and identified cutoff values for mean platelet diameter and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced size that have good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ITs with giant platelets and with normal or slightly decreased platelet size from immune thrombocytopenia and all other forms of IT.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^115Jccwp]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate measurements of the platelet count are necessary to diagnose thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia correctly, gauge the severity of clinical risk and identify the most appropriate therapeutic intervention. Despite increased diagnostic accuracy with electronic counters, counting is still unsatisfactory in rare situations. Conditions causing spurious thrombocytopenia include the following. (i) Pre-analytical errors, such as difficult venipuncture, over-/under-filling of blood collection tubes, insufficient mixing of blood with the anticoagulant (EDTA), which may cause fibrin formation. (ii) EDTA-induced, temperature- and time-dependent, antibody-mediated in vitro platelet agglutination, with consequent reduction in the number of single platelets in the sample; this condition, referred to as pseudothrombocytopenia, is benign and does not need follow-up or medical interventions; the use of alternative in vitro anticoagulants does not prevent formation of agglutinates in all samples; accurate platelet counts could be obtained by testing EDTA-samples immediately after blood collection. (iii) EDTA-induced in vitro platelet adherence to leukocytes (platelet satellitism), caused by bridging IgG antibodies binding to GPIIb-IIIa on platelets and the Fc receptor-III on leukocytes; occasionally, leukocytes may phagocytose platelets and/or form platelet/leukocyte clumps. (iv) The presence of large/giant platelets (commonly from patients with congenital or acquired thrombocytopenia) that are not recognized as such by electronic counters, which distinguish platelets from other cells based on their smaller size. (v) Type 2B von Willebrand disease: blood from patients with this disorder may display large/giant platelets and platelet agglutinates. All the above conditions are easily identifiable by microscopic examination of anticoagulated peripheral blood smears, which is an indispensable diagnostic procedure in hematology.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^112HTVP5]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

### Does size matter in platelet production? [^116EL5vF]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Platelet (PLT) production represents the final stage of megakaryocyte (MK) development. During differentiation, bone marrow MKs extend and release long, branched proPLTs into sinusoidal blood vessels, which undergo repeated abscissions to yield circulating PLTs. Circular-prePLTs are dynamic intermediate structures in this sequence that have the capacity to reversibly convert into barbell-proPLTs and may be related to "young PLTs" and "large PLTs" of both inherited and acquired macrothrombocytopenias. Conversion is regulated by the diameter and thickness of the peripheral microtubule coil, and PLTs are capable of enlarging in culture to generate barbell-proPLTs that divide to yield 2 smaller PLT products. Because PLT number and size are inversely proportional, this raises the question: do macrothrombocytopenias represent a failure in the intermediate stages of PLT production? This review aims to bring together and contextualize our current understanding of terminal PLT production against the backdrop of human macrothrombocytopenias to establish how "large PLTs" observed in both conditions are similar, how they are different, and what they can teach us about PLT formation. A better understanding of the cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate PLT formation and determine PLT size offers the promise of improved therapies for clinical disorders of PLT production and an important source of PLTs for infusion.

### Inherited platelet diseases with normal platelet count: phenotypes, genotypes and diagnostic strategy [^111NxfaM]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In this review we compare clinical, biological and genetic characteristics of inherited platelet disorders (IPD) with abnormal platelet function but a normal platelet count (listed in Table 1) and highlight anti-ischemic drugs developed based on the discoveries made regarding these disorders. A low platelet count does not exclude altered platelet function but we refrain from repeating details for disorders such as Bernard-Soulier and gray platelet syndromes included in our companion paper in this journal and summarized in Online Supplementary Table S1. After briefly detailing therapy, we discuss the current lessons and perspectives for clinical practice and highlight how it is important for clinicians to constitute a pivot between genetic platforms and basic research.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^117XAqev]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last 100 years the role of platelets in hemostatic events and their production by megakaryocytes have gradually been defined. Progressively, thrombocytopenia was recognized as a cause of bleeding, first through an acquired immune disorder; then, since 1948, when Bernard-Soulier syndrome was first described, inherited thrombocytopenia became a fascinating example of Mendelian disease. The platelet count is often severely decreased and platelet size variable; associated platelet function defects frequently aggravate bleeding. Macrothrombocytopenia with variable proportions of enlarged platelets is common. The number of circulating platelets will depend on platelet production, consumption and lifespan. The bulk of macrothrombocytopenias arise from defects in megakaryopoiesis with causal variants in transcription factor genes giving rise to altered stem cell differentiation and changes in early megakaryocyte development and maturation. Genes encoding surface receptors, cytoskeletal and signaling proteins also feature prominently and Sanger sequencing associated with careful phenotyping has allowed their early classification. It quickly became apparent that many inherited thrombocytopenias are syndromic while others are linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancies. In the last decade, the application of next-generation sequencing, including whole exome sequencing, and the use of gene platforms for rapid testing have greatly accelerated the discovery of causal genes and extended the list of variants in more common disorders. Genes linked to an increased platelet turnover and apoptosis have also been identified. The current challenges are now to use next-generation sequencing in first-step screening and to define bleeding risk and treatment better.

### Recommendations for the management of the haematological and onco-haematological aspects of gaucher disease [^117LmGWA]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Non-malignant haematological disease

Gaucher disease is associated with well-defined patterns of cytopenia. In spleen-intact patients, platelets tend to decrease first. With increasing spleen size, haemoglobin levels also gradually fall, followed lastly by a decline in leucocyte numbers. In contrast, asplenic patients have normal or even high platelet counts. If there is severe bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, haemoglobin levels often decline first. Deviations from these patterns may indicate other co-morbidities. For example, a non-splenectomized patient presenting with a large or slightly enlarged spleen, severe anaemia, but normal platelet counts is inconsistent with the expected pattern in Gaucher disease (which would normally include thrombocytopenia). In this case, it is likely that the anaemia is not (only) related to Gaucher disease and other causes should be investigated.

Anaemia

Anaemia is associated with poorer outcomes and poorer quality of life in a wide variety of disorders including Gaucher disease. Adoption of recent proposals to increase the lower limits defining anaemia for adults would enable earlier treatment and elevated treatment goals for haemoglobin normalization in adult Gaucher patients. Importantly, the proposals recognize that different ethnicities may have different requirements – an observation that may also be extended to different medical conditions and environments. Many Gaucher patients at the severe end of the disease spectrum present as children. Should anaemia in children, therefore, also be re-evaluated? In the absence of revised guidelines, an individualized approach to Gaucher disease management encourages physicians to assess, treat and monitor every patient individually for optimal outcomes. This takes into account variables, such as ethnic origin, age, environment, diet, co-morbidities and Gaucher disease status in all possible affected organs and tissues including bone marrow and bone density, in making disease management decisions.

### Inherited platelet-based bleeding disorders [^113Pnx64]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet-based bleeding disorders include abnormalities of platelet number and function, and are generally classified based on the abnormal functions or responses. However, a clear distinction is problematic, and in this review, the classification has been based on abnormalities of platelet components that share common characteristics. Inherited thrombocytopenias are rare, but probably underdiagnosed. They are usually classified according to both platelet size and the presence or absence of clinical features other than those deriving from the platelet defect. Hereditary disorders of platelet function can be classified as resulting from: (i) abnormalities of the platelet receptors for adhesive proteins; (ii) abnormalities of the platelet receptors for soluble agonists; (iii) abnormalities of the platelet granules; (iv) abnormalities of the signal-transduction pathways; (v) abnormalities of the membrane phospholipids; and (vi) miscellaneous abnormalities of platelet function. The literature on these disorders is reviewed, and the underlying defects discussed.

### The genetics of normal platelet reactivity [^112ddCbZ]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Genetic and environmental factors contribute to a substantial variation in platelet function seen among normal persons. Candidate gene association studies represent a valiant effort to define the genetic component in an era where genetic tools were limited, but the single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in those studies need to be validated by more objective, comprehensive approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of quantitative functional traits in much larger cohorts of more carefully selected normal subjects. During the past year, platelet count and mean platelet volume, which indirectly affect platelet function, were the subjects of GWAS. The majority of the GWAS signals were located to noncoding regions, a consistent outcome of all GWAS to date, suggesting a major role for mechanisms that alter phenotype at the level of transcription or posttranscriptional modifications. Of 15 quantitative trait loci associated with mean platelet volume and platelet count, one located at 12q24 is also a risk locus for coronary artery disease. In most cases, the effect sizes of individual quantitative trait loci are admittedly small, but the results of these studies have led to new insight into regulators of hematopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis that would otherwise be unapparent and difficult to define.

### What we have learned from inherited platelet disorders [^114qYkBb]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Identifying the molecular basis of inherited platelet disorders has contributed to our understanding of normal platelet physiology. Many of these conditions are rare, but close observation of clinical and laboratory phenotype, and subsequent identification of the abnormal protein and mutated gene, have provided us with unique opportunities to examine specific aspects of platelet biogenesis and function. Phenotype-genotype association studies are providing a detailed understanding of the structure and function of platelet membrane receptors, the biogenesis and release of platelet granules, and the assembly of the cytoskeleton. Genetic polymorphisms contributing to decreased or increased platelet adhesion and activation may translate into increased clinical risks for bleeding or thrombosis. More recently, genome wide association studies have identified new genes contributing to the variation in normal platelet function.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^1179NRvv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the patient has an inherited thrombocytopenia?

Our patient's bleeding resolved in parallel with the improvement of her platelet count, which suggests that she does not have platelet dysfunction, as seen in Bernard-Soulier or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Furthermore, she does not have any syndromic features consistent with an inherited thrombocytopenia. Review of her prior records revealed that she has had at least one prior normal platelet count.

The stability of her blood counts after initial treatment excludes cyclic thrombocytopenia which is an often-forgotten form of inherited thrombocytopenia. There are very many forms of inherited thrombocytopenia and new ones seem to be discovered regularly. Certain features should suggest an inherited thrombocytopenia: (i) other family members with thrombocytopenia; (ii) no past normal platelet count; (iii) too many too large platelets on a blood smear (not all inherited thrombocytopenias have macrothrombocytes but most do); (iv) features of a syndrome such as thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome; (v) failure to respond to treatment for ITP, such as IVIG and steroids: (vi) bleeding out of proportion to the platelet count e.g. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, RUNX-1 mutations; and (vii) a relatively stable platelet count. In the absence of an apparent specific syndrome, whole exome screening may be helpful, although this approach is effective in less than half of such cases. Ideally this possibility would be explored in conjunction with an experienced geneticist. The importance of making a precise diagnosis is not limited to the management of the platelet count per se, but extends to the associated medical problems including a possible propensity to autoimmune conditions, malignancy, or bone marrow aplasia.

### A genome-wide association study of blood cell morphology identifies cellular proteins implicated in disease aetiology [^113MskNa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Blood cells play vital roles in human physiology, including in oxygen transport, in haemostasis, and in host defence. Many of the biological functions of blood cells, such as thrombotic aggregation and the killing of pathogens or the killing of virally infected cells, are mediated by proteins stored in cell granules that are released into the extracellular space in response to a stimulus. At present, the functional responses of blood cells to stimuli cannot be measured using high-throughput instruments. Consequently, genetic association studies of cell function traits have been limited to small studies (n ≤ 5000) of platelet aggregation phenotypes, which have identified associations in approximately thirty loci. Meanwhile, high-power genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood cell traits have concentrated on phenotypes in classical complete blood counts (cCBCs) –. cCBCs are standard clinical reports, which include measurements of the counts (i.e. concentrations) and average volumes of various types of cell in the peripheral blood. However, cCBCs do not measure the properties of intracellular structures, which play important roles in many functional haematological processes. For example, pathologies of leukopoiesis that result in the absence of specific granules from neutrophils can cause immune dysfunction, but are frequently accompanied by a normal neutrophil count and so cannot be detected by cCBCs.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

In megakaryocytes, the role of apoptosis during proplatelet formation and platelet biogenesis is controversial and largely unproven although it may intervene after platelet release or during stress situations such as infections and inflammation. In a classic paper, the pro-survival protein, Bcl-X L, was proposed to constrain the pro-death Bak in platelets; the balance acting as a molecular clock for platelet survival. Others have shown how apoptotic pathways and necrosis engage pro-death proteins triggering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome C release and caspase activation leading to Ca²+-dependent exposure of phosphatidylserine, which is not only recognized by phagocytic cells but also leads to procoagulant activity.

The following sections of this review will describe familial defects of platelet production and megakaryopoiesis; affected genes will be shown to interfere with HSC proliferation, megakaryocyte maturation and migration and the alteration of platelet lifespan. Many are accompanied by an increased platelet size (Figure 2) while others have a normal platelet size or even small platelets (Figure 3). Platelet function is variably affected. While some thrombocytopenias are isolated, many are syndromic and/or associated with other conditions that may be of major clinical importance. Bleeding is mostly mucocutaneous, severe in some disorders, but infrequent or even absent in others, particularly when the decrease in platelet count is modest. A summary of the genes involved and the principle characteristics of each disorder are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1.

### A unique presentation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in relation to platelet size [^114W8iYF]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is a triad of immunodeficiency, eczema, and thrombocytopenia. Despite the heterogeneity of genetic and clinical findings, a correlation with small platelet size is routinely observed. Herein we describe a case with a unique phenotype that links normal mean platelet volume with the classic characteristics of this disease. The diagnosis was verified by genetic analysis showing a novel and de novo mutation. Our case illustrates that a high index of suspicion of WAS is warranted even in the setting of normal sized platelets.

Peripheral blood smears from a patient with EDTA-dependent pseudo-gray platelet syndrome. Blood was taken from a 6-year-old patient with phenylketonuria. The platelet count in EDTA was 167x10 9 /L but the electronic counter showed reduced refraction indicating hypogranular platelets. (A) A smear of peripheral blood anticoagulated in EDTA showed agranular and large platelets which, despite having undergone degranulation with consequent secretion of pro-aggregatory molecules such as ADP, did not form aggregates. (B) A smear from peripheral blood anticoagulated in citrate showed platelets that retained normal granularity and size, but formed small clumps. EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; ADP: adenosine diphosphate. Reproduced, with permission, from Pancione Y, et al.

Several alternative in vitro anticoagulants (both Ca²+-chelating and non-chelating) have been proposed and tested for collecting blood samples in subjects with PTCP, aiming to avoid the occurrence of platelet clumping. Some of them have been selected for their capacity to inhibit platelet aggregation. One of these is magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄), which partially inhibits platelet aggregation, probably interfering with the essential role played by Ca²+ in this platelet function. MgSO₄ did indeed inhibit the full development of PTCP (Figure 5), but the hypothesis that it did so by inhibiting platelet aggregation, is incongruous, because the anticoagulant that is most effective at inhibiting platelet aggregation in vitro is EDTA (Figure 5), which causes PTCP instead of preventing it, thus supporting the interpretation that platelet clumps are not platelet aggregates but, rather, platelet agglutinates. The good performance of MgSO₄ in avoiding PTCP, can be explained by the fact that it preserves the integrity of the GPIIb-IIIa complex (Figure 5), thus keeping the cryptoantigen on GPIIb inaccessible to agglutinins.

Diagnosis

The continuing difficulties in diagnosis of inherited thrombocytopenias should not be underestimated. While classic disorders such as BSS, MYH9 -related disease and WAS are now relatively straightforward to identify, the majority are not and in the absence of a well-defined family history of bleeding, new cases can still be confused with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Diagnostic algorithms with steps based on clinical data and laboratory testing aid the work-up and management of patients. – The widespread use of whole blood electronic counters to evaluate platelet count and size has helped, while assessing platelet function, distinguishing between syndromic or non-syndromic forms, identifying associated hematologic or marrow defects are important parts of any strategy. A successful diagnosis avoids unnecessary splenectomy and/or the use of drugs given for immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It helps to predict disease evolution, and is indispensable for selecting patients for HSC transplantation or gene therapy. Noteworthy advances have been the application of Human Phenotype Ontology terms and the identification of phenotype clusters of associated pathologies as an aid to establishing phenotype/genotype relationships. Nonetheless preparing an extensive Human Phenotype Ontology listing is not always compatible with day-to-day hospital practice. Classic tests for evaluating platelet function, such as aggregometry (Born platelet aggregometer, impedance aggregometry or other methods), secretion assays, flow cytometry, western blotting and electron microscopy, are time consuming, expensive to perform and require trained personnel. Critically, many such tests are difficult or impossible to perform when the platelet count is low. Cytochemical or immunofluorescence staining of blood smears is a recognized first step for detecting enlarged platelets, and is particularly useful in third-world countries. The evaluation of platelet spreading on single protein substrates provides more information. The use of computer-based high-throughput testing of platelet function and thrombus formation under flow on extracellular matrix proteins on microchips is full of promise but has been little tested for thrombocytopenias.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^111G16oz]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study showed that platelet size evaluation is a useful tool for distinguishing inherited macrothrombocytopenias from ITP and that the better differentiation is obtained by the use of the MPV values given by appropriate cell counters. Inappropriate instruments can be identified either by comparison of platelet counts measured by the counter with those obtained by manual counting or by the evaluation of peripheral blood films, which show very large platelets in subjects with normal or only slightly enlarged MPV. From a practical point of view, we suggest that microscope evaluation of blood films and measurement of MPV by cell counters should be used in combination. Blood film examination enables the easy identification of very large platelets, which suggest a diagnosis of inherited macrothrombocytopenias. If very large platelets are not identified, a MPV increased by more than 51% with respect to controls represents an important element that supports the suspicion of a hereditary macrothrombocytopenia.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^116a1G3g]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

The proposed mechanism of platelet satellitism involves the binding of acquired or natural-occurring antibodies of the IgG class to GPIIb-IIIa on platelets and the Fc receptor III on neutrophils, thus bridging the two cells. However, alternative mechanisms have been advocated in some cases, including binding of neutrophils to platelets expressing thrombospondin or other α-granule proteins. Platelet phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes has been described (Figure 8).72,

EDTA-dependent platelet-neutrophil agglutination

A condition similar to platelet satellitism is characterized by EDTA- and temperature-dependent platelet-neutrophil agglutination, resulting in spurious thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and alterations of the white blood cell differential. Large hetero-agglutinates including several neutrophils and platelets (Figure 9) are formed through an as yet unknown mechanism, involving a transferable molecule in the plasma or serum of the affected subjects. The diagnosis must rely on inspection of peripheral blood smears by light microscopy.

EDTA-dependent platelet-neutrophil agglutination is an in vitro, EDTA-dependent artefact that should be clearly distinguished from pathological conditions characterized by the presence in circulating blood of platelet/neutrophil and/or platelet/monocyte aggregates, which are triggered by in vivo platelet activation, exposure of P-selectin on the platelet membrane and its binding to the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) counter-receptor on the leukocyte plasma membrane. These platelet/leukocyte hetero-aggregates are readily identified by whole blood flow cytometry.

### Inherited platelet disorders: toward DNA-based diagnosis [^1152QVw5]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Variations in platelet number, volume, and function are largely genetically controlled, and many loci associated with platelet traits have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs).(1) The genome also contains a large number of rare variants, of which a tiny fraction underlies the inherited diseases of humans. Research over the last 3 decades has led to the discovery of 51 genes harboring variants responsible for inherited platelet disorders (IPDs). However, the majority of patients with an IPD still do not receive a molecular diagnosis. Alongside the scientific interest, molecular or genetic diagnosis is important for patients. There is increasing recognition that a number of IPDs are associated with severe pathologies, including an increased risk of malignancy, and a definitive diagnosis can inform prognosis and care. In this review, we give an overview of these disorders grouped according to their effect on platelet biology and their clinical characteristics. We also discuss the challenge of identifying candidate genes and causal variants therein, how IPDs have been historically diagnosed, and how this is changing with the introduction of high-throughput sequencing. Finally, we describe how integration of large genomic, epigenomic, and phenotypic datasets, including whole genome sequencing data, GWASs, epigenomic profiling, protein-protein interaction networks, and standardized clinical phenotype coding, will drive the discovery of novel mechanisms of disease in the near future to improve patient diagnosis and management.

Automatic platelet counting techniques

Impedance platelet counting

The principle of this method is based on the property of blood cells in electrolyte solutions to increase the impedance of the current, when passing through a small aperture between two electrodes, which is proportional to the volume of the cell. The first instruments required platelets to be counted in platelet-rich plasma, but more recent, technologically advanced impedance-based hematology analyzers allow platelet counting in whole blood samples. All particles with volumes within a predefined range are counted as platelets, while particles outside that range are not counted, independently of whether they are or are not platelets. Therefore, the resulting platelet count may be overestimated (due to the inclusion of non-platelet particles in the final count, such as cell debris, immune complexes, bacteria, microcytic red blood cells) or underestimated (due to the presence of very large platelets, platelet clumps or platelet adhering to leukocytes).

Optical platelet counting

Optical light scatter methods have been implemented for platelet counting. One-dimensional and two-dimensional platelet analysis instruments are available. In the two-dimensional analysis, detectors for low- and high-angle scattered light allow measurements of the platelet size and density, respectively, which facilitate the distinction between platelet and red blood cell populations. The two-dimensional counting appears to provide more accurate results in thrombocytopenic samples because, if the number of particles is too low, the data acquisition time is automatically extended, thus increasing the number of events counted.

Table 1.
Accuracy and precision of six platelet counting methods.

Hybrid platelet counting

Hybrid platelet counting combines the detection of small platelets (< 10 fL) by an impedance channel (which is distinct from the red blood cell detection channel) with the detection of large platelets (> 10 fL) by the white blood cell differential channel, to obtain accurate platelet counting.

Optical fluorescence platelet counting

A fluorescent dye (oxazine) is used to stain mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA, thus increasing the difference in fluorescence intensity between platelets and fragmented red cells, enhancing specificity. The platelet count is measured in the reticulated red channel of automated hematology analyzers. The parallel analysis of fluorescence and scattered light increases the accuracy of platelet counting, especially because it allows better discrimination between large platelets and small red blood cells.

### Inherited platelet diseases with normal platelet count: phenotypes, genotypes and diagnostic strategy [^1158U2M3]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently the diagnosis of IPD is based largely on the concept of a monogenic heritable platelet disease, but a proportion of these diseases may be di- or polygenic in origin. Families with unexplained heritability may have unrecognized variants or other changes in regulatory regions in combinations that only advanced technologies may help to resolve. Thus in a large cohort of patients with primary immunodeficiency, genome-wide association studies have revealed loci that modulate platelet function with the co-localization of and interplay between novel high-penetrance monogenic variants and common variants. It is reassuring that IPD without thrombocytopenia are not associated with a propensity to develop hematological malignancies or bone marrow aplasia or fibrosis, as in some inherited thrombocytopenias such as RUNX1-related disease and ETV6-related disease.

Current advances suggest the need to redefine the circuit for patient screening from the first consultation. An information- gathering first consultation, blood cell counts and basic coagulation screening remain essential as is assigning a bleeding score and determining whether the platelet function abnormalities are isolated or syndromic. But flow charts with extensive biological testing in order to select the gene(s) to analyze need to be revisited and the choice of extensive biological testing before genotyping questioned. Platelet aggregation, flow cytometry and the examination of blood smears provide early information to guide the diagnosis. Nevertheless, when clinical and biological data are in favor of an IPD, in selected cases upfront DNA analysis may save time, money and improve patients' care: however longitudinal studies are required to substantiate this expectation. For patients without access to a specialized platelet center, sending blood and DNA samples to expert centers is recommended. Validation of novel variant(s) on next-generation sequencing targeted gene platforms or after whole exome or whole genome sequencing requires confirmation by co-segregation or other studies as discussed above and it is here that selected biological phenotyping may be necessary.

Glanzmann thrombasthenia

With a worldwide distribution, Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is the most common platelet function disorder. Most importantly, studies on it led to the characterization of the IIb3 integrin mediator of platelet aggregation (Figure 1); this was accompanied by the emergence of a new category of powerful anti-ischemic drugs.

Table 1.
Principal named inherited platelet function disorders with a normal platelet count

Definition

Classically, GT is a severe bleeding diathesis with autosomal recessive transmission caused by an absence of platelet aggregation induced by all physiologic agonists.

Clinical phenotype

The clinical phenotype is marked by life-long spontaneous easy bruising, epistaxis and gum bleeding, often requiring platelet transfusions. Gastro-intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and severe bleeding at menarche feature prominently, as does trauma-related hemorrhage. The first signs usually appear at birth, are intense during childhood but tend to decrease in later life. GT is prevalent in ethnic communities.

Biological phenotype

Patients have a normal platelet count and morphology. Most have platelets lacking IIb3 although some express residual amounts but insufficient to support platelet aggregation: these have been termed type I and type II thrombasthenia. A third category consists of phenotypic variants in which platelets have reduced to normal amounts of IIb3 unable to function. While type I GT patients possess platelets that fail to promote clot retraction, this can be subnormal or normal for some with residual or variant IIb3. Platelets respond to ristocetin and adhere to subendothelial matrix components under flow yet fail to spread; intriguingly they can attach to fibrin. If bleeding first occurs late in life, care must be taken to exclude acquired GT, which often has an immune origin. The severity of bleeding in GT is independent of the subtype.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^113cn2jV]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

A possible alternative for the evaluation of platelet size is microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears, which recognizes platelets regardless of their size and thus makes possible accurate measurement of their diameters (Noris et al). However, this method also has drawbacks in that it is time consuming and requires experienced operators. Finally, a major problem for the use of platelet size in differentiating ITs from ITP was represented until recently by the lack of cut-off values for both MPV and mean platelet diameter (MPD).

To remedy the last difficulty, a recent, monocentric study measured platelet size in patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenias and ITP by both cell counters and optical microscopy on blood films. It found that both techniques were effective in distinguishing the two conditions, in that a MPV higher than 12.4 fl measured with an optical cell counter (ADVIA 120) and a MPD larger than 3.3 μm had sensitivity and specificity higher than 80% (Noris et al).

To validate these cut-off values, we performed a multicentre study in a different series of patients, which enrolled 113 consecutive patients with ITs and 130 patients with ITP.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: what is the evidence for treatment? [^1138BuPS]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage. The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking. In this review, we discuss current treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^112NR68C]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Familial platelet disorders with predisposition to myeloid or lymphoid malignancies

Defects of transcription factors are a major source of inherited thrombocytopenias (Figure 1). Those that interfere with the early stages of megakaryocyte maturation are often accompanied by a risk of developing myeloid or lymphoid malignancies and this was first shown for AD thrombocytopenia caused by mutations of RUNX1. – The thrombocytopenia is mild and platelet volume increases are modest, but platelet function is defective and a reduced dense granule secretion contributes to the mostly mild bleeding. Disease-causing variants occur across the gene with emphasis on the Runt homology domain that mediates DNA-binding and dimerization with the core binding factor (CBFAβ), a complex essential for regulated proliferation and differentiation of HSC and normal megakaryopoiesis as well as suppression of erythroid gene expression. RUNX1 mutations interfere with ploidy and prolong the expression of the cytoskeletal protein MYH10, whose natural loss triggers the switch from mitosis to endomitosis; the result is an abundance of immature megakaryocytes that fail to differentiate properly. Furthermore, RUNX1 directly or indirectly regulates the synthesis of a number of platelet proteins thereby altering the function of those platelets that are affected. Decreased DNA repair, a pro-inflammatory environment and the prolonged life of HSC predispose patients to acute myeloid leukemia and related conditions. Most of the genetic variants act through haploinsufficiency but, significantly, those that act in a dominant negative manner have a higher probability of causing malignancy.

Myeloid malignancies and myelodysplastic syndromes are also a risk for patients with mutations in the 5' untranslated region of ANKRD26, which are associated with mostly moderate thrombocytopenia, mild bleeding and normal sized platelets (a condition also known as thrombocytopenia 2, THC2). – Unexplained findings in some patients are a low density of α2β1 integrin, decreased numbers of platelet α-granules and large, particulate structures formed of ubiquitinated proteins or proteasomes. As for mutations of RUNX1, patients with ANKRD26 mutations have downregulated megakaryocyte maturation leading to an abundance of cells with hypolobulated nuclei. Mechanistically, mutations of the 5' untranslated region of ANKRD26 prevent downregulation of this gene by RUNX1 and FLI1, leading to increased ANKRD26 protein with a lack of repression in the terminal stages of megakaryopoiesis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis, a characteristic of inherited hemolytic anemia, and myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes, was reported in a case with ANKRD26 -related thrombocytopenia. It should be noted that THC2 also includes the Ser/Thr kinase MASTL without a tendency for malignancy, dealt with in a later section.

### Is the size of an abdominal aortic aneurysm associated with coagulopathy? [^112mkTY8]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) volume and intraluminal thrombi were analyzed with respect to the number and function of platelets, blood cells, and coagulation factors. A group of 43 patients who underwent repair of an AAA were enrolled in this study. The maximum diameter and volume of the AAA, and the volume of intraluminal thrombi and lumen were measured by computed tomography with planimetry. The platelet count and platelet function, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, plasminogen, antithrombin 3, fibrin degradation products (FDP), D-dimer, and blood cell counts were measured. Spontaneous platelet aggregation and the FDP, and D-dimer levels were elevated; all other factors remained within the normal range. Intraluminal thrombus volume was strongly correlated with the volume and diameter of the AAA. However, no correlation was observed between the size of the AAA and coagulating factors, including the number and aggregation value of platelets. AAAs are frequently associated with a coagulating disorder. However, its size and thrombus volume are not correlated with coagulation changes. Although an intraluminal thrombus increases along with fee enlargement of the AAA, the clinical manifestation of bleeding is rarely associated with an AAA. Therefore coagulopathy in patients with an AAA is not fully explained by its morphology.

### Platelet ageing: a review [^114NrwVW]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Platelet ageing is an area of research which has gained much interest in recent years. Newly formed platelets, often referred to as reticulated platelets, young platelets or immature platelets, are defined as RNA-enriched and have long been thought to be hyper-reactive. This latter view is largely rooted in associations and observations in patient groups with shortened platelet half-lives who often present with increased proportions of newly formed platelets. Evidence from such groups suggests that an increased proportion of newly formed platelets is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events and a reduced effectiveness of standard anti-platelet therapies. Whilst research has highlighted the existence of platelet subpopulations based on function, size and age within patient groups, the common intrinsic changes which occur as platelets age within the circulation are only just being explored. By understanding the changes that occur during the natural ageing processes of platelets, we may be able to identify the triggers for alterations in platelet life span and platelet reactivity. Here we review research on platelet ageing in the context of health and disease, paying particular attention to the experimental approaches taken and the robustness of conclusions that can be drawn.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^114yTnde]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

History

In the late 19 th century improvements to the light microscope led to anucleate platelets being visualized in great numbers in human blood. Early pioneers in the field of platelet research included the Canadian William Osler, a Paris hematologist, George Hayem, who performed the first accurate platelet count, and the Italian Giulio Bizzozero. In 1906, James Homer Wright confirmed that platelets were produced by bone marrow megakaryocytes. When, in 1951, Harrington et al.observed purpura in a child of a mother with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, a maternal factor was said to be destroying the platelets. Anti-platelet antibodies were identified as the cause and platelet transfusions, immunosuppressive therapy and splenectomy became standard treatments. Acquired thrombocytopenia, often with defective platelet function, has many causes. For example, it may be an immune response linked to blood transfusions and drugs, a direct consequence of viral or bacterial infections, be the result of other hematologic disorders or be secondary to many major illnesses. However, some thrombocytopenias are inherited and Professors Jean Bernard and Jean-Pierre Soulier in Paris were pioneers in this domain, describing in 1948 what they called in French " dystrophie thrombocytaire hémorragipare congénitale ", later re-named the Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Strikingly, many platelets were enlarged and some were giant. A key to the molecular defect was the platelet deficit of sialic acid, a negatively charged monosaccharide terminating many of the oligosaccharides of platelet glycoproteins (GP) and some glycolipids. The discovery that a major component of the platelet surface, first identified as "GPI", was absent from platelets in BSS began the long road to defining the molecular landscape of inherited thrombocytopenias. This centenary review will take a concise look at this journey emphasizing major steps in the current understanding of these conditions and highlighting recent advances in what is an intriguing subset of Mendelian diseases.

### Interactions of platelets with obesity in relation to lung cancer risk in the UK biobank cohort [^116LxjSf]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A plausible mechanism linking PLT to lung cancer development would be an inflammation-related platelet increase, as platelets are involved in immuno-inflammatory responses and PLT is high in chronic inflammatory conditions. Inflammatory markers have, indeed, been associated with higher lung cancer risk, more commonly when measured within the years close to diagnosis and in smokers, but also further away from diagnosis and in never smokers. Platelets contribute to cancer-associated inflammation by regulating the migration of haematopoietic and immune cells towards the tumour cite and facilitate cancer progression and metastasis by enabling thrombosis and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which protect cancer cells. Platelet-derived factors are also involved in immunomodulation, as is the case with TREM-like transcript 1 (TLT-1) protein, which is higher in platelets from patients with lung cancer and promotes cancer progression via suppression of CD8 T-cells. The lung may be a particularly vulnerable organ to platelet action, as platelets are released in the lung from circulating megakaryocytes. Although the stronger association with PLT closer to lung cancer diagnosis, described in our and in previous studies, indicates an additional cancer-related PLT increase, the cancer is likely to promote an already operational inflammatory pathway.

Notably, the inverse association of MPV with lung cancer risk in men was observed in the same BMI categories (normal weight and overweight) as the positive association with PLT. This is consistent with the inverse correlation between PLT and MPV, which we have previously shown in UK Biobank for a restricted dataset excluding participants with cardiometabolic conditions and have confirmed in this study for the unrestricted UK Biobank dataset. A potential explanation for an inverse association with MPV coupled to a positive association with PLT would be a trade-off between platelet size and count related to platelet formation, as immature proplatelet intermediates are larger particles and split into two smaller-size platelets in the process of maturation. Mutations in megakaryocyte cytoskeleton proteins are, indeed, accompanied with large platelet size coupled to low platelet number. Therefore, large platelet size may reflect more immature and potentially dysfunctional platelets and, hence, a lower risk of lung cancer development. Large platelet size, however, could also indicate platelet activation, because large platelets are more responsive to stimulation and less susceptible to suppression by aspirin and MPV is associated positively with markers of platelet activation. As platelet activation would result in a positive rather than an inverse association with lung cancer risk, a suggestion has previously been offered that larger activated platelets are engaged in thrombotic events, leaving only smaller platelets in the circulation of patients with lung cancer.

### Service evaluation of R90 bleeding and platelet disorders gene panel in thrombocytopenia cases [^1143kk8E]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thrombocytopenia is found in a heterogeneous group of bleeding disorders with varying clinical implications. In the paediatric population, a large proportion of patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia will be diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP is an autoimmune disorder of peripheral platelet destruction. It is classically described as a diagnosis of exclusion; however, genetic testing is not routinely done at presentation. The role of genetic variants in inherited forms of thrombocytopenia has been established in recent years. These genetic aberrations disrupt various pathways involved in platelet production, regulation and function. Consequently, it is crucial to consider genetic testing in the context of isolated thrombocytopenia in the paediatric population to establish an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategies.

The R90 bleeding and platelet disorders gene panel is a resource available to the NHS in England that allows for the assessment of potential genetic aberrations involved in non‐ITP. The panel also includes genes associated with platelet function and factor disorders. Specifically, the R90.1 panel consists of coagulation and platelet disorders WES or medium panel and the R90.2 consists of F5; F11; MYH9; ENG; ACVRL1; F7; F8; F9; F10; VWF, MLPA or equivalent. The current testing criteria include individuals with a bleeding or platelet disorder of likely monogenic aetiology where there are multiple possible causative genes. In our local practice, we suspect inherited thrombocytopenia disorders when patients exhibit persistent thrombocytopenia from early life, have a positive family history, show distinct characteristics typical of inherited conditions and/or fail to respond to first‐line treatments. It was also considered when a patient was not presenting with the typical history, examination and laboratory findings associated with ITP. Investigations that triggered consideration of a potential inherited platelet disorder were mean platelet volume (MPV) or diameter (MPD) when available or when a peripheral film identified an excessive abundance of large platelets. If there was no improvement in platelet counts, or if the response to initial treatments was suboptimal after 3–6 months, we reevaluated the likelihood of an inherited platelet disorder.

### Platelet biology and functions: new concepts and clinical perspectives [^1167hJVq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Platelets - blood cells continuously produced from megakaryocytes mainly in the bone marrow - are implicated not only in haemostasis and arterial thrombosis, but also in other physiological and pathophysiological processes. This Review describes current evidence for the heterogeneity in platelet structure, age, and activation properties, with consequences for a diversity of platelet functions. Signalling processes of platelet populations involved in thrombus formation with ongoing coagulation are well understood. Genetic approaches have provided information on multiple genes related to normal haemostasis, such as those encoding receptors and signalling or secretory proteins, that determine platelet count and/or responsiveness. As highly responsive and secretory cells, platelets can alter the environment through the release of growth factors, chemokines, coagulant factors, RNA species, and extracellular vesicles. Conversely, platelets will also adapt to their environment. In disease states, platelets can be positively primed to reach a pre-activated condition. At the inflamed vessel wall, platelets interact with leukocytes and the coagulation system, interactions mediating thromboinflammation. With current antiplatelet therapies invariably causing bleeding as an undesired adverse effect, novel therapies can be more beneficial if directed against specific platelet responses, populations, interactions, or priming conditions. On the basis of these novel concepts and processes, we discuss several initiatives to target platelets therapeutically.

### Inherited platelet diseases with normal platelet count: phenotypes, genotypes and diagnostic strategy [^115rnhRV]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Inherited platelet disorders resulting from platelet function defects and a normal platelet count cause a moderate or severe bleeding diathesis. Since the description of Glanzmann thrombasthenia resulting from defects of ITGA2B and ITGB3, new inherited platelet disorders have been discovered, facilitated by the use of high throughput sequencing and genomic analyses. Defects of RASGRP2 and FERMT3 responsible for severe bleeding syndromes and integrin activation have illustrated the critical role of signaling molecules. Important are mutations of P2RY12 encoding the major ADP receptor causal for an inherited platelet disorder with inheritance characteristics that depend on the variant identified. Interestingly, variants of GP6 encoding the major subunit of the collagen receptor GPVI/FcRassociate only with mild bleeding. The numbers of genes involved in dense granule defects including Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak Higashi syndromes continue to progress and are updated. The ANO6 gene encoding a Ca²+-activated ion channel required for phospholipid scrambling is responsible for the rare Scott syndrome and decreased procoagulant activity. A novel EPHB2 defect in a familial bleeding syndrome demonstrates a role for this tyrosine kinase receptor independent of the classical model of its interaction with ephrins. Such advances highlight the large diversity of variants affecting platelet function but not their production, despite the difficulties in establishing a clear phenotype when few families are affected. They have provided insights into essential pathways of platelet function and have been at the origin of new and improved therapies for ischemic disease. Nevertheless, many patients remain without a diagnosis and requiring new strategies that are now discussed.

Clinical Features: Disorders of Primary Hemostasis

Disorders of primary hemostasis are frequently a result of an abnormality in platelet morphology/function or the quantity available to provide hemostasis. Most commonly, these will present as spontaneous petechiae, a capillary hemorrhage that can merge into purpura, or pronounced ecchymosis in the setting of minimal provocation. The most common disorders of primary hemostasis present within orthopaedic surgery include acquired platelet disorders, substantial thrombocytopenia, and von Willebrand disease (vWD).

In surgical settings, platelet disorders may result in wound bleeding. Not all disorders will result in this because of the spectrum of severities. Normal platelet counts are > 150,000/µL, which acts as a large reservoir for platelet formation into a plug for subsequent clot formation. When platelet counts are < 20,000/µL, this is considered substantial thrombocytopenia and notable spontaneous bleeding can be observed. In the setting of this condition, spontaneous bleeding may not occur before surgery, but intraoperatively, considerable hemorrhage may occur. Common pathological conditions causing thrombocytopenia include sepsis or chronic kidney disease. Alternatively, inherited forms of thrombocytopenia are rare and spontaneous bleeding from these conditions is usually identified and diagnosed during childhood.

vWD results in impaired primary and/or secondary hemostasis. It includes a spectrum of severities that ranges from mild mucosal bleeding to life-threatening bleeding. As the severity of vWD increases, the amount of factor VIII in the serum will be lower. Of note, most cases of platelet function disorders are pharmaceutically acquired, as seen in the use of aspirin, NSAIDs, or other antiplatelet medications (eg, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel).

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^112NAnnf]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Platelet size is enlarged in many forms of IT and diagnostic guidelines suggest that this parameter is an important element for distinguishing these conditions from ITP (Geddis & Balduini; Provan et al). However, this statement is mainly based on expert opinion, because only one experimental study has addressed this matter in detail to date (Noris et al). In a single institution case series of patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenias (MYH9 -RD, mono and biallelic BSS) and ITP, the authors measured MPDs by peripheral blood film evaluation and MPVs by two different blood cell analysers (ADVIA 120 [Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany] that uses two-dimensional light scatter and XE-2100 [Sysmex XE] based on the impedance method), and searched for the best cut-off values for distinguishing between ITP and inherited disorders. Results of this study revealed that both cell counters underestimated platelet counts in inherited macrothrombocytopenias with respect to the values obtained by microscope counting in a Neubauer chamber, although this phenomenon was much more evident with the impedentiometric counter (Noris et al). Moreover, the impedance instrument did not report the MPV in all the patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenia owing to the abnormalities in their platelet volume distribution curves. Finally, 3.3 μm for MPD and 12.4 fl for MPV measured by the optical counter were identified by ROC analysis as the best cut-off values for differentiating ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias. Sensitivity and specificity of MPV were 83% and 89% respectively, while those of MPD were 89% and 88%. Thus, Noris et al first demonstrated the effectiveness of platelet size in distinguishing between these conditions.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^1112tXWp]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Distinguishing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from inherited thrombocytopenias (ITs) is not always easy, and several patients with inherited forms have received unnecessary medical treatments or even splenectomy because they were misdiagnosed with ITP (Bader-Meunier et al; Noris et al; Kunishima et al; Gunay-Aygun et al; Savoia et al). Differential diagnosis may be especially difficult when a low platelet count, which can be used to decide whether thrombocytopenia is acquired or congenital, is incidentally discovered in asymptomatic subjects who have never had a blood count performed before. In some cases, family history may solve the diagnostic dilemma, in that the presence of other relatives with low platelet counts strongly argues against ITP and supports an inherited form. Conversely, the absence of affected family members by no means excludes genetic disorders because many ITs are transmitted in a recessive fashion or derive from de novo mutations.

As many forms of IT are characterized by platelet macrocytosis (Balduini & Savoia,), it is commonly accepted that the evaluation of platelet size is an important tool to provoke suspicion of these disorders. However, the accurate measurement of platelet size in IT subjects presents notable difficulties because some of the less rare forms, such as MYH9 -related disease (MYH9 -RD), monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) and biallelic BSS, may present platelets that, due to their very large size, are not recognized by the electronic counters, which therefore underestimates not only the platelet count but also the mean platelet volume (MPV) (Balduini et al; Savoia et al; Noris et al). Moreover, instruments operating on different principles also induce variability into the measurement of MPV in healthy subjects or in subjects with non-macrocytic thrombocytopenias, thus making difficult the direct comparison of MPV values obtained in different centres (Latger-Cannard et al).

### Uncommon phenotypes of-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia [^115AteZL]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia

Apparent thrombocythemia may result from a BCR::ABL1 rearrangement and precede the overt signs of CML. Approximately 5% of patients with apparent essential thrombocythemia have a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The disease closely mimics classical essential thrombocythemia, initially. The signs are marked elevation of the platelet count, arbitrarily set by some at 1,000×10⁹/L or higher, a striking increase in marrow megakaryocytes, frequently with a normal or mildly elevated white cell count with neutrophilia, no or very slight myeloid immaturity in the blood and no or minimal anemia. Setting a specific platelet count is unwise and can be misleading. In circumstances in which the platelet count is strikingly elevated but not yet at the 1,000×10⁹/L level and the white cell count is relatively low and myeloid immaturity less prominent, consideration of BCR::ABL1 thrombocythemia is advisable. Otherwise, one risks not diagnosing BCR::ABL1 -thrombocythemia and not providing TKI therapy. In contrast to classical BCR::ABL1 -positive CML, marrow granulopoiesis may be increased but it is usually not as significantly expanded. The incidence of this variant is heavily skewed toward women(Table 2). The oncogene is usually the classical BCR::ABL1 (M-bcr).

Table 1.
Molecular versions of oncoproteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia.

The marrow megakaryocytes in BCR::ABL1 -positive thrombocythemia are, invariably, smaller than those in normal marrow and have hypolobulated round nuclei. There is little or no clustering of megakaryocytes. These findings are in consistent and distinct contrast to the marrow morphology in essential thrombocythemia, which is often normocellular or moderately hypercellular with increased megakaryocytes that are large to giant in size, have hyperlobulated nuclei, and are distributed in loose clusters. The distinction in the marrow megakaryocyte pattern between BCR::ABL1 -positive-thrombocythemia and essential thrombocythemia is so striking that a hematopathologist may advise the hematologist to test for BCR::ABL1 in this situation.

### What to do when you suspect an inherited platelet disorder [^116N4hpM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that include defects in platelet function and disordered megakaryopoiesis. Some IPDs overlap as both defects in function and thrombopoiesis, resulting in both altered aggregation and/or secretion and thrombocytopenia. This review examines the key features of the presentation of IPDs in children and adults and presents a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of these patients. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of platelet disorders are addressed, with attention given to some of the novel genetic associations. Finally, treatment options and future therapies are briefly discussed.

### Qualitative disorders of platelets and megakaryocytes [^112bt8JK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Qualitative disorders of platelet function and production form a large group of rare diseases which cover a multitude of genetic defects that by and large have as a common symptom, excessive mucocutaneous bleeding. Glanzmann thrombasthenia, is enabling us to learn much about the pathophysiology of integrins and of how alphaIIb beta3 functions. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, an example of macrothrombocytopenia, combines the production of large platelets with a deficit or non-functioning of the major adhesion receptor of platelets, the GPIb-IX-V complex. Amino acid substitutions in GPIb alpha, may lead to up-regulation and spontaneous binding of von Willebrand factor as in Platelet-type von Willebrand disease. In disorders with defects in the MYH9 gene, macrothrombocytopenias are linked to modifications in kidney, eye or ear, whereas other inherited thrombocytopenias variously link a low platelet count with a propensity to leukemia, skeletal defects, learning impairment, and abnormal red cells. Defects of secretion from platelets include an abnormal alpha-granule formation as in the gray platelet syndrome (with marrow myelofibrosis), and of organelle biogenesis in the Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes where platelet dense body defects are linked to abnormalities of other lysosomal-like organelles including melanosomes. Finally, defects involving surface receptors (P2Y(12), TPalpha) for activating stimuli, of proteins essential for signaling pathways (including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and of platelet-derived procoagulant activity (Scott syndrome) show how studies on platelet disorders are helping unravel the pathways of primary hemostasis.

Future strategies

Despite the progress in gene identification a significant proportion of patients still fail to be genotyped. One successful strategy for the identification of causal genes in patients with inherited thrombocytopenia was by comparison with mouse models with similar phenotypes;, Another approach is ongoing screening of local whole exome or whole genome sequencing databases of patients for variants of each newly published IPD gene. A third strategy involves screening large families or those with consanguinity, as done for RASGRP2 and EPHB2, or statistical analysis of large cohorts of patients, aligning variant detection in unrelated families with a similar phenotype. The final proof that variants in new genes are causal will still require their expression in heterologous cells, the use of in silico modeling to assess changes in protein structure, or their reproduction in mouse, zebrafish or other animal models. When no genetic diagnosis has been achieved with standard approaches, gene analysis should be expanded to evaluate complex copy number variations, deep variants in non-coding regions and secondary defects involving the action of microRNA or retrotransposons, as we have detailed elsewhere.

### Platelet size distinguishes between inherited macrothrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia [^112qFkEF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Distinguishing inherited thrombocytopenias from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) can be difficult, and patients are therefore at risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatments. Although it is known that the most common inherited forms of thrombocytopenia are characterized by increased platelet size, the diagnostic power of this feature has never been investigated.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that platelet size can be used to differentiate ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias.

Patients/Methods

We measured mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet diameter (MPD), within 2 h of blood sampling, in 35 patients with inherited macrothrombocytopenias [15 MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD), three biallelic and 17 monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS)], and 56 with ITP. Using receiving operating characteristic analysis, we searched for the best cut-off values to differentiate between these conditions.

Results

As expected, platelets were larger in inherited macrothrombocytopenias than in ITP. An MPD larger than 3.3 mum differentiated MYH9-RD and BSS from ITP with 0.89 sensitivity and 0.88 specificity, and an MPV larger than 12.4 fL had 0.83 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity. Combining MPD with MPV increased sensitivity and specificity to 0.97 and 0.89, respectively.

Conclusion

Platelet size evaluation by both an appropriate cell counter and blood film examination is useful for differentiating inherited macrothrombocytopenias from ITP.

### Learning by counting blood platelets in population studies: survey and perspective a long way after bizzozero [^1175Nm5L]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Platelet count represents a useful tool in clinical practice to discriminate individuals at higher risk of bleeding. Less obvious is the role of platelet count variability within the normal range of distribution in shaping the individual's disease risk profile. Epidemiological studies have shown that platelet count in the adult general population is associated with a number of health outcomes related to hemostasis and thrombosis. However, recent studies are suggesting a possible role of this platelet index also as an independent risk factor. In this review of adult population studies, we will first focus on known genetic and non-genetic determinants of platelet number variability. Next, we will evaluate platelet count as a marker and/or a predictor of disease risk and its interaction with other risk factors. We will then discuss the role of platelet count variability within the normal distribution range as a contribution to disease and mortality risk. The possibility of considering platelet count as a simple, inexpensive indicator of increased risk of disease and death in general populations could open new opportunities to investigate novel platelet pathophysiological roles as well as therapeutic opportunities. Future studies should also consider platelet count, not only platelet function, as a modulator of disease and mortality risk.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^115gAJwa]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

The most frequent forms of inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) are characterized by platelet size abnormalities and it has been suggested that this parameter is useful for their differentiation from immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Recently, a monocentric study identified cut-off values for mean platelet volume (MPV) and mean platelet diameter (MPD) with good diagnostic accuracy in this respect. To validate these cut-off values in a different and larger case series of patients, we enrolled 130 subjects with ITP and 113 with IT in six different centres. The platelet count and MPV was each measured by the instrument routinely used in each institution. In some centres, platelet count was also measured by optical microscopy. MPD was evaluated centrally by image analysis of peripheral blood films. The previously identified cut-off value for MPV had 91% specificity in distinguishing ITP from inherited macrothrombocytopenias (mono and biallelic Bernard-Soulier, MYH9-related disease), while its sensitivity was greatly variable depending on the instrument used. With an appropriate instrument, specificity was 83%. The diagnostic accuracy of MPD was lower than that obtained with MPV. We concluded that MPV is a useful parameter for differentiating ITP from IT provided that it is measured by appropriate cell counters.

Once considered exceptionally rare, congenital thrombocytopenias are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a reduction in platelet number and a bleeding tendency that may range from very mild to life threatening. Although some of these disorders affect only megakaryocytes and platelets, others involve different cell types and may result in characteristic phenotypic abnormalities. This review elaborates the clinical presentation and laboratory manifestations of common congenital thrombocytopenias in addition to exploring our understanding of the molecular basis of these disorders and therapeutic interventions available.

### The rate of platelet activation determines thrombus size and structure at arterial shear [^1149MwVj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The response of platelets to activating stimuli and pharmaceutical agents varies greatly within the normal population. Current platelet function tests are used to measure end-point levels of platelet activation without taking the speed at which platelets activate into account, potentially missing vital metrics to characterize platelet reactivity.

Objectives

To identify variability, to agonists and among individuals, in platelet activation kinetics and assess the impact of this on thrombus formation.

Methods

We have developed a bespoke real-time flow cytometry assay and analysis package to measure the rate of platelet activation over time using 2 parameters of platelet activation, fibrinogen binding and P-selectin exposure.

Results

The rate of platelet activation varied considerably within the normal population but did not correlate with maximal platelet activation, demonstrating that platelet activation rate is a separate and novel metric to describe platelet reactivity. The relative rate of platelet response between agonists was strongly correlated, suggesting that a central control mechanism regulates the rate of platelet response to all agonists.

Conclusion

For the first time, we have shown that platelet response rate corresponds to thrombus size and structure, wherein faster responders form larger, more densely packed thrombi at arterial, but crucially not venous, shear. We have demonstrated that the rate of platelet activation is an important metric in stratifying individual platelet responses and will provide a novel focus for the design and development of antiplatelet therapy, targeting high-shear thrombosis without exacerbating bleeding at low shear.

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^111drvmc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### Platelet size deviation width, platelet large cell ratio, and mean platelet volume have sufficient sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia [^113wL8NS]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

We investigated the significance of the platelet indices, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet size deviation width (PDW), and platelet-large cell ratio (P-LCR), in the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia by comparing these levels in 40 patients with hypo-productive thrombocytopenia (aplastic anaemia; AA) and 39 patients with hyper-destructive thrombocytopenia (immune thrombo-cytopenia; ITP). The sensitivity and specificity of platelet indices to make a diagnosis of ITP were also compared. All platelet indices were significantly higher in ITP than in AA, and platelet indices showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics curve of platelet indices was large enough to enable the diagnosis of ITP. P-LCR and PDW had the largest AUCs, which indicated that these values were very reliable for immune thrombocytopenia. Our results suggest that these indices provide clinical information about the underlying conditions of thrombocytopenia. More attention should be paid to these indices in the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^111DL17M]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Reference ranges for the platelet count

The reference range of the platelet count is traditionally set at 150–400×10⁹/L (with some variations in the higher limit that some guidelines set at 350 or 450×10⁹/L) for all subjects, based on historical studies published in the last decades of the 20 th century. However, it must be emphasized that some studies showed that the platelet count is higher in women than in men and in younger subjects than in the elderly, and may vary in different ethnic populations. Based on the results obtained in 40,987 subjects enrolled in population-based studies in seven areas of Italy, a sex- and age-adapted reference range has been proposed for the Italian population (Figure 1). The important message of these studies is that platelet count values slightly lower than 150×10⁹/L in adult subjects can be considered normal. A population-based study in France, which enrolled 33,258 individuals, while confirming the sex-related differences, showed that the lower limit of platelet count in adult individuals was higher than in the Italian population (161 and 187×10⁹/L in men and women, respectively).

### Multiparameter platelet function analysis of bleeding patients with a prolonged platelet function analyser closure time [^116VD4NC]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although addition of healthy platelets, in vitro, did not fully rescue the reduction in thrombus formation, an increase in platelet aggregate size was observed when platelet count was increased by 40% by addition of healthy platelets. This result suggests that substantial platelet transfusion will be needed to normalize thrombus formation and to prevent bleeding in PFA‐only patients. In‐vivo experiments, before and after platelet transfusion in PFA‐only patients, are needed to investigated this in detail.

Both the PFA‐100 and the microfluidic test rely on combined processes of shear‐dependent primary (collagen) and secondary (autocrine) platelet activation along with VWF function. Exome sequencing of a large panel of genes associated with coagulation, thrombotic, or platelet disorders, did not reveal a monogenic explanation (e.g. a TIER1 mutation) for the abnormalities found in the PFA‐only patients. This does not exclude genetic variations in unknown genes involved in the VWF–platelet interactions, or the accumulative effects of a number of common variants, which might result in the abnormalities found (Tier‐2/3 mutations were not tested, since there are no prior data on how these affect platelet traits under high‐shear conditions). Furthermore, for the majority of patients we are not aware of a familial history of bleeding, which includes the possibility of an acquired or somatic mutation effect. Some of the patients had low–normal VWF. We hypothesize that the bleeding disorder in PFA‐only patients is multifactorial, and includes combinations of low VWF, Tier‐2/3 mutations of platelet function genes, reduced autocrine processes and acquired or somatic platelet defects. Furthermore, there may be a relation with the novel shear‐dependent receptor GRP56, but nothing is known about the expression variability of this receptor.

### GPVI expression is linked to platelet size, age, and reactivity [^112ywziS]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Circulating platelets are heterogeneous in structure and age, as well as in their activation response upon stimulation during thrombus formation. This leads to a diversity of platelet populations with distinct or overlapping functions, including aggregating, secreting, or procoagulant platelet populations. This heterogeneity in function appears during the exposure of a platelet to different adhesive surfaces, agonists, blood flow patterns, and other cells. However, intrinsic differences in platelet size, levels of intracellular and membrane proteins, and platelet age are also important in defining these distinct platelet populations. How precisely these intrinsic factors arbitrate the reactivity of a platelet is not yet known.

More specifically, the exact relation between platelet age and platelet size is still not well established in humans. A larger platelet size (mean platelet volume) is associated with poorer outcomes in prothrombotic disorders such as sepsis and cardiovascular disease. In these conditions, platelet turnover is increased, and circulating platelets are younger. Currently, larger platelets are considered to be juvenile because they may not have yet shed their granules. Platelets can absorb many substances, however, which might increase platelet size during their life span. Others argue that the heterogeneity in platelet size originates from the thrombopoiesis from megakaryocytes and is not influenced by platelet age. Experiments in baboons revealed that size and age are independent determinants of platelet reactivity. It remains unclear how strong platelet age and size determine platelet reactivity and which additional features exist that characterize highly responsive platelets.

We and others have shown that larger platelets respond remarkably stronger to several platelet agonists, such as thrombin or collagen, than smaller platelets. Furthermore, large platelets contain and mobilize more Ca²+ from their intracellular stores upon activation and have a predisposition to expose phosphatidylserine on their membranes compared with small platelets. Conversely, small platelets exhibit enhanced integrin α IIb β 3 activation in response to adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP). Other groups found that reticulated juvenile platelets are more responsive compared with nonreticulated ones.

In this study, we have combined a differential centrifugation protocol to separate size fractions and novel markers for juvenile platelet identification to further dissect the relation between platelet size, age, and reactivity. To determine the reactivity of the differently sized platelets in a more biologically relevant setting, we used a model of whole-blood thrombus formation under flow. In addition, we characterize the associations between platelet size and age, receptor expression, and their response to agonists using multicolor flow cytometry and clustering algorithms.

Deficiencies in size, number or shape of platelet granules are associated with bleeding symptoms.
Super‐resolution microscopy (SRM) facilitates the diagnosis of structural platelet disorders.
SRM can deliver quantitative, automated, unbiased high‐throughput morphometric analyses.
Using CD63 as a marker, Hermansky‐Pudlak patients are easily distinguished from controls.

Summary

Background

Many platelet functions are dependent on bioactive molecules released from their granules. Deficiencies of these granules in number, shape or content are associated with bleeding. The small size of these granules is such that imaging them for diagnosis has traditionally required electron microscopy. However, recently developed super‐resolution microscopes provide sufficient spatial resolution to effectively image platelet granules. When combined with automated image analysis, these methods provide a quantitative, unbiased, rapidly acquired dataset that can readily and reliably reveal differences in platelet granules between individuals.

Objective

To demonstrate the ability of structured illumination microscopy to efficiently differentiate between healthy volunteers and three patients with Hermansky‐Pudlak syndrome.

Methods

Blood samples were taken from three patients with Hermansky‐Pudlak syndrome and seven controls. Patients 1–3 have gene defects in 1, 6 and 5, respectively; all controls were healthy volunteers. Platelet‐rich plasma was isolated from blood and the platelets fixed, stained for63 and processed for analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy, using a custom‐builtmicroscope.

Results

can successfully resolve63‐positive structures in fixed platelets. A determination of the number of63‐positive structures per platelet allowed us to conclude that each patient was significantly different from all of the controls with 99% confidence.

Conclusions

A super‐resolution imaging approach is effective and rapid in objectively differentiating between patients with a platelet bleeding disorder and healthy volunteers.63 is a useful marker for predicting Hermansky‐Pudlak syndrome and could be used in the diagnosis of patients suspected of other platelet granule disorders.

### Percentage of small platelets on peripheral blood smear and child-turcott-pugh class can predict the presence of oesophageal varices in newly diagnosed patients with cirrhosis: development of a prediction model for resource limited settings [^113boezN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Method of data collection

An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to record demographic, clinical, biochemical and ultrasonographic parameters, CTP class, UGIE findings & haematological parameters.
Assessment of esophageal varices by UGIE

All patients underwent diagnostic UGIE to document the presence or absence as well as the grading of OV according to variceal size: small OV with < 5 mm in size with minimal elevation from the mucosal surface or large OV > 5 mm in size involving more than one third of the esophageal mucosa, according to the World Gastroenterology Organization practice guidelines on OV.
b) Assessment of haematological parameters and peripheral blood morphology

Two mL of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated blood was collected prior to any transfusions and processed by an automated hematology analyzer in order to obtain the following hematological readings: Total white blood count (WBC), differential leukocyte count (DC), hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), red cell count (RCC), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV).

Peripheral blood smears were stained by Leishman stain. The blood films were assessed by a Consultant Haematologist, blinded for clinical and endoscopic findings of the patients, for the presence of target cells, macrocytes, fragmented cells and other abnormalities. In addition, assessment of visual platelet count was done in order to overcome possible errors with the automated haematology analyzer. The platelet size was assessed morphologically and divided into three groups: small, normal and large and giant size. Small platelets were defined as nearly pinpoint, large platelets defined as closer towards red cell size and normal size defined as in between small and large.

### Admission platelet count and indices as predictors of outcome in children with severe sepsis: a prospective hospital-based study [^115BHjyB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Meanwhile, the non-survivors had significantly larger MPV than the survivors. This situation may be caused by production of many cytokines, endothelial damage, and bone marrow suppression in septic patients. A study by Margetic, in 2012 showed that MPV acts as an acute phase reactant in different inflammatory conditions, they stated that high MPV levels were associated with high-grade inflammation owing to the presence of large platelets in circulation. Two prospective studies demonstrated significant correlations between increased MPV and short-term mortality. Also, a study by Tajarernmuang et al. in 2016, on adults, revealed that the gradual increase in MPV after a few days of admission was associated with increased hospital mortality. An elevation of MPV suggests that the infection is invasive and uncontrolled and is related to the severity of the disease, a finding which was verified in our study, and may be useful as an assessment tool for outcome prognosis.

Furthermore, a study by Sezgi et al. in 2015 showed that in patients with sepsis the MPV level was increasing during the course of the disease in non-survivors, while it was found to be decreasing in the surviving group.

In our study PDW increased in non-survivors than survivors, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. The PDW is increased when there is an increase in number and size of platelet pseudopodia. Platelet activation causes morphologic changes of platelets, including both spherical shape and pseudopodia formation. Platelets with increased number and size of pseudopodia differ in size, which affects PDW. In a previous study, PDW was significantly higher in patients with asserted platelet activation compared with healthy persons.

Platelet ratios calculated in this study, MPV/PLT, MPV/PCT, PDW/PLT, PDW/PCT, were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors. This is in accordance with a previous study in 2016 by Golwala et al. who found these ratios to be predictors of mortality in children.

### A genome-wide association study of blood cell morphology identifies cellular proteins implicated in disease aetiology [^113ZEGai]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Identification of platelet α-granule proteins

Firstly, we conducted a literature review to identify proteins localised to platelet α-granules by mass spectrometry –, electron microscopy, immunogold labelling, or platelet sub-fractionation –; cytoskeletal proteins were excluded. Proteins identified in the platelet releasate were included, absent other evidence that they were α-granule proteins –. Secondly, we performed a differential abundance analysis comparing the platelets of patients with grey platelet syndrome (GPS; n = 5), which lack α-granules, to those of healthy controls (n = 5). Platelets were isolated, analysed by mass spectrometry, and normalised abundance values (NAVs) were calculated for each protein detected. We performed two-sample Student's t -tests (without assuming equal variances) to test for a difference in the mean of the log NAVs of each protein between the two conditions. Proteins for which the test was significant (unadjusted P -value ≤ 0.05) and for which the log-ratios were greater than 2 standard deviations from the median were considered to be differentially abundant. Differentially abundant proteins that were less abundant in GPS platelets than controls were assumed to be localised to the platelet α-granule.

The effect of rs6993770 on the average plasma concentrations of proteins expressed in platelets

We extracted from the results of Sun et al. the statistics summarising the univariate associations of rs6993770 with 1456 proteins showing strong evidence for expression in MKs (RNA-seq log₂ FPKM > 1). The estimated effect size corresponding to 215 of these proteins was sufficiently large to correspond to an unadjusted P -value < 1×10⁻³. 44 of these were localised to α-granules, of which 40 had negative estimated T-allelic effect sizes, while 171 were not localised to α-granules, of which 101 had negative T-allelic effect sizes. We performed a Fisher's exact test for the corresponding 2×2 table.

Using a dataset in which each row corresponded to one of 1456 plasma proteins studied by Sun et al. and expressed in MKs (log₂ FPKM > 1), we performed a linear regression of the estimated effect size of rs6993770-T on a dummy variable indicating α-granule localisation while adjusting for the abundance of the mRNA transcripts for the corresponding genes in MKs.

### Sparse matrix factorization robust to sample sharing across GWASs reveals interpretable genetic components [^115oGhZJ]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Among platelet factors, F4 had the strongest selection coefficient estimate (, the fifth largest magnitude in the entire analysis). Consistent with negative selection acting on large-effect SNPs, top F4 SNPs had larger average effect-size magnitudes across MPV, PCT, and PDW than F11 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test,) and F23 SNPs (Figure S17). Given this selection signature, we speculated that variants captured by F4 might adversely influence human fitness.

We also observed that PCT and MPV had opposite directions of effect in F4 (Figure 4 D), suggesting that F4 SNPs drive platelet volume and platelet count in opposing directions. This is consistent with the previously reported negative correlation between GWAS effects for these traitsand with negative correlation of the traits themselves across patients. Published work has hypothesized that alleles contributing to both lower PCT and elevated MPV could explain hereditary cases of the blood condition macrothrombocytopenia. Hereditary macrothrombocytopenia (HMTP) is characterized by elevated platelet size (> 12 fL) and low platelet counts (< 150,000/μL)and is associated with many other blood-related diseases (e.g. sitosterolemia [MIM:], gray platelet syndrome [MIM:], Bernard-Soulier syndrome [MIM:], platelet-type bleeding disorders [MIM:,], and cancer susceptibility [MIM:]). While previously thought to be a Mendelian condition, growing evidence from GWASs suggests polygenic contributions to both HMTP and other blood diseases.

### What It takes to be a platelet: evolving concepts in platelet production [^111h5h13]. Circulation Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Platelets are among the most abundant cells within the circulation. Given that the platelet lifespan is 7 to 10 days in humans, a constant production of around 100 billion platelets per day is required. Platelet production from precursor cells called megakaryocytes is one of the most enigmatic processes in human biology. Although it has been studied for over a century, there is still controversy about the exact mechanisms leading to platelet release into circulation. The formation of proplatelet extensions from megakaryocytes into bone marrow sinusoids is the best-described mechanism explaining the origin of blood platelets. However, using powerful imaging techniques, several emerging studies have recently raised challenging questions in the field, suggesting that small platelet-sized structures called buds might also contribute to the circulating platelet pool. How and whether these structures differ from microvesicles or membrane blebs, which have previously been described to be released from megakaryocytes, is still a matter of discussion. In this review, we will summarize what the past and present have revealed about platelet production and whether mature blood platelets might emerge via different mechanisms.

### GPVI expression is linked to platelet size, age, and reactivity [^115QXQyf]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study is somewhat in contrast to a recent study by Gupta et al, who found a GPVI signaling defect in juvenile mouse platelets after GPIbα antibody–mediated platelet depletion. The different observations may result from various antibodies inducing thrombocytopenia. Moreover, a complete depletion of platelets resembling similar conditions in humans compared with the mouse study is, for many reasons, not possible and therefore makes comparisons difficult.

In accordance with the pivotal studies performed by Thompson et al-in the 1980s, our results underpin that platelet size and age independently affect platelet reactivity for 2 reasons: (1) RNA-poor large platelets exist with apparently lower reactivity; and (2) RNA-rich small platelets exist with a higher reactivity compared with their RNA- counterparts. We found that reactivity was closely linked to GPVI expression. We suggest that ADP activation promotes the formation of a pro-aggregatory platelet population, which may predominantly involve smaller platelets. This concept needs further evaluation in upcoming studies.

In summary, we could establish a link between GPVI expression, platelet size, age, and reactivity. Our findings are important to better target highly reactive juvenile platelets in future studies addressing platelet subpopulations, to improve platelet storage, and to investigate diseases with increased proportions of juvenile platelets such as ITP.

### Mechanisms of increased mitochondria-dependent necrosis in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome platelets [^111aNA7Q]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The model, therefore, predicted that the size of platelets from untreated WAS patients would negatively affect the platelets' ability to expose PS spontaneously and (if this is the mechanism underlying thrombocytopenia) positively affect the patients' platelet count. Interestingly, there was a significant positive correlation between platelet size and platelet count among the untreated WAS patients (Online Supplementary Figure S7A). Although we did not observe significant correlations with PS exposure, probably as a result of the limited number of samples (Online Supplementary Figure S7B, C), it is interesting that patient #18 (indicated with a red arrow), who had normal-sized platelets and a mild phenotype, also had the least PS exposure upon immobilization and incidentally the highest platelet count.

### Inherited platelet diseases with normal platelet count: phenotypes, genotypes and diagnostic strategy [^114nsedE]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Genotype

Several hundred GT patients and their families have undergone gene sequencing. Mutations extend across both ITGA2B and ITGB3 and include missense mutations, stop codons, small deletions, inserts or duplications, splice defects often with frame-shifts. In classic GT, defects prevent or greatly limit the passage of the affected subunit (and the pro-IIb3 precursor) across the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The absence or incorrect conformation of one subunit results in the destruction of both the mutated and the unused normal subunit in maturing megakaryocytes. An exception is the ability of 3 to complex with v, forming v3, which is present in small amounts in platelets but is a major integrin of endothelial and other cells. For both ITGA2B and ITGB3 defects the bleeding phenotype predominates and the absence of v3 does not lead to major additive defects. Large gene deletions are rare. Recent haplotype analysis suggests that the mutational landscape of GT is constantly renewing.

### Intermittent low platelet counts hampering diagnosis of X-linked thrombocytopenia in children: report of two unrelated cases and a novel mutation in the gene coding for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein [^1128yjdn]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is a broad differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients. However, ITP is often considered the main cause of this finding, which can occur in up to 1 per 20,000 children per year in the United States. In this report, we described two cases of inherited thrombocytopenia previously misdiagnosed as ITP. Both cases presented small platelets with persistently low MPV, illustrating the importance of platelet morphology assessment by combining peripheral blood smear evaluation, and platelet parameters in the automated blood count.

In pediatric population, ITP is usually triggered by previous infection or vaccination, and by six months after the onset, 75% of cases are expected to achieve complete remission. In this way, those cases presenting with persistent or recurrent thrombocytopenia should be carefully evaluated for alternative diagnoses.

A differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia should always consider platelet size, as proposed in Table 1. In addition, further characteristics of clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, can contribute for diagnosis in cases with thrombocytopenia. Both the presence of giant platelets and Döhle-like inclusion bodies in neutrophils are consistent to an autosomal dominant disorder, known as MYH9-related macrothrombocytopenia. In contrast, presence of parental consanguinity increases the probability of autosomal recessive disorders, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Furthermore, wide variation of platelet counts, severe thrombocytopenia in very young children (e.g. < 20 × 10⁹/L), and the history of preceding infection are more frequently seen in patients with ITP.

### Congenital platelet disorders and understanding of platelet function [^113KX1WT]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Genetic defects of platelets constitute rare diseases that include bleeding syndromes of autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked inheritance. They affect platelet production, resulting in a low circulating platelet count and changes in platelet morphology, platelet function, or a combination of both with altered megakaryopoiesis and a defective platelet response. As a result, blood platelets fail to fulfil their haemostatic function. Most studied of the platelet function disorders are deficiencies of glycoprotein mediators of adhesion and aggregation while defects of primary receptors for stimuli include the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Studies on inherited defects of (i) secretion from storage organelles (dense granules, α-granules), (ii) the platelet cytoskeleton and (iii) the generation of pro-coagulant activity have identified genes indirectly controlling the functional response. Signalling pathway defects leading to agonist-specific modifications of platelet aggregation are the current target of exome-sequencing strategies. We now review recent advances in the molecular characterization of platelet function defects.

### Red blood cell aggregation within a blood clot causes platelet-independent clot shrinkage [^114WnCM3]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several other conceivable options that remain to be studied. RBC aggregation can normally contribute to the platelet-driven clot contraction of hemostatic clots and pathological thrombi. The extent of such contribution may be relatively small because the weaker RBC aggregation forces can be swamped out by the stronger contractile forces of activated platelets. In addition, RBC-induced shrinkage is likely to compete with platelet-driven contraction in venous thrombi with especially small amounts of platelets, such as chronic thrombi, thrombi in larger veins, or those associated with slower blood flow that may have a higher proportion of fibrin and RBCs. Notably, the volume fraction of platelets in venous thrombi is < 1% compared with > 60% for RBCs. Finally, the contribution of RBCs to blood clot shrinkage is likely to be substantial when there are few and/or dysfunctional platelets in the blood in combination with high RBC counts, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and other myeloproliferative neoplasms, as well as RBC transfusion in severe pancytopenia.

In summary, this study provides compelling evidence that RBCs play a role in blood clot shrinkage unrelated to platelets. The main mechanism underlying the RBC aggregation within a clot is depletion interactions occurring when RBCs are embedded in close proximity to each other within the pores of the fibrin network. The potential pathophysiological significance of the RBC-induced clot shrinkage may be attributed to the ability of RBC aggregation to reinforce the platelet-driven blood clot contraction and/or promote clot compaction in thrombocytopenia and/or thrombocytopathies, especially associated with polycythemia, and in other pathological conditions with extremely low platelet content in thrombi. Certainly, the newly described phenomenon of RBC-mediated clot shrinkage needs further research to fully elucidate its (patho)physiological significance. As a part of these investigations, future studies must focus on biological and physical properties of RBC-shrunken clots, including permeability, sensitivity to fibrinolysis, mechanical properties, and much more.

DISCUSSION

Platelet activation involves major morphological changes, beginning by platelets spherization due to a cytoskeletal rearrangement. Next, platelets develop filipodial extensions before they spread and aggregate. Functional assays are based on these morphological changes; for example, LTA mainly visualizes platelet spherization and aggregation. IFC provides access to images, delivers a large amount of data on cell size, shape and texture and thus allowing a detailed discrimination of cell types and states (including platelets). Thus, IFC reasonably appears to be a perfect candidate for the detection of morphometric changes associated with platelet activation — particularly in a context of HIT.

We compared TRAP‐6‐activated platelets (the positive control) and non‐activated platelets (the negative control) with regard to various size, shape and texture features. Area, circularity, contrast, diameter and major axis differed significantly between the two conditions highlighting their interest in platelet activation identification. Furthermore, cross‐linking the FcγRIIa receptor with an anti‐CD9 antibody led to similar increases in size and shape features, while contrast and modulation decreased. This highlights that platelet and platelet aggregates structures may vary depending on the activator used. It had previously been shown that area and circularity are elevated in platelets expressing phosphatidylserine, and area has been used to identify circulating platelet aggregates in COVID‐19 patients. However, the relevance of the other features is described here for the first time.

### Platelet size for distinguishing between inherited thrombocytopenias and immune thrombocytopenia: a multicentric, real life study [^112MBTd3]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

As shown in Fig 1, MPD was significantly higher than ITP in MYH9 -RD and biallelic BSS, while it was lower than ITP in ANKRD26 -RT. Of note, as for MPV, the variability of platelet diameters within each category of patients was large. As the measure of MPDs was centralized, we can exclude that technical differences played an important role in this variability, which, therefore has to be considered actual. Investigating the role of differences in genetic background, causative mutations, age or sex in this variability requires a very large number of patients for each disorder and, therefore, was not an aim of our study.

The absence of platelet α-granules is also a characteristic of children with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome, a severe AR multisystem disorder especially affecting the kidneys and linked to mutations in VPS33B and VPS16B, genes encoding proteins involved in α-granule biogenesis; however, platelet count and size are often normal and this syndrome is not included in Online Supplementary Table S1. A paucity of α-granules in platelets of patients with X-linked mutations in GATA1 is explained by its long-distance regulation of NBEAL2. The transcription factor, GATA1, in complex with its cofactor FOG1 acts as a gene repressor in hematopoietic cell lineages including megakaryocytes and red blood cells. It was first identified as a cause of macrothrombocytopenia with moderate to severe bleeding by Nichols et al. who found a p.V205M mutation in siblings with severe thrombocytopenia and dyserythropoietic anemia. Most GATA1 mutations result in dysmegakaryopoiesis with the marrow often containing an abundance of small megakaryocytes; the red blood cell abnormalities include features that can be observed in β-thalassemia and also congenital erythropoietic porphyria. Phenotypic variation is considerable and the condition often improves with age. A loss of collagen-induced platelet aggregation in some patients remains unexplained. Macrothrombocytopenia, an absence of platelet α-granules and red blood cell defects variably characterize patients with AD germline mutations in GFI1B, a transcriptional repressor and key regulator of hematopoiesis. The macrothrombocytopenia can be accompanied by platelet function defects and myelofibrosis; bleeding is mostly mild or even absent but may be severe after trauma. Abnormal megakaryocyte maturation and proplatelet formation contribute to the macrothrombocytopenia. The phenotype depends on the site and nature of the mutation and the GFI1B isoform affected. Haploinsufficiency or non-functioning of GATA1 or GFI1B will change the activation of a number of genes coding for proteins maintaining platelet function.

Gray platelet syndrome and related disorders

A qualitative disorder characterized by moderate macrothrombocytopenia with "gray-colored" platelets on a stained blood smear, gray platelet syndrome has mostly AR inheritance. Patients have enlarged platelets lacking α-granules and their storage pool of proteins. Thrombocytopenia is often progressive and bleeding highly variable. Enlarged spleens, myelofibrosis, high serum vitamin B12 levels and reduced platelet function help define the phenotype. In 2011, three groups using different approaches including next-generation WES and RNA profiling showed that mutations in NBEAL2 caused gray platelet syndrome in large, but distinct cohorts of patients (data reviewed by Chen et al.). NBEAL2 is a scaffolding protein involved in α-granule ontogeny. Mouse Nbeal2 −/− models recapitulated the gray platelet syndrome phenotype and showed how the lack of the secretory pool of biologically active proteins affects wound healing, and has consequences for thrombosis and inflammation. Cultured megakaryocytes from patients with NBEAL2 mutations interacted abnormally with extracellular matrix proteins, including type I collagen, with reduced proplatelet formation and branching. Extensive emperipolesis of neutrophils by the megakaryocytes is another feature of gray platelet syndrome. Although altered neutrophil structure and increased infections were reported in early studies on this syndrome, only recently was a role for NBEAL2 in immunity confirmed. New avenues for research on autoimmunity and inflammation in gray platelet syndrome have now opened.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^116u7qVw]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Single allele missense mutations in ACTN1 encoding α-actinin were first identified in Japanese patients with moderate thrombocytopenia and in a large French pedigree by WES and by genome-wide linkage analysis. Their presence was later revealed as quite common in a non-syndromic form of thrombocytopenia with mild or no bleeding although blood loss can be a problem after surgery. α-Actinin is a dimeric protein that cross-links actin filaments into bundles; mutations affecting functional domains act in a dominant-negative manner to disrupt actin filament organization and proplatelet structure in megakaryocytes. Platelet size changes are variable between patients. It is a quite common form of mild inherited thrombocytopenia. –

A final cytoskeletal gene identified by WES in two human pedigrees with macrothrombocytopenia is TPM4 encoding tropomyosin 4, another actin-binding protein. A premature stop codon on a single allele segregated with platelet size increases and a low platelet count. Gene identification was helped by phenotype comparison with a mouse conditional knockout model and confirmed by short hairpin RNA knockdown of TPM4 in normal human megakaryocytes. Platelet function was affected although bleeding was mild. Megakaryocytes in culture produced abundant proplatelets but with fewer branches and enlarged tips, the latter being a standard finding in patients with defects of genes encoding for cytoskeletal proteins, which results in a dynamic re-organization of the cytoskeleton.

Quite remarkably, all of the eight genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and which give rise to macrothrombocytopenia do so with AD inheritance (Online Supplementary Table S1).

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

May-Hegglin anomaly is the presentation of a qualitative platelet disorder characterised by large platelets, thrombocytopenia and granulocyte inclusions as a result of mutations in the MYH9 gene. Though often overlooked given its rarity, it should be considered in patients who present with epistaxis, bruising, menorrhagia and easy bleeding as it can be mistaken for other diagnoses resulting in unnecessary treatments and tests. Our case study reports one presentation of this anomaly and can help broaden awareness of the presentation of this type of patient.

Bleeding disorders due to platelet dysfunction are a common hematologic complication affecting patients, and typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding or hemorrhage. An inherited platelet disorder should be suspected in individuals with a suggestive family history and no identified secondary causes of bleeding. Genetic defects have been described at all levels of platelet activation, including receptor binding, signaling, granule release, cytoskeletal remodeling, and platelet hematopoiesis. Management of these disorders is typically supportive, with an emphasis on awareness, patient education, and anticipatory guidance to prevent future episodes of bleeding.

### Inherited disorders of platelet function: selected updates [^1134JJUL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

The gene variants responsible for the primary genotype of many platelet disorders have now been identified. Next-generation sequencing technology (NGST), mainly exome sequencing, has highlighted genes responsible for defects in platelet secretion (NBEAL2, gray platelet syndrome), procoagulant activity (STIM1, Stormorken syndrome), and activation pathways (RASGRP2, CalDAG-GEFI deficiency and integrin dysfunction; PRKACG, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase deficiency). Often disorders of platelet function are associated with a modified platelet production with changes in platelet number and size and can accompany malfunction of other organs or tissues. Most families have private mutations, and gene variants may prevent protein synthesis, abrogate function, or result in aberrant activated proteins. Nevertheless, bleeding severity is difficult to predict by genotype alone suggesting other factors. A major new challenge of NGST is to identify these factors and help improve patient care. This review concentrates on recent developments and is illustrated from personal observations.

### Genetics of inherited thrombocytopenias [^117MGT2x]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The inherited thrombocytopenia syndromes are a group of disorders characterized primarily by quantitative defects in platelet number, though with a variety demonstrating qualitative defects and/or extrahematopoietic findings. Through collaborative international efforts applying next-generation sequencing approaches, the list of genetic syndromes that cause thrombocytopenia has expanded significantly in recent years, now with over 40 genes implicated. In this review, we focus on what is known about the genetic etiology of inherited thrombocytopenia syndromes and how the field has worked to validate new genetic discoveries. We highlight the important role for the clinician in identifying a germline genetic diagnosis and strategies for identifying novel causes through research-based endeavors.

### FlnA-null megakaryocytes prematurely release large and fragile platelets that circulate poorly [^1117pz3K]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Filamin A (FlnA) is a large cytoplasmic protein that crosslinks actin filaments and anchors membrane receptors and signaling intermediates. FlnA(loxP) PF4-Cre mice that lack FlnA in the megakaryocyte (MK) lineage have a severe macrothrombocytopenia because of accelerated platelet clearance. Macrophage ablation by injection of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes increases blood platelet counts in FlnA(loxP) PF4-Cre mice and reveals the desintegration of FlnA-null platelets into microvesicles, a process that occurs spontaneously during storage. FlnA(loxP) PF4-Cre bone marrows and spleens have a 2.5- to 5-fold increase in MK numbers, indicating increased thrombopoiesis in vivo. Analysis of platelet production in vitro reveals that FlnA-null MKs prematurely convert their cytoplasm into large CD61(+) platelet-sized particles, reminiscent of the large platelets observed in vivo. FlnA stabilizes the platelet von Willebrand factor receptor, as surface expression of von Willebrand factor receptor components is normal on FlnA-null MKs but decreased on FlnA-null platelets. Further, FlnA-null platelets contain multiple GPIbα degradation products and have increased expression of the ADAM17 and MMP9 metalloproteinases. Together, the findings indicate that FlnA-null MKs prematurely release large and fragile platelets that are removed rapidly from the circulation by macrophages.

### Analysis of platelet count and new cancer diagnosis over a 10-year period [^116yS7mA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer often have an abnormally high platelet count at the time of diagnosis (thrombocytosis), defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L (to convert to ×10³ per microliter, divide by 1.0). A normal platelet count falls between 150 and 450 × 10⁹/L and varies with the age and sex of the individual. Several conditions that commonly cause an elevated platelet count include acute blood loss, infection, and inflammation. Solid tumor cancers can sometimes lead to an elevated platelet count to the extent that an undiagnosed cancer is often considered in the diagnostic workup of a patient with thrombocytosis. Cancer is believed to induce platelet formation through the release of interleukin 6, a proinflammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of thrombopoietin hormone. Elevated levels of thrombopoietin have a direct effect on increased platelet production. Excess levels of thrombopoietin in the blood stimulate megakaryocyte cell division in the bone marrow, which in turn leads to platelet formation.

An elevated platelet count has been shown to be associated with short-term risk of cancer in the general population. Prospective studies evaluating platelet count and survival among patients with newly diagnosed cancer have also noted a high proportion of patients who presented with thrombocytosis. The excess risk associated with an elevated platelet count varies by cancer site but has been most studied for lung, colon, and gastric cancers. The full range of cancers associated with a high platelet count and whether risks associated with platelet counts within the high-normal range exist remain unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the association between a high platelet count and cancer is transient or prolonged. Based on results of previous studies, a high platelet count may be a risk factor for developing cancer or, alternatively, a marker indicative of an undetected cancer. It is also not clear whether an increasing platelet count is a better indicator of a new cancer than is a high but steady platelet count.

We identified a cohort of adult residents in Ontario, Canada, who had 1 or more routine blood tests performed for a complete blood count (CBC) including platelet counts and subsequently received a diagnosis of cancer to assess the range of cancers associated with a high platelet count. We also examined whether an increasing platelet count is associated with an increased cancer risk.

RASGRP2-(CalDAG-GEFI)-related disease

In 2014 a missense mutation (p.G248W) in RASGRP2 coding for calcium and diacylglycerol-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor I (CalDAG-GEFI) was reported for siblings with a severe bleeding disorder and much reduced platelet aggregation despite normal IIb3 levels. Since this report, a characteristic GT-like defect of platelet function has been confirmed worldwide for 23 cases, as recently reviewed by Canault and Alessi.

Definition

Gene variants of RASGRP2 represent a new autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder linked to major defects of platelet signaling resulting in impaired IIb3 activation (Figure 2). CalDAG-GEFI activates Rap1, which initiates "inside-out" signaling for IIb3 promoting the binding of talin to shift the integrin into its high-affinity state. Both mouse and human platelets lacking functional CalDAG-GEFI undergo a slow but sustained activation that supports the formation of small thrombi at low shear such as those found in the venous system but not the large thrombi characteristic of arterial blood flow.

Clinical phenotype

Bleeding manifestations start early in life and can be severe. Epistaxis is common and most patients have other cutaneous bleeds. Gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported in four patients and menorrhagia in seven out of nine women. The bleeding diathesis is not truly syndromic; CalDAG-GEFI is found in other blood cell lineages, vascular cells and the brain striatum and has been implicated in Huntington disease. It often occurs in ethnic groups. One case, a male of Jamaican origin, successfully underwent surgery for a brain tumor under recombinant activated factor VII administration despite inefficacy of platelet transfusions.

### Identification of platelet function defects by multi-parameter assessment of thrombus formation [^111Z9t7y]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Thrombus formation was also assessed in blood from rare patients with established platelet function disorders. Heatmap mean data were generated for the control subjects and the individual patients under investigation (Fig. 8a, b). These data were further evaluated in subtraction heatmaps and significance maps (Fig. 8c, d).

Thrombus formation was assessed in blood from a patient with severe immune deficiency syndrome (SCID), associated with near-complete deficiency in store-induced calcium entry in haematopoietic cells including platelets. In spite of a reduced morphological score of thrombus formation, platelet activation parameters on surfaces producing type III thrombi, that is, vWF/rhodocytin and collagen I, were increased in comparison with control subjects (Fig. 8d, e). This may point to increased CLEC-2- and GPVI-dependent platelet activation under high shear flow, for example, compensating for the absence of one of the calcium entry pathways. Blood samples were also examined from a patient with May–Hegglin anomaly, characterized by a myosin cytoskeletal defect and macrothrombocytopenia, in which disease the consequences for platelet function are not well understood. Thrombus formation parameters were mostly within the normal range, with the exception of reduced platelet aggregate formation (morphological score, integrated feature size, platelet deposition) on GPVI-binding surfaces (vWF, vWF/GFOGER-(GPO) n, collagen I). Most values for nonGPVI-binding surfaces were in the normal range. However, platelet procoagulant activity tended to be higher on two-component surfaces.

Platelet-type von Willebrand disease and type 2B von Willebrand disease

GPIbα has seven leucine-rich repeats and flanking regions near its N-terminus; the mucin-like domain follows with the many negatively charged O-linked oligosaccharides that provide rigidity. In platelet-type von Willebrand disease, AD gain-of-function missense mutations within the leucine-rich repeats (and 1 deletion outside the repeats) promote spontaneous binding of large VWF multimers. As a result, the higher molecular weight multimers are decreased or absent in plasma. Cross-linking of platelets by VWF favors platelet clumping and a high sensitivity to ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. In culture, spontaneous binding of VWF multimers to maturing megakaryocytes inappropriately activates intracellular signaling pathways; as a result, there are fewer proplatelets and they have enlarged tips. Furthermore, VWF-bound platelets are rapidly removed from the circulation in a process that is enhanced when aggregates are present. Bleeding is accentuated under conditions of stress, such as pregnancy when circulating large VWF multimers are elevated. Mention should also be made of type 2B von Willebrand disease, also with AD inheritance. In this condition single allele gain-of-function mutations within exon 28 of VWF result in multimers that bind spontaneously to GIbα. Enlarged platelets and thrombocytopenia are features and the cross-linking of platelets by adsorbed VWF multimers leads to platelet clumping in many patients. Megakaryocytes in culture appear to bind VWF multimers leaking from their own cells; the mature megakaryocytes have larger platelet territories while proplatelet-like protrusions are fewer, shorter and the swellings larger. Patients of French-Canadian descent with what was called the "Montreal platelet syndrome", an inherited macrothrombocytopenia, in fact possessed the VWF p.V1316M mutation. Recent studies on both a mouse model and platelets from a patient with VWF V1316M have shown that platelet aggregation is also reduced due to the loss of essential signaling requirements for αIIbβ3 activation. With regards to a possible loss of sialic acid from platelets of these patients, the same group showed that while endogenous neuraminidase translocated to the platelet surface, the desialylation threshold required for thrombocytopenia in vivo was not reached; intriguingly, N-glycans on αIIb and β3 and not GPIbα, were most targeted. But both platelet-type von Willebrand disease and type 2B von Willebrand disease are disorders in which increased platelet turnover contributes to the thrombocytopenia.

Macrothrombocytopenia and sitosterolemia

An unusual inherited macrothrombocytopenia with epigenetic or environmental implications is sitosterolemia. In this condition, giant platelets associate with AR mutations in ABCG5 and ABCG8, genes which code for proteins that act as cellular transporters of plant sterols, the latter accumulating at high levels in blood and tissues. Xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis and hemolytic anemia are other features; not all patients develop hematologic abnormalities while macrothrombocytopenia can also be isolated. Studies in mice show knock-on effects with sterol intercalation within the demarcation membrane system of megakaryocytes leading to release of hyper-reactive enlarged platelets with deregulation of multiple signaling pathways including GPIbα shedding.

### Is GPIb α really a master regulator of platelet activation? [^116FiWvM]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, the authors primarily focus on the role the GPIbα cytoplasmic tail has on moderating PKC activity via sequestering 14–3–3 isoforms, a concept they proposed 19 years ago, and conclude this is how the GPIbα cytoplasmic tail regulates platelet activation. Here again, it is puzzling that the authors have not even considered there could be additional mechanisms taking place; particularly because the GPIbα cytoplasmic tail has other binding partners it uses to transduce platelet signals, which the authors have not discussed. It is very difficult to understand how this 14–3–3 sequestration model works in different scenarios: normal and shorter GPIbα in the presence of the MPαC peptide, with or without platelet agonists.

In summary, Yan et al assign an important role to the tail of GPIbα in platelet signaling and activation through its binding to 14–3–3, promoting PKC activation. Although this is an elegant concept, we suggest that these conclusions deserve additional thoughts based on the lack of key information related to the tools and models used and especially considering that patients with Bernard Soulier syndrome generally have normal platelet aggregation profiles with agonists other than ristocetin. Few case studies, nevertheless, report defective platelet aggregation with ADP or collagen, but here again, the difficulty of adequately comparing the aggregation profiles of platelets from patients with Bernard Soulier syndrome with healthy platelets due to their size and low counts should be acknowledged and perhaps deserve further investigation.

### Progress in understanding the diagnosis and molecular genetics of macrothrombocytopenias [^115BXp7j]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The inherited macrothrombocytopenias constitute a subgroup of congenital platelet disorders that is the best characterized from the genetic point of view. This clinically heterogeneous subgroup is characterized by a variable degree of bleeding but without predisposition to haematological malignancies, as seen in the two other subgroups. The classification of inherited thrombocytopenia is traditionally based on the description of different clinical and biological features, in particular the measurement of the mean platelet volume. In certain disorders, biochemical platelet components are abnormal, and their analyses are useful in diagnosis. However, these approaches present several limitations, and many cases remain undiagnosed, especially for patients without a clear family history. An analysis of genetic abnormalities was subsequently used for classification, demonstrating that some different clinical entities were, in fact, identical. The genomic approach that was used initially to accurately link some phenotypic diagnoses with the causal genetic alteration was positional cloning and DNA sequencing. More recently, next generation sequencing in the form of whole-genome or -exome sequencing and RNA sequencing has been developed. This review will focus on the progress in understanding the different macrothrombocytopenias that have been identified.

Regarding specific circumstances for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery, BSH 2010 guidelines recommend to consider controlling platelet counts preoperatively to a target of < 400×10⁹/L in patients undergoing surgery where bleeding is a risk or thromboprophylaxis would normally be prescribed.

Mutations of TUBB1 encoding β1-tubulin cause macrothrombocytopenia through altered association with α-tubulin and defective microtubule assembly. The defect leads to altered megakaryocyte maturation with the production of fewer proplatelets with large tips but there is a high degree of phenotypic and genotypic variability and while the causal effect of some variants is clear, other predicted pathological variants have little effect on platelet count or size. Interestingly, TUBB1 dysfunction may lead to genome instability; co-segregation with myeloid malignancy has been reported, but this tendency needs confirmation as TUBB1 mutations are relatively common. Thyroid dysgenesis has also been linked to TUBB1 mutations in some patients. Variants identified by WES in exons 5 and 6 of ACTB encoding β-cytoplasmic actin cause syndromic thrombocytopenia by compromising microtubule organization during the final stages of megakaryocyte maturation, but bleeding has not been reported. The defect has been located in five families and is accompanied by platelet size variability including large forms; associated and highly variable clinical features are given in Online Supplementary Table S1. The defect intervenes in the final stages of platelet biogenesis and pre-platelet (a purported intermediate platelet precursor) fragmentation but no defects were seen in megakaryocyte proplatelet formation in culture. Interestingly, variants in exons 2 to 4 give rise to a severe developmental disorder, Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome, but no thrombocytopenia.

### Thrombocytopenia… [^113LzAfS]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Family physicians often see patients who present with a low platelet count. Although further inquiry may elicit additional signs and symptoms of systemic disease, the etiology of thrombocytopenia usually is not immediately apparent. A low platelet count may be the only hematologic abnormality. In adults, thrombocytopenia is a platelet count less than 150 × 10. 1 Patients with a platelet count greater than 50×10³ per μL often are asymptomatic. Patients with a count from 30 to 50×10³ per μL rarely present with purpura, although they may have excessive bleeding with trauma. Spontaneous bleeding is more likely in patients with platelet counts less than 5×10³ per μL, and is considered a hematologic emergency.
2. 3 per μL over a 10-year period. In 64 percent of patients, platelet counts normalized or remained stable.

The probability of developing immune thrombocytopenic purpura or an autoimmune disorder was approximately 7 and 12 percent, respectively. Four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome were diagnosed, all of which were in older patients.
16. Activity Participation and Invasive Procedures General recommendations for activity participation have been based on historical data from patients with chronic severe thrombocytopenia. 39, 40 A platelet count greater than 50 × 10 3 per μL is adequate for hemostasis and is unlikely to be clinically recognized. Patients with a platelet count greater than this level can engage in most activities, but should use caution if participating in contact sports. 16, 40 Patients with platelet counts less than 10×10³ per μL should be restricted from contact sports and other potentially traumatic activities. In one study, 42 percent of patients with platelet counts less than 10×10³ per μL had spontaneous bleeding requiring intervention compared with 6 percent of patients with counts between 10 and 30×10³ per μL. 39 Most surgical and invasive procedures can be performed safely in patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10.
