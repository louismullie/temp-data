## Question

What is emphysematous cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what emphysematous cystitis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach, especially imaging. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and potential mimics. Finally, I will consider management principles, prognosis, and special scenarios, and I will close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Emphysematous cystitis is a complicated lower urinary tract infection characterized by gas within the bladder wall, typically due to gas-forming bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus species, with fermentation of glucose yielding carbon dioxide and hydrogen under favorable metabolic conditions, especially in hyperglycemic environments [^17642cd9] [^a99f4eff] [^52361ac3].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and risk factors before I overgeneralize. The condition is uncommon but increasingly recognized with modern imaging, and it clusters in older adults, females, and patients with diabetes mellitus; additional risks include immunocompromise, chronic or recurrent UTIs, urinary tract obstruction, and instrumentation, with emerging associations to severe colonic inflammation such as Crohn's disease and even COVID-19 in pediatrics, though the latter remains rare and hypothesis-generating [^a99f4eff] [^2786856a] [^382e8bc1] [^92d9c316].

> I need to check the clinical spectrum carefully. Presentation ranges from asymptomatic incidental findings to classic lower urinary tract symptoms, gross hematuria, pneumaturia, abdominal pain, and systemic toxicity including sepsis; importantly, some patients, particularly those with severe systemic illness or neuropathy, may have minimal localizing symptoms, which can delay diagnosis and worsen outcomes [^2786856a] [^fc5d44aa] [^a99f4eff].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach and not jump to conclusions. The cornerstone is imaging that detects intramural or intraluminal bladder gas; noncontrast CT is the modality of choice for sensitivity and specificity, with ultrasound and plain radiography as adjuncts; cystoscopy can visualize submucosal emphysema and help exclude fistulous disease when suspected, and urinalysis with culture guides pathogen-directed therapy, though cultures may be negative in a minority of cases [^e05a5c7e] [^a365b62d] [^52361ac3] [^a99f4eff].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis and potential mimics so I don't anchor prematurely. Gas in the bladder can also follow instrumentation, vesicointestinal fistulas, or radiation cystitis; distinguishing emphysematous cystitis from emphysematous pyelonephritis is crucial because the latter involves renal parenchymal gas and carries higher mortality, and CT patterns help separate these entities and stage severity when gas extends beyond the bladder [^e05a5c7e] [^cf6abdcc] [^3f7684a7].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure they align with evidence. The triad is prompt bladder drainage with urethral or suprapubic catheterization, broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent narrowing to culture results, and correction of underlying risk factors such as glycemic control and obstruction; most cases resolve with conservative therapy, though rare refractory cases may require surgical debridement or cystectomy, and hyperbaric oxygen has been explored as adjunctive therapy in select reports, though high-quality evidence is limited [^a99f4eff] [^2786856a] [^52361ac3] [^23d0d03e].

> I should double-check prognosis and outcomes. Historically, mortality approached 20% in older series, but with modern imaging and timely therapy, mortality is lower, though complications such as sepsis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and venous gas can occur; recurrence is uncommon if risk factors are addressed, but persistent diabetes or obstruction increases risk, and concomitant emphysematous cystitis in severe systemic disease may signal a poor prognostic trajectory [^fc5d44aa] [^a99f4eff] [^382e8bc1].

> But wait, what if the gas is extraperitoneal or there is no obvious UTI source. Extraperitoneal pelvic gas has been reported and may reflect a distension-based mechanism with intramural bacterial seeding, and in severe Crohn's colitis, emphysematous cystitis can occur without concurrent UTI, suggesting translocation of bacteria or systemic inflammatory effects; in such scenarios, treatment should target the underlying disease process while still ensuring drainage and empiric coverage when infection cannot be excluded [^904651ed] [^382e8bc1] [^627b8845].

> Let me synthesize succinctly. Emphysematous cystitis is a gas-forming bacterial infection of the bladder wall defined by intramural gas on imaging, most often in older diabetic women, presenting variably from silent to septic; diagnosis hinges on CT, management centers on catheter drainage, appropriate antibiotics, and correction of predisposing factors, and while most recover with conservative care, vigilance for complications and atypical associations is essential to avoid delays and poor outcomes [^17642cd9] [^e05a5c7e] [^a99f4eff] [^52361ac3].

Emphysematous cystitis is a **rare, gas-forming bacterial infection** of the bladder wall, most often due to E. coli or Klebsiella in diabetic or immunocompromised patients [^a99f4eff] [^52361ac3]. It is defined by **intramural bladder gas** on CT [^e05a5c7e], which is the diagnostic gold standard [^616c93e8]. Patients may present with dysuria, hematuria, pneumaturia, or be asymptomatic; **prompt recognition is critical** to prevent sepsis and necrosis [^fc5d44aa]. Management centers on **broad-spectrum antibiotics, bladder drainage, and glycemic control** [^a99f4eff]; most cases resolve with conservative therapy, but severe disease may require surgical intervention [^52361ac3] [^57fc7cb8].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Gas production**: Fermentation of glucose by gas-forming bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus) produces CO2 and H2, accumulating in the bladder wall [^672b00f1].
- **Risk factors**: Diabetes, immunocompromise, chronic UTIs, bladder outlet obstruction, and instrumentation increase risk [^a99f4eff] [^2786856a].
- **Mechanism**: High intraluminal pressure and ischemia facilitate bacterial invasion and gas dissection into the wall [^904651ed].

---

## Clinical presentation

Presentation is **variable**, ranging from asymptomatic to severe systemic illness:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Dysuria, frequency, urgency | Common [^notfound] |
| Gross hematuria | Common [^fc5d44aa] |
| Pneumaturia (passing gas) | Less common, pathognomonic [^2786856a] |
| Abdominal or suprapubic pain | Common [^52361ac3] |
| Fever, chills, sepsis | Variable, can be severe [^2786856a] |

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **CT scan**: Gold standard; detects intramural gas, wall thickening, and complications [^e05a5c7e] [^a365b62d].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful initial modality; echogenic foci with dirty shadowing suggest gas [^notfound].
- **Plain radiography**: May show curvilinear gas shadows but is less sensitive [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Emphysematous pyelonephritis**: Gas in renal parenchyma, not bladder wall [^cf6abdcc].
- **Vesicointestinal fistula**: Gas from bowel; look for colovesical fistula [^2358dfda].
- **Instrumentation-related gas**: Recent catheterization or surgery [^2358dfda].

---

## Management

- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum coverage (e.g. ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam) with adjustment to culture results [^a4fe6455].
- **Bladder drainage**: Foley or suprapubic catheter to decompress and reduce gas [^a99f4eff].
- **Glycemic control**: Aggressive management of hyperglycemia [^a99f4eff].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory cases, necrosis, or failure of medical therapy [^57fc7cb8].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with timely therapy, but complications can occur:

- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening if unrecognized [^fc5d44aa].
- **Bladder necrosis**: Rare, may require partial cystectomy [^notfound].
- **Recurrence**: Uncommon with adequate source control and risk-factor modification [^notfound].

---

Emphysematous cystitis is a **rare gas-forming bladder infection** with characteristic intramural gas on CT; **early diagnosis and treatment** with antibiotics, drainage, and glycemic control are essential to prevent severe complications [^a99f4eff].

Emphysematous cystitis is a somewhat uncommon entity in which early diagnosis and treatment play a key role in avoiding potentially high morbidity and mortality. An elderly woman with emphysematous cystitis and no comorbid factors, except advanced age, is presented. This case illustrates the key features in the radiographic diagnosis of this unusual disease. Discussion of the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of emphysematous cystitis emphasizes prompt recognition, drainage of the bladder and use of appropriate broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.

We present the case of a 57-year-old man with emphysematous cystitis. The patient presented with a complaint of several days of lower abdominal pain and gross hematuria. Work-up included an abdominal CT scan that revealed gas within the urinary bladder wall, and cystoscopy confirmed diffuse submucosal emphysema throughout the bladder. The patient was treated conservatively with broad spectrum antibiotics, with prompt resolution of both symptoms and radiographic findings. Emphysematous cystitis is a rare clinically entity, more commonly seen in diabetic, immunocompromised patients. A conservative treatment approach using antibiotics and bladder catheterization is typically successful, with a complication rate of only 18.8%.

### Emphysematous cystitis: radiological diagnosis of complicated urinary tract infection [^a99f4eff]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Emphysematous cystitis is an uncommon condition characterised by the presence of gas in the bladder. It is an infection caused by gas forming organisms, usually in elderly women with a background of diabetes mellitus. The presentation is variable, however with increasing use of imaging more cases are being diagnosed in asymptomatic patients. Routine cross-sectional imaging is not advocated for specific diagnosis but its role in accurate assessment of the severity of the condition cannot be overlooked. As the mode and duration of follow-up in incidentally detected cases has not been addressed in the literature, follow-up should be tailored individually depending upon the severity and response to treatment. We describe two such incidentally detected cases of emphysematous cystitis in elderly diabetic patients and present a review of the literature. The triad of treatment is adequate control of diabetes, antibiotics and bladder drainage. One patient died in the hospital, while the other underwent a flexible cystoscopy 6 weeks later which was normal.

### Emphysematous cystitis-gas in bladder: a rare urological emergency [^2786856a]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Emphysematous cystitis is an unusual inflammatory condition characterised by the presence of air within the bladder wall and lumen. It is usually seen in patients with diabetes, and in those with long-term catheterisation or of immunocompromised status. Its presentation varies from asymptomatic to frank urosepsis. It is diagnosed after radiological studies. Treatment requires establishment of prompt urinary drainage, antibiotic coverage and correction of offending factors, if any. We report a case of 41-year-old, non-diabetic, otherwise healthy woman presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms with pneumaturia, which was managed conservatively. A review of the recent literature is also presented.

### Emphysematous cystitis with extraperitoneal gas: new insights into pathogenesis via novel CT findings [^904651ed]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Emphysematous cystitis is a relatively rare disease entity characterized by intramural and/or intraluminal bladder gas best depicted by cross-sectional imaging. Its disease mechanism is not well understood. A case of a diabetic patient with emphysematous cystitis is presented and is notable for the rare finding of extraperitoneal gas in the pelvis based on a review of 114 case reports. Herein we propose a distension-based mechanism with intramural bacterial seeding as the pathogenesis of emphysematous cystitis based on the patient's imaging and the disease's established associations with diabetes and E. coli. The ability to recognize extraperitoneal pelvic gas as a feature of emphysematous cystitis allowed prompt diagnosis. This facilitated early commencement of successful treatment in a diabetic patient in whom the diagnosis was not suspected clinically.

### Unusual case of emphysematous cystitis seen on FDG PET / CT [^e072f489]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Emphysematous cystitis is a rare condition requiring immediate aggressive medical attention. Here, we describe a very unusual case of emphysematous cystitis seen on FDG PET/CT. This finding was discovered in an 84-year-old man undergoing FDG PET/CT to monitor a known diagnosis of IgG4-related nodular sclerosis. Images revealed gas within the bladder wall and an anterior gas-filled bladder diverticulum. The patient subsequently developed sepsis with cultures revealing Escherichia coli. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this finding on varied imaging modalities, as life-threatening complications may arise from this condition.

### Emphysematous cystitis: a rare cause of gross hematuria [^fc5d44aa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Emphysematous cystitis is a relatively rare infectious condition of the urinary bladder. The mortality rate is high if the diagnosis is delayed or if the treatment is inadequate. We present an uncommon case of emphysematous cystitis and highlight the risk factors for this disease. An 81-year-old man with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and a central pontine infarction presented to the Emergency Department due to gross hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) and plain radiography revealed localized gas within the bladder that was compatible with the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis. A Foley catheter was inserted. Urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2 g cefotaxime daily was initiated. Subsequent plain radiography and CT scan showed regression of intraluminal gas. We recommend CT for the definitive diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis. Adequate antibiotic therapy, strict blood glucose control, adequate drainage of urine, and early goal-directed therapy for suspected sepsis are suggested to prevent the complications of emphysematous cystitis.

### Emphysematous cystitis as a potential marker of severe Crohn's disease [^42afd5d4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emphysematous cystitis (EC) is often a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) that presents with severe clinical sequelae. It is defined by the presence of gas within the bladder wall, which is identified through imaging studies. Risk factors for developing EC include advanced age, poorly controlled diabetes, immunosuppression, chronic UTIs and urinary tract outlet obstruction. In addition to an ascending infection by gas-producing organisms, EC can also result from abdominal or pelvic instrumentation, fistula to a hollow viscus and tissue infarction with necrosis.

There have been multiple reports of EC in the setting of infectious colitis, both with and without any microbiological evidence of a concurrent UTI. Acute colonic inflammation from diverticulitis has also been associated with EC, some cases of which were in the context of fistula formation between the colonic diverticula and the bladder. In the absence of obvious colovesical fistula, the connection between colonic inflammation and EC is poorly understood.

Crohn's disease is a relapsing systemic inflammatory disease that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and give rise to complications like fibrosis, stricturing and fistula formation. Crohn's colitis presents as transmural and segmental inflammation that is restricted within the colon, although these patients may still exhibit features of extra-intestinal manifestations and perianal disease. We report the first case of EC in the setting of severe Crohn's colitis with no evidence of UTI or fistulating disease. This highlights EC as a potential unappreciated sign of severe Crohn's disease that is worthy of further investigation.

### Cystitis emphysematosa… [^17642cd9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cystitis emphysematosa has been defined by Mills as a rare "inflammatory condition of the bladder associated with the presence of gas vesicles in the tissues. " 1 It referred strictly to the presence of gas in the vesical wall usually with associated cystitis and hemorrhage. Generalized gas-producing infections with secondary bladder involvement were specifically excluded. No reports of primary bladder lesions with extension to other tissues were available at that time. The condition has usually been associated with primary infections of the bladder by the coliform group of organisms and the presence of the gas determined incidentally by cystoscopy, x-ray, or at postmortem examination. Intravesical gas, the characteristic manifestation of cystitis emphysematosa, has led to predominant urologic and radiologic interest in this subject. 2, 3. The present report concerns a fulminating and fatal case in an elderly diabetic woman.

It is believed to be the first case of cystitis emphysematosa with generalized LEE JB. Cystitis Emphysematosa: A Review and Report of a Case with Disseminated Inflammatory Emphysema. AMA Arch Intern Med. 1960; 105: 618–626.

### MDCT imaging of acute bladder pathology [^200d2b9f]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will discuss and illustrate the pathophysiology, presentation, and multidetector computed tomography findings associated with emergent bladder conditions, limiting our discussion to traumatic, infectious, and obstructive etiologies. After reviewing computed tomography cystographic technique, the commonly utilized classification systems for bladder trauma will be presented with illustrative examples of associated typical and more infrequent secondary injuries and complications. Next, the pathogenesis and imaging appearance of both mechanical and neurogenic acute urinary retention will be addressed, including less common though potentially pathognomonic obstructive etiologies including urethral calculi and ectopic ureteroceles. Finally, we will review and illustrate the imaging features of both inflammatory and infectious cystitis, including hemorrhagic and emphysematous variants, as well as the potentially encountered secondary complications.

### Emphysematous cystitis as a potential marker of severe Crohn's disease [^382e8bc1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emphysematous cystitis (EC) is characterized by the presence of air within the bladder wall, often a complication of urinary tract infection (UTI) by gas-producing organisms. However, EC has also been reported in the setting of infectious colitis suggesting an alternate etiology. We report a rare case of EC in the setting of severe Crohn's colitis with no clinical evidence of UTI.

Case presentation

A 43-year old female presented with a 2-month history of bloody diarrhea consisting of 8–12 bowel movements a day, weight loss of 10 kg and peripheral edema. She also had multiple ulcerated lesions on her abdominal wall and in the perianal region. Initial CT scan was significant for pancolitis, anasarca and EC. The follow-up CT cystogram, flexible cystoscopy and pelvic MRI confirmed the diagnosis of EC and ruled out any fistulous tracts in the pelvis including enterovesical/colovesical fistula. The patient did not report any urinary symptoms and the urinalysis was within normal limits. An extensive infectious workup was negative. Despite the paucity of infectious findings, the EC was empirically treated with an intravenous third-generation cephalosporin. Colonoscopy was significant for multiple ulcerated and hyperemic areas with pseudopolyps all throughout the right, transverse and left colon. Biopsies confirmed Crohn's colitis with no evidence of granulomata or dysplasia. Immunohistochemistry was negative for CMV. The perianal and abdominal wall lesions were suspected to be pyoderma gangrenosum although biopsies were equivocal. The colitis was initially treated with intravenous steroids followed by biologic therapy with Infliximab. Despite appropriate escalation of therapies, the patient developed colonic perforation requiring subtotal colectomy.

Conclusion

This is a rare case of EC in a patient with severe Crohn's colitis. There was no evidence of urinary tract infection or fistulising disease. According to our review, this is the first reported incident of EC in a patient with inflammatory bowel disease without any prior intra-abdominal surgeries. While active Crohn's disease alone is a critical illness, we conclude that concomitant EC may be a poor prognostic factor.

### Emphysematous cystitis: a tympanic bladder [^57fc7cb8]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes was admitted with increasing lethargy and hyperglycaemia. On examination she was noted to have a tender and tympanic bladder. CT revealed a distended bladder with gas locules in the bladder wall. She was diagnosed with hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar non-ketosis precipitated by emphysematous cystitis. After systemic antibiotics and bladder drainage via a urethral catheter, her symptoms readily improved. Radiographic appearances of the bladder were normal one week after instigating treatment. Emphysematous cystitis is characterized by gas within the bladder wall. Although rare it is increasingly more recognized with the advent of modern imaging. The mainstay of treatment is antibiotics and bladder drainage. Rarely surgical debridement and even cystectomy is required.

### Emphysematous cystitis developed in a patient with an eating disorder and schizophrenia [^bec45635]. The Journal of Infection (2003). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old female patient with an emphysematous cystitis associated with an eating disorder and schizophrenia is described. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an emphysematous cystitis developed in those kinds of psychiatric disorders.

### Emphysematous cystitis as a potential marker of severe Crohn's disease [^627b8845]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

After a thorough literature review, we identified two reports of EC in the setting of infectious colitis. Both of these patients had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented with C. difficile colitis, and had evidence of EC on CT scan. However, only one of them had a concomitant UTI. The presence of EC without any evidence of a UTI is not very common. In the absence of urologic infections, treatment of EC is best directed at the underlying disease process. Under such circumstances the EC should be considered a clinical sign and not the primary disease process.

The association between colonic inflammation and EC is poorly understood. One possible explanation is bacterial translocation within the abdomen from the disruption of the mucosal barriers secondary to chronic inflammation. A similar mechanism is seen in severe IBD. While it remains controversial whether bacterial translocation is a consequence or a cause of intestinal inflammation, IBD patients have a high rate of bacterial DNA in their blood samples compared to healthy controls. This can present with infectious features within a specific organ system with no local microbiological evidence of an infection. Severe Crohn's colitis can also cause emphysematous changes within the bowel wall. Since our patient had persistent symptoms for two months before seeking care, it is difficult to comment whether she developed any emphysematous changes within the bowel wall before developing EC.

In this case report we describe the first case of EC in the setting of severe Crohn's colitis. EC has been shown to be complication of various colonic inflammatory processes. We suggest the severity of colitis in our patient was the main precipitating factor for EC. Radiological modalities can offer a non-invasive assessment of disease severity in IBD. We propose that concomitant EC in decompensated IBD patients may be a marker of severe inflammation that portends poor prognosis.

### Emphysematous cystitis with bilateral pyelonephritis in a pediatric patient with COVID-19 [^92d9c316]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A 15-year-old female adolescent with a medical history of recurrent urinary tract infections and grade 1 left-sided vesicoureteral reflux presented to the emergency room with abdominal and back pain. Labs revealed a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 9.1% and a random blood glucose of 200mg/dL, consistent with new-onset diabetes mellitus. Nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test returned positive. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral attenuation of the kidneys and air in the bladder, which was confirmed by pelvic ultrasound. Gas subsequently resolved 2days later after treatment with antibiotics, and a diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made. Emphysematous cystitis in the paediatric population is an extremely rare condition with four cases reported in the literature. Furthermore, there has been a reported association between COVID-19, cystitis and non-typical course of urinary symptoms. Local inflammation obstructing transportation of formed gas is one of the proposed mechanisms underlying emphysematous cystitis, and so COVID-19 may be yet another predisposing factor.

### Emphysematous pyelonephritis: outcomes of conservative management and literature review [^38767146]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rare, necrotising infection of the renal parenchyma, predominantly associated with Escherichia coli infection and unless promptly recognised and dealt with, it carries a poor prognosis. The current treatment is one of antimicrobial therapies together with nephrectomy in a majority of patients. We report an elderly man with multiple comorbidities with a diagnosis of EPN whose condition improved with antimicrobial and supportive therapy, and no surgical intervention was required.

Discussion and conclusions

We report the first case of EC in the setting of severe Crohn's colitis with no clinical evidence of a UTI. Our patient did not have any of the known risk factors for EC such as diabetes, severe immunodeficiency, systemic infection, hematuria or intra-abdominal instrumentation. While immunological dysfunction is a significant component of Crohn's disease, it does not make patients immunocompromised and susceptible to infections unless they are on immunosuppressive therapies.

CT scan is considered the ideal diagnostic modality for EC. This can characterize the extent of the disease beyond the bladder into the pelvicalyceal systems and renal parenchyma. Since colovesical fistula is a known complication of Crohn's colitis we completed a comprehensive workup to rule out any fistulating disease. In collaboration with Urology, we confirmed the diagnosis of EC and collectively ruled out any fistulous tract within the pelvis.

A literature review on PubMed and the Cochrane Library did not identify any documented association between IBD and EC. There is one reported incident of EC in an elderly patient following a total colectomy for ulcerative colitis. Since abdominal instrumentation can be a precipitating factor for EC, it is difficult to interpret this connection. Despite the paucity of evidence for IBD, there is well established association between other types of acute colonic inflammation and EC. Acute diverticulitis can create colovesical fistulas, some of which may present as EC. Colon cancer arising within a colonic diverticulum can also create such colovesical fistula. Invasive colon cancer has also been known to have emphysematous presentation within the genitourinary system. With multiple imaging modalities, direct visualization and pathological examination, we have definitively ruled out these more common etiologies for EC in our patient.

### Emphysematous cystitis as a potential marker of severe Crohn's disease [^8ae0a161]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

On the most recent follow-up assessment the patient had no known recurrence of Crohn's disease including any perianal disease, and as a result she was not on any immunosuppressive therapies. She was followed up until about three years from her initial presentation with EC and colitis. She had normal stoma function and was being considered for an ileorectal anastomosis. She did not have any intervention for her goitre, and it had not caused any further complications.

### Emphysematous pyelitis presenting as an acute abdomen in an end-stage renal disease patient treated with peritoneal dialysis [^df42c9a2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Emphysematous pyelitis is air in the renal collecting system in patients with urinary tract infections. This entity is uncommon and seen primarily in patients with diabetes mellitus. We report a case of a patient with end-stage renal disease treated with peritoneal dialysis who developed emphysematous pyelitis who presented with signs and symptoms that were more consistent with appendicitis. The spectrum of infections causing air in the urinary tract and the method by which end-stage renal disease patients are treated are discussed. Patients receiving dextrose peritoneal dialysis are at risk for emphysematous pyelonephritis, pyelitis, and cystitis.

### The diagnosis and management of life-threatening urologic infections [^a9ff38b1]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary infections are commonly encountered and managed in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings. Fournier's gangrene, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and obstructive pyelonephritis represent the most serious urologic infections and have a high risk of mortality if not managed promptly. Due to the rarity of these infections, the evidence for specific treatment strategies is scattered. This review aims to provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of these life-threatening urologic infections.

### Morphological transition after medical treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis over time-case report [^93bc83b6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The unique feature of this case is that we were able to follow the morphological transition of EPN on CT image and show recovery from a high-risk case. Both classifications resemble the trajectory of EPN, rather than different pathophysiology, and evaluation in combination with the severity of the patient, may guide to selection of appropriate treatment options.

### Infective endocarditis secondary to-associated emphysematous cystitis [^031d7dbc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is responsible for about 1.5% of infective endocarditis (IE) cases. IE caused by community-acquired K. pneumoniae infection has rarely been reported. An 80-year-old man presented at our hospital with hypotension and hypoxaemia, and a history of aortic valve stenosis and no history of recent dental treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography at admission showed no signs of heart failure or vegetation. CT revealed typical signs of emphysematous cystitis (EC). The patient was treated for EC-associated septic shock. K. pneumoniae was detected in urine and blood cultures on day 3. Symptoms of heart failure developed on day 6 and clinical examination revealed a heart murmur. An identification of vegetation and perforation of the mitral valve on repeat echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of IE secondary to K. pneumoniae infection. A surgical valve replacement was performed on day 7. Repeated point-of-care ultrasound played a role in the early diagnosis of IE.

### Emphysematous cystitis in a patient presenting with paradoxical arterial embolism and intestinal mycobacteriosis without evidence of diabetes [^04be2203]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 72-year-old woman who displayed massive multiple intramural gas collections of the bladder wall as an incidental finding on CT. The patient presented with critical ischemia of the left leg caused by paradoxical arterial embolism, raised corpuscular sedimentation rate, anemia by gastrointestinal blood loss, hypoproteinemia, diarrhea, malabsorption, and exudative enteropathia caused by mycobacterial ileocolitis. The patient had no dysuria and there was no evidence of diabetes. The intramural gas collections of the bladder wall, as shown by CT, were compatible with emphysematous cystitis. Urine samples proved infection by a multi-resistant strain of E. coli. Emphysematous cystitis is a rare form of bladder infection that can be diagnosed by plain-film radiograms or CT.

### A pictorial review of genitourinary infections and inflammations [^192d46f8]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Various infectious and inflammatory diseases affect the genitourinary system. This paper provides a review of multiple common and uncommon infectious and inflammatory conditions affecting the genitourinary system and some associated complications. These include acute infectious cystitis, emphysematous cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, renal and perinephric abscesses, pyonephrosis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, epididymo-orchitis, vasitis, prostatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, renal hydatid infection, renal tuberculosis, actinomycosis, Erdheim-Chester Disease, IgG4-Related Kidney Disease, urethritis and urethral strictures, ureteritis cystica, and genitourinary fistulas. Radiologists should be aware of these diseases' complications and management. Uncommon conditions must be considered when evaluating the genitourinary system.

While the EC was investigated the patient also underwent a colonoscopy. This was significant for hyperemic and ulcerated areas with pseudopolyps throughout the right and transverse colon (Fig. 2 a–c). There was less marked ulceration of the rectum and the left colon, which made this suspicious for colonic Crohn's disease (Fig. 2 d, e). The terminal ileum appeared normal. Colonic biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of Crohn's colitis with no evidence of granulomata or dysplasia. CMV immunohistochemistry was negative. Dermatology service was consulted for the skin lesions. Biopsies of the abdominal wall ulcers showed non-specific inflammatory changes with neutrophilic infiltrates. The perianal ulcer also showed non-specific inflammatory changes without granulomatous evolution, which was equivocal for pyoderma gangrenosum. The biopsy samples did not show any features of infection or malignancy.

The patient was started on IV Methylprednisone while the known mediastinal mass was being investigated. An endobronchial ultrasound guided biopsy of the left paratracheal mass was diagnostic for goiter with no features of malignancy. Following this result, the patient was started on Infliximab induction therapy. Throughout her admission, she also received multiple units of packed red blood cells and IV albumin. With the initiation of Infliximab and IV steroids, the patient had steady improvement of her bloody diarrhea and the cutaneous lesions resolved. She was repatriated to Yukon from VGH on a tapering dose of oral prednisone and maintenance Infliximab infusions. However, following the transfer the patient developed a colonic perforation requiring subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. Her post-operative course was further complicated by a stomal obstruction and interloop abscesses requiring multiple laparotomies and surgical revisions.

### Complicated genitourinary tract infections and mimics [^2358dfda]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

This article provides pictorial review of complicated upper and lower genitourinary infections and their mimics. Imaging features of upper urinary tract infections including uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGPN), emphysematous pyelonephritis, perirenal abscess, and pyonephrosis are first reviewed and then followed by pictorial review of their mimics including contrast-associated nephrotoxicity, renal infarcts, malakoplakia, renal cell cancer, leukemia or lymphoma and Castleman's disease. Next, imaging features of lower urinary tract infections including cystitis, emphysematous cystitis, enterovesical, colovesical and vesicovaginal fistulas, Fournier gangrene, prostatitis, epididymitis, and orchitis are reviewed and then followed by pictorial review of their mimics including gas in the bladder and perineum related to instrumentation, radiation cystitis, bladder cancer, testicular torsion, testicular trauma, and testicular cancer and lymphoma. Recognizing imaging characteristics of complicated genitourinary infections and their mimics would allow clinicians to provide appropriate timely management.

### Treatment of a case of emphysematous pyelonephritis that presented with acute abdomen and pneumoperitoneum: a case report [^657c98b7]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe, life-threatening infection of the renal parenchyma and perinephric tissues. This condition is primarily encountered in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or ureteral obstruction, and is characterized by the production of intrarenal and perinephric gas. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is associated with a high degree of morbidity and a high mortality rate. In the present report, we describe a case of emphysematous pyelonephritis that presented with pneumoperitoneum.

Table 1
Summary of laboratory investigations on admission Hospital with appropriate reference ranges

In terms of diagnostic imaging the patient had a contrast-enhanced CT scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis on arrival to VGH. There was a large heterogeneous soft tissue mass arising from the inferior aspect of the left thyroid lobe that measured 6.5 × 5.7 × 8.2 cm (transverse, antero-posterior, craniocaudal dimensions respectively). This mass extended inferiorly to the level of the carina and displaced the great vessels anteriorly without restricting blood flow. The abdomen and pelvic scans identified circumferential mural thickening of the entire colon with multiple pseudopolyps. The small bowel appeared unremarkable. There was significant anasarca and small volume ascites. The patient also had intramural gas foci within the bladder, a pathognomonic feature of EC (Fig. 1 a–c). There was no bladder wall thickening and the urinary system had symmetrical enhancement with no obvious mass or obstruction. The patient did not report any urinary symptoms and both initial and subsequent urinalyses were within normal limits. Infectious workup including urine and blood cultures, stool ova and parasite, stool C. difficile PCR, TB-IGRA, Hep A, Hep B, Hep C and HIV serologies were all negative. The patient was consulted to the Urology service who agreed with the diagnosis of EC and arranged a flexible cystoscopy and a CT cystogram. The cystoscopy revealed patchy areas of submucosal hemorrhage throughout the posterior bladder wall. There was no evidence of any fistulous tract on direct visualization or on the CT cystogram. Lastly, a pelvic MRI was completed which definitively ruled out any fistulating disease. The EC was empirically treated with an intravenous (IV) third-generation cephalosporin for five days despite no obvious infectious etiology.

### Managing complicated urinary tract infections: the urologic view [^db26c601]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

Mural bladder abscess in a 61-year-old man with recurrent UTIs and clinical and sonographic suspicion of bladder carcinoma. Multiplanar CT images (a – d) depicted a poorly distensible bladder with mural thickening (*), urothelial hyperenhancement (thin arrows) consistent with active UTI, and a fluid-like collection (arrowheads) with irregular peripheral enhancement along the posterolateral aspect. Urine cytology and cystoscopy excluded the presence of tumour. Six weeks later, repeated CT (d) after antibiotic treatment showed resolved abscess, persistent mural thickening (*) and infectious urothelial enhancement (thin arrow). Further follow-up with MRI including T2- (e) and post-gadolinium T1-weighted (f) sequences confirmed abscess disappearance (arrowheads)

In addition, diagnosis of AIC is further suggested by the identification of inflammatory changes as "hazy" increased attenuation of the extraperitoneal perivesical fat planes (Figs. 2 and 4). Particularly frequent in diabetics, emphysematous cystitis is a form of C-UTI in which gas-forming micro-organisms lead to the formation of characteristic air-attenuation linear changes within the bladder wall (Fig. 4).

Associated findings included inflammatory stranding (+) of the perivesical fat planes and a small bilobated fluid-like intraprostatic collection consistent with abscess (arrowheads).

Case presentation

A 43 year-old female presented to a community hospital in Yukon, Canada with a 2-month history of bloody diarrhea. On admission a plain radiograph identified a large mediastinal mass. She was subsequently transferred to Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) under the care of Thoracic Surgery. Prior to her transfer she received oral steroids and 5-ASA formulations for 2 days as her initial stool cultures were negative and a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was suspected.

The patient was an immigrant from Taiwan and had previous episodes of bloody diarrhea with associated abdominal discomfort and fatigue. Her prior symptoms never lasted for more than a month and the most recent episode was 18 months ago when she was still living in Taiwan. She had no previous investigation for her symptoms. She presented to the hospital due to the fact that her symptoms had persisted for 2 months over which she lost 10 kg and developed significant peripheral edema. On presentation she was having 8–12 episodes of bloody diarrhea daily. The laboratory investigations on admission are highlighted in Table 1. This was significant for normocytic anemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated ferritin and elevated C-reactive protein. The patient also had multiple round and shallow ulcers with a punched-out appearance on her abdomen. Furthermore, she had a large perianal ulcer, which had developed over the preceding two weeks. She did not have any history of ocular diseases, arthralgia, or any other history of dermatological symptoms.

### Differences in the pattern of antibiotic prescription profile and recurrence rate for possible urinary tract infections in women with and without diabetes [^fe9da445]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is an increasingly important endocrine disease. Incidence of infections is increased in diabetic (type 1 and type 2) patients compared with control subjects, and the urinary tract is the most prevalent site of these infections. Furthermore, diabetic patients with a urinary tract infection (UTI) more often develop severe and rare complications, such as emphysematous cystitis and papillary necrosis. Studies addressing differences in UTI recurrence rates between diabetic patients and control subjects show contradictory results for uncomplicated lower and upper UTIs. Currently, there are no controlled clinical trials investigating the optimal antimicrobial treatment strategy in diabetic patients with UTIs. Current recommendations rely on the opinion of experts. It is generally recommended to treat UTIs in diabetic patients with antibiotics with high tissue penetration for 7–14 days. Importantly, we lack data on the clinical practice of how diabetic patients with a UTI are actually treated, to assess recurrence rates.

The aims of this study are to describe the treatments (duration and agents) for uncomplicated UTIs in women with and without diabetes in the Netherlands and to analyze recurrence rates of these UTIs within 30 days after the last treatment.

Pyelitis emphysematosa is a gas-forming infection characterized by gas located within the wall of the collecting system and renal pelvis. There are only 2 reported cases of pyelitis emphysematosa in the literature, neither of which occurred in the era of cross-sectional imaging. Here we present a case of pyelitis emphysematosa occurring in an elderly female with congenital left renal atrophy and chronic right hydronephrosis secondary to ureteropelvic junction obstruction.

Conclusions

We believe that cases with free intraperitoneal air should promptly undergo laparotomy to identify the cause of the pneumoperitoneum. Moreover, an immediate nephrectomy may be effective for the treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis in cases with poor prognostic factors.

### Fatal emphysematous pyelonephritis with gas in the spinal extradural space in a patient with diabetes [^00fb4d9b]. Diabetic Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EP) is a rare but life-threatening condition of the upper urinary tract, characterized by the presence of gas in the renal parenchyma and perirenal space. The vast majority of patients with EP (90%) are known to have diabetes, with Escherichia coli being the most common causative pathogen.

Case Report

We present a case of fatal bilateral EP in a patient with diabetes, with an unusual radiological finding of gas around the spinal cord and in the psoas muscle, with renal parenchymal sparing. Our case serves as an important reminder of this life threatening entity in diabetic patients, which is not well recognized by clinicians because of its rarity.

### Treatment of a case of emphysematous pyelonephritis that presented with acute abdomen and pneumoperitoneum: a case report [^672b00f1]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Emphysematous pyelonephritis — a serious complication of upper urinary infection — has been defined as an acute, severe, necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma and perirenal tissue, which results in the development of gas within the renal parenchyma, collecting system, or perinephric tissue. It is usually associated with DM and/or urinary obstruction such as stones. However, the mechanism of gas formation and pathogenesis of emphysematous pyelonephritis are unclear. Huang and Tseng hypothesized that the high level of blood glucose in patients with DM may provide gas-forming microorganisms with a more favorable environment for gas formation via mixed acid fermentation of glucose. However, bacterial gas production does not fully explain the pathologic and clinical manifestations of this condition.

Emphysematous pyelonephritis is diagnosed by the identification of gas in renal or perinephric tissue. CT is reportedly the most sensitive method for detecting gas in and adjacent to the kidney. Based on CT findings, Wan et al proposed that emphysematous pyelonephritis can be classified into two types, in order to determine the prognosis and guide therapy. Furthermore, Huang and Tseng classified emphysematous pyelonephritis into four types based on the radiological findings on CT. Thus, the prognosis and treatment course of cases with emphysematous pyelonephritis can be determined according to classifications based on CT findings. However, pneumoperitoneum caused by emphysematous pyelonephritis has not been included in any of the classification systems based on CT findings.

### Gas in the kidney: CT findings [^ededebc6]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Gas in the renal parenchyma is a rare finding seen best with computed tomography (CT). It can be encountered in a wide range of clinical conditions, some of them life-threatening like emphysematous pyelonephritis, whereas in others, it may represent a postoperative or procedure outcome. The latter are not usually a clinical emergency (for example, after nephrostomy insertion or in a urinary intestinal connection). Due to the increasing use of abdominal CT examinations, radiologists, especially in emergency setting, should be aware of this rare finding and be familiar with its differential diagnosis.

### Emphysematous infections of the abdomen and pelvis: a pictorial review [^e05a5c7e]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Emphysematous (gas-forming) infections of the abdomen and pelvis represent potentially life-threatening conditions that require aggressive medical and often surgical management. The initial clinical manifestation of these entities may be insidious, but rapid progression to sepsis will occur in the absence of early therapeutic intervention. Conventional radiography and ultrasonography are often the initial imaging modalities used to evaluate patients with abdominopelvic complaints. However, when a differential diagnosis remains, or if further localization or confirmation of tentative findings is needed, computed tomography (CT) should be considered the imaging modality of choice. CT is both highly sensitive and specific in the detection of abnormal gas and well suited to reliable depiction of the anatomic location and extent of the gas. Of equal importance may be the capability of CT to help reliably identify benign sources of gas, because treatment (if any) varies dramatically depending on the source. Knowledge of the pathophysiologic characteristics, common predisposing conditions, and typical imaging features associated with gas-forming infections of the gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, and genitourinary system will help make early diagnosis and successful treatment possible. In addition, such knowledge will aid in further diagnostic work-up, surveillance of potential complications, and evaluation of therapeutic response.

### Infectious and inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract: role of MR imaging [^4593ea47]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common of bacterial infections. Imaging studies are only required in cases of complicated UTIs. Ultrasound remains the first-line imaging method; however, CT is the gold standard for evaluation of UTIs. MR imaging's improved contrast resolution and absence of ionizing radiation may recommend its use for assessment of lower UTIs. Furthermore, MR imaging performs with diagnostic accuracy at least similar to CT in complicated UTIs, except for the identification of calculi and emphysematous pyelonephritis. In this article, the role of MR imaging for the evaluation of infectious and inflammatory disease processes of the urinary tract is reviewed.

### Impact of radiological diagnostics in the survivor of disseminated Fournier gangrene patient with septic pulmonary embolism [^1eb362a5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 51-year-old diabetic man diagnosed with prostatic abscess underwent its drainage twice. Following surgery he developed fever and right-sided painless visual loss due to endophthalmitis. To rule out its endogenous source CT scan was done which showed multisystem aetiology and complications. His pelvic CT and CT cystogram revealed postsurgical urethral injury along with urinary extravasation, perineal and pelvic soft tissues air densities with fat stranding ascribed to Fournier gangrene, air in distended urinary bladder due to emphysematous cystitis and right common iliac vein air containing septic thrombus. CT chest spotted bilateral multiple septic pulmonary emboli. These radiological findings were promptly handled by uro-surgical team followed by alliance with other relevant departments. With hasty surgical drainage/debridement, urological restoration of urinary obstruction, aggressive broad spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation and radiological follow-ups the patient withstood multisystem lethal complications and come up with excellent outcome except evisceration.

### Clinical and morphological effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with interstitial cystitis associated with fibromyalgia [^23d0d03e]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HBOT is emerging as a novel treatment in patients with IC and FM, as suggested by recent experiences in both the urologic and rheumatologic fields. In fact, hyperbaric oxygen is known to increase anti-inflammatory defenses over time and to promote neovascularization. These mechanisms have been recently confirmed by Minami, who reported a reduction in H2O2-induced inflammation, edema, and fibrosis on the bladder of mice treated with HBOT. On a molecular level, Thom demonstrated mobilization of bone marrow stem cells in response to hyperoxia, to hyperoxia and concluded that species that oxidative stress is the fundamental key mechanism of action of HBOT, exerting its effects on transcription through reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production over several treatments. Similarly, Minami and coll. demonstrated a decrease in mRNA expression of inflammatory biomarkers and an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) after HBOT. Overall, HBOT results in enhanced perfusion and wound healing in ischemic tissues.

HBOT is now widely used in urology for the treatment of radiation cystitis, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, emphysematous cystitis, or pelvic radiation disease, and the interest in treatment IC is currently growing. The molecular mechanisms of IC development are still not well known, but current literature identifies a plausible cause in microcirculation. For instance, Tamaki and coll. suggested that an important pathophysiology way could result from a reduced blood flow in bladder's walls during its filling phase. Concordantly, Lee J.D. and Lee M. verified that, in the bladder of IC patients, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α is increased both in muscle and urothelium of bladder, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) expression is higher in umbrella cells (apical cells). Both these studies could explain a hypoxic/ischemic damage, and therefore a possible useful role of HBOT in IC, as previously demonstrated on an ischemia/reperfusion model on muscle mice by Bosco and coll.

### Beyond broken spines-what the radiologist needs to know about late complications of spinal cord injury [^71c4373f]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
Renal calculi: multiple right renal calculi with mild cortical thinning and parenchymal loss in this patient with remote spinal cord injury. Routine urologic follow-up is an essential component in the care of spinal cord injury patients to prevent the consequences of acute obstructive processes and to preserve renal function

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common after SCI, with an incidence of 2.5 episodes per patient per year. It is important to recognise that UTI is a frequent source of septicaemia and has a mortality rate of approximately 15% in the SCI population. Imaging findings are similar to those seen in patients without SCI (Fig. 3). While there is an increased incidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis in persons with SCI, the absence of symptoms or presence of non-specific symptoms such as fever or autonomic dysreflexia, a manifestation of the loss of coordinated autonomic responses to demands on the heart rate and vascular tone, often leads to a delay in diagnosis. At the time of clinical presentation, the patient may have developed complications or widespread infection or sepsis. Figure 4 shows gas within the renal collecting system secondary to infection with a gas-forming organism or pyelitis. This serious infection requires urgent drainage and has a mortality rate approaching 20%. It is important to distinguish from emphysematous pyelonephritis, in which there is gas in the renal parenchyma, necessitating emergency nephrectomy, and which has a mortality rate of nearly 80% in this population. Epididymitis is a common complication in SCI, associated with voiding dysfunction and retrograde spread of organisms from the urinary bladder or prostate. At ultrasound, the epididymis is enlarged, hypoechoic and hypervascular (Fig. 5). The role of imaging in the evaluation of the genitourinary system in SCI patients is to assess for obstruction and to identify an underlying cause such as calculi; to evaluate for signs of active infection; to identify or exclude serious complications, such as renal or perinephric abscess or emphysematous pyelonephritis requiring emergency intervention; and to detect chronic changes such as scarring.

### Venous gas caused by emphysematous pyelonephritis: a case report and review of literature [^2c5729f1]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a gas-producing necrotizing bacterial infection that involves the renal parenchyma, collecting system, and/or perinephric tissue. EPN is often complicated by a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and venous air bubbles are an uncommon complication of it. We describe a 52-year-old woman who was admitted in coma, with a history of vomiting, and was found to have EPN with air bubbles in the uterine veins. We discuss the presentation, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of this uncommon but clinically significant event, and briefly review other case reports of venous gas or thrombosis caused by EPN.

Case Presentation

We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, presenting with loss of consciousness after vomiting for half a day. Abdominal computed tomography scan revealed unilateral EPN with air bubbles in the uterine veins. The blood, pus, and urine cultures were positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The patient's condition improved well after conservative management comprising supportive measures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, percutaneous drainage therapy, and an open operation.

Conclusions

Venous air bubbles are rare but fatal complication of EPN. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to ensure good results.

### Risk factors for mortality in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis: a meta-analysis [^f1180751]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Emphysematous pyelonephritis, an infection most commonly seen in cases of diabetes mellitus, is associated with considerable case fatality. We identified the factors associated with mortality in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis and estimated the magnitude of the associations.

Materials and Methods

PubMed was searched to identify studies reporting on risk factors of mortality in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis. A meta-analysis of the eligible studies was performed.

Results

Seven study cohorts, representing 175 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall mortality rate was 25%, ranging from 11% to 42%. Conservative treatment alone (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.19–6.81), bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis (OR 5.36, 95% CI 1.41–20.33), type I emphysematous pyelonephritis (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.13–5.65) and thrombocytopenia (OR 22.68, 95% CI 4.4–116.32) were associated with increased mortality. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl and disturbance of consciousness were also found to be associated with increased mortality. However, this finding was based on limited data. On the other hand, there was no association between mortality and diabetes mellitus (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.05–1.99) in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis.

Conclusions

The accumulated and analyzed evidence suggests that conservative treatment, type I emphysematous pyelonephritis, bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis and thrombocytopenia seem to be significant risk factors for mortality in patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis. These data may be taken into consideration when treating patients with this devastating infection.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes [^a4fe6455]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Results of various epidemiologic studies suggest that bacteriuria and urinary tract infection (UTI) occur more commonly in women with diabetes than in women without this disease. Similar findings have been demonstrated for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), with ASB being a risk factor for pyelonephritis and subsequent decline in renal function. Although ASB is not associated with serious health outcomes in healthy patients, further research needs to be undertaken regarding the impact of ASB in patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes often have increased complications of UTI, including such rare complications as emphysematous cystitis and pyelonephritis, fungal infections (particularly Candida species), and increased severity and unusual manifestations (e.g., gram-negative pathogens other than Escherichia coli). Anatomic and functional abnormalities of the urinary tract are also associated with diabetes. Such abnormalities result in greater instrumentation of the urinary tract, thereby increasing the risk of secondary UTI. In addition, these abnormalities complicate UTI and require specialized treatment strategies. There is a greater likelihood of UTI affected by antimicrobial resistance or atypical uropathogens, and the risk of upper tract involvement is increased. Pre- and posttherapy urine cultures are therefore indicated. The initial choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy should be based on Gram stain and urine culture. Choice of antibiotic therapy should integrate local sensitivity patterns of the infecting organism. Fluoroquinolones are a reasonable empiric choice for many patients with diabetes. For seriously ill patients, including patients infected with Pseudomonas spp., such agents as imipenem, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam may also be considered. Treatment of ASB in patients with diabetes is often recommended to prevent the risk of symptomatic UTI. However, the management of ASB in patients with diabetes is complex, with no single preferred approach.

### Emphysematous pyelonephritis caused by raoultella ornithinolytica: a case report [^ec72d005]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

EPN is caused mainly by bacterial invasion into the renal parenchyma. Bacteria proliferate and ascend along the urinary tract, producing gases from anaerobic metabolism, especially glucose fermentation. Therefore, a series of lesions, such as abscesses, vascular thrombi and necrotizing tissue, may occur in the kidney. The pathogenesis of EPN is believed to involve a variety of factors, including gas-forming bacteria, elevated tissue glucose concentrations, impaired tissue perfusion, and weakened immune responses, which are particularly common in diabetic patients. Common risk factors for EPN are diabetes mellitus (DM), female sex, chronic urinary tract infections, genitourinary obstruction (such as ureteral stones), low immunity, sepsis, shock and disturbance of consciousness. If left untreated, EPN may lead to high mortality rates. Thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, sepsis, shock and disturbance of consciousness are important risk factors for death in EPN patients. Notably, DM is a common risk factor for EPN but it may not be associated with increased mortality. Similarly, no significant associations were found between EPN mortality rates and factors such as sex, age, or other comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis, hypertension, and a history of cerebrovascular accidents.

### Pyelonephritis: radiologic-pathologic review [^cf6abdcc]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common urologic disease in the United States and annually account for over 7 million office and 1 million emergency department visits. In adults, diagnosis of urinary tract infection is typically based on characteristic clinical features and abnormal laboratory values. Imaging is usually reserved for patients who do not respond to therapy and for those whose clinical presentation is either atypical or potentially life threatening. Urinary tract infection typically originates in the urinary bladder; when it migrates to the kidney or is seeded there hematogenously, a tubulointerstitial inflammatory reaction ensues, involving the renal pelvis and parenchyma. The condition is characterized as pyelonephritis. Complicated and uncomplicated pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and tuberculosis are all urinary tract infections for which imaging evaluation adds diagnostic information important for patient care. Computed tomography (CT), when performed before, immediately after, and at delayed intervals from contrast material injection, is the preferred modality for evaluating acute bacterial pyelonephritis. CT is also preferred over conventional radiography and ultrasonography (US) for assessing emphysematous pyelonephritis. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a chronic granulomatous process, induced by recurrent bacterial urinary tract infection. Although US is useful in the diagnosis of this condition, CT is the main imaging tool, as it provides highly specific findings and accurate assessment of the extrarenal extent of disease, which is essential for surgical planning. The increasing prevalence of tuberculosis and continued emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains have significance for genitourinary radiologists, as the urinary tract is the most common extrapulmonary site of tuberculosis. Familiarity with the renal manifestations of the disease — pelvoinfundibular strictures, papillary necrosis, cortical low-attenuation masses, scarring, and calcification — will help in the diagnosis, even in the absence of documented pulmonary disease.

### Understanding cystic lung lesions in smokers with interstitial lung disease: radiologic-pathological correlation [^78c1bc12]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Honeycombing

Honeycombing has been defined radiologically as well-defined, rounded cystic structures, typically clustered in the subpleural region (Fig. 6a, b) as a consequence of destruction of lung parenchyma with loss of architecture. Although typically defined as several layers of cysts, a single layer is used for diagnosis, provided other signs of fibrosis are present. Distinction of honeycombing from emphysema and other cystic lesions associated with smoking ILD is challenging, with two large studies showing only a moderate interobserver correlation for the diagnosis of honeycombing, even among experienced radiologists. As a matter of fact, it has been described that honeycombing cysts are bigger in heavy smokers compared with non-smokers or patients with a lower smoking habit.

Fig. 6
Honeycombing. a CT shows basal fibrosis with small honeycombing cysts (black arrows) consisting of rounded cystic lesions clustered in the subpleural region associated with traction bronchiectasis (white arrows). b Bigger, thick-walled honeycombing cysts sharing their walls are seen. c Pathologically, in samples from other patients, honeycombing is characterized by enlarged airspaces surrounded by fibrosis and lined by bronchiolar (arrow) or hyperplastic alveolar epithelium (arrowheads). d The transition from bronchiolectasis, with bronchial epithelium and a uniform muscular layer (arrowheads in the inset magnification), to respiratory-lined cysts (arrows) is shown

Pathologically, honeycombing is characterized by enlarged airspaces surrounded by fibrosis and lined by bronchiolar or hyperplastic alveolar epithelium (Fig. 6c, d). In a study, honeycombing at CT has been correlated pathologically in explants mainly with respiratory-lined cysts and bronchiolectasis, the latter reflecting the continuum between bronchiolectasis and honeycombing as the hallmark findings of fibrosis at CT (Fig. 6c, d). The distinction of honeycombing cysts from coexisting cystic emphysematous lesions in fibrotic areas may be difficult for pathologists. In one study, honeycombing cysts were differentiated from emphysematous cysts by identifying columnar epithelial cells lining the inner surfaces of cysts.

### Giant colonic diverticulum: radiographic and MDCT characteristics [^2b71a8fd]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis and other diagnostic tools

Symptoms and signs of colonic diverticular disease and colorectal cancer are similar, and thus imaging is required to exclude malignancy. The general occurrence of GCD in the sigmoid colon may suggest diagnosis, but may also be misleading, since 10% of GCD do not occur in the sigmoid colon.

Radiological differential diagnosis should include abdominal abscess, localized pneumoperitoneum, large-bowel volvulus, enteric duplication cyst, Meckel's diverticulum, duodenal and jejunal diverticula, pneumatosis intestinalis, emphysematous cholecystitis, emphysematous cystitis, and infected pancreatic pseudocyst. However, on radiographs, duplication cysts are rarely found on the sigmoid colon and Meckel's diverticulum is generally located in the distal ileum and affects young children. CT scan of the abdomen may determine the differential diagnosis of GCD (Fig. 5). On CT, duplication cysts are usually fluid filled and fusiform, contrasting with round or oval gas-filled GCD. Further, the quantity of gas is generally greater in GCD than in abscesses; the explanation of such lies in the connection between the GCD and the colonic lumen.

Colonoscopy is a widely available and effective tool for assessing the colonic lumen and for ruling out carcinoma. However, it is not very useful for diagnosing GCD, since the connection point between the GCD and the colon cavity is small and hard to detect. In addition, colonoscopy is generally avoided due to the risk of perforation. Further, the diverticular ostium is frequently small and easily missed.

### Number of metabolic syndrome components is the central predictor of the impact of metabolic syndrome on outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy in staghorn nephrolithiasis [^6a9130a2]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Medium credibility.

With respect to clinical outcomes, Johans and colleagues performed the first study quantified by the number of MetS components, which showed that risk of post-PCNL myocardial infarction increased as the number of MetS components increased from 0 to 4 (Table 6). According to Table 1, our data showed that MetS affected PCNL mainly in safety instead of efficacy because of inflammatory and hemorrhagic disorders. These results were similar to those reported by Nalbant and colleagues. Additionally, the baseline of complete staghorn stones and positive urine culture, an independent risk of post-PCNL infection, was comparable between groups, supporting the specific effect of MetS on hemorrhage and urinary tract infections. Table 2 further confirmed DM and the number of MetS components as independent risk factors, whereas HDL was an independent protective factor.

Table 6.
The Literature Review of the Impact of Metabolic Syndrome on Outcomes of Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy

First, HT produces hyaline degeneration in the arteriole, which thickens the arteriole wall and decreases blood irrigation. Second, the DM thickens the basement membrane in the capillary and is more likely to develop fast macrovascular atherosclerosis. Third, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia are known to induce atherosclerosis. HDL functions the efflux of cholesterol in macrophage-derived foam cells under angiothelium through ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 pathways, which has antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects against atherosclerosis. Therefore, patients with MetS are more prone to develop vascular lesions, which result in dysfunction of coagulation and higher blood loss during operations.

The other major risk of infectious complication caused by MetS may involve immune dysfunction by DM and dyslipidemia. Patients with obesity and DM are more likely to develop urinary tract infections (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.10–1.39)and are more likely to exhibit sever urinary infections, such as xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, emphysematous cystitis, uroseptic shock, and death. High TG and low HDL decrease cellular immunity by reducing the function of dendritic cells and T lymphocytes.DM impairs humoral immune response by reducing total IgG and specific IgG. MetS causes a proinflammatory state and changes in extracellular matrix through higher C reactive protein, tumor necrosis α, and endothelin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, but lower nitric oxide by an excessive reactive oxygen species stress disorder.

### Emphysematous cholecystitis in diabetic patients… [^0380a10e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ACUTE EMPHYSEMATOUS cholecystitis is an uncommon disease which was first reported by Welch and Flexner1 in 1896 as an autopsy finding, the causative organism was Bacillus aerogenes capsulatus. Stolz2 in 1901 described gas in the gallbladder and biliary ducts as an autopsy finding in three patients. Lobinger3 in 1908 found gas in the gallbladder lumen associated with intramural gas in a patient who was operated on for acute cholecystitis. The first roentgenographic findings were described by von Friederich4 in 1929, and Hegner5 in 1931 made the first reported roentgenographic diagnosis in the US by describing the circumferential layer of gas in the gallbladder wall. Edinburgh and Geffen6 in 1958 reviewed 49 cases published in the world literature and added one of their own. Among these 50 patients, the incidence of diabetes was 24% and that of biliary calculi was 80%. Marshall and Carvalho HP, Mulero HL, Jackiw NM.

### Venous gas caused by emphysematous pyelonephritis: a case report and review of literature [^150a605c]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

EPN is a life-threatening and acute severe necrotizing infection, involving the renal parenchyma, collecting system, and/or perinephric tissue by gas-producing uropathogens. E. coli has been isolated from pus or urine cultures in approximately 75% of EPN cases, and other pathogens, such as Klebsiella and Proteus, have also been reported. Its risk factors include DM (up to 95% of patients), female gender, reduced host immunity, chronic urinary tract infections, and genitourinary obstruction. Mortality in EPN has been attributed to patients with disturbed consciousness, thrombocytopenia, and septic complications.

Abdominal CT is currently the preferred radiographic modality for diagnosing EPN and staging its severity, which is correlated with its management. EPN is classified into four classes: Class 1 indicates gas confined to the collecting system; Class 2 indicates gas confined to the renal parenchyma without extension to extrarenal space; Class 3A indicates extension of gas or abscess to perinephric space-as in our patient; Class 3B pertains to extension of the gas or abscess to the pararenal space; and Class 4 refers to bilateral EPN or a solitary kidney with EPN. According to this classification, our patient was had Class 3B EPN.

Venous gas is a rare complication of EPN and, to our knowledge, there have been only 15 previously reported cases of EPN with venous gas (Table 1). Of these cases, 13 (87%) of patients were diabetic, and 12 (80%) were female. E. coli were the most common bacteria identified (11/15, 73%). The portal vein (7/15, 47%) and the inferior vena cava (5/15, 33%) were the most common blood vessels involved. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of EPN with venous gas in the uterine vein. Thrombosis is another rare complication of EPN. According to our knowledge, there have been only three previously reported cases of EPN with venous thrombosis (Table 1). All three cases were female, and unlike venous gas, the renal veins were the most common blood vessels involved by EPN with venous thrombosis.

Clinical evidence regarding infection susceptibility and outcomes

Diabetic patients have increased susceptibility to infection.

Contrary to common belief, the association between diabetes and increased susceptibility to infection was not clear for a long time. Recent clinical reports, however, provide reasonably solid evidence that susceptibility to a variety of infections is increased in diabetic patients (Table 2 A). In addition, several unusual infections such as malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and emphysematous cholecystitis occur almost exclusively in diabetic patients (reviewed in and). Diabetes-related complications such as microvascular damage and neuropathy are important causes of skin ulceration, which likely predisposes patients to secondary skin infections. In a database study using patient data from 8,655 diabetic patients and demographically matched control subjects across the U.S. diabetes was identified as an important risk factor for skin infections including abscess and cellulitis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.8). Other infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) are also more common in diabetic subjects. A prospective case-control study in 218 diabetic patients and 799 sex-matched control subjects found a twofold increase in the relative risk of UTIs in diabetic women compared with control subjects. Different potential mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility for UTIs in diabetic subjects were postulated. Higher glucose concentrations in urine may promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and act as a culture medium. Genitourinary neurologic damage due to diabetes may result in dysfunctional bladder voiding and relative urinary retention, resulting in conditions conducive to UTI. Bacteriuria in patients with diabetes may result in severe infections such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis, perinephric abscess, and candida pyelonephritis (reviewed in).

### Morphological transition after medical treatment of emphysematous pyelonephritis over time-case report [^63f305f1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We presented the trajectory of a high-risk EPN in a patient who was medically treated at initial presentation and completed by elective nephrectomy. At presentation, widespread multilocular gas was confirmed in the whole swollen left kidney, which gradually dissolved and "liquified" to form a niveau in the retroperitoneum space mostly where the cortex occupied. The interval between this change was about less than 2 weeks. As far as we know, such graphical transitions based on Wan's classification of medically treated pyelonephritis has not been reported.

Studies on EPN have mainly focused on the CT morphology at presentation and the prognosis depending on the treatment either surgical or medical. The classification by Huang et al is distinguished by CT scan and evaluated by the extension of gas inside or outside the infected kidney (Table 1). This classification is believed to represent the severity of the disease and therefore, related to prognosis. This case would be diagnosed as class 3A at initial presentation and 3B with the following formation of ilipsoas abscess, which is suggested to be a severe form of EPN. The report by Wan et al is more simple and discriminates between two types of presentation as having (type II) or not having (type I) fluid collection (Table 2). Using this classification, this case would be type I at presentation and type II after several days of medical treatment. Our report shows that CT morphology may differ during the course of treatment. Indeed, in Wan's report, type I EPN was diagnosed 4 days after symptom onset and type II EPN was 11 days. Though the literature on EPN are based mostly on single or collective case reports, type I EPN has been related to higher mortality. Reports including those from Wan have proposed that the two subtypes may represent different pathophysiologic responses to infection. It can be speculated from our case that during successful intensive medical treatment, type I transforms into type II though the extension of infection may not change unless drainage or nephrectomy is performed.

Patient 4 was a 60-year-old man who was receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for renal failure 15 years after kidney transplantation for chronic glomerulonephritis; he sought care for acute peritonitis. Upon cultivation of yeasts in the dialysis fluid, caspofungin was started and changed to voriconazole when B. capitatus was identified. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved, and voriconazole was discontinued after 4 weeks.

Patient 5 was a 56-year-old woman who underwent combined pancreas–kidney transplantation because of diabetic nephropathy and pancreatic insufficiency in December 2010. Two months later, B. capitatus was cultivated in urine while she was being treated empirically with caspofungin for possible fungal infection. Emphysematous cystitis was detected by computed tomographic scan, and B. capitatus was cultured from urine collected from the right kidney. Despite treatment with voriconazole, B. capitatus was cultured from urine for several weeks; however, the patient recovered.

Case presentation

A 65-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of right flank pain and fatigue. On the day of admission, she was found immobile at home and was transported by ambulance. Her medical history included diabetes mellitus and breast cancer 10 years ago. At admission, vital signs included: Glasgow Coma Scale: E4V5M6, blood pressure 77/55 mm Hg, heart rate 120 beats/min, temperature 36.2°C, and respiratory rate 42/min. Physical examination revealed a mildly distended abdomen with right flank and costovertebral angle tenderness. Blood tests showed white bleed cell count 18.5x10 9 /L, hemoglobin 11.7 × 10–1 g/L, platelet 7.8×10–5 /L, blood urea nitrogen 67.9 mg/dL, creatinine 3.53 mg/dL, sodium 124 mEq/L, potassium 3.7 mEq/L, chloride 84 mEq/L, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio 1.29, blood glucose 543 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 12.1%. Blood gas analysis was significant for metabolic acidosis with pH 7.41, arterial oxygen pressure 101.6 mm Hg, PaCO 2 16.1 mm Hg, bicarbonate 10.0 mEq/L, base excess 12.1 mEq/L, and lactic acid 3.43 mmol/dL. Urinalysis showed white blood cell 3+ and occult blood 3+. CT scan of the abdomen revealed emphysematous changes in the right kidney (figure 1), and the diagnosis of right emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) class 3B was made. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). After obtaining blood and urine cultures, meropenem and vancomycin were administered intravenously. Resuscitation continued with intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and steroids according to surviving sepsis guidelines, but her condition deteriorated. Six hours after admission, she was intubated and required mechanical ventilation. A portable abdominal X-ray showed progression of emphysematous changes in the right kidney (figure 2).

3.2.5 Urologic comorbidities

Urologic comorbidities can occur in both T1DM and T2DM. The primary reason for such comorbidities is urogenital tract infections (UTI), which have higher incidence rates in patients with DM (increased urinary glucose excretion, greater adherence of bacteria to the uroepithelium, chronic neurologic bladder dysfunction and weakened immune responses). Furthermore, sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can slightly increase the risk of UTI, despite recent meta‐analyses suggesting no increased risk of severe bacterial infections. Male patients with DM (both T1DM and T2DM) have a threefold higher risk for asymptomatic bacteriuria and an increased risk of UTI recurrence, balanitis, balanoposthitis and male accessory gland infection. While Escherichia coli has been the most frequently observed pathogen, other unusual microorganisms can be found (e.g. Klebsiella, fungal infections, gram negative rods, enterococci, group B streptococci, Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis). As such, early diagnosis of UTI is imperative to avoid complications such as emphysematous cystitis, pyelonephritis, renal failure and bacteraemia. Balanitis or balanoposthitis, which are very frequent in patients with DM, mainly depend on Candida albicans, whereas male accessory gland infection often occurs in patients with DM with autonomic neuropathy.

DM (T2DM more than T1DM) has also been associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Both hypoxia due to vascular damage and hyperinsulinaemia are in fact important stimuli for prostate growth. In addition, increased HbA1c levels have been associated with further increased risk of overactive bladder urgency, urge urinary incontinence and nocturia. Additionally, several studies have described a potential association between neuropathic complications and LUTS, also in T1DM. Finally, Peyronie's disease (PD), a connective tissue disorder of the penis characterised by impaired deposition of collagen and formation of fibrous plaques that may cause penile deformity with consequent pain and discomfort during erections, must be considered.DM has been identified as a risk factor for PD, with prevalence rates of DM among patients with PD ranging between 10% and 43%.

In conclusion, urinary complications of DM have been associated with general discomfort and decreased quality of life, unfavourable psychological effects and possibly depression and psychiatric symptoms. Recent findings have revealed that among men with DM, those with LUTS have a higher prevalence of ED than those without LUTS.

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^d04c84fc]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of perineal and genital infections

Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a rare, life-threatening necrotizing polymicrobial infection of the perineal, perianal and genital structure, commonly occurring in diabetics, with a striking male predominance (male-to-female ratio, 10:1). FG may further complicate a lower UTI, or originate from different infections such as colorectal infections, anal fistulas or pressure ulceration. Clinical presentation includes local pain, swollen oedematous or gangrenous overlying skin, sometimes with appreciable crepitus, and progressive hyperthermia. FG represents a surgical emergency: aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics are required to prevent a fatal outcome.

CT is by far the best modality for imaging of FG; it quickly and comprehensively visualises the extent of FG involvement. CT features include subcutaneous fat stranding at the involved areas, fascial thickening, superficial or deep fluid and air-attenuation collections. Subcutaneous emphysema produced by anaerobic bacteria is the hallmark of FG and is present in approximately 90% of cases (Fig. 19). Furthermore, CT can define the starting point of the infectious process, thereby allowing differentiation of complicated perineal infections from urinary versus an alternative source, particularly cryptogenic perianal sepsis (Fig. 20).

a Cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis with venous gas

b Cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis with venous thrombosis

However, the precise mechanisms of venous air bubble formation in EPN have not been determined. Sebastià et al. proposed three possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of portomesenteric vein gas associated with infectious abdominal disease: (1) sepsis in the mesentery and portal vein branches; (2) increased intracavitary fermentation of carbohydrates caused by bacteria; and (3) perforation of a mesenteric abscess in the mesenteric lumen, which separates between the peritoneal lobules of the mesenteric membrane to enter the mesenteric vein. It was previously reported that infected bubbles enter the bloodstream and can form seeds in various organs, leading to the spread of infection. In this patient, we speculate that the uterine vein gas was caused by sepsis in the uterine vein, because she had septic shock and a high blood sugar level on admission. The high plasma glucose level serves as a favorable environment for Enterobacteriaceae's mixed acid fermentation to produce gas, the main components of which are carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The precise mechanisms of venous thrombosis in EPN have also not been determined. Similar to Jignesh et al. we speculate that it was likely provoked by an infectious, and therefore hypercoagulable state.

Of 15 patients with venous gas, 5 were treated with nephrectomy, 5 underwent PCD, 3 were treated with antibiotics and general management alone, and 1 patient underwent exploratory operation. Two patients died. One patient, with air in the renal vein and septic emboli in the lungs, died of cardiac arrest within hours of admission. One died because of cardiovascular collapse resulted from septic shock, endogenous air emboli, or a combination of both. Of 3 cases with thrombosis in EPN, one was treated with nephrectomy, one underwent PCD, and one was treated with antibiotics and general management alone. All three patients achieved an improved clinical outcome. However, the incidence of venous gas and thrombosis in patients with EPN may be underestimated, especially in patients with poor prognosis, because venous gas and thrombosis may be overlooked on radiological images of EPN, especially in patients without enhanced abdominal CT.

RAPID/RAPID Extension life-years gained analysis

A post-hoc analysis of the RAPID/RAPID Extension program investigated the time to respiratory crisis for progressive emphysema, defined as death, lung transplant or a crippling respiratory condition. Seven patients withdrew from the 4-year program (final mean FEV 1% predicted of 36.1%) due to a respiratory crisis, with an average final recorded lung density of approximately 20.5 g/L (Table 1). Using this value as the terminal lung density, and by comparing the rate of decline in lung density loss in A 1 -PI-treated patients (−1.51 g/L/year) with placebo-treated patients (−2.26 g/L/year), the projected gain in life-years (time to terminal respiratory failure) was approximately 5.6 years (Fig. 2).

This post-hoc calculation has a number of limitations. The calculation is based on a very small sample size (n = 7), and is only a preliminary estimate. In addition, the analysis presumes a linear decline in loss of lung density. Furthermore, whilst the analysis aimed to explore a mortality benefit, the trials in the RAPID program were not sufficiently powered to assess mortality; a substantially larger pool of terminal CT data from patients with AATD, similar to that of the NHLBI registry (n = 1129), would be needed to refine and validate this approach. Three deaths were recorded in the placebo arm of RAPID-RCT compared with one death in the active treatment arm over the first two years. An additional death was reported in the Early-Start group of the 2-year RAPID-OLE.

5.5 Renal Failure

In the randomized clinical trial (TROPIC), renal failure of any grade occurred in 4% of the patients being treated with cabazitaxel, including four cases with fatal outcome. Most cases occurred in association with sepsis, dehydration, or obstructive uropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some deaths due to renal failure did not have a clear etiology. Appropriate measures should be taken to identify causes of renal failure and treat aggressively.

5.6 Urinary Disorders Including Cystitis

Cystitis, radiation cystitis, and hematuria, including that requiring hospitalization, has been reported with cabazitaxel in patients who previously received pelvic radiation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In PROSELICA, cystitis and radiation cystitis were reported in 1.2% and 1.5% of patients who received prior radiation, respectively. Hematuria was reported in 19.4% of patients who received prior radiation and in 14.4% of patients who did not receive prior radiation. Cystitis from radiation recall may occur late in treatment with cabazitaxel. Monitor patients who previously received pelvic radiation for signs and symptoms of cystitis while on cabazitaxel. Interrupt or discontinue cabazitaxel in patients experiencing severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat severe hemorrhagic cystitis.

5.7 Respiratory Disorders

Interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with underlying lung disease may be at higher risk for these events. Acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in the setting of infection. Interrupt cabazitaxel if new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop. Closely monitor, promptly investigate, and appropriately treat patients receiving cabazitaxel. Consider discontinuation. The benefit of resuming cabazitaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated.

Evidence strength determination and study quality — grading and assessment approach: The categorization of evidence strength is conceptually distinct from the quality of individual studies; AUA categorizes body of evidence strength as Grade A (well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or exceptionally strong observational studies), Grade B (RCTs with some weaknesses of procedure or generalizability or generally strong observational studies), or Grade C (observational studies that are inconsistent, have small sample sizes, or have other problems that potentially confound interpretation of data). Quality of individual RCTs or crossover trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and because placebo effects are common, procedural deviations that could compromise randomization or blinding resulted in a rating of increased risk of bias; the quality of individual observational studies was not assessed. Because treatment data are difficult to interpret without placebo control, bodies of evidence entirely lacking placebo controls were assigned a strength rating of Grade C.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^2ae63704]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### Lack of uniformity among United States recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated cystitis [^f814ecab]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Eosinophilic cystitis complicated with cystitis glandularis: a case report [^9b7df35b]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

EC is a scarce inflammatory disease of the bladder, first presented in 1960 by Brown. Because of the small number of patients suffer from EC, only about Two hundred cases of EC have been described, the etiology and pathogenesis of EC is not well understood, treatment modalities are not agreed upon. Most EC patients present with mucosal lesions of the bladder, only few studies have described mass-forming or malignancy-mimicking EC. As far as we know, there is no literature published about EC complicated with cystitis glandularis. The report of this case brings a guide for doctors to comprehend EC complicated with CG.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^dc26a5db]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Symptom control usually required the maximum tolerated dose of an antibiotic and, in some patients, more than one drug. This reality is not surprising given what we now know about host/pathogen interactions in rUTI. Polymicrobial infections are not unusual. Given that genomic and other more modern approaches began to reveal bacterial diversity in this patient population, antibiotics targeting fastidious organisms were also introduced. In addition, several common uropathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica, are known to invade urothelial cells and form intracellular bacterial communities. Such reservoirs may be resistant to antibiotics present in the lumen, as many such drugs are not cell-permeant. This means that any sequestered bacteria are free to emerge later to reinitiate infection. The deeper layers of the bladder mucosa may harbour bacterial reservoirs, and cell turnover is slow. Uropathogens can also form biofilms that elaborate a polymeric capsule, conferring intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Most bacteria within these biofilms divide little, thereby failing to express a therapeutic target for most antimicrobial drugs. These insights might account for the protracted treatment periods required to achieve disease regression. Recurrent relapse, experienced by some patients in association with antimicrobial withdrawal, might be explained by similar mechanisms. The failure of some patients to tolerate antimicrobial withdrawal represents a significant clinical challenge that needs to be addressed in future work.

It is worth noting that intracellular reservoirs and biofilms clinging to shed urothelial cells are unlikely to be recovered during routine MSU culture. This test samples very small volumes of urine supernatant (typically 1–10 µl), whereas infected cells settle quickly to the bottom of sample tubes. Our laboratory and others have found that enhanced collection methods involving collecting sediment via centrifugation provide the necessary sensitivity.

The damped oscillations in pyuria demonstrated by most patients under treatment in this study suggest that antibiotic inhibition in the lower urinary tract is partial. Damped oscillations are seen in systems in which the retarding force, in this case antimicrobial therapy, is smaller than the force it opposes. The damped oscillator and long treatment periods needed support the use of maximum antibiotic doses. These oscillations also argue against our results being explained by simple regression to the mean.

### Acute cystitis and subsequent risk of urogenital cancer: a national cohort study from Sweden [^84bc6ff1]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Implications and further research

The present study adds to the accumulating evidence of infections as markers of increased cancer risk. For clinicians, the findings indicate that acute cystitis could be a clinical marker for urogenital cancer (at least when no other cause is obvious), and particularly for occult urogenital cancer, as the risks for cancers were highest within 3 months of cystitis diagnosis. Although the risks for urogenital cancers were attenuated over time, the risks remained high up to 12 months after acute cystitis for most urogenital cancers, suggesting a possibility for earlier cancer detection. Beyond 1 year of follow-up from cystitis diagnosis, the elevated risks of urogenital cancers decreased further for most cancers, with excess cancer rates below 1 per 10 000 person-years for most cancers, except bladder and endometrial cancers. This pattern may reflect a compensatory deficit of cancer diagnoses after an increased detection rate in the first 12 months after cystitis, indicating that follow-up beyond 1 year might have limited cost benefit. For healthcare, the implication is especially important for primary healthcare, as most cystitis cases are diagnosed and many forms of cancer present in this setting. Additionally, our findings imply that cystitis precedes urogenital cancer differently across sex and age groups, indicating that the clinical relevance of cystitis as a potential marker for urogenital cancers may vary across populations. For policymakers, it remains to be determined whether the sustained long-term subsequent risks of urogenital cancers following cystitis could be used to help earlier detection or even prevention of urogenital cancers. For example, precancerous changes in the urogenital system may facilitate cystitis by compromising the urinary tract. Lastly, considering that haematuria can be a symptom of acute cystitis and urinary tract cancers, future studies could also examine whether those with concomitant cystitis and haematuria have an increased risk of subsequent urinary tract cancers compared with those presenting with either cystitis or haematuria.

In conclusion, this population-based cohort study found that acute cystitis is a common infection among adults aged ≥ 50 years, often diagnosed in primary healthcare settings, and can precede urogenital cancers. The cancer risks were particularly high within 3 months after acute cystitis, suggesting that acute cystitis might be a useful clinical marker for urogenital cancer, especially for bladder and prostate cancer. The persistent risk beyond 3 months might present an opportunity for earlier detection of urogenital cancer, but this warrants further research including health economic evaluations.

### How do patients with interstitial cystitis present? [^c4b2953c]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined how interstitial cystitis progresses from initial symptoms to diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 45 patients to determine the dates of symptom onset and diagnosis, and sequence of urgency/frequency, nocturia and pain. We also documented alternate and previous diagnoses, and previous surgical treatments.

Results

Of the patients 89% presented with only 1 symptom. Median time from the initial symptom to all symptoms was 2 years (mean 5.5). The most common previous diagnoses were urinary infection in 19 cases, a gynecologic diagnosis in 14 and urethral diagnoses in 6. A previous urinary infection was documented in only 1 of 19 patients, while 11 had undergone hysterectomy and 5 diagnosed with endometriosis had no pathological documentation available.

Conclusions

Early interstitial cystitis presents variably and usually with only a single symptom of urgency/frequency, nocturia or pain. Clinicians may fail to appreciate the symptoms of early interstitial cystitis, which leads to delayed diagnosis until the patient is more symptomatic. With time multiple symptoms manifest. Bacterial cystitis, prostatitis, endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain are common initial misdiagnoses. Interstitial cystitis should be considered when laboratory documentation of alternate diagnoses is lacking or when patients fail to respond to therapy for alternate diagnoses.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^220d5dcb]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

For each indication we calculated the proportion of prescriptions longer than the recommended duration separately for children (< 16 years) and for people aged 16 years or older, and by antibiotic where guidelines recommended different durations for particular drugs. Because guidelines recommend longer antibiotic courses to treat acute cystitis in males than females, we performed separate analyses for males and females for this condition. The cause of acute prostatitis in young men is often differentfrom that in older men (sexually transmitted organisms versus mostly Enterobacteriaceae, respectively), and prescribers might fear chronic prostatitis more in older men. Therefore we evaluated three age groups for acute prostatitis: < 35, 35–65, and > 65 years old. In addition, for all conditions we performed a secondary analysis restricting to healthy patients, defined as those with no chronic kidney disease, COPD, asthma, coronary heart disease, immunosuppressive disease, or use of immunosuppressive drugs, systemic corticosteroids, or inhaled corticosteroids.

We used multiple imputations through chained equations using sequential regression trees to impute duration data that were missing in 10–20% of the consultations (see supplementary file 2 for more details). Confidence intervals were calculated using multiple imputation Wilson intervals, which have better properties than the usual multiple imputation confidence intervals, in particular always being bounded by zero and one. In sensitivity analysis, we restricted the analysis to data with no missing values.

In addition, we calculated the total number of excess antibiotic days, defined as the total number of days beyond the recommended duration in the guidelines.

All analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 (packages: "dplyr", "ggplot2", "mice", "nlme").

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Results will be disseminated to relevant patient communities through news media.
