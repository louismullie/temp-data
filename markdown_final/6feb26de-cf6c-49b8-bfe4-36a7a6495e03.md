## Question

Pancreatoblastoma in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pancreatoblastoma in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and demographics to frame rarity and age distribution. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and how it differs from pediatric cases. Next, I will examine imaging features and the differential diagnosis, followed by the pathologic hallmarks and molecular features that secure the diagnosis. After that, I need to review management principles, including surgery, chemotherapy, and the role of molecular-guided therapy. Finally, I will appraise prognosis, consider special scenarios like ampullary origin, and synthesize a practical diagnostic and treatment algorithm with explicit self-checks and caveats throughout.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and demographics so I don't overstate anything. Pancreatoblastoma is exceedingly rare in adults, with most cases reported in children under 10 years, and adult presentations are exceptional; a literature review identified 41 adult cases with a mean age around 41 years, while a separate series of 30 cases included only 6 adults, underscoring the pediatric predominance and the scarcity of adult data [^111geSFd] [^111YRvoG]. Hold on, I should verify whether contemporary databases shift this picture; an NCDB analysis of 82 cases reported a mean age of 55.3 years, suggesting that adult cases may be underrepresented in the literature and that registry data capture older patients, which helps reconcile the apparent discrepancy in mean age across sources [^1141xgoq].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation in adults, and I need to ensure I distinguish it from the pediatric pattern. Adults commonly present with nonspecific abdominal pain, weight loss, and obstructive jaundice when the tumor involves the pancreatic head; a large proportion of adult tumors exceed 8 cm at diagnosis, which aligns with advanced presentation and contributes to diagnostic delay and misclassification as other solid pancreatic neoplasms [^111geSFd]. Wait, let me verify the jaundice claim; yes, head-of-pancreas lesions frequently cause biliary obstruction with cholestatic labs, consistent with general principles of pancreatic head masses, and this mechanistic link supports the observed jaundice frequency in adult pancreatoblastoma series [^111UTvti].

> Next, I should review imaging features and the differential diagnosis, and I must be careful not to jump to conclusions based on appearance alone. On contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, pancreatoblastoma typically manifests as a large, heterogeneous, solid and cystic mass with lobulated contours, necrosis, and enhancing septations; calcifications can occur, and margins may be well circumscribed but not encapsulated, which can mimic solid pseudopapillary neoplasm or acinar cell carcinoma in adults [^117NXiim] [^112kFGzY]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PET; 18F-FDG PET/CT can show variable uptake, sometimes intense in metastases and modest in the primary, and dual-tracer PET/MR with FDG and DOTATATE may show discordant avidity, reflecting mixed differentiation and helping distinguish from pure neuroendocrine tumors, though this is not pathognomonic and must be integrated with morphology and immunohistochemistry [^116ofeGa] [^113pNPSV].

> Let me consider the key differentials and where misdiagnosis commonly occurs. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and conventional ductal adenocarcinoma are frequent considerations; misclassification as neuroendocrine carcinoma has been reported when limited biopsy material shows synaptophysin positivity without the full architectural context, so I need to ensure adequate tissue sampling and panel interpretation before committing to a diagnosis [^115Bc183]. I should double-check that imaging alone cannot reliably separate these entities; indeed, overlapping enhancement patterns and necrosis necessitate pathologic confirmation, particularly in adults where pancreatoblastoma is unexpected [^112kFGzY].

> Now, I will confirm the pathologic hallmarks that anchor diagnosis. The defining feature is squamoid corpuscles within a neoplasm showing multiphenotypic differentiation toward acinar, endocrine, and ductal lineages; immunohistochemistry typically shows acinar markers such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase, endocrine markers like synaptophysin and chromogranin in a subset, and epithelial markers including AE1/AE3, with β-catenin nuclear accumulation supporting Wnt pathway activation [^113hfXbH]. Wait, let me verify the molecular correlate; alterations in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including CTNNB1 and APC mutations, are common in pancreatoblastoma, and loss of 11p has been described, aligning with its relationship to acinar neoplasms and helping in molecularly ambiguous cases [^111U57nT].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic workflow is explicit and practical. Preoperative tissue diagnosis is often challenging due to heterogeneity and limited biopsy material; EUS-guided FNA or core biopsy with a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel and, when needed, molecular testing for Wnt pathway alterations can improve diagnostic yield and reduce misclassification, and this approach is consistent with evolving standards for small pancreatic biopsies in rare solid neoplasms [^113JTd2a] [^114rETsn]. Hold on, I should verify that multidisciplinary review is emphasized; yes, consensus statements for pancreatic solid masses endorse MDT review to integrate imaging, cytology, and molecular data for optimal classification and planning [^117VAUiU].

> Next, I should review management principles, starting with surgery as the cornerstone. For localized disease, margin-negative resection is the primary curative modality; in adults, this typically entails pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy with regional lymphadenectomy, and outcomes hinge on completeness of resection and pathologic stage, mirroring principles from pediatric protocols adapted to adult anatomy and comorbidity profiles [^111b16xh] [^116XjpA8]. Wait, let me verify the role of pancreas-sparing approaches; while central pancreatectomy has been reported in adolescents to preserve function, adult data are sparse, so procedure selection should be individualized at high-volume centers balancing oncologic clearance with exocrine and endocrine preservation [^116J5yxa].

> I should confirm the role and uncertainty of systemic therapy. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often extrapolated from pediatric experience and acinar cell carcinoma regimens, with agents such as vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine used in various combinations; however, evidence is limited to case reports and small series, and durable responses are uncommon in adults, underscoring the need for clinical trial enrollment when feasible [^111YRvoG] [^112UmKxM]. But wait, what if molecular vulnerabilities exist; Wnt pathway activation and DNA repair defects have been described in acinar neoplasms, suggesting potential roles for Wnt-targeted strategies or DNA damage–response agents, though these remain investigational for pancreatoblastoma and should be considered within trials or specialized centers [^113hfXbH] [^111U57nT].

> I will now examine prognosis and prognostic factors, and I need to be cautious given small numbers. Adults appear to have worse outcomes than children, with high rates of metastasis at diagnosis and shorter median survival; in one adult series, metastases were present in 41.5% and survival was poor, whereas pediatric cohorts show high long-term survival after complete resection but meaningful recurrence risk, highlighting the importance of stage and resectability [^111geSFd] [^112Kgim5]. Hold on, I should verify whether adult registry data align; the NCDB analysis confirms that most patients undergo surgery and a minority receive chemotherapy, but detailed survival estimates are limited, reinforcing the need for prospective data and standardized staging using UICC criteria to enable meaningful comparisons [^1141xgoq] [^113SMbWn].

> Let me consider special scenarios that can alter presentation and outcomes. Ampullary pancreatoblastoma, though rare, may present earlier with obstructive jaundice and be amenable to timely resection; recent reports even suggest a precursor adenoma–to–pancreatoblastoma sequence with shared CTNNB1 mutations, which could refine early detection strategies and pathogenic models in select adults [^115TF8X4]. I should confirm that earlier diagnosis in this anatomic context is plausible; yes, ampullary masses often cause biliary obstruction earlier than purely parenchymal lesions, potentially expediting intervention and improving resectability rates [^1125W3QQ].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic and treatment algorithm and double-check each step for internal consistency. Suspect pancreatoblastoma in adults with a large, heterogeneous, solid and cystic pancreatic mass, especially with endocrine or acinar features on limited biopsy, and proceed with high-quality multiphasic CT or MRI plus EUS-guided tissue acquisition with a full immunohistochemical panel and, when indicated, Wnt pathway molecular testing; stage with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and consider FDG-PET/CT for metabolic profiling and metastatic survey; manage at a high-volume pancreatic center with MDT review; for localized disease, pursue margin-negative resection; for borderline resectable or locally advanced disease, consider neoadjuvant therapy within trials; for metastatic disease, prioritize surgical debulking when feasible and enroll in clinical trials for systemic therapy, given the limited evidence base in adults [^113JTd2a] [^117VAUiU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include CA 19–9 routinely, but I should correct that; CA 19–9 is not reliable for diagnosis or screening in this context and should not be used to distinguish pancreatoblastoma from other solid neoplasms, though it may be elevated with biliary obstruction and can serve as a disease burden marker in ductal adenocarcinoma workflows, which do not directly apply here [^111UTvti].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically grounded and reference-aligned. Adult pancreatoblastoma is a rare, large, heterogeneous pancreatic neoplasm with multiphenotypic differentiation that is frequently misdiagnosed; diagnosis hinges on recognizing squamoid corpuscles with acinar, endocrine, and ductal markers and Wnt pathway alterations, best achieved with adequate tissue and expert pathology; complete surgical resection offers the only realistic chance of cure, while systemic therapy remains empiric and should be pursued within trials; prognosis in adults is guarded and inferior to children, emphasizing early recognition, accurate classification, and management at experienced centers [^113hfXbH] [^111b16xh] [^111geSFd].

Pancreatoblastoma in adults is a **rare, aggressive malignancy** with a mean age of 41–55 years and a slight male predominance [^111geSFd] [^1141xgoq]. It typically presents as a large, heterogeneous, solid-cystic pancreatic mass with calcifications and frequent liver and lymph node metastases [^111geSFd] [^116w8ZEK]. Diagnosis relies on **histopathology with squamoid corpuscles** and immunohistochemistry showing acinar, endocrine, and ductal differentiation; molecular testing often reveals Wnt/β-catenin pathway alterations [^113hfXbH] [^111U57nT]. Complete surgical resection is the **cornerstone of therapy**; adjuvant chemotherapy is considered for advanced or metastatic disease, though evidence is limited [^111YRvoG] [^111b16xh]. Prognosis is **poor**, with 5-year survival ~20–30% and median survival ~25 months, especially in adults [^111YRvoG] [^112UmKxM].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical presentation

- **Rarity and age**: Extremely rare in adults; mean age 41–55 years, with slight male predominance [^111geSFd] [^1141xgoq].
- **Symptoms**: Nonspecific — abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and obstructive jaundice from biliary compression [^notfound].
- **Tumor size**: Typically large (> 8 cm) at diagnosis, often with metastases at presentation [^111geSFd].

---

## Imaging features

Imaging shows a **large, heterogeneous, solid-cystic mass** with well-defined or partially circumscribed margins, often with calcifications and necrosis [^117NXiim] [^116w8ZEK]. On CT/MRI, enhancement is heterogeneous with internal septations and necrotic areas; **FDG-PET** may show increased uptake, aiding detection of metastases [^116ofeGa] [^113pNPSV].

---

## Histopathological features

- **Architecture**: Lobular growth with epithelial differentiation and squamoid corpuscles (pathognomonic) [^1125W3QQ].
- **Differentiation**: Mixed acinar, endocrine, and ductal differentiation on immunohistochemistry [^111YRvoG].
- **Markers**: Trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and β-catenin (nuclear) are typical [^115TF8X4].

---

## Molecular and genetic features

Wnt/β-catenin pathway alterations — such as **CTNNB1 or APC mutations** — are common [^111U57nT]. Chromosomal **11p loss** has also been reported [^113hfXbH].

---

## Diagnostic challenges

The **differential** includes acinar cell carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, neuroendocrine tumor, and ductal adenocarcinoma [^notfound]. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to **radiologic overlap** with other pancreatic neoplasms; definitive diagnosis requires histopathology and immunohistochemistry [^115sgJNx] [^114rETsn].

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Surgery**: Complete surgical resection is the cornerstone; margin-negative resection offers the best chance of survival [^111YRvoG] [^111b16xh].
- **Chemotherapy**: Adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens (e.g. vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, gemcitabine) are used for advanced or metastatic disease, though evidence is limited [^111YRvoG] [^112UmKxM].
- **Radiation**: Limited role; occasionally used for palliation or local control [^112Kgim5] [^112UmKxM].

---

## Prognosis and survival

Adult prognosis is **poor**, with 5-year survival ~20–30% and median survival ~25 months [^111YRvoG] [^112UmKxM]. Prognostic factors include complete resection, absence of metastases, and low proliferative index [^115tnryt].

---

## Follow-up and recurrence

Regular imaging (CT/MRI) and **tumor markers** (AFP, CEA, CA 19–9) are recommended for surveillance [^notfound]. Recurrence is **common** (~50%), especially with incomplete resection or metastases, necessitating close follow-up [^notfound].

---

Pancreatoblastoma in adults is a rare, aggressive malignancy requiring **multidisciplinary management**. Complete surgical resection is the mainstay, with adjuvant therapy for advanced disease; prognosis remains poor, underscoring the need for early diagnosis and novel therapies.

### Adult pancreatoblastoma: a case report and clinicopathological review of the literature [^111geSFd]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our purpose was to report a case of adult pancreatoblastoma, and review the literature in order to assist clinicians in the management of the disease.

Materials and Methods

The demographic, clinical, and imaging findings of 41 patients with pathologically proven pancreatoblastoma from 1986 to 2017 identified in PubMed were reviewed. The key words used for searching PubMed were: "pancreatoblastoma", "pancreatic tumor", and "adult pancreatoblastoma". We also reported the details of a case of adult pancreatoblastoma treated at our institution.

Results

We identified 41 cases of adult pancreatoblastomas, and the mean age at diagnosis was 41.4 ± 17.4 years. Pancreatoblastomas occurred in the pancreatic head in 48.4% of patients, and in 39.0% of cases the tumor was > 8 cm in diameter at diagnosis. Patient age and tumor size were similar between males and females (P = 0.59; P = 0.32, respectively). Metastases was present in 17 of the 41 adult patients (41.5%). No significant difference in age, sex, tumor size, and tumor location was found between patients with and without metastases (P = 0.57, 0.58, 0.64, 0.39, respectively).

Conclusion

Preoperative diagnosis of adult pancreatoblastoma is difficult because of the heterogeneous, variable cellular differentiation and atypical clinical and imaging features. A pancreatoblastoma should be considered when tumors in the pancreas are solid and cystic.

### Adult pancreatoblastoma-case report and review of literature [^115sgJNx]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Most cases of pancreatoblastoma, a rare malignant epithelial tumor of the pancreas, are seen in the pediatric population. The rarity of pancreatoblastoma, the similar radiologic findings to those seen in other pancreatic lesions, and its histopathologic heterogeneity, make its preoperative diagnosis in adults a real challenge. We report ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging correlative findings of a histologically proven pancreatoblastoma in a 37-year-old woman. Pancreatoblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic mass presenting uncommon imaging features.

### Investigation and management of pancreatic tumours [^115Zk8Bp]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the 10th most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK and the fifth most common cause of cancer death. It remains one of the most aggressive cancers with over 95% of patients affected dying of their disease. Often presenting at an advanced stage of disease progression, there is currently no simple screening test available. Therefore a high clinical suspicion and prompt appropriate investigation is required from physicians when dealing with patients with symptoms in keeping with pancreatic cancer. The gastroenterology 2010 curriculum states that trainees should learn the presentation and multidisciplinary management of patients with pancreatic tumours. In this article we discuss the typical clinical presentations of common and less common pancreatic tumours followed by the investigation, staging and management required.

### Pancreatoblastoma: a rare, adult pancreatic tumor with many faces [^115Bc183]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatoblastomas are malignant epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas that are heterogeneous and have variable cellular differentiation, complicating the diagnosis. We report a case of pancreatoblastoma occurring in an adult patient, presenting as a pancreatic head mass with liver metastasis and jaundice. The initial liver biopsy diagnosis was metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma based on morphology and synaptophysin positivity. At pancreatic resection, the diagnostic features of pancreatoblastoma were recognized. We review the radiologic and pathologic differential diagnosis, histologic heterogeneity, clinical presentation, and associated genetic syndromes for this unusual tumor that can mimic other types of pancreatic neoplasia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatoblastoma in China [^111YRvoG]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pancreatoblastoma is an extremely rare pancreatic neoplasm. The aims of the current study were to analyze the clinical, pathological, and immunohistochemical features of pancreatoblastoma and to discuss its management.

Methods

The clinical data of 30 Chinese pancreatoblastoma patients (among them, 1 case was treated by authors, and the other 29 cases were reported in Chinese literature from January 1981 to December 2005) were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

Patients with pancreatoblastoma had an age range of 5 months to 42 years. There were 24 children and 6 adult cases, with a male-female ratio of 2:1 (20/10). The tumor size ranged from 2 to 20 cm in diameter. Metastases were found during the operation in 8 cases (26.7%) (among them, 66% with liver invasion and 50% with multiple metastases including spleen, kidney, and bone). Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed in 5 cases (16.7%). Nine cases (30%) received chemotherapy with vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and adriamycin. By immunohistochemistry, the tumors exhibited acinar, endocrine, and ductal differentiation. The mean time of survival was 25.5 months.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma mainly depends on the pathological findings, surgical resection is the most effective way for cure, and adjuvant chemotherapy could be a good palliative method in certain patients.

### Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^115A6DXf]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic tumors that vary in pathophysiology, malignant potential, clinical course, and outcomes. Their management is heavily predicated on establishing an accurate diagnosis. This can be particularly challenging, but can often be achieved by a thorough history and physical examination combined with high-quality, thin-slice computed tomography, although additional diagnostic tools may be required. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment can range from simple observation to total pancreatectomy. This decision rests on a clear and complete understanding of each disease process in the context of the patient's age and comorbidities. This article reviews the most common cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, focusing on their diagnosis and management.

### Central pancreatectomy for pancreatoblastoma in a 16-year-old girl [^116J5yxa]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Long-term functional results after standard pancreatic resections are a major concern, especially in children. An alternative pancreas-sparing procedure (such as central pancreatectomy) should be taken into consideration whenever it is feasible, and a prolonged survival is expected. Pancreatoblastoma is an unusual malignant tumor in childhood. However, in initially resectable tumors, the 15-year survival is more than 80%. Thus, there is a potential role of a conservative pancreatic resection in successful treatment of pancreatoblastoma. The management in a case of a 16-year-old girl with a pancreatoblastoma in the body of pancreas is presented. Complete surgical resection by central pancreatectomy followed by chemotherapy led to a prolonged disease-free survival, with good functional results. Central pancreatectomy could be an alternative surgical technique in some selected cases of pancreatoblastoma, having the lowest incidence of postoperative exocrine and endocrine insufficiency rate and offering the best nutritional status.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas: challenging issues in clinical practice [^115eotHb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are being recognized with increasing frequency and have become a common finding in clinical practice. Cystic lesions of the pancreas display a wide spectrum of histopathology and biologic behavior. Differentiating among lesions and choosing an optimal therapy is challenging, and evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis, management, and follow-up for cystic lesions of the pancreas are needed. This review describes the epidemiology and typical features of cystic lesions of the pancreas, including a summary of commonly used descriptive terms, as well as the primary issues in the differential diagnosis and management of these lesions.

### Pancreatoblastoma in children: EXPeRT / PARTNER diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations [^111b16xh]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatoblastoma (PBL) is a rare malignant epithelial neoplasm that affects typically young children. Signs related to advanced upper-abdominal tumor accompanied by elevated serum α-fetoprotein levels in a young child suggest PBL, however histopathological confirmation is mandatory. The mainstay of the treatment is a complete surgical resection. Unresectable and/or metastatic PBL may become amenable to complete delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This manuscript presents the international consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of children with PBL, established by the European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors (EXPeRT) within the EU-funded PARTNER (Paediatric Rare Tumors Network - European Registry) project.

### Pancreas solid tumors [^116XjpA8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Solid tumors of the pancreas encompass a variety of diagnoses with treatments ranging from observation to major abdominal surgery. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most common and most lethal of these differential of diagnoses and requires a multimodality approach through a multidisciplinary team of specialists. This article reviews the classification, clinical presentation, and workup in differentiating solid tumors of the pancreas and serves as an additional tool for general surgeons faced with such a clinical finding, from a surgical oncology perspective.

### Evaluation and management of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas [^111ZuBT1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are a diverse group of neoplasms with a generally favorable prognosis. Although they exhibit indolent growth, metastases are seen in roughly 60% of patients. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may produce a wide variety of hormones, which are associated with dramatic symptoms, but the majority are nonfunctional. The diagnosis and treatment of these tumors is a multidisciplinary effort, and management guidelines continue to evolve. This review provides a concise summary of the presentation, diagnosis, surgical management, and systemic treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^117Gm185]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) — epidemiology highlights rarity and female predominance with typical young adult presentation. SPNs are rare lesions, are more common in women than in men (10:1), and most frequently present in women in their 20s but have a wide age range.

### Ampullary pancreatoblastoma in an elderly patient: a case report and review of the literature [^1125W3QQ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Pancreatoblastoma, generally regarded as a pediatric malignant tumor, is rarely found in the adult population. Only 13 adults with pancreatoblastoma, ranging in age from 19 to 68 years, have previously been reported in the world literature. A diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma relies on characteristic histologic features, including epithelial differentiation and, more importantly, squamoid differentiation. Despite aggressive therapy, adults with pancreatoblastoma have a poor outcome. We describe a 78-year-old woman who presented with painless jaundice and was found on abdominal computed tomographic scan to have a 2.7-cm ampullary mass. The patient underwent successful pancreaticoduodenectomy. Pathologic examination of the resected tumor revealed findings characteristic of pancreatoblastoma. The tumor formed acinar and glandular structures, solid areas, and contained many "squamoid corpuscles", a defining feature of pancreatoblastoma. The tumor cells also showed acinar and ductal phenotype by immunohistochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the oldest patient with pancreatoblastoma to be described in the literature to date and the first to occur in the ampulla of Vater. We review previously published cases and discuss the clinical and histopathologic features of adult pancreatoblastoma.

### Imaging of pediatric pancreatic neoplasms with radiologic-histopathologic correlation [^115RBYNo]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the imaging features of pediatric pancreatic tumors with pathologic correlation. Epithelial and nonepithelial lesions are described. Pancreatic imaging protocols, clinical presentation, and management are also detailed.

Conclusion

Pancreatic neoplasms are rare in children and vary widely between benign and malignant causes and between cystic and solid lesions. Epithelial tumors are most common and include solid pseudopapillary tumor, pancreatoblastoma, islet cell neoplasms, and cystic lesions.

### Update on pancreatic endocrine tumors [^1177dD4x]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Endocrine tumors of the pancreas represent 1% to 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. The tumors tend to have an indolent behavior, and long-term survival is common. There is no gender or age predilection. Patients can present with symptoms due to hormonal excess or a local mass effect or be asymptomatic. The tumors tend to be solid and well circumscribed. Typical microscopic findings include an organoid pattern of growth, with cells containing scant to moderate amounts of cytoplasm, and nuclei with dispersed chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The morphologic spectrum of these tumors can be variable, and the differential diagnosis includes chronic pancreatitis with neuroendocrine hyperplasia, ductal adenocarcinoma, solid pseudopapillary tumor, acinar cell carcinoma, and pancreatoblastoma. The classification of these tumors remains controversial, and prognosis is difficult to predict, but important features include metastasis and invasion of adjacent structures. Resection remains the mainstay of surgical treatment. It is important to be aware that unusual morphologic variants of pancreatic endocrine tumors are common, and immunohistochemical stains can help avoid misdiagnosis.

### Clinical and biologic analysis of pancreatoblastoma [^112UmKxM]. Pancreas (2005). Low credibility.

Since the first description of pancreatoblastoma as a malignant pancreatic tumor of childhood in 1957, approximately 200 cases have been reported. We describe an 18-year-old boy who presented with pain and jaundice and was found to have an abdominal mass. The patient initially presented with abdominal pain. During laparotomy, a 10 × 8 × 8 cm³ tumor was discovered in the pancreatic body and tail, and with 3 cystic masses, 15, 10, and 8 cm in diameter, respectively, involving the right lobe of the liver. Pathologic examination of the resected tumor revealed findings characteristic of pancreatoblastoma. The tumor formed acinar and glandular structures and solid areas and contained many "squamoid corpuscles", a defining feature of pancreatoblastoma. In spite of adjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin and gemcitabine, the patient returned 11 months later with several large hepatic masses, invading the pancreatic head and enlarged tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Radiotherapy, transcatheter arterial embolization therapy, and chemotherapy were performed. Unfortunately, the patient died 26 months later from disseminated tumor progression. A review of the literature reveals that pancreatoblastoma in childhood must be considered malignant but usually has a favorable prognosis in contrast to pancreatic neoplasms in adult patients. Biologic study will investigate the molecular biology of this rare tumor. The biology may help define prognosis and therapy for this kind of tumor.

### Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^115UPGUa]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are a rare group of neoplasms that arise from multipotent stem cells in the pancreatic ductal epithelium. Although they comprise only 1% to 2% of pancreatic neoplasms, their incidence is increasing. Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are nonfunctioning, but they can secrete various hormones resulting in unique clinical syndromes. Clinicians must be aware of the diverse manifestations of this disease, as the key step to management of these rare tumors is to first suspect the diagnosis.

### Surgical management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [^111QUA1g]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancNETs) are rare neoplasms that comprise 2% to 4% of all clinically detected pancreatic tumors. They are usually indolent, and their malignant potential is often underestimated. The management of this disease poses a challenge because of the heterogeneous clinical presentation and varying degree of aggressiveness. Treatment decisions for this clinical entity are still patient- and/or physician-specific. Optimal clinical management of pancNETs requires a multidisciplinary approach. The only potentially curative treatment option, especially in the early stage disease, remains surgical resection; however, as many as 75% of patients present with advanced disease (nodal and/or distant metastases).

### Prognostic factors of pancreatic tumors in children and adolescents: a population study based on the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database [^112Ku5Xc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric pancreatic tumors, with a prevalence estimated at 1–2 cases per ten million children and adolescents in the United States, represent a notably rare oncological entity. The majority of our current knowledge of the incidence and prognosis of pancreatic tumors in pediatric patients is based on limited single institutional case series. Among adults, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is by far the most frequent histology. On the other hand, a large range of tumors are seen in children. Solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPTs) are thought to be the most prevalent malignancy in the second decade of life, whereas pancreatoblastoma is considered to be the most common during the first decade of life. In addition, neuroendocrine tumors, epithelial carcinomas and sarcomas have also been reported in children. The rarity and diversity of these malignancies, coupled with the absence of standardized treatment protocols, present significant challenges in clinical research and management.

To the best of our knowledge, however, given the rarity of pancreatic tumors, very few sizable cohort studies have explored the epidemiology and survival outcomes of patients with these tumors. Therefore, utilizing data from a sizable population-based database, the current study aimed to more thoroughly identify and assess the prognostic factors among children with pancreatic tumors.

### Complicated case presentation: management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^113iLFt6]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an inherited predisposition to tumors of the parathyroid glands, anterior pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells. In this review, we discuss the clinical case of a 45-year-old woman with MEN1 that was presented at the 2015 North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society Symposium. In our review of this patient's complicated clinical course and subsequent operative management, we highlight controversies in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in MEN1. In particular, this case illustrates the lack of consensus regarding the optimal biochemical and radiologic screening for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and absence of guidelines about the appropriate surgical approach for treatment. We review these controversies and discuss possible approaches to management.

### The spectrum of cystic masses of the pancreas: imaging features and diagnostic difficulties [^111iuNJE]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Cystic masses of the pancreas comprise a diverse group of pathologic entities ranging from pseudocysts to cystic tumors. Although their presentations may be similar, the appropriate treatment and patient management can differ greatly. There is an overlap in radiologic features, but the clinical context and some imaging findings are useful in differentiating among these entities; the differential diagnosis could be considerably reduced and it is generally possible to reach the correct diagnosis. In this article, we review imaging characteristics and radiologic patterns of both common and uncommon cystic masses of the pancreas.

### Adult pancreatoblastoma with liver metastasis diagnosed by 18F-FDG PET / CT and 2 years' postoperative follow-up [^116ofeGa]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatoblastoma is an extremely rare malignant tumor of the pancreas. Most patients are infants and children; however, a few cases have been reported in adults. Herein, we present the case of a 49-year-old man with pancreatoblastoma and liver metastasis who underwent preoperative multimodal imaging, in which F-FDG PET/CT showed a markedly increased F-FDG uptake in the metastatic lesion and a slightly increased uptake in the primary lesion. Subsequently, the patient underwent complete resection of the primary and metastatic lesions. No recurrences or metastases were found in 2 years of follow-up.

### Benign pancreatic tumors [^112nZu35]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The goal of this article is to describe the different types of benign pancreatic neoplasms, methods to distinguish between them, and treatment options. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is associated with specific neoplastic lesions that are similar in radiographic appearance to some benign lesions. The correct differentiation of these malignant and premalignant lesions from their benign counterpart is paramount to their proper management.

### Rare pancreatic masses: a pictorial review of radiological concepts [^113uNVmB]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Non-ductal pancreatic neoplasm (NPN) represents a heterogeneous group of pancreatic masses, in which diagnosis and management remain challenging due to their overall rarity. Knowledge of their radiologic features is essential for differential diagnosis and to guide clinical decisions for optimal management. The purpose of this paper was to present radiological patterns of these rare pancreatic tumors, solid or predominantly solid, with emphasis in the differential diagnosis and surgical management.

### A subset of pancreatoblastomas may arise from an adenomatous precursor: an ampullary pancreatoblastoma and adjacent adenoma with a shared molecular phenotype in an adult patient [^115TF8X4]. Pancreas (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pancreatoblastomas are rare pediatric tumors. In adults, they are exceedingly rare and seem to have a worse prognosis. Most are sporadic, though rare, cases occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Unlike pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, pancreatoblastomas are not believed to arise from dysplastic precursor lesions. Clinical history, along with endoscopic, pathological, and molecular findings, was reviewed for a 57-year-old male patient with an ampullary mass who presented with obstructive jaundice. Microscopic examination showed a pancreatoblastoma subjacent to an adenomatous polyp with intestinal differentiation and low-grade dysplasia. Both tumors had abnormal p53 (complete loss) and nuclear β-catenin immunostaining. Mutational panel analysis showed an identical CTNNB1 (p.S45P) mutation in both. This case adds to our understanding of the pathogenesis of these rare tumors and suggests that a subset may arise from an adenomatous precursor. In addition, this case is just the second pancreatoblastoma to originate in the duodenal ampulla, and the preceding case suggests that an ampullary location leads to earlier diagnosis. Moreover, this case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing pancreatoblastoma on limited tissue specimens and illustrates the need to include pancreatoblastoma in the differential diagnosis in all tumors in and around the pancreas, including those in adult patients.

### Malignant pancreatic tumors in childhood and adolescence: the memorial sloan-kettering experience, 1967 to present [^112Kgim5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant tumors of the pancreas are uncommon in children and adolescents and only recently have the most common tumor types been well characterized. As a result, the treatment approach to these patients has yet to be standardized, and much of the information available in the literature, particularly with regard to the role of chemotherapy and radiation, is anecdotal.

Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients less than 21 years of age with malignant pancreatic tumors who were cared for at Memorial Sloan-Kettering since 1967.

Results

Seventeen patients were identified. The pathologic types were pancreatoblastoma, 5; solid pseudopapillary tumor, 7; acinar cell carcinoma, 1; nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine neoplasm, 1; malignant VIPoma, 1; and PNET, 2. A complete resection of the primary tumor was achieved in 82%, and 12 of 15 are alive, 10 with no evidence of disease. Chemotherapy or radiation were used in selected cases.

Conclusions

Unlike malignant pancreatic tumors in adults, tumors in children and adolescents usually are resectable, and long-term survival is likely. However, the risk of recurrence for pancreatoblastoma is high. The roles of chemotherapy and radiation remain undefined.

### Pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^11562Kob]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas have been recognized for almost 2 centuries, but the principles of management continue to evolve. Clinicians have a better understanding now of the diverse pathologies and behaviors of cystic neoplasms, and can characterize them more precisely into benign, malignant, and of uncertain potential in their manifestations. Treatment is dependent on accurate diagnosis and tailored to the potential aggressiveness of the lesion, the surgical fitness of the patient, and the probability of effecting long-term palliation or survival of the patient. In this article the authors review the classification based on the World Health Organization classification and the latest evidence-based literature of cystic neoplasms, and present their considerations for surgical management of the various lesions. A better understanding of the biologic potential of cystic neoplasms such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms allows for a more patient-specific evidence-based management plan.

Pancreatic cystic lesions are a common clinical entity. The majority are neoplastic and have the potential for malignant transformation. To assist with patient management, a number of clinical guidelines have been developed over the past decade. However, controversies exist in regards to the various guidelines and treatment strategies they offer. This article will review the various clinical guidelines for management of pancreatic cysts, describe the limitations of these guidelines, and present future directions for improvement in clinical decision making for patients diagnosed with a pancreatic cystic neoplasm.

### Imaging presentation of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms [^111pKBbN]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (P-NENs) are the second most common solid pancreatic neoplasms. P-NENs have a wide range of imaging features presentations and they can be detected with typical and atypical imaging presentations. Typical and atypical appearances can be explained by pathologic correlations. P-NENs are generally hypervascular lesions, showing a typical enhancement behavior after contrast media injection during imaging methods, but they could also have different imaging features, creating some difficulty in differential diagnosis. For this reason, radiologists should be aware of different imaging presentations of these neoplasms. Radiological evaluation has a critical role in P-NENs identification, characterization, and staging of these neoplasms, especially in those cases in which surgery is the treatment of choice. The present paper shows, indicating the underlying pathologic correlations, typical and atypical presentations of NENs.

Key Points

- P-NENs have a wide range of imaging features presentations, typical and atypical.

- Pathology could help in better understanding the typical P-NENs appearance at imaging.

- P-NENs are generally hypervascular lesions.

- Radiological evaluation has a critical role in P-NENs identification and management.

- Radiologists should know every type of different imaging presentation of P-NENs to better diagnose these kinds of lesions.

### Pancreatic neoplasms with acinar differentiation: a review of pathologic and molecular features [^113hfXbH]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Pancreatic acinar lesions encompass a broad spectrum of malignant tumors and benign reactive processes affecting both adults and children, with clinical, pathologic, and molecular features that are distinct from more common ductal neoplasms. Accurate morphologic diagnosis and molecular assessment of these uncommon neoplasms is critical for effective patient care.

Objective —

To review the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of pancreatic neoplasms with acinar differentiation, the most common of which is acinar cell carcinoma but which also includes mixed carcinomas with acinar components, cystic acinar lesions, and pancreatoblastoma.

Data Sources —

We assessed the current primary literature, as well as recently updated diagnostic manuals.

Conclusions —

Pancreatic acinar neoplasms are a morphologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterized by acinar differentiation of at least a subset of the neoplastic cells, defined either morphologically (granular cytoplasm, single prominent nucleoli) or immunohistochemically. Squamoid nests are a key morphologic feature of pancreatoblastoma. Alterations in WNT signaling and chromosomal 11p loss are common molecular features of both acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatoblastoma. Targetable molecular alterations in acinar carcinoma include BRAF rearrangements and DNA repair defects, including mismatch repair deficiency and BRCA pathway defects. For practicing pathologists, morphologic recognition of such acinar neoplasms is critical, and in the future, molecular diagnostics to identify lesions susceptible to targeted therapy will likely form an important component of patient care.

### Spectrum and classification of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^113uYS4Y]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

As patients are living longer and axial imaging is more widespread, increasing numbers of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are found. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms are the most common. The revised Sendai guidelines provide a safe algorithm for expectant management of certain cystic neoplasms; however, studies are ongoing to identify further subgroups that can be treated nonoperatively. For those patients with high-risk clinical features or symptoms, surgical resection can be performed safely at high-volume pancreatic centers. Accurate diagnosis is critical for accurate decision making.

### Imaging of pancreatic neoplasms [^116GBkmV]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Ductal adenocarcinoma accounts for 85% to 90% of all solid pancreatic neoplasms, is increasing in incidence, and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. There are currently no screening tests available for the detection of ductal adenocarcinoma. The only chance for cure in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is surgery. Imaging has a crucial role in the identification of the primary tumor, vascular variants, identification of metastases, disease response assessment to treatment, and prediction of respectability. Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms can have a distinctive appearance and pattern of spread, which should be recognized on imaging for appropriate management of these patients.

### Endocrine tumours of the pancreas [^115FKqRd]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Verbeke C S (2010) Histopathology 56, 669–682 Endocrine tumours of the pancreas Histopathology reporting of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms is complex. The tumours can exhibit a variety of morphological appearances, which often require careful differential diagnostic consideration. Prediction of tumour behaviour and clinical outcome is based on the World Health Organization classification and TNM staging and grading system, which share some criteria and premises, but differ significantly in others. Clinicopathological correlation through discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings is of paramount importance. In this review special emphasis is given to the items of information that can and should be provided by the pathologist to allow optimal patient management. The review further discusses areas of current controversy and uncertainty, of which pathologists participating in multidisciplinary discussions should be aware.

### CT manifestations of childhood pancreatoblastoma [^117NXiim]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Pancreatoblastoma is the most common type of malignant pancreatic tumor in children under 10 years old, accounting for 25% of pancreatic tumors. The imaging findings of pancreatoblastoma are non-specific, and most of tumors are lobulated masses with well-circumscribed or partially circumscribed margins, accompanied by necrosis and enhancing septations on contrast-enhanced CT. When a large tumor originates in the pancreas, pancreatoblastoma is one of the top differential diagnoses in children because of its relative frequency in this age group. However, owing to the usual tumor's large size at diagnosis, a tumor originating from the pancreas may be misdiagnosed with a tumor originating from a peripancreatic organ, such as neuroblastoma, lymphoma, or hepatoblastoma. The differential diagnosis in these tumors is more challenging, and the potential for misdiagnosis still exists. Therefore, it is important to delineate the origin of tumor clearly on CT. The present study analyzed the imaging CT findings of pancreatoblastoma retrospectively.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients diagnosed as pancreatoblastoma by pathology; (2) complete CT information including that from non-contrast and contrast CT. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with no complete CT information or pathological diagnosis. In this study, four patients with pancreatoblastoma who underwent tumor biopsy and three patients who had tumor resection from January 2014 to March 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of pancreatoblastoma was based on the analyzed examination, which revealed that the acinar and trabecular areas were associated with the nests of squamous epithelium (squamoid nests), and the immunohistochemical staining which showed CK (+) and AAT (+). A second review of the specimens for the scope of the study was done by a gastrointestinal pathologist with 12 years of experience in gastrointestinal pathology.

### Autologous stem cell transplantation as treatment modality in a patient with relapsed pancreatoblastoma [^112RLZ3E]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatoblastoma (PB) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the pancreas, which occurs mostly during childhood. Presently, the optimal treatment strategy is neither clear nor uniform for patients in advanced stages, in particular those with metastasis, inoperable, or recurrent tumors. To our knowledge, until now, only one patient with PB has been treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following aggressive chemotherapy and surgical resection. Here we report the second case of PB who was treated with aggressive chemotherapy combined with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

### Pathology and molecular characteristics of pancreatic cancer [^115zXLX8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. However, it should be kept in mind that there are other pancreatic cancers that are classified by their cellular lineage: acinar cell carcinomas (acinar differentiation), neuroendocrine neoplasms (arising from the islets), solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms (showing no discernible cell lineage), and pancreatoblastomas (characterized by multiphenotypic differentiation, including acinar endocrine and ductal). This article focuses on the molecular and pathology alterations in PDAC.

### Childhood pancreatic tumors: a single institution experience [^115tnryt]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The rarity and histopathologic diversity of primary pancreatic neoplasms in children have made it difficult to predict prognosis and to develop optimal management protocols.

Methods

A 90-year (1918–2007), single institution, retrospective review of all patients with neoplastic pancreatic masses was performed.

Results

Eighteen patients were identified with 7 distinct histopathologic subtypes. The most common were gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine, solid pseudopapillary, and acinar tumors. There were 6 benign and 12 malignant tumors. Six patients had disease outside the pancreas at their initial operation. There were 7 deaths (41%), 2 related to the initial operation, 3 from disease progression, 1 from a small bowel obstruction, and 1 from necrotizing pancreatitis. Five deaths were in patients with extrapancreatic disease found at initial operation. The median duration of follow-up for the 10 survivors was 41 months.

Conclusion

In adults, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is by far the most common histopathologic subtype, with other subtypes more common in children. Stage is an important prognostic factor. Long-term disease-free survival in childhood pancreatic malignancies is achievable with complete surgical resection, prognosis, and adjuvant treatment, depending on the histopathologic type.

### Pancreatic tumors in children: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^116w8ZEK]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Pancreatic neoplasms are rare in children and have a different histologic spectrum and prognosis than those in adults. In general, these tumors are well demarcated with expansile rather than infiltrating growth patterns. They may be quite large at diagnosis, and central cystic necrosis is common. They infrequently cause biliary duct obstruction. The imaging appearance of each neoplasm reflects its pathologic features. Pancreatoblastoma is the most common pancreatic neoplasm in young children. At imaging, pancreatoblastomas are heterogeneous and often multilocular with hyperechoic and enhancing septa. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor occurs in adolescent girls. It is heterogeneous in internal architecture, with a mixture of solid and cystic hemorrhagic and necrotic elements. This tumor is distinguished by its fibrous capsule and hemorrhagic nature, which are best shown at magnetic resonance imaging as a dark rim on T1- or T2-weighted images and hyper-intense foci on T1-weighted images, respectively. Islet cell tumors in children are insulinomas or gastrinomas. These tumors manifest early due to hormonal syndromes and are distinguished by their small size, homogeneous appearance, and intense enhancement with intravenous contrast material. All pancreatic neoplasms in children are capable of producing metastases, usually to the liver and lymph nodes; however, on the whole, these tumors have a better clinical outcome than most pancreatic tumors in adults. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses in children and their relatively good prognosis may promote correct preoperative diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Pediatric pancreatectomy for neoplasms: indications, outcomes, and implementation of minimally invasive surgery in a Ukrainian tertiary center [^115DWfQZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic neoplasia is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population, accounting for only 0.2% of all pediatric malignancies, with an incidence of 0.46 cases per 1 million. Among the various histological subtypes, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm is the most common, followed by neuroendocrine tumor and pancreatoblastoma. Due to the rarity and diversity of these tumors, their diagnosis and management require specialized expertise and a multidisciplinary approach.

Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for pediatric pancreatic neoplasms. While open surgery has traditionally been the standard approach, recent years have seen a growing trend toward the application of minimally invasive techniques in pediatric pancreatic surgery. However, there are limited data on the short- and long-term outcomes of surgical treatment in this population, as the available literature primarily consists of small case series from single institutions.

Our aim was to contribute to the limited published information on this matter and to report our experience of surgical resection in children with pancreatic tumors, including rare histological subtypes, such as mature teratoma and pancreatic paraganglioma.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the sonographic, CT, and MRI features of primary malignant pancreatic tumors of childhood.

Conclusion

Most children with a pancreatic tumor present with a solid pseudopapillary tumor that is usually well marginated and has solid and cystic areas surrounded by a fibrous capsule. Pancreatoblastoma is more aggressive than solid pseudopapillary tumor. The imaging features are those of a large heterogeneous tumor. Ductal adenocarcinoma is rare in children and has a poor prognosis.

### Diagnostic pearls and pitfalls in the evaluation of biopsies of the pancreas [^114rETsn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

The examination of small pancreatic biopsies is a difficult task for pathologists. This is due to the scant and fragmented material often obtained from diagnostic procedures as well as the significant overlap between different neoplastic and nonneoplastic entities. In the upcoming neoadjuvant era, biopsies could become even more important, representing the only possibility to look at the real histomorphology of tumors before chemotherapy-induced modifications.

Objectives —

To summarize and discuss the state-of-the-art diagnostic workflow for small pancreatic biopsies, including the most important morphologic and immunohistochemical features and molecular alterations. The main diagnostic pearls and pitfalls of this challenging scenario are also discussed. The most important topics of this review are represented by: (1) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, along with its main differential diagnoses, including autoimmune pancreatitis; (2) solid hypercellular neoplasms, including neuroendocrine neoplasms, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms; and (3) cystic lesions. Real-world considerations will also be presented and discussed.

Data Sources —

Sources included a literature review of published studies and the author's own work.

Conclusions —

The correct diagnosis of pancreatic lesions is a crucial step in the therapeutic journey of patients. It should be based on robust, standardized, and reliable hallmarks. As presented and discussed here, the integration of morphology with immunohistochemistry, and, in selected cases, with molecular analysis, represents a decisive step in this complex scenario.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: current evidence and guidelines [^112EdNmY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic cysts that include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystic neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions, all with different biological behaviours and variable risk of progression to malignancy. As more pancreatic cysts are incidentally discovered on routine cross-sectional imaging, optimal surveillance for patients with PCN is becoming an increasingly common clinical problem, highlighting the need to balance cancer prevention with the risk of (surgical) overtreatment. This Review summarizes the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of PCN, including the quality of available evidence. Also discussed are the most important differences between the PCN guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association, the International Association of Pancreatology and the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, including diagnostic and follow-up strategies and indications for surgery. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with PCN are addressed.

Abstract

A 36-year-old asymptomatic woman was incidentally found to have a huge mass in the pancreas by ultrasound during routine health screening. The mass was suspected of neuroendocrine tumor or solid pseudopapillary tumor by subsequent abdominal CT. 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/MR were acquired for presurgical assessment of the tumor invasion and malignant potential, which revealed intense FDG uptake and mild DOTATATE uptake. The tumor was completely resected, and postsurgical pathology demonstrated pancreatoblastoma with neuroendocrine manifestations. This case showed the metabolic and biological features of pancreatoblastoma on the 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/MR.

Functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) — acute symptom control principles: There are five main types of functioning panNETs, including insulinoma, gastrinoma, somatostatinoma, glucagonoma, and VIPoma, and the priority for functioning panNETs is to control the hormone excess state as soon as possible, even before diagnosis and staging. The evidence base for functioning panNETs comprises lower-quality data with case reports, case series, and retrospective studies, and reduction of tumor bulk is an important intervention that can reduce the symptoms of hormonal syndromes.

Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm — post-resection follow-up: Patients with surgically resected solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm with negative margins have an excellent prognosis; however, recurrence is reported in 4.4% of patients with the median time to recurrence of 50 months. Surveillance is, therefore, recommended, and imaging on a yearly basis for at least 5 years, followed by eventual cessation of surveillance, is reasonable; in addition, patients should be followed for a minimum of 5 years following resection of a solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### The broad spectrum of paediatric pancreatic disease: a single-center 26-years retrospective review [^115JHpBh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Paediatric pancreatic pathology and its management is rarely described. We present our experience.

Methods

A retrospective case-note review of all patients with pancreatic disease from 1995 to 2021 was completed. Data are quoted as median (range).

Results

Two hundred and twelve patients were identified with 75.9% presenting with pancreatitis. Referrals for pancreatitis increased during the study period and affected a wide age range (2 months-15.6 years). Acute pancreatitis (n = 118) (age 10.6 (0.18–16.3) years). The most common causes were idiopathic (n = 60, 50.8%) and biliary (n = 28, 23.8%). About 10% required treatment for complications or underlying biliary causes. Recurrent pancreatitis (n = 14) (11.6 (0.3–14.3) years). The most common cause was hereditary pancreatitis (n = 6, 42.9%). One patient required endoscopic drainage of pseudocyst. Chronic pancreatitis (n = 29) (16 (0.38–15.5) years). The underlying diagnosis was idiopathic (n = 14, 48.4%) or hereditary pancreatitis (n = 10, 34.5%). 13 patients required active management, including pancreaticojejunostomies (n = 5). Blunt Trauma (n = 34) was managed conservatively in 24 (70.5%). 6 patients required open surgery, but 4 were managed by either endoscopy or interventional radiology. Pancreatic tumours (n = 13) presented at 11.2 (2.3–16) years. Pathology included pancreaticoblastomas (n = 3), solid pseudopapillary tumours (n = 3), neuroendocrine tumours (n = 2), acinar cell cystadenoma (n = 1), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n = 1), pancreatic insulinoma (n = 1), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 1), and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1). OTHERS (N = 4): Pancreatic cyst (n = 3) and annular pancreas (n = 1).

Conclusion

Paediatric pancreatic disease spans a wide spectrum of both benign and malignant disease and benefits from access to specialist medical, surgical, endoscopic, and interventional radiology expertise. Referrals for paediatric pancreatitis are increasing, but aetiology is different to that seen in adults.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^111GKBTC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Men1-associated gastrinoma — surgical management emphasizes selective indications and individualized planning: for a nonmetastatic pancreatic gastrinoma, we recommend surgery for pancreatic gastrinomas because survival improves when tumors are more than 2 cm; yet outcomes vary, with only 16% disease-free immediately after surgery and 6% at 5 yr in one MEN1 series (versus 45 and 40% without MEN1), while other studies report up to 77% eugastrinemia at 6-month follow-up after duodenectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, or total pancreatectomy. Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy has a greater than 65% cure rate but higher operative mortality and long-term complications, so most centers do not offer it because lesser operations or no surgery are associated with excellent survival, e.g. 52 and 100% at 15 yr in patients with and without metastases. Most centers undertake a nonsurgical strategy unless pancreatic gastrinomas more than 2 cm are identified, in which case surgery is recommended; resection of duodenal MEN1-associated gastrinomas may be considered in specialized centers, and we recommend that the surgical procedure be individualized to preoperative findings and patient factors.

### Dilemmas in the management of screen-detected lesions in patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer [^117CaqSw]. Familial Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Disadvantages include, (1) the surveillance program cannot guarantee that PDAC is always detected at an early and curable stage, (2) the screening protocol is burdensome and may cause anxiety before and shortly after the screening procedure, (3) there may be false positive and false negative cases, and finally, (4) treatment consists of major surgery, a pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy depending on the site of the tumor, all of which are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

These case reports illustrate the difficult decisions that have to be made in high-risk individuals with a suspected lesion in the pancreas. All involved physicians, together with the patient, should be aware of all possible outcomes of the intervention.

### Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours [^113QVuvo]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNET) is rising mainly due to the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although many PNETs are asymptomatic and non-functioning, the overall 5-year survival is still less than 50%. In this article, we review the advances in diagnosis, classification and staging of PNET that have evolved with the development of new cross-sectional imaging methods and biopsy techniques. With accurate classification, evidence-based, individualised prognostic outcomes and treatments are able to be given which are also discussed.

### Multicenter study on the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of insulinoma: insights from 15 medical centres [^113am7Bo]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Insulinomas, though rare, are the most common functional neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas, with an estimated incidence of 1–4 cases per million annually. These tumours primarily affect individuals between the ages of 30 and 70, with a higher prevalence in women. The vast majority of insulinomas are sporadic (94%), benign (87%) and solitary (90%). Despite their relatively small size, insulinomas can cause significant morbidity due to excessive insulin secretion, leading to recurrent hypoglycemia. The clinical presentation is often heterogeneous, ranging from mild neuroglycopenic symptoms, such as confusion and behavioural changes, to severe episodes involving seizures and loss of consciousness. Due to this broad spectrum of manifestations, insulinomas are frequently misdiagnosed as neurological or psychiatric disorders.

Advancements in biochemical testing and imaging modalities have improved diagnostic accuracy, yet insulinomas remain a challenging entity due to their intermittent symptomatology and resemblance to other neuroglycopenic conditions. The delay in diagnosis can have serious consequences, including increased risk of complications and reduced quality of life for affected individuals. Therefore, understanding the clinical presentation, diagnostic pathways, and treatment outcomes is crucial for optimising patient care.

Previous studies on insulinoma have primarily been limited to single‐centre experiences or specific patient subgroups, which may not capture the full spectrum of the disease across different populations. Additionally, there is limited data on regional variations in clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and treatment outcomes. This study addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive, multicenter retrospective analysis of insulinoma cases from diverse geographical regions of Türkiye. By evaluating differences based on gender, tumour characteristics, and associated comorbidities, this study aims to identify clinically relevant patterns that could refine current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Furthermore, by systematically examining diagnostic pitfalls and treatment outcomes, this study contributes to a more standardised and effective clinical framework for insulinoma management. The findings will not only enhance early detection strategies but also help guide clinicians in selecting the most appropriate therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient prognosis. Given the rarity of insulinoma, large‐scale, multicenter studies such as this one is essential for generating robust evidence that can inform clinical practice and shape future research directions.

### Pancreatic tumors in children and adolescents: the Italian TREP project experience [^1119mrgX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Malignant pancreatic tumors are exceedingly rare in pediatric age and their clinical features and treatment usually go unappreciated by most pediatric oncologists and surgeons.

Methods

From January 2000 to July 2009, 21 patients < 18 years old with pancreatic tumors were prospectively registered in the Italian cooperative TREP project dedicated to very rare pediatric tumors.

Results

Tumor types were 4 pancreatoblastomas, 2 pancreatic carcinomas, 3 neoplasms of the endocrine pancreas, and 12 solid pseudopapillary tumors. Three of the four patients with pancreatoblastoma had advanced disease at diagnosis and were given chemotherapy; at the time of this report, three patients were alive in first remission, while one died due to treatment toxicity. Both the cases of pancreatic carcinoma had the acinar cell subtype and successfully underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete tumor resection, remaining without evidence of disease at the time of this analysis. The histological diagnoses of the three endocrine tumors were a malignant islet cell tumor, a gastrinoma, and a well-differentiated tumor. All 12 patients with solid pseudopapillary tumors underwent complete tumor resection and were given no adjuvant treatment; 11 were alive in first remission, while one experienced a local and distant relapse 5 years after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Surgery remains the keystone of treatment for pancreatic tumors in pediatric age as in adults. The TREP project shows that prospective cooperative studies are feasible even for such very rare tumors as these and may serve as a model for developing international cooperative schemes.

Very rare tumors are usually divided into two groups: One includes tumors that are rare among both children and adults; the other one encompasses tumors that frequently occur in adults but are rarely observed in children. In this review, we focus on adrenocortical tumors, neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, pancreatoblastoma and solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas, with special attention to the role of surgery as main curative intervention or as part of the multimodal treatment.

### Malignant pancreatic serous cystic neoplasms: systematic review with a new case [^113UnyqV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the number of reported cases of malignant SCNs of the pancreas is growing, prompting radiologists and clinicians to redefine this disease entity and establish guidelines for diagnosis and management of malignant SCNs of the pancreas. A comprehensive panel of patient's symptoms/signs, imaging, cytopathology, tumor growth rate, and biological activity is essential to diagnose and manage malignant SCNs of the pancreas.

### Pancreatic hamartoma: a case report and literature review [^117UURoU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Pancreatic hamartoma is an extremely rare tumor of the pancreas. Recently, this disease has become clearly recognized, the clinical imaging diagnosis remains some of difficult. We suggest that the term "well-demarcated solid and cystic lesion with chronological morphological changes" could be a clinical keyword to describe pancreatic hamartomas.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^111TRHzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Incidence and Epidemiology

Insulinomas are the most common, yet still rare, hormone-producing pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNEN) with a reported incidence of 0.7 to 4 cases per million per year. There is an age-specific incidence peak in the fifth decade of life in men and the sixth decade of life in women and the incidence is slightly higher in women than in men. More than 99% of insulinomas are located in the pancreas, where its tumor locations are evenly distributed. Extrapancreatic (occasionally metastatic) insulinomas are extremely rare and have been described in the lung, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, hilum of the spleen, and gastric antrum. Approximately 10% of insulinomas present as multiple lesions. Because the definitions for malignancy in insulinoma are ambiguous, nonmetastatic insulinomas are now referred to as "indolent" and metastatic insulinomas as "aggressive" (see Treatment of Metastatic or Inoperable Aggressive Insulinoma). Approximately 10% to 15% of insulinomas belong to the aggressive category and 85% to 90% can be considered as indolent. Patients with an aggressive insulinoma have lower survival compared with patients with an indolent insulinoma. The 5-year survival of patients with an indolent insulinoma has been reported to be 94% to 100% and for patients with an aggressive insulinoma this amounts to 24% to 67%. Secondary, or metachronous insulin secretion by panNEN that previously were nonsecreting, or secreting other peptide hormones, can also occasionally develop and is generally associated with a poor survival as compared with their non-insulin-secreting counterparts.

A total of 5% to 10% of insulinomas are associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. The MEN1-related insulinomas may develop as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions and are generally diagnosed at an earlier age than their sporadic counterparts because of application of the MEN1 screening recommendations. Routine genetic testing for MEN1 is usually not recommended in patients with newly diagnosed insulinoma, but a thorough medical and family history should be obtained, and patients should be referred for appropriate testing if there is suspicion of the insulinoma being 1 of the manifestations of MEN1. A recent Delphi consensus recommends to consider MEN1 screening in patients aged 35 or younger who present with an apparently sporadic insulinoma, although this is not yet supported by the literature. Other genetic syndromes associated with the development of insulinomas are neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex.

### Pancreaticoduodenectomy for pediatric and adolescent pancreatic malignancy: a single-center retrospective analysis [^113iaXJn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

While pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) has been extensively studied in adults, there are few data pertaining specifically to pediatric patients. We retrospectively analyzed PD-associated morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients.

Methods

Our analytic cohort included all consecutive patients ≤ 18years of age treated at our institution from 1993 to 2015 who underwent PD. Patient data (demographics, disease characteristics, surgical and adjuvant treatment, length of hospital stay, and postoperative course) were extracted from the medical records.

Results

We identified 12 children with a median age of 9years (7 female, 5 male). Final diagnoses were pancreatoblastoma (n = 3), solid pseudopapillary tumor (n = 3), neuroblastoma (n = 2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 2). Four patients underwent PD for resection of recurrent disease. 75% (9/12 patients) received neoadjuvant therapy. The median operative time was approximately 7hours with a mean blood loss of 590 cm³. The distal pancreas was invaginated into the posterior stomach (n = 3) or into the jejunum (n = 5) or was directly sewn to the jejunal mucosa (n = 4). There were no operative deaths. There were 4 patients (34%) with grade II complications, 1 with a grade IIIb complication (chest tube), and 1 with a grade IV complication (reexploration). The most common long-term morbidity was pancreas exocrine supplementation (n = 10; 83%). Five patients (42%) diagnosed with either solid pseudopapillary tumor or rhabdomyosarcoma are currently alive with a mean survival of 77.4months.

Conclusion

Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a feasible management strategy for pediatric pancreatic malignancies and is associated with acceptable morbidity and overall survival. Long-term outcome is mostly dependent on histology of the tumor.

Level Of Evidence

Pancreas

Pancreatic malignancies have significant morbidity and mortality. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has dismal survival rates which have not changed significantly over the last few decades, despite advances in medical and surgical oncology. Around 90% of patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are expected to die eventually from the disease. Acute or chronic pancreatitis are common pancreatic diseases that may sometimes be confused with pancreatic cancers.

### Nonmucinous cystic lesions of the pancreas [^11756WHm]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Pancreatic cystic lesions are increasingly diagnosed. Among other criteria, they are often distinguished in mucinous versus nonmucinous cysts. Mucinous pancreatic cystic lesions have received increasing attention, especially those known as precursors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the group of nonmucinous cystic lesions of the pancreas includes numerous entities that may pose a diagnostic challenge. Their accurate diagnosis and classification are crucial for adequate patient management.

Objective —

To review the spectrum of nonmucinous cystic lesions of the pancreas, taking into consideration their epidemiology and typical clinical context, their characteristic gross morphology and histomorphology, as well as their immunohistochemical and molecular profile.

Data Sources —

Literature was searched and reviewed with MEDLINE via PubMed. Macroscopic and microscopic images were obtained from the archives of the Institute of Pathology, Heinrich Heine University and University Hospital of Duesseldorf, Germany.

Conclusions —

Nonmucinous cysts of the pancreas comprise numerous, mostly rare entities displaying different biological behaviors. The most frequent are serous cystic neoplasms, solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms, cystic neuroendocrine tumors, and pancreatitis-associated pseudocysts. Accurate diagnosis can be achieved if characteristic clinical context, histomorphology, and immunoprofile are taken into account.

### Aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment of advanced pancreatoblastoma associated with tumor thrombus in portal vein [^116tt9V2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

A 3-year-old boy had pancreatoblastoma arising in the pancreatic head and body, with metastasis in the mesenteric lymph nodes, tumor thrombus in the portal vein, and a small metastatic lesion in the left lung. After preoperative chemotherapy, aggressive surgical treatment including resection and reconstruction of the portal and superior mesenteric veins was performed. Postoperative chemotherapy was followed by high-dose chemotherapy and rescue with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and he has now been well for 6 years. This is the first surviving pediatric case of advanced pancreatoblastoma treated by aggressive surgical therapy including reconstruction of the portal vein and high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

### Multimodality imaging of neoplastic and nonneoplastic solid lesions of the pancreas [^112kFGzY]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Solid lesions of the pancreas represent a heterogeneous group of entities that can be broadly classified as either neoplastic or nonneoplastic. Neoplastic lesions include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, solid pseudopapillary tumor, pancreatoblastoma, pancreatic lymphoma, metastases to the pancreas, and rare miscellaneous neoplasms. Nonneoplastic lesions include focal pancreatitis, fatty infiltration-replacement, intrapancreatic accessory spleen, congenital anomalies such as prominent pancreatic lobulation and bifid pancreatic tail (pancreatic bifidum), and rare miscellaneous lesions (eg, pancreatic sarcoidosis, Castleman disease of the pancreas). A variety of imaging modalities are available for assessing these solid lesions, including ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic US, and hybrid nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography-CT and positron emission tomography-CT, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Accurate diagnosis can be challenging, and use of a multimodality imaging approach is often helpful in equivocal or complex cases. Knowledge of relevant clinical information and key radiologic features is essential for confident lesion characterization and differentiation.

5 CONCLUSION

Disease stage and surgical resection are critical prognostic factors in pediatric panNETs. Localized disease demonstrated excellent survival rates, while metastatic cases underscore the need for improved systemic therapies. Pediatric‐specific management guidelines are necessary, incorporating genetic screening and molecular profiling into routine practice.

### An algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms [^114jk1BH]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

The pancreas gives rise to an array of distinct neoplasms that can be solid, cystic, or intraductal and can recapitulate the various lines of differentiation present in the normal gland.

Objective

To develop an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms that simplifies their pathologic evaluation.

Data Sources

We reviewed literature related to the classification of pancreatic neoplasms on the basis of their gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical features.

Conclusions

By using a series of dichotomous decisions, the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic neoplasm can be narrowed, and in cases of the more common neoplasms, accurate classification can be achieved. Uncommon neoplasms not accounted for by this approach are also discussed, and the additional diagnostic information needed for complete pathologic reporting is presented.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^112TTaUq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are very common with the majority incidentally identified. There are several types of pancreatic cysts; some types can contain cancer or have malignant potential, whereas others are benign. However, even the types of cysts with malignant potential rarely progress to cancer. At the present time, the only viable treatment for pancreatic cysts is surgical excision, which is associated with a high morbidity and occasional mortality. The small risk of malignant transformation, the high risks of surgical treatment, and the lack of high-quality prospective studies have led to contradictory recommendations for their immediate management and for their surveillance. This guideline will provide a practical approach to pancreatic cyst management and recommendations for cyst surveillance for the general gastroenterologist.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — clinical presentation and biomarkers: "Most patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head present with obstructive jaundice". Laboratory abnormalities may signal obstruction as "Elevations in routine or diagnostic liver enzyme testing, especially increased levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, may lead to a diagnosis of cholestasis due to biliary obstruction localized to the head of the pancreas". In contrast, "patients with pancreatic malignancy in the body and tail typically present with more advanced-stage disease and normal liver biochemistry results because of the absence of biliary obstruction", and "Symptoms generally do not occur until advanced disease is present among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the body or tail". For serum markers, "CA19–9 levels are elevated in the peripheral blood of the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, but this finding does not achieve the performance required for either early detection or diagnosis, because of the potential for both false positive and false negative results". Nonetheless, "CA 19–9 is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved biomarker recommended for use in the routine management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma" and "It has been used for prognosis and as a marker of disease burden (ie, recurrence or disease progression)".

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^114XPvb2]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

When should surgery be performed? What type of surgery should be performed?

Screening should only be offered to individuals who are candidates for surgery (agree 75.5%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Pancreatic resections should be performed at high-volume specialty centres (agree 100%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Determining when surgery is required for pancreatic lesions is difficult and is best individualised after multidisciplinary assessment, preferably within research studies.

There is little consensus about which lesions detected by screening require surgery. The few published reports are based on limited numbers of patients. Because of the risks of pancreatectomy, prophylactic surgery is not recommended for asymptomatic HRIs without an identifiable lesion. When indicated, pancreatic surgery is best performed at a high-volume specialty centre. Multiple studies have shown volume directly correlates with outcomes.

Unambiguous solid lesions (≥ 1 cm, or seen by multiple imaging modalities) are ominous and the threshold for removing them is much lower. There was no consensus as to whether any indeterminate solid lesions detected by EUS should be resected (Appendix).

The majority of cystic lesions detected by screening appear to be low-risk branch-duct IPMNs (table 1). The Sendai international consensus guidelines have been developed and updatedto help stratify patients with an IPMN as low risk versus high risk for either developing or currently harbouring a malignancy. In subjects with suspected BD-IPMNs, resection is considered if the patient has symptoms attributable to the cyst(s), if the cysts are > 3 cm in size, or if the cysts contain mural nodules. Logic would dictate that if these are the recommendations for subjects without a strong family history of PC, then these thresholds for resection should be either the same or lower in subjects with a strong family history. There was no consensus on the size criterion for resection of suspected BD-IPMNs or other cysts in HRIs but the majority agreed that surgery should be considered for suspected BD-IPMNs which were ≥ 2 cm (Appendix). Pathologically confirmed PanIN-3 lesions have been found in the pancreata of individuals who had resections of IPMNs smaller than 1 cm. High-grade dysplasia and main-duct involvement have been identified at resection of some individuals who had surgery for one or more small (< 3 cm) BD-IPMNs. However, there is insufficient evidence to lower the threshold criteria for surgery for patients with lesions identified during pancreatic screening.

### Pancreatic islet cell tumors in adolescents and young adults [^1171F3y7]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic islet cell tumors are rare in adolescents, and most studies published to date focus on older patients. We utilized a national database to describe the histology and clinical pattern of pancreatic islet cell tumors in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, and to compare AYAs to older adults. We hypothesized that AYAs with pancreatic islet cell tumors would have better overall survival.

Methods

The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB, 1998–2012) was queried for AYA patients (15–39 years) with a pancreatic islet cell tumor diagnosis. Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes were abstracted and compared to adults (≥ 40 years).

Results

383 patients (56.4% female, 65% non-Hispanic Whites) were identified, with a median age of 27 (IQR 16–34) years. Islet cell carcinoma was the most common histology. Of patients with known stage of disease, 49% presented with early stage (I or II). Seventy percent of patients underwent surgical resection, including local excision 44%, Whipple procedure 37.5%, or total pancreatectomy 19%. Chemotherapy was utilized in 27% and radiotherapy in 7%. All-cause mortality was 36%. AYA patients underwent more extensive resections (p = 0.001) and had lower mortality rates (p < 0.001), with no differences in tumor stage or use of adjuvant therapies, when compared to adults.

Conclusions

AYA patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors had comparable utilization of adjuvant therapies but underwent more extensive resections and demonstrated a higher overall survival rate than adult counterparts. Further investigation into approaches to earlier diagnosis and tailoring of multimodality therapy of these neoplasms in the AYA population is needed.

### Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas versus chronic pancreatitis: diagnostic dilemma with significant consequences [^117RLN47]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Although carcinoma of the head of the pancreas and chronic pancreatitis are usually easy to distinguish on clinical presentation and subsequent investigation, there can be enough overlap in the presenting features and on imaging studies that differentiation is sometimes extremely difficult. As this confusion may lead to either major pancreatic resection for benign disease, or rejection of surgery for a potentially curable lesion, all attempts to arrive at a correct diagnosis should be pursued. This article provides an update of investigative techniques in pancreatic disease, and offers an algorithm for the clinical approach to the patient who appears to present with this diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.

### Proteomic basis for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma and pancreatoblastoma as similar yet distinct entities [^111U57nT]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) and pancreatoblastoma (PBL) are pancreatic neoplasms that are characterized by acinar differentiation of at least a subset of the neoplastic cells. These diseases have distinct clinicopathological features from conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) and other neoplasms with ductal differentiation. ACC is a rare malignant tumor arising from the exocrine pancreas, comprises approximately 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms, and occurs mostly in adult men. PBL is another rare malignancy that resembles ACC in acinar differentiation but occurs predominantly in infants and young children, comprising less than 1% of all pancreatic tumors. Because ACC and PBL share many histologic and immunophenotypic features, they have been considered closely related neoplasms.

Molecular understanding of ACC and PBL is thus far confined to genomic analyses. Unlike in PDAC, KRAS mutations are rarely observed in ACC –. Mutations in SMAD4, CDKN2A, and TP53, which are frequently altered in PDAC, are observed in ACC but less frequently. The most frequent mutations in ACC are observed in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (APC and CTNNB1), occurring in up to 25% of ACC cases. Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and RB1 genes, are also observed in ACC. At the chromosomal level, BRAF rearrangement and loss of chromosome 11p have been reported in ACC. Genomic analyses of PBL, in which the sample numbers have thus far been small, revealed lower somatic mutation burden compared to ACC. Multiple studies have shown alterations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in PBL, with APC and CTNNB1 harboring the most common gene alterations and imprinting IGF2 dysregulation as a consequence of APC alterations. Loss of chromosome 11p has also been reported in PBL.

### Imaging presentation of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms [^116Y1Bx3]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (P-NENs) are typically hypervascular, but they could present with atypical features. At imaging, the atypical presentations of P-NENs are less frequent than typical presentations, but they could be very heterogeneous and hard to characterize, because of peculiar pathological changes, causing possible misdiagnosis. As a consequence, it is very important for radiologists to know all of the possible P-NENs presentations forms.

Pancreatic cyst management — patients who should have no further evaluation include those for whom Patients who are not medically fit for surgery should not undergo further evaluation of incidentally found pancreatic cysts, irrespective of cyst size (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and asymptomatic cysts diagnosed as pseudocysts on initial imaging and clinical history or as serous cystadenomas do not require treatment or further evaluation (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Supporting risk data in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) cohorts show that among 725 patients 55% underwent resection and 45% underwent surveillance; after a median follow-up of 5 years, 24% of the patients had died and 78% of the deaths were not related to IPMNs, with the chance of a non-IPMN-related death within 3 years of diagnosis 11-fold higher for patients with a CACI of 7 or more and the median survival time for patients with a CACI score of ≥ 7 43 months. An additional series of 793 patients with IPMN reported that during a median follow-up of 50 months, 15% died, with causes of death pancreatic cancer in 26%, extrapancreatic cancer in 38%, other diseases in 32%, and unknown in 3.4%.

Table 2 — characteristics of pancreatic cysts detail distinguishing demographics, imaging, and fluid findings by type: Pseudocyst is associated with acute and/or chronic pancreatitis, may contain fluid alone or debris, and has aspirate: Brown fluid, high amylase/lipase, low carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Serous cystadenoma is 75% in women in the 6th decade, shows microcystic/honeycomb morphology, and has aspirate: low CEA, low amylase/lipase. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) shows Men > Women 7th decade, is mucin producing, and has aspirate: high CEA, high amylase; the side branch subtype is the most common incidental cyst with low risk of cancer progression that may be multifocal, communicates with the main pancreatic duct, and has aspirate: high CEA, high amylase; the main duct subtype is much less common than side branch with higher risk of cancer and shows a dilated main pancreatic duct that may be segmental with patulous orifice in 50%; mixed IPMN is rare and appears to have the same cancer risk as main duct, representing side branch IPMN combined with main duct IPMN. Mucinous cystic neoplasm occurs almost exclusively in women in the 5th to 7th decade, is usually in the body or tail, is unilocular with possible septations or wall calcification and no main duct communication, is mucin-producing, and has aspirate: high CEA, variable amylase. Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm has a 10:1 women:men ratio, most commonly presents in the 20s with a wide age range, and can be single cysts anywhere in the pancreas with smaller ones more solid without cystic degeneration. Cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor is usually non-functioning with Men = Women incidence in the 5th–6th decade, may be associated with MEN I, shows cytology: neuroendocrine tumor, and has aspirate: low CEA, low amylase/lipase.

Table 2
Risk of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy according to dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in IPMN

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN several factors may predict progression during surveillance (eg, diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

4.2 What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection

For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

For patients with relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection therefore does not eliminate the need for regular follow-up screening.

4.3 Is there a certain size cut-off point for resecting an IPMN regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms or (other) risk factors? Is age of the patient a co-factor that should be analysed to define better management strategy?

Patients with IPMNs > 40 mm have an increased risk of harbouring malignancy (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Several studies including both surgically resected or observed IPMN have reported an increased risk of malignancy ranging from 12% to 47% in cases of a cyst ≥ 30 mm. In some of these series, the risk of malignancy produced by cyst size was stratified by the presence of other features for malignancy, indicating that cyst size alone is not an appropriate indication for surgery since the risk of malignancy is actual but low. If multiple risk factors are present the sensitivity to detect malignancy increases.

### Imaging presentation of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms [^112sJ4Bo]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Atypical imaging presentations and variants

P-NENs could show atypical behavior. The most common atypical presentations are the hypoenhancing pattern, the intravessels growth, the intraductal growth, and the cystic and calcified variants.

P-NENs sometimes appear hypovascular (Fig. 6) after contrast media injection and/or with progressive enhancement in the portal and late phases, causing some problems in differential diagnosis, mimicking ductal adenocarcinoma. Actually, hypovascular P-NENs are not so rare, reaching 49% in a group of patients with NENs in the clinical records of Jeon et al. This appearance is directly related to the amount of dense and hyalinized stroma within the tumor, and to the small lesion dimension or of its vascular network. It is crucial to carefully evaluate all the other imaging characteristics (size, margins, growing pattern, and main pancreatic duct aspect) in order to carry out an accurate differential diagnosis and to differentiate them from ductal adenocarcinoma, because these two entities may have a completely different management and, last but not least, a completely different prognosis.

Fig. 6
Non-functioning NEN. CT examination: huge inhomogeneously hypovascular pancreatic body-tail mass with necrotic areas and intralesional calcifications studied in the pancreatic (a) and venous (b) phases

In this variant, the involvement of the main pancreatic duct is more frequent, with also the presence of the "double-duct sign" if there is a concomitant involvement of the common bile duct due to a lesion occurring in the pancreatic head. This tumor variant at imaging is very close to the expected picture of a ductal adenocarcinoma, especially if it is small in dimension, implicating the cytological or histological confirmation mandatory in every case. At imaging, these fibrous P-NENs have atypical features, appearing hypovascular in the arterial phase at CT and MRI and with a possible progressive enhancement in the other phase due to the presence of fibrosis within lesions, except during CEUS due to the microbubble contrast media inner characteristics. Moreover, during MRI, it could lack the typical high hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, appearing isointense or slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, and, also, the strong restriction on DWI could be missed, causing mistakes in the differential diagnosis.

Follow-up With Long-term Outcomes

No surgery-related deaths occurred during the follow-up period. Median follow-up duration was 39 months (range, 3–203). Eleven patients (15.3%) were lost to follow-up. During the follow-up, 2 patients of the entire cohort required late pancreatic reoperations for a stenotic pancreaticojejunostomy after 10 and 24 months, respectively. Five of 35 patients (14.3%) with chronic pancreatitis had recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Twenty-two of the 73 patients (30.1%) needed enzyme substitution therapy. Eight patients (11.0%) suffered from endocrine insufficiency and required insulin therapy. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients with pancreatitis was 85.7% (95% CI, 71.8–99.8). The overall survival (OS) of the entire study cohort at 2 years was 98.3% (95% CI, 95.0–100) and 90.5% (95% CI, 80.3–100) at 5 years (Fig. 3), respectively. The overall event-free survival for the entire cohort at 5 years was 81.1% (95% CI, 70.7–92.7).

### Pancreatoblastoma: a study of demographic and socioeconomic factors… [^1141xgoq]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e16345 Background: Pancreatoblastoma is a rare tumor originating from pancreatic epithelial exocrine cells with a very poor prognosis. At diagnosis, it often presents with large lesions encompassing overlapping regions and may involve the entire pancreas. PB is frequently associated with distant metastasis and often occurs in children under the age of 10. An optimal treatment strategy has yet to be established. Analyzing trends in diagnoses may yield valuable information about its epidemiology. The National Cancer Database was utilized to uncover the demographic factors in patients diagnosed with PB. Methods: A retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2020 was conducted using the NCDB. 82 patients were found with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of PB. Race, gender, Hispanic origin, type of treatment facility, insurance coverage, and distance from patient residence to treatment facility were analyzed via descriptive statistics.

Trends in incidence were interpreted using regression analysis. Results: A total of 82 individuals in the NCDB were confirmed to be diagnosed with pancreatoblastoma between 2004–2020. The incidence rate of patients diagnosed per year is steady. The average age of diagnosis was 55. 3 years with women being more likely to be diagnosed compared to men. None of the observed patients utilized palliative care, and from this population, 87% received surgery, and 28% received chemotherapy as their primary treatment. The majority of the patients were non-Hispanic and White. Most patients were privately insured and lived in metropolitan areas with a population greater than 1 million. Conclusions: This represents the first analysis of pancreatoblastoma within the NCDB to our knowledge, addressing a notable knowledge gap. Pancreatoblastoma is predominantly treated by surgery, consistent with previous case reports.

Notably, our study pioneers the exploration of socioeconomic aspects among pancreatoblastoma patients. Findings reveal a higher likelihood of these patients belonging to the highest income quartile, residing in densely populated metropolitan areas, and receiving treatment within academic/research programs. Further investigation is warranted to comprehend the influence of demographic and socioeconomic variables on the diagnosis, treatment approaches, and overall survival of individuals with pancreatoblastoma.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma in adolescent and young adults (18–44): characteristics and clinical outcomes from Canada and France… [^112sy6va]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract e15215 Background: Epidemiology and clinical outcomes for pancreatic adenocarcinoma are not well described in adolescent and young adult population. Furthermore, treatments' efficacy for AYAs remains ambiguous. In our study, clinical characteristics and outcome were investigated Methods: AYA patients, diagnosed with PDAC stage I to IV at Segal Cancer Center, Canada and Institut Paoli-Calmettes, France between August 2002 to December 2013. All clinical data were pooled for analysis. Survival analyses used Kaplan Meier methodology. Results: 43 patients were enrolled. 13% had a family history of pancreatic cancer and presented with initial symptoms of pain, fatigue and weight loss. Almost half of patients were locally-advanced or metastatic at the time diagnosis and majority of the aforementioned had liver metastasis.

Surgery was performed in 19 pts, with 26% receiving neoadjuvant and 78% adjuvant chemotherapy. Systemic treatments in adjuvant and palliative settings were characterized as: gemcitabine-based treatments, platinum-based treatments with 5-FU, FOLFIRINOX and capecitabine. Nine pts went on to second-line and three third-line or beyond. Survival analyses are presented in the table below. Conclusions: In our study, AYA pts with PDAC numerically have a worse prognosis, especially 5-year survival rate than those reported in literature. Data suggest early-stage diagnosis allowed pts to undergo surgery, giving them better disease survival. On the contrary, advanced-disease showed worse prognosis but these results have to be balanced with bias existing in our study: retrospective unselected population from tertiary cancer centres.

Therefore, these results remain to be further international collaboration required to study PDAC in AYA pts in larger context.

### Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) population: a multi-institutional study of characteristics and outcomes… [^112gtAUK]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract e15173 Background: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare entity that represents 5–10% of all pancreatic tumors. To date, limited studies detail characteristics and outcomes of pNET in AYA pts. A multi-institutional retrospective study was conducted to elucidate the aforementioned. Methods: AYAp, diagnosed with pNETs at the Institut Paoli-Calmettes France, Segal Cancer Centre Canada and Military Medical Academy Bulgaria between Aug 2002 to Dec 2013. Pts characteristics and outcomes were pooled for analysis. Survival data used Kaplan Meier methodology. Results: 28 AYAp diagnosed with pNETS were identified. 3 VHL disease or 1 MNN were reported. The most frequent presenting symptoms were: abdominal cramps, weight loss, diarrhea and flushing. Seven pts had a functioning tumor and 1 secreting.

53% were already metastatic at the diagnosis with liver predominance. Tumors were well differentiated, moderately-D and poorly-D with 25% unknown; 75% grade 1 or 2, 65% Ki-67 rate between 3–20%. Primary tumor was resected in 17 pts with 4 further undergoing liver resection. Seven pts received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 13 pts went on to receive palliative chemotherapy, mainly platinum-based, with 30% receiving it in combination with Sandostatine LR. Only 1 pt everolimus. 46% and 10% went on to receive 2nd and 3d line respectively. The median follow-up was 28. 2 months. Survival data are presented in the Table. Conclusions: pNETs in AYAp are a heterogeneous and poorly understood disease with prognosis dependent on tumor biology, extensiveness of surgery and response to systemic treatments. Half of pts in our cohort had met disease at the diagnosis and were associated with poorer outcomes.

With approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in 2011, their role in AYAp remain to be answered. Further international collaboration will be required.

### Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (islet cell… [^111XmCp8]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Certain factors affect prognosis and treatment options. Pancreatic NETs can often be cured. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the following:

- The type of cancer cell.
- Where the tumor is found in the pancreas.
- Whether the tumor has spread to more than one place in the pancreas or to other parts of the body.
- Whether the patient has MEN1 syndrome.
- The patient's age and general health.
- Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred. Stages of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Key Points
- The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.
- There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
- Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
- Pancreatic NETs can recur after they have been treated. The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the NET is found in the pancreas and whether it has spread.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of the tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are also used to find out whether the cancer has spread. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually neuroendocrine tumor cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, not liver cancer. Pancreatic NETs can recur after they have been treated. The tumors may come back in the pancreas or in other parts of the body. Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.
- The following types of treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization
- Targeted therapy
- Supportive care
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed.
