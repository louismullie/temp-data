## Question

My thyroid pills haven't improved my fatigue, i feel sluggish and my hair is falling out. Why?

Assistant: When your dose isn’t precisely adjusted, you can still feel tired, have slowed metabolism, and experience hair changes. It could be that your current dose needs reevaluation, or other factors like nutrient gaps or stress might be contributing.

Should i just raise my dose right away to fix this or is there a brand you recommend

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why they still have fatigue, sluggishness, and hair loss despite taking thyroid medication, and whether they should increase the dose or switch brands to fix it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the current thyroid labs show biochemical euthyroidism and whether the dose has been optimized. Then, I should verify adherence and absorption issues that could blunt response. Next, I will consider non-thyroid causes of fatigue and hair loss. After that, I need to weigh the evidence for dose escalation versus brand switching. Finally, I will outline a safe, guideline-concordant plan with monitoring and when to consider combination therapy, anchoring to ATA and ETA guidance and contemporary reviews [^4881bc8a] [^af64cc26] [^29437850].

> Let me first confirm the biochemical picture, because persistent symptoms despite therapy usually fall into three buckets: under-replacement, apparent euthyroidism with ongoing symptoms, or non-thyroid etiologies. I should check TSH and free T4 about 6–8 weeks after any dose change, and if TSH is not at goal, dose adjustment is appropriate; if TSH is normal and symptoms persist, I should not reflexively escalate the dose without reassessing other causes, as about 5–15% of patients on LT4 report persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH, often related to tissue-level T3 dynamics or non-thyroidal factors [^4881bc8a] [^7c400ceb] [^d1b328bd].

> Wait, let me verify adherence and absorption before changing the dose, because these are common, fixable reasons for treatment failure. I need to ensure levothyroxine is taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, separated by at least 4 hours from calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, and some antacids, and that the same brand or generic is used consistently; switching formulations can alter absorption and TSH, so if a switch occurs, I should recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks, and if adherence is poor, weekly dosing can be considered in select cases [^84f27ad7] [^c1e064d7] [^639f6a74] [^fce310d1] [^8938c0c8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose increases; I should confirm whether the current dose is truly inadequate. Full replacement is roughly 1.6 mcg/kg/day in otherwise healthy adults, but older adults, those with cardiac disease, or mild hypothyroidism often start lower and titrate slowly; if TSH remains above the target, a 12.5–25 mcg increment is reasonable, reassessing in 6–8 weeks, whereas if TSH is already normal, further LT4 increases risk iatrogenic hyperthyroidism without proven symptom benefit [^dd726a0c] [^1f5b3bab] [^7c400ceb].

> I need to check for non-thyroid causes of fatigue and hair loss next, because these symptoms are nonspecific and can reflect anemia, B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, sleep apnea, depression, menopause, medications, or stress. Hair shedding can also occur transiently after starting LT4 and usually recovers; if symptoms persist despite a normal TSH, guidelines advise evaluating for alternative etiologies and considering referral rather than escalating thyroid hormone indiscriminately [^1f5b3bab] [^84f27ad7] [^bd4531b5].

> Let me consider the role of brand or formulation switching, because patients often ask about this. I should confirm that consistent use of the same product is preferred; if TSH is repeatedly elevated despite good adherence, switching to a liquid or softgel LT4 formulation can improve absorption and may normalize TSH without changing the dose, but I should recheck TSH 6–8 weeks after any switch; observational data suggest generic and brand LT4 can perform similarly when used consistently, though switching itself can destabilize control, so I should avoid frequent changes [^af64cc26] [^d211728c] [^9240d4c5] [^639f6a74].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a stable, adequate LT4 dose with a normal TSH and still feels fatigued? I should double-check whether combination LT4/LT3 therapy is appropriate here. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show no consistent advantage of adding liothyronine over LT4 alone for fatigue, mood, or quality of life, though a minority of patients report preference for combination therapy; if considered, it should be a time-limited, carefully monitored trial in select patients with persistent symptoms after other causes are excluded, and not during pregnancy [^36ee6fe9] [^40c9842b] [^b2c45664] [^2f047d02].

> I should confirm the practical next steps so the plan is safe and actionable. First, obtain TSH and free T4 now if not recent, and review adherence, timing, and interacting drugs; second, if TSH is high, adjust LT4 by 12.5–25 mcg and recheck in 6–8 weeks; third, if TSH is normal, evaluate for non-thyroid causes of fatigue and hair loss; fourth, if TSH is high despite good adherence, consider switching to liquid or softgel LT4 and recheck in 6–8 weeks; fifth, reserve combination LT4/LT3 for select, refractory cases with shared decision-making and close monitoring, and avoid unsupervised brand hopping or dose escalation [^4881bc8a] [^af64cc26] [^1f5b3bab] [^b2c45664].

> In summary, I should not raise the dose reflexively if TSH is already normal, and I should not switch brands arbitrarily; instead, I need to ensure the dose is truly optimized, adherence and absorption are correct, and other causes of fatigue and hair loss have been considered, reserving dose escalation for biochemical under-replacement and considering formulation or combination therapy only in guideline-concordant, monitored scenarios [^4881bc8a] [^af64cc26] [^29437850].

Your fatigue and hair loss likely persist because your **levothyroxine dose is not yet optimized** or because of **absorption or adherence issues**. It takes 6–8 weeks after any dose change to reach steady state, and dose adjustments should be based on TSH and free T4, not symptoms alone [^4881bc8a] [^7c400ceb]. If TSH is still high, your dose may need to be increased; if TSH is normal, consider absorption problems (calcium, iron, PPIs, coffee, food) [^84f27ad7], inconsistent dosing, or other causes like anemia, B12 deficiency, or stress [^1f5b3bab]. Hair loss can occur early in treatment and usually resolves; switching brands is not routinely helpful unless there is a specific issue with the current product [^84f27ad7] [^1b98ef38]. Work with your clinician to recheck labs and review adherence before changing dose or brand [^7c400ceb].

## Reasons for persistent fatigue and hair loss despite thyroid medication

### Inadequate dosage or incomplete biochemical control

- **Dose adjustment**: Fatigue and hair loss often persist if the levothyroxine dose is insufficient to normalize TSH and free T4. Dose changes should be guided by labs, not symptoms alone [^4881bc8a].

- **Time to steady state**: After any dose change, it takes 6–8 weeks to reach steady state; premature changes can mislead assessment [^7c400ceb].

- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Even mild TSH elevation can cause symptoms; target TSH is typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L, though individual targets vary [^notfound].

---

### Absorption and adherence issues

- **Absorption interference**: Calcium, iron, PPIs, coffee, and food taken within 1 hour of dosing can reduce absorption and raise TSH [^84f27ad7].

- **Inconsistent dosing**: Missing doses or irregular timing can cause fluctuating levels and persistent symptoms [^07fc306d].

- **Formulation issues**: Some patients absorb liquid or softgel LT4 better than tablets; consider switching if TSH remains high despite good adherence [^af64cc26].

---

### Individual patient factors

- **Genetic variability**: Polymorphisms in deiodinase or thyroid hormone pathway genes can impair T4-to-T3 conversion, causing persistent symptoms despite normal TSH [^d1b328bd].

- **Comorbidities**: Anemia, B12 deficiency, depression, sleep apnea, and stress can mimic or worsen hypothyroid symptoms [^3b1e7351].

- **Age and sex**: Older adults and women may require individualized dosing and slower titration due to sensitivity and comorbidities [^95d0aac6].

---

## Hair loss: a common but usually transient side effect

Hair loss is common early in treatment and typically **resolves within months** as euthyroidism stabilizes; persistent shedding usually reflects ongoing hypothyroidism or other causes rather than the medication itself [^84f27ad7].

---

## Should you increase your thyroid medication dose?

Dose increases are appropriate when **TSH remains above target** or when free T4 is low, but increases should be conservative (12.5–25 mcg) and followed by reassessment in 6–8 weeks [^7c400ceb]. Increasing dose without biochemical justification risks overtreatment and adverse effects such as anxiety, palpitations, and osteoporosis [^b2c45664].

---

## Is switching thyroid medication brands beneficial?

Switching brands is not routinely beneficial; **consistent use of the same product** is recommended to avoid variability in absorption and TSH fluctuations [^1b98ef38]. If there is a specific issue (e.g. excipient intolerance, supply shortage), switching may be reasonable, but TSH should be rechecked 6–8 weeks after any change [^639f6a74].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Recheck labs**: Measure TSH, free T4, and free T3 to assess biochemical control [^d1b328bd].

- **Review adherence**: Confirm timing, fasting administration, and separation from interfering agents [^84f27ad7].

- **Evaluate other causes**: Screen for anemia, B12 deficiency, depression, sleep apnea, and stress [^3b1e7351].

- **Adjust dose**: If TSH is high, increase dose by 12.5–25 mcg and recheck in 6–8 weeks [^7c400ceb].

- **Consider formulation**: If TSH remains high despite adherence, try liquid or softgel LT4 [^af64cc26].

---

Persistent fatigue and hair loss despite thyroid medication usually reflect **incomplete biochemical control**, absorption/adherence issues, or non-thyroidal factors. Optimize dosing, confirm adherence, and evaluate other causes before changing brands or escalating therapy.

### Managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: consensus recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) toxicity management working group [^38756b80]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Management of confirmed hypophysitis includes replacement of deficient hormones (physiologic doses of steroids and thyroid hormone). In the presence of both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism, steroids should always be started prior to thyroid hormone in order to avoid an adrenal crisis. High doses of steroids are necessary in the setting of severe headaches, vision changes or adrenal crisis. Both adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism appear to represent long term sequelae of hypophysitis and lifelong hormonal replacement is needed in most cases [,–]. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed to obtain and carry a medical alert bracelet.

Thyroid dysfunction

Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis) was reported in 6–20% of patients in large phase 3 clinical trials.

Hypothyroidism

Patients with unexplained fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, cold intolerance, constipation, depression and other recognized symptoms should be suspected of having hypothyroidism. Lab tests showing high TSH and low free T4 are indicative of biochemical hypothyroidism and, if present, additional testing for thyroid antibodies such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is warranted. Patients with confirmed hypothyroidism should be started on thyroid hormone, with repeat TSH and free T4 levels evaluated 6–8 weeks later. Once a maintenance dose is identified (TSH within normal range) clinical and biochemical re-evaluation should be undertaken every 12 months.

### Shared decisionmaking in the treatment of hypothyroidism [^8b7e4507]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, affects millions worldwide, leading to cognitive and metabolic slowdowns. It is most prevalent in women and older adults, with causes including autoimmune thyroiditis, surgical thyroidectomy, and certain medications.

Standard Of Care and Limitations

The standard treatment involves synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, which alleviates symptoms by converting to the active hormone, T3. However, some patients continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and poor quality of life despite normalized TSH levels. This persistence of symptoms may stem from misdiagnosis, inadequate dosing, or incomplete normalization of thyroid hormone signaling.

New Findings

Research suggests that LT4 monotherapy may not fully restore T3 levels, leading to suboptimal symptom control. Consequently, combination therapy with LT4 and liothyronine (LT3) has been proposed as an alternative, aiming to balance T4 and T3 levels more effectively. Although randomized controlled trials have not identified significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between LT4 monotherapy and combination therapy, they indicate that patients may prefer the latter.

Conclusion

Guidelines from leading endocrinology organizations now recommend considering combination therapy for patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate LT4 dosing. A patient-centered approach, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized treatment plans, is essential for optimizing outcomes in hypothyroidism management. Further research is needed to refine dosing strategies and identify the patients who would benefit most from combination therapy.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^4881bc8a]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association guideline—initiating and adjusting therapy states that thyroid hormone therapy should be initiated as an initial full replacement or as partial replacement with gradual increments in the dose titrated upward using serum thyrotropin as the goal, with dose adjustments where there are large changes in body weight, with aging, and with pregnancy, and thyrotropin assessment 4–6 weeks after any dosage change. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^824d4918]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels >10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH >20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^0daf5585]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Systemic MIBG (in therapeutic doses)—endocrine/metabolic late effects monitoring focuses on hypothyroidism with specified history, physical, and screening elements. History lists Fatigue, Weight gain, Cold intolerance, Constipation, Dry skin, Brittle hair, and Depressed mood, with the directive, “Yearly, consider more frequent screening during periods of rapid growth.” Physical lists Height, Weight, Hair, Skin, and Thyroid exam, with the same directive, “Yearly, consider more frequent screening during periods of rapid growth.” Screening includes TSH and Free T4, with “Yearly, consider more frequent screening during periods of rapid growth.” Counseling notes, “For females, thyroid levels prior to attempting pregnancy and periodically throughout pregnancy.” Potential interventions include “Endocrine consultation for thyroid hormone replacement.” Additional information states, “MIBG used for diagnostic purposes (i.e., MIBG scanning) does NOT put patients at risk for hypothyroidism.” The page specifies “SYSTEM = Endocrine/Metabolic SCORE = 1,” and labels the potential late effect as “Hypothyroidism.”

Nonthyroidal illness therapy dosing guidance—De Groot’s review suggests that if LT4 therapy is to be initiated, it should be at a “replacement dose” of approximately 50 μg/d in divided doses, and the review also suggests that T3 be followed and adjusted such that it is “at least near normal” before the next scheduled dose.

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bf75ab49]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroxine (T4) has a half-life of approximately 7 days, serving as a stable, long-acting hormone reservoir for conversion to the more active triiodothyronine (T3), which has a shorter half-life of about 1 day, reflecting its potent and rapid-acting metabolic effects on energy expenditure and thermogenesis; meanwhile, Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) has a half-life of about 60–80 min, allowing for rapid adjustments in response to the body’s thyroid hormone needs.

The potential mechanisms underlying the observed effects of combined T4 and T3 therapy, as compared to levothyroxine (T4) alone, involve several complex factors that vary among individuals. This combined therapy aims to more closely mimic the natural secretion of the thyroid gland, potentially restoring physiological levels of T3 and T4 across various tissues. T3, the more active hormone, may enhance metabolic effects in peripheral tissues more directly than T4, a prohormone, thus ameliorating hypothyroid symptoms. Genetic variations in thyroid hormone transport and metabolism, such as those involving deiodinase enzymes, might make certain individuals more responsive to T3 supplementation, particularly those with specific genetic polymorphisms affecting the conversion of T4 to T3. Despite mixed results in clinical trials, patient preference for combined therapy over T4 alone often arises from subjective improvements in symptoms like fatigue and cognitive function, which are not consistently quantifiable by standard clinical parameters. While the evidence remains mixed, and most professional guidelines still recommend T4 monotherapy as the standard treatment, combined therapy may offer benefits to specific patients, particularly those who do not efficiently convert T4 to T3.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders [^49f8bfa0]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Symptoms of the menopause transition-altered cycle length, change in amount of bleeding, sleep disruption, fatigue, mood swings, forgetfulness, heat intolerance, and palpitations-can also reflect thyroid dysfunction, common in midlife women. Although many clinicians are familiar with diagnosis and management of overt thyroid disorders, subclinical thyroid disease adds an entirely new dimension to this arena.

### Thyroxine-triiodothyronine combination therapy versus thyroxine monotherapy for clinical hypothyroidism: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^36ee6fe9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

In some patients symptoms of hypothyroidism persist despite therapy with T(4).

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the effectiveness of T(4)-T(3) combination vs. T(4) monotherapy for the treatment of clinical hypothyroidism in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched in September 2005. References of all included trials were scanned for additional studies. We put no restrictions on language, year of publication, or publication status.

Study Selection

All randomized trials that compared the effectiveness of T(4)-T(3) combination vs. T(4) monotherapy for the treatment of clinical hypothyroidism in adults were included.

Data Extraction

The data were extracted by two independent reviewers.

Data Synthesis

We included 11 studies, in which 1216 patients were randomized. No difference was found in the effectiveness of combination vs. monotherapy in any of the following symptoms: bodily pain [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.34, 0.35], depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.20, 0.34), anxiety (SMD 0.00, 95% CI -0.12, 0.11), fatigue (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.33, 0.09), quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.09, 0.15), body weight, total serum cholesterol, triglyceride levels, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein. Adverse events did not differ between regimens.

Conclusions

T(4) monotherapy should remain the treatment of choice for clinical hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine product selection—prescription of brand name levothyroxine, or alternatively maintenance of the same generic preparation (i.e., maintenance of an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine), is advised. Switches between levothyroxine products could potentially result in variations in the administered dose and should generally be avoided for that reason (see also recommendation 3d). Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence (for general populations). Strong recommendation. Low-quality evidence (frail patients, high-risk thyroid cancer patients, pregnant patients). Strong recommendation. Moderate-quality evidence (early childhood hypothyroidism).

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^813cdb12]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

DTE, commonly known as Nature Thyroid, presents a distinct biochemical profile compared to synthetic levothyroxine (LT4), containing not only T4 and T3 but also additional thyroid hormones like T2 and calcitonin. This comprehensive hormonal composition may more closely mimic the natural output of the thyroid gland, potentially leading to improved symptom management for some patients. Many patients report a preference for DTE over LT4, often due to better relief from symptoms such as fatigue, mental fog, and difficulties with weight management, which are not as effectively addressed by LT4 alone. Additionally, genetic variations that impair the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 may make DTE, which directly supplies both hormones, particularly beneficial for these individuals. Furthermore, some studies suggest that DTE may promote weight loss and improve metabolic parameters, possibly due to the direct metabolic effects of T3. While DTE may offer advantages for certain subgroups of patients, especially those who do not achieve optimal results with LT4, it should be used cautiously, tailored to individual needs, and supported by more definitive, large-scale clinical trials to fully understand its long-term efficacy compared to LT4.

Our metanalysis does not suggest any clinical benefits of DTE or combined T4 and T3 supplementation over T4 therapy alone in the broader population.

These results highlight the complexity of thyroid hormone replacement therapy and the need for individualized treatment approaches. While combined T4 + T3 therapy offers distinct biochemical changes, these do not translate into significant clinical differences in lipid profiles, heart rate, or most quality-of-life measures. However, the observed improvement in mental well-being with combined therapy could be a potential area for further exploration.

There are several strengths alongside notable weaknesses. Among its strengths is the study’s comprehensive literature search across multiple databases using a Boolean approach and specific keywords, which ensures a thorough collection of relevant studies. This is further enhanced by the exclusive focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adhering to the highest standards of scientific evidence and significantly bolstering the reliability and validity of the findings. The rigorous data extraction process, conducted independently by multiple investigators and utilizing the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2), adds to the study’s thoroughness and accuracy, minimizing potential biases in the included clinical trials. The detailed statistical analysis using Review Manager (RevMan) software, mean differences, standardized mean differences, and forest plots provides a robust and clear statistical framework, enhancing the study’s credibility.

Different levothyroxine products and serum TSH—Because use of different levothyroxine products may sometimes be associated with altered serum TSH values, a change in an identifiable formulation of levothyroxine (brand name or generic) should be followed by re-evaluation of serum TSH at steady state. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by the thyroid gland’s inability to produce sufficient thyroid hormones, which are crucial for regulating metabolism and energy. This condition predominantly affects women and the elderly, impacting approximately 1–6% of the general population. It can range in severity from mild, often asymptomatic forms to severe complications like myxedema, with symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Despite the widespread use of synthetic levothyroxine (LT4) as standard treatment, which effectively normalizes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in most patients, a subset continues to experience persistent symptoms. This observation has spurred interest in exploring alternative treatment strategies, such as combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid extract (DTE).

LT4 monotherapy has long been the cornerstone of hypothyroidism management, prized for its ability to standardize dosages and ensure consistent potency. While LT4 effectively alleviates the primary symptoms of hypothyroidism and prevents long-term health issues associated with thyroid hormone deficiency, approximately 5–10% of patients report persistent symptoms such as fatigue and mood disturbances, even when TSH levels are normalized. These persistent symptoms suggest that TSH levels may not fully reflect the thyroid hormone status at the tissue level, highlighting the potential inadequacies of LT4 monotherapy in some patients and underscoring the complexity of thyroid hormone metabolism, including genetic variations that affect hormone conversion.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

Combined Therapy of T4 and T3

Although the predominant treatment of thyroxine supplementation is LT4 monotherapy, 10% to 15% of patients have persistent or recurrent hypothyroid symptoms (weight gain, fatigue, memory loss, etc.) despite normal TH levels and medical adhesion. This phenomenon is assumed to be attributed to a low level of circulating T3, which plays a superior role to T4 in the feedback of the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid axis. A previous study showed a 10% to 20% reduction in serum T3 levels in ∼1.8 thousand LT4-treated hypothyroid patients compared with the healthy population. Similar phenomena were also observed in thyroidectomized rats, which reached euthyroidism only after normalization of serum T3 levels.

Based on the theory above, clinicians have returned to combined therapy of T4 plus T3 to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms, with strict indications. Clinicians supported that only hypothyroid patients treated with a stable dose of LT4 for at least 6 months, who had experienced persistent symptoms and had a normal serum TSH level, should receive T4 plus T3 combination therapy. However, those with associated comorbidities (eg, autoimmune diseases and psychological dysfunctions) or unrealistic expectations should not receive combination therapy. The dose ratio of T3 to T4 in combination therapy is a controversial area. Ratios ranging from 1:3 to 1:17 have been reported in several articles. Considering that the physiological ratio of T3:T4 secreted by the thyroid gland is approximately 1:14 and the residual thyroid has secretory function, a ratio between 1:8 and 1:13 may be more appropriate. Animal-derived DTE has also been introduced to treat refractory hypothyroidism due to combinations of T3 and T4 in a 1:4.22 ratio. Animal-derived DTE contains a supraphysiological amount of T3, and cardiac complications should be monitored with caution.

1 Introduction

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe, and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and no or minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy, with this medication being converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3) are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. This concept may seem straightforward, but there are subtleties that have only recently been recognised. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalise TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms of hypothyroidism, even with normalised TSH levels. This may be due to LT4 monotherapy not restoring T3 levels to the normal range in a subset of patients, perhaps due to polymorphisms within the genes which encode peripheral deiodinase enzymes.

Additionally, multiple studies suggest that as many as 40% of patients taking LT4 have TSH levels outside of the normal range, indicating under‐ or over‐replacement of thyroid hormones. Certain patient factors, such as sex, age, and duration of treatment, may influence this under‐ or over‐treatment. Significantly, both under‐ and over‐treatment of hypothyroidism are associated with increased all‐cause mortality.

This study aims to investigate further the differences in thyroid hormone levels and health outcomes in people on thyroid hormone replacement therapy compared with people being screened for thyroid disorder and not taking levothyroxine. Better understanding of the relation between thyroid hormone replacement therapy and actual levels of TSH, Free T3 (FT3), and FT4 in patients could allow more tailored and effective therapy for people with hypothyroidism.

### Comparative effectiveness of levothyroxine, desiccated thyroid extract, and levothyroxine + liothyronine in hypothyroidism [^b6400b30]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

All study participants, physician investigators, those administering the neurocognitive tests, and those analyzing test results were blinded throughout the study.

Baseline assessments were obtained before randomization, whereas patients were taking either LT4, LT4 + LT3, or DTE (Table 1). Subsequently, patients were randomized to 1 of 3 groups and started on the study medications (Table 2). All medications were given once daily only, in the morning on an empty stomach with water only; other medications, if any, were given at least 1 hour later. Adherence was evaluated through interviews, by counting the number of remaining capsules, and monitoring refills, as well as evaluating the thyroid function tests.

Table 2. 
Equivalent doses of LT4, LT4 + LT3 and DTE given to study subjects

Each study medication was administered during a study period of 22 weeks, as follows: after the first 6 weeks on the medication, TSH levels were checked, and the dose adjusted to maintain TSH level between 0.27 and 4.20. The adjustment was performed by a physician who had no other contact with the study patients. Adjustments were made by increasing or decreasing the dosage of the study medication as per Table 2. If the TSH was out of range, the next higher or lower dosage was used. Similarly, the physician doing the evaluations did not know the dose of the study medications the patients were taking. With the serum TSH level within the desired range, patients continued on the study medication for an additional 16 weeks, completing the study period. Subsequently, patients were crossed over to the next randomized study medication and followed for another 22-week study period. Predefined equivalence ratios among LT4, LT4 + LT3, and DTE were used (Table 2). The same steps were followed after crossover to the third study medication. The doses of each study medication at the beginning and end of each study period were: LT4, 115 ± 25 vs 115 ± 25 mcg/d; DTE, 77 ± 16 vs 77 ± 17 mg/d; LT4 + LT3, 84 ± 20/8.8 ± 1.7 mcg/d vs 84 ± 20/8.8 ± 1.8 mcg/d (Table 3).

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^1f5b3bab]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening (myxedema coma); more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially early in disease presentation; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine. There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone. Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e., take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management. Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment is essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than 10 mIU per L or the thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: understanding the patient's perspective [^78dcc860]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patient-centered studies have shown that several patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism exhibit persistent symptoms, including "brain fog." Here, we aimed to determine which of these specific symptoms are associated with brain fog, identify patient-reported factors that modify these symptoms, and identify patient concerns related to brain fog not included in thyroid-specific questionnaires.

Methods

A survey on brain fog symptoms adapted from thyroid-specific patient-reported outcome was distributed online. Textual data analysis was performed to identify common areas of concern from open-ended survey responses.

Results

A total of 5170 participants reporting brain fog while being treated for hypothyroidism were included in the analysis. Of these, 2409 (46.6%) participants reported symptom onset prior to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and 4096 (79.2%) participants experienced brain fog symptoms frequently. Of the symptoms listed, participants associated fatigue and forgetfulness most frequently with brain fog. More rest was the most common factor provided for improving symptoms. The textual data analysis identified areas of concern that are not often included in thyroid-specific quality of life questionnaires, including a focus on the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the types and doses of medications, and the patient-doctor relationship.

Conclusion

Brain fog in patients treated for hypothyroidism was associated most frequently with fatigue and cognitive symptoms. Several additional areas of patient concern were found to be associated with brain fog, which are not typically addressed in thyroid-specific questionnaires.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Dosing and Administration

Instruct patients to take LEVOXYL only as directed by their healthcare provider.
Instruct patients to take LEVOXYL as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast with a full glass of water to avoid choking or gagging.
Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take LEVOXYL tablets within 4 hours of these agents.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking LEVOXYL.

Important Information

Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in symptoms.
Inform patients that the levothyroxine in LEVOXYL is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life.
Inform patients that LEVOXYL should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions you may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking LEVOXYL. If they have diabetes, instruct patients to monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by their physician and immediately report any changes to their physician. If patients are taking anticoagulants, their clotting status should be checked frequently.
Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking LEVOXYL prior to any surgery.

Adverse Reactions

Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.
Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of LEVOXYL therapy; this is usually temporary.

### Fatigue and cancer: causes, prevalence and treatment approaches [^3b1e7351]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Assessing patients with clinically significant fatigue

Given the diverse aetiological factors that contribute to fatigue and its multidimensional nature, the comprehensive assessment of patients with fatigue is required for the development of effective treatment interventions. Clinical practice guidelines for fatigue assessment and management emphasise the need to evaluate (1) fatigue characteristics and (2) disease status and treatment. Guidelines also recommend obtaining a history and physical checkup and conducting laboratory studies as indicated to rule out common, treatable causes of fatigue, such as anemia or thyroid dysfunction (;). An in-depth fatigue assessment should include fatigue severity, temporal characteristics (e.g. onset, duration), exacerbating and alleviating factors, impact on functioning and quality of life, symptom-related distress, and other symptoms that commonly co-occur with fatigue such as pain, menopausal symptoms, sleep disturbances, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Since fatigue is a subjective sensation, it is important to use validated, standardised assessment instruments. Many standardised instruments have been developed for the assessment of fatigue and its impact on quality of life (for a review, see).

Interventions for cancer-related fatigue

The brief nature of this article does not allow a comprehensive review of empirical support for interventions to treat cancer-related fatigue. Priority was given to randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with fatigue as a primary end point. For interventions with several published RCTs (e.g. psychosocial interventions), results from less methodologically rigorous studies were not presented. For interventions that have not been as extensively investigated, open-label studies and pilot studies are cited. Clinical practice guidelines developed by the NCCN Cancer-Related Fatigue Panel through evidence-based and consensus review are used to guide the discussion.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network Cancer-Related Fatigue Guidelines recommend a two-stage approach to the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. The first step in treating fatigued cancer patients is to identify and address any treatable contributing factors that may be causing the fatigue. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines identify several commonly observed treatable contributing factors, including pain, emotional distress, anemia, sleep disturbance, nutritional inadequacies, deconditioning due to decreased activity and comorbidities (e.g. infection, cardiac dysfunction, renal dysfunction). Significant improvements in quality of life have been demonstrated among anemic cancer patients after treatment with erythropoietic agents (; Cella et al, in press).

Information for the Patient —

Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that:

1. Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.

2. They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.

3. In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.

4. In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted.

5. Instruct patients to discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before thyroid function testing is conducted.

6. Partial loss of hair may be experienced by children in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule.

Laboratory Tests —

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Comparative effectiveness of generic vs brand-name levothyroxine in achieving normal thyrotropin levels [^f71b6af2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations that need to be considered. Given the observational nature of our study, residual confounding may still exist. As a result, unmeasured factors may have influenced our findings, and patients filling generic levothyroxine may be different from those filling brand levothyroxine prescriptions; these differences may have influenced the study outcomes. For instance, we could not account for all the factors that might affect gastrointestinal tract absorption of levothyroxine, such as concomitant intake of over-the-counter calcium preparations.Our primary measure for the assessment of baseline thyroid hormone level status and for the laboratory outcomes was based on a thyrotropin level and not free thyroxine. We preferred this approach, given that thyrotropin is the most sensitive test to assess response to therapy.We could not reliably ascertain levothyroxine dose adjustments from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse because physician-directed medication adjustments may involve pill cutting and alternate-day dosing. Finally, our study sample includes mostly patients with commercial health insurance; the applicability of study findings to underinsured populations is unclear.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring—recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

### Hypothyroidism [^29437850]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism, the deficiency of thyroid hormone, is a common condition worldwide. It affects almost all body systems and has a wide variety of clinical presentations from being asymptomatic to, in rare cases, life threatening. The classic symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, lethargy, weight gain, and cold intolerance; however, these symptoms are non-specific and the diagnosis is typically made on biochemical grounds through serum thyroid function tests. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), although other causes, including drugs (such as amiodarone, lithium, and immune checkpoint inhibitors), radioactive-iodine treatment, and thyroid surgery, are frequent. Historically, severe iodine deficiency was the most common cause. Reference ranges for thyroid function tests are based on fixed percentiles of the population distribution, but there is increasing awareness of the need for more individualised reference intervals based on key factors such as age, sex, and special circumstances such as pregnancy. Levothyroxine monotherapy is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism; it is safe and inexpensive, restores thyroid function tests to within the reference range, and improves symptoms in the majority of patients. However, 10% of patients have persistent symptoms of ill health despite normalisation of thyroid function tests biochemically and a substantial proportion of patients on levothyroxine have thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations outside the reference range. Ongoing symptoms despite levothyroxine treatment has led to some patients using liothyronine or desiccated thyroid extract. Taken together, these factors have led to intense debate around the treatment thresholds and treatment strategies for hypothyroidism. In this Seminar, we review the epidemiology, genetic determinants, causes, and presentation of hypothyroidism; highlight key considerations and controversies in its diagnosis and management; and provide future directions for research.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

From a conventional clinical perspective, doctors should instruct patients not to change preparations if the change will not result in obvious benefits. Interestingly, in 2022, a comparative effectiveness study using data from a national database provided conflicting results. By comparing 2780 individuals who switched among generic LT4 preparations with 2780 propensity-matched controls, no significant difference was detected in TSH levels. However, the study did not evaluate the effect of generic to brand and brand to generic switching. The dose adjustment before and after the switch was not evaluated. In addition, only 3 preparations containing similar excipients were included in the study and the conclusion cannot be extended beyond those 3 products. Conservatively, if a switch is necessary, close follow-up of serum TH levels and self-reported symptoms should be conducted.

Improper storage leads to reduced potency of LT4. Normally, the bioequivalence remains unchanged over a shelf life of more than 36 months. Exposure to sunlight, high temperatures, humidity, and oxygen significantly accelerates the degradation of LT4 tablets. Exposure to direct sunlight for 80 minutes results in more than 60% decomposition. Blister packaging may eliminate refractory hypothyroidism due to improper storage.

### Comparative effectiveness of generic vs brand-name levothyroxine in achieving normal thyrotropin levels [^9240d4c5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study of the comparative effectiveness of generic vs brand-name levothyroxine found that for adults with mild forms of thyroid dysfunction, consistent use of either the generic or brand-name formulations was associated with similar rates of achieving normal and stable thyrotropin levels. Further research needs to clarify whether these findings are consistent among patients with no or little endogenous thyroid hormone production and whether switching between formulation affects these outcomes.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Inform the patient of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of LEVO-T:

Dosing and Administration

Instruct patients that LEVO-T should be taken with a full glass of water since the tablet may rapidly disintegrate.
Instruct patients to take LEVO-T only as directed by their healthcare provider.
Instruct patients to take LEVO-T as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast.
Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take LEVO-T tablets within 4 hours of these agents.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant while taking LEVO-T.

Important Information

Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in symptoms.
Inform patients that the levothyroxine in LEVO-T is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life.
Inform patients that LEVO-T should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations.
Instruct patients to notify their physician of any other medical conditions they may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while they are taking LEVO-T. If they have diabetes, instruct patients to monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by their physician and immediately report any changes to their physician. If patients are taking anticoagulants, their clotting status should be checked frequently.
Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist that they are taking LEVO-T prior to any surgery.

Adverse Reactions

Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.
Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of LEVO-T therapy, but this is usually temporary.

Nonresponse and relapses after completion of treatment

Among the 34 patients showing a proptosis response of ≥2 mm in OPTIC, 10 patients (29.4%) experienced a relapse (described as “flare”) over the ensuing year, including 5 who had a proptosis relapse alone, 4 who experienced both a proptosis and CAS relapse, and 1 with a CAS relapse alone.Relapses had occurred at week 48 (27 weeks after final infusion) in seven patients, week 60 in two patients, and week 72 in one patient. The OPTIC-X study also examined the effect of a repeat course of eight TEP infusions in poor responders (n = 5) or those who relapsed after an initial study-defined response (n = 8) in OPTIC.

For the five nonresponders, two responded with proptosis reduction of ≥2 mm, one patient remained a nonresponder, and two dropped out due to either poor response or a serious adverse effect (intracerebral hemorrhage). For 8 patients among the 10 who relapsed after an initial response in OPTIC for whom data from OPTIC-X are available, 5 of 8 experienced proptosis reduction of ≥2 mm with the second course of TEP. An FDA briefing document cites a relapse rate of 37% at 72 weeks among TEP-treated patients (relapse defined as an increase in proptosis of ≥2 mm from week 24 in the study eye only).

Safety

TEP should not be used during pregnancy or for patients <18 years of age due to concerns regarding growth. The AE profile of TEP appears to be acceptable, but deterioration of glucose control in patients with diabetes or prediabetes, at times requiring insulin therapy, was noted in 10% of patients.Muscle cramps were reported in 25% of patients treated with TEP, nausea in 17%, alopecia in 13%, fatigue in 12%, and, importantly, hearing impairment in 10% of patients.A recent summary of five series reported hearing impairment in 29 of 190 (15.2%) patients treated with TEP, with resolution in 16 (55%) but persistence in 13 (45%) patients.

Aggravation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on TEP was noted in two patients in the two existing RCTs, and apparently new diagnoses of IBD have been described in conjunction with TEP therapy,so cautionary use of this drug is recommended in patients with this disorder. In the United States, the drug was granted FDA approval in 2020.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient and/or the caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information Sheet).

Dosing and Administration

Instruct patients to take TIROSINT only as directed by their healthcare provider.
Instruct patients to take TIROSINT one-half to one hour before breakfast.
Inform patients that agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Instruct patients not to take TIROSINT within 4 hours of these agents.
Instruct patients that TIROSINT capsules should be swallowed whole and never be cut, crushed, or chewed.
To assist with identifying the name and strength of each TIROSINT capsule, instruct patients not to remove capsules from the blisters in advance, particularly if they are taking multiple strengths.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant while taking TIROSINT.

Important Information

Inform patients that it may take several weeks before they notice an improvement in symptoms.
Inform patients that the levothyroxine in TIROSINT is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life.
Inform patients that TIROSINT should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations [see Drug Interactions (7)] .
Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking TIROSINT. If they have diabetes, instruct patients to monitor their blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by their physician and immediately report any changes to their physician. If patients are taking anticoagulants, their clotting status should be checked frequently.
Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist that they are taking TIROSINT prior to any surgery.

Study Outcomes

We examined the effectiveness of levothyroxine based on attained thyrotropin levels measured in the outpatient setting. For assessment of effectiveness, we examined the proportion of individuals who initiated use of either generic or brand-name levothyroxine and who attained a normal thyrotropin level within 3 months, clinically meaningful abnormal thyrotropin level within 3 months, and stable thyrotropin level(s) within 3 months after thyrotropin fell into the normal range (Figure 2).

Figure 2. 
Study Outcomes

We defined a normal thyrotropin level as ranging from 0.3 to 4.4 mIU/L, a range that includes as much as 95% of the healthy population.Given that thyrotropin values are only reliable as treatment markers at least 6 weeks after initiation of therapy,we used only the first available thyrotropin value from 6 weeks to 3 months after initiation of therapy to assess treatment effectiveness. Using thyrotropin values beyond 3 months of therapy may not be an accurate surrogate for effectiveness because the values might reflect changes in doses rather than the comparative effectiveness between brand-name and generic levothyroxine. Moreover, levothyroxine dose adjustments may not be reliably obtained retrospectively from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, because physician-directed medication adjustments may involve pill splitting and alternate-day dosing. Abnormal thyrotropin values were categorized as clinically meaningful when thyrotropin levels were suppressed (<0.1 mIU/L) or elevated (>10 mIU/L). We defined stable thyrotropin levels as a normal thyrotropin level within 3 months after thyrotropin levels fell into the normal range. When there were multiple thyrotropin level measurements during this period of time, we used the one closest to the first thyrotropin measurement (Figure 2).

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy.High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement,, and untreated hyperthyroidism.In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, deepening of the voice, and androgenic alopecia.Based on available safety data, if the level is supraphysiological, even in the absence of androgenic side effects, the patient should be instructed to titrate down the dose with a repeat blood test after 2–3 weeks. Serum testosterone concentrations should be monitored every 4–6 months once stable levels are achieved to screen for overuse with the inherent downstream androgenic consequences.

The inclusion criteria (prospective study, published in English, had a T4+T3 combination therapy test group and a T4 monotherapy control group, patients aged ≥18 years and with overt primary hypothyroidism, and published after January 2000) were applied by two reviewers; any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. The two reviewers independently extracted data using a standard data form and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Coprimary outcomes included the psychological health measures of depression, fatigue, pain, anxiety and anger, measured using validated and reliable instruments.

Results

Eighteen of 2029 studies (883 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. No significant difference was found between T4+T3 combination therapy and T4 monotherapy with regard to depression (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.18; 0.07), fatigue (SMD: 0.06, 95% CI: -0.13; 0.26), pain (SMD: -0.01, 95% CI: -0.24; 0.22), anxiety (SMD: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.15; 0.17) and anger (SMD: 0.05, 95% CI: -0.15; 0.24). Methodological heterogeneity had no influence on the results. The patients preferred combination therapy significantly.

Conclusions

Compared with T4 monotherapy, T4+T3 combination therapy had no significant advantage in improving psychological health. For patients who are unsatisfied with LT4 monotherapy, the patient and the physician should make a joint decision concerning therapy.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^916982eb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement in central hypothyroidism (CH): We recommend L-T4 in doses sufficient to achieve serum fT4 levels in the mid to upper half of the reference range, and appropriate L-T4 doses in CH average 1.6 μg/kg/d, with dose adjustments based on clinical context, age, and fT4 levels. We suggest against treating CH with levotriiodothyronine (L-T3), thyroid extracts, or other formulations of thyroid hormones. We recommend against using serum TSH levels to adjust thyroid replacement dosing in patients with CH.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^7c400ceb]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism—dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

### Study protocol ; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^cdf53b2f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH <0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains <0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥0.4 and <4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

### Use of thyroid hormones in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients: a 2020 THESIS questionnaire survey of members of the Czech society of endocrinology [^a6e36fbe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Respondents with diagnosis of hypothyroidism

Twenty-nine respondents (18.5%) had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and treated with thyroid hormones, and 3 of them (10.3%) stated that they experienced excessive fatigue. Of these 29, none had tried preparation of desiccated thyroid and 4 (13.8%) had tried combined therapy with LT4 and LT3. Among the latter 4 respondents, 2 preferred LT4 and one reported no difference between LT4 and combined LT4-LT3 therapy. Only one out of 29 hypothyroid physicians (3.5%) would recommend LT3 to their patients. Similarly, only 4 out of 128 respondents (3.1%) would consider LT3 or desiccated thyroid for themselves, if diagnosed with hypothyroidism.

10	OVERDOSAGE

In clinical trials of THYROGEN, three patients experienced symptoms after receiving THYROGEN doses higher than those recommended. Two patients had nausea after a 2.7 mg IM dose (3 times the recommended dose), and in one of these patients, the event was accompanied by weakness, dizziness and headache. Another patient experienced nausea, vomiting and hot flashes after a 3.6 mg IM dose (4 times the recommended dose). There is no specific therapy for THYROGEN overdose. Supportive care is recommended.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^95d0aac6]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine therapy in specific subpopulations—elderly with hypothyroidism (Recommendation 6a) states that, in general, levothyroxine should be initiated with low doses, and the dose titrated slowly based on serum thyrotropin (TSH) measurements, and it should be recognized that normal serum thyrotropin ranges are higher in older populations (such as those over 65 years), and that higher serum thyrotropin targets may be appropriate. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.
