## Question

Which laboratory tests can be used to exclude a thrombus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests can be used to exclude a suspected venous thromboembolism, likely deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, although the prompt seems truncated and I should acknowledge that uncertainty explicitly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework for excluding VTE and how pretest probability governs the use of laboratory testing. Then, I should verify which laboratory assays, if any, are validated to safely rule out VTE and under what conditions. Next, I will review evidence on D-dimer performance, including assay types and integration with clinical decision rules. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings where exclusion with labs is less reliable. Finally, I should confirm which tests are not appropriate for ruling out VTE so we avoid misapplication and unnecessary thrombophilia panels.

> Let me first confirm the overarching diagnostic strategy. Modern VTE workups start with pretest probability assessment (for example, Wells-based "unlikely/likely" categorization), because the safety of using laboratory tests to exclude VTE depends on baseline risk. For patients assessed as low (unlikely) risk, an initial D-dimer can safely reduce the need for imaging; for high (likely) risk patients, imaging is warranted up front. This pretest probability–anchored approach applies to both suspected DVT and PE and is the backbone of contemporary guidelines [^113ihkkg].

> Hold on, I should verify which laboratory test actually excludes VTE. Apart from D-dimer, routine labs such as CBC, PT/INR, and aPTT do not reliably rule in or rule out acute DVT/PE; they are nonspecific adjuncts at best. In contrast, a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer in the context of low (or sometimes intermediate) pretest probability can exclude VTE without imaging; using D-dimer outside a low/intermediate risk framework is unsafe and not recommended. So, the laboratory test with validated rule-out capability is D-dimer, used in a structured algorithm that incorporates pretest probability [^112nfW7r] [^113ihkkg].

> I need to check assay characteristics because not all D-dimers are equal. Highly sensitive laboratory-based assays (e.g. ELISA) have the best sensitivity and are validated to exclude DVT or PE in low-risk patients, and in some strategies can extend to moderate pretest probability; point-of-care qualitative or moderately sensitive latex assays are generally limited to low-risk groups. The diagnostic performance and permitted scope differ by assay sensitivity, so I should emphasize that clinicians must know which D-dimer method their lab uses and apply the correct thresholding within a validated algorithm [^113xKyRy] [^112Esmpn].

> Next, I should review the integration with clinical decision rules. With a Wells "unlikely" score and a negative D-dimer, the post-test probability of DVT is very low, supporting a safe rule-out strategy. An individual patient data meta-analysis found that an unlikely Wells score (≤ 1) plus a negative D-dimer yielded about a 1.2% probability of DVT and allowed nearly one-third of patients to avoid imaging; the rule's calibration is robust across common subgroups, though probabilities are higher in cancer and suspected recurrences. This reinforces the principle: pretest probability first, then D-dimer to exclude when appropriate [^116X8Sfc] [^117M8hQW].

> Wait, there is a tempting shortcut: could D-dimer alone exclude DVT without pretest probability? I should not jump to conclusions. Retrospective analyses suggest a low failure rate for proximal DVT when D-dimer is used alone, but this has not been validated in prospective management studies, and guidelines still recommend pairing D-dimer with a clinical decision rule. Therefore, D-dimer as a stand-alone rule-out is not standard of care and should be avoided outside research settings [^117Tb8do] [^113ihkkg].

> Let me consider the pulmonary embolism side specifically. The same principles apply: in patients with low (unlikely) PE pretest probability, a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer can exclude PE without imaging, while high (likely) risk warrants direct imaging with V/Q scan or CTPA. Nonspecific tests for PE (e.g., arterial blood gases, ECG, troponin) cannot exclude PE and serve only to raise or lower suspicion; they do not replace D-dimer paired with validated clinical prediction rules or definitive imaging when indicated [^113ihkkg] [^112nfW7r].

> I should double-check special populations and settings where laboratory exclusion is less reliable. In hospitalized inpatients, baseline D-dimer is often elevated and evidence for using D-dimer to exclude VTE is limited; imaging thresholds remain low. In pregnancy, physiologic D-dimer elevation complicates interpretation; a systematic review suggests diagnostic algorithms that include D-dimer can still function, but careful application and pregnancy-adapted rules are required. In patients with cancer or suspected recurrent DVT, false negatives are less common than false positives, but overall post-test probabilities are higher and exclusion strategies are less efficient, making imaging more frequently necessary [^111XAuCs] [^113AgJ5q] [^116X8Sfc].

> But wait, what about atypical-site thromboses like cerebral venous thrombosis or portal vein thrombosis? I need to be precise. For CVT, routine labs (CBC, CMP, PT, aPTT) are recommended as part of the evaluation, but they do not exclude CVT; diagnosis hinges on neuroimaging. For portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis, diagnosis is imaging-based, and expert guidance advises against routine hypercoagulable workups in the absence of red flags; in patients with HCC, contrast-enhanced modalities or thrombus biopsy are used to distinguish bland from tumor thrombus. In short, laboratory testing does not exclude atypical-site venous thrombosis; targeted imaging is required [^114iaZTV] [^114rykp1] [^115UkwPV].

> I should confirm what not to use for exclusion in the acute setting. Thrombophilia panels (e.g. FVL, prothrombin G20210A, protein C/S, antithrombin, APS antibodies) do not diagnose or exclude acute VTE and should not be ordered to rule out DVT/PE; they are often misleading during acute thrombosis or anticoagulation, and guidelines discourage routine testing, especially at the time of VTE presentation. Their results do not change acute diagnostic decisions and can be deferred or avoided in most scenarios [^112hie2h] [^111chGNk] [^112DUYA3].

> Let me summarize to ensure internal consistency. The only laboratory test validated to exclude suspected VTE is a high-sensitivity D-dimer, and even then, only when combined with a low (unlikely) pretest probability, with selective extension to moderate pretest probability depending on assay sensitivity. If pretest probability is high, or the setting reduces D-dimer specificity or validated performance (inpatient, pregnancy, cancer, suspected recurrence), imaging is indicated. Routine labs and thrombophilia tests cannot exclude VTE and should not be used for that purpose. This aligns with contemporary guideline-directed diagnostic pathways [^113ihkkg] [^116X8Sfc] [^112Esmpn] [^112DUYA3].

To rule out thrombus, use a **high-sensitivity D-dimer** with a validated clinical decision rule (e.g. Wells) [^112Esmpn] in low-risk patients; a negative result reliably excludes VTE without imaging [^113ihkkg] [^112QSwJG]. In moderate/high-risk or inpatient settings, D-dimer is less specific and **imaging is required** [^111XAuCs]. Routine thrombophilia testing is **not indicated for initial exclusion** of thrombus [^114KTP3M] [^112DUYA3] [^111chGNk] [^112V177e].

---

## D-dimer testing

D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product released during thrombus formation and breakdown; it has **high sensitivity** [^113xKyRy] but low specificity, making it most useful for excluding VTE in low-risk patients [^113ihkkg] [^116X8Sfc].

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: High-sensitivity assays have sensitivity ~96% for DVT and ~95% for PE, but specificity is low (~36%) [^113xKyRy] [^112QSwJG].

- **Clinical decision rules**: Combine D-dimer with Wells or Geneva [^112Esmpn] to stratify risk and guide testing [^117M8hQW] [^113ihkkg].

- **Outpatient use**: In low-risk outpatients [^1119hm4S], a negative D-dimer safely excludes VTE without imaging [^113ihkkg] [^116X8Sfc].

- **Inpatient limitations**: In hospitalized patients, specificity is reduced [^111XAuCs] and imaging is often required [^112nfW7r].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation profile

CBC and coagulation tests are **nonspecific** for thrombus but help assess bleeding risk and guide anticoagulation [^114iaZTV]. The **CBC** measures platelet count and hemoglobin to assess bleeding risk and anemia, whereas the **coagulation profile** (PT/INR and aPTT) assesses baseline coagulation and guides anticoagulation [^116ZcNEn].

---

## Thrombophilia testing

Thrombophilia testing identifies inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states [^115Zrnz2] but is **not indicated for initial exclusion** of thrombus [^115zjaco] [^112DUYA3].

- **Inherited thrombophilia**: Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, antithrombin, protein C/S deficiencies [^112hie2h] [^114KTP3M] [^112V177e].

- **Acquired thrombophilia**: Antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) [^115Zrnz2] [^114KTP3M] [^112V177e].

- **Clinical utility**: Testing is not recommended during acute VTE or initial anticoagulation [^111chGNk]; it does not guide initial exclusion [^114KTP3M] [^112V177e] [^112DUYA3].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **adjusted strategies** to exclude thrombus.

- **Pregnancy**: D-dimer rises with gestation; use pregnancy-adjusted thresholds and clinical assessment [^113AgJ5q].

- **Cancer patients**: D-dimer is often elevated [^112Esmpn]; imaging is usually required [^113ihkkg].

- **COVID-19**: D-dimer is frequently elevated [^116ZcNEn]; clinical context and imaging are essential [^115LuBdy] [^114LMUSp].

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule in clinically important subgroups: Individual patient data meta-analysis [^112Esmpn]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Fourthly, the American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommends D-dimer testing to rule out deep vein thrombosis in those with a low score on the Wells rule; a negative D-dimer test result precludes the need for imaging. Our individual patient data meta-analysis confirmed that recommendation, and as such, that finding of our analyses is not novel. Yet, different thresholds on the Wells rule have been defined to categorize patients as low risk. The Wells rule can be either trichotomized (three-level Wells rule: low score ≤ 0, moderate score 1 or 2, and high score > 2) or dichotomized (two-level Wells rule: unlikely score ≤ 1 and likely score ≥ 2).

- **D-dimer testing**: The evidence summarized in the American College of Chest Physicians guideline suggested that moderately sensitive D-dimer tests (such as qualitative point-of-care D-dimer tests) are only safe in patients defined as low risk by the three-level Wells rule (score ≤ 0), whereas highly sensitive laboratory-based D-dimer testing (using assay-specific cut-offs, usually < 500 µg/L) can still safely exclude deep vein thrombosis in patients with a moderate pretest probability using the three-level Wells rule (score 1 or 2).

Yet, evidence on the pooled estimates for the safety of excluding deep vein thrombosis using the two-level Wells rule combined with either point-of-care or laboratory-based D-dimer testing was unfortunately lacking. A novel finding of our individual patient data meta-analysis is that we can now provide such pooled estimates on the probability of deep vein thrombosis in patients with an unlikely score on the Wells rule (≤ 1).

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^113ihkkg]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Modern diagnostic strategies for venous thromboembolism (VTE) incorporate pretest probability (PTP; prevalence) assessment. The ability of diagnostic tests to correctly identify or exclude VTE is influenced by VTE prevalence and test accuracy characteristics.

These evidence-based guidelines are intended to support patients, clinicians, and health care professionals in VTE diagnosis. Diagnostic strategies were evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower and upper extremity, and recurrent VTE (reVTE).

- **Methods**: The American Society of Hematology (ASH) formed a multidisciplinary panel including patient representatives. The McMaster University GRADE Centre completed systematic reviews up to 1 October 2017. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence and make recommendations. Test accuracy estimates and VTE population prevalence were used to model expected outcomes in diagnostic pathways. Where modeling was not feasible, management and accuracy studies were used to formulate recommendations.

- **Results**: Ten recommendations are presented, by PTP for patients with suspected PE and lower extremity DVT, and for reVTE and upper extremity DVT.

- **Conclusions**: For patients at low (unlikely) VTE risk, using D-dimer as the initial test reduces the need for diagnostic imaging. For patients at high (likely) VTE risk, imaging is warranted. For PE diagnosis, ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are preferred when available.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^112xF1tL]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

For individuals with a family history of VTE and known antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency (high-risk thrombophilia) who have a minor provoking risk factor for VTE, the ASH guideline panel suggests testing for the known familial thrombophilia. The panel suggests thromboprophylaxis in individuals with thrombophilia and no thromboprophylaxis in individuals without thrombophilia (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- **A strategy with selective testing**: For the known familial thrombophilia type would mean that individuals with thrombophilia would receive thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
- **A positive family history is defined as**: Having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE or thrombophilia.
- **These recommendations do not address**: Homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types.
- **This recommendation does not consider**: The time it takes to perform the test and is based on the assumption that thrombophilia test results are available at the time the individual is at risk for VTE because of a minor provoking risk factor.
- **These recommendations refer to**: Selective testing for the known familial thrombophilia type. A separate question in this guideline addressed testing for all hereditary thrombophilias (using a panel of tests) in this population (recommendation 12), and the resulting recommendations are the same. It is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia.

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule in clinically important subgroups: Individual patient data meta-analysis [^1171T2TA]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Doctors regularly encounter patients with leg problems and must decide whether to test for deep vein thrombosis. As signs and symptoms can be non-specific, many patients require additional diagnostic testing; the consequences of missing an event can be fatal (for example, pulmonary embolism). In recent studies, the prevalence of thrombosis in suspected patients was only around 10–15%, suggesting that doctors have a low threshold for diagnostic testing. Various clinical decision rules have been developed to improve the clinical investigations for suspected deep vein thrombosis. These rules combine different clinical factors to yield a score, which is then used to estimate the probability of deep vein thrombosis being present.

The most widely used clinical decision rule is probably that developed by Wells and colleagues. Many studies have shown that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant treatment without further diagnostic testing in patients with a low score on the Wells rule combined with a negative D-dimer test result.

	- Scores can be trichotomized into low (≤ 0), moderate (1 or 2), and high (≥ 3), or dichotomized into deep vein thrombosis unlikely (≤ 1) or likely (> 1).

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^113QtTpU]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Modeling was conducted for each specific guideline question using prevalence and risk association data to calculate the absolute risk of events in individuals with and without thrombophilia. This approach is based on previously published methods. For each absolute risk, the lowest and highest boundaries were derived by combining minimum and maximum prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) boundaries for the risk association of thrombophilia with first-time or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE); no such association was assumed for the outcome of major bleeding.

Finally, the simulation calculated the absolute number of events in the comparator group (no thrombophilia testing) and the intervention group (thrombophilia testing). This involved simulating the proportion of people with a positive result for thrombophilia, a function of thrombophilia prevalence, the expected event rate before treatment in individuals with or without thrombophilia, a function of the risk associated with thrombophilia, and the reduction (or increase) of outcomes due to the intervention.

The panel assessed the appropriateness of the management strategy (test and treat accordingly) by considering VTEs prevented/tolerated and bleeds prevented/tolerated based on 1,000 patients tested and the specific proportion treated. The cost implications of recommending tests and treatment for particular subgroups were evaluated as per the standard guideline process. Details about the modeling approach are provided in Figure 2.

### Elevated hemostatic factor levels as potential risk factors for thrombosis [^111t9sKC]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the state of the art regarding elevated hemostatic factor levels as potential risk factors for thrombosis. This was done by examining the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, aiming to make recommendations for using specific measurements of hemostatic factor levels in assessing thrombotic risk in individual patients.

- **Data sources**: The study involved a review of the medical literature, focusing primarily on works published in the last 10 years.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Following an initial assessment of the literature, key points were identified. Experts conducted an in-depth review and prepared summaries of their findings and recommendations. A draft manuscript was then prepared and distributed to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia, prior to the conference. During the conference, each key point and associated recommendations were presented for discussion. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus among the 27 experts attending the conference was reached. The results of these discussions were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

- **Conclusions**: Consensus was reached on eight recommendations regarding the use of hemostatic factor levels in assessing thrombotic risk in individual patients. A detailed discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is provided in the article. This is an evolving area of research, and while the routine use of factor level measurements is not presently recommended, improvements in assay methodology and further developments are anticipated.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^113xKyRy]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is currently advocated in the literature as the best D-dimer test for excluding venous thromboembolism in a hospital setting. Stein and colleagues report in their meta-analysis that ELISA for D-dimer has an overall sensitivity of 0.96 for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 0.95 for pulmonary embolism (PE). We found in our meta-analysis that the quantitative point of care D-dimer tests (Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer) indeed have similar sensitivity to ELISA for D-dimer. According to Stein and colleagues, the overall sensitivity of laboratory-based latex D-dimer tests is 0.85 and 0.89 for DVT and PE, respectively, which is equal to the average accuracy of the Clearview Simplify point of care D-dimer test.

Physicians, especially those in primary care, are confronted with a wide spectrum of patients suspected of venous thromboembolism. This spectrum could range from a low-risk patient — for example, a 32-year-old female on oral contraceptives with minor swelling of the leg — to a high-risk patient — such as a 78-year-old male with disseminated malignancy, acute onset of dyspnea with pain on inspiration, and swelling of the entire leg. However, patients in daily practice are hardly ever "textbook patients". It is not uncommon for the low-risk patient to have DVT and the high-risk patient to be diagnosed with another disease, such as heart failure. Hence, it is difficult to make a decision on which patients are to be referred for reference testing (imaging) on the basis of signs and symptoms only. Moreover, this decision often has to be made at the p

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^114NwUKM]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Diagnosing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific and investigations can yield false positives or negatives. The initial step in the diagnostic process involves stratifying patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model.

- **Clinical probability and ultrasound**:
	- When the clinical probability is intermediate or high and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Conversely, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also rule out DVT, obviating the need for ultrasonography.

- **Discordant clinical assessment**:
	- If the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT.

Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred agent for initial therapy, and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis.

- **Therapy duration**:
	- Therapy should continue for at least 3 months. The decision to extend treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of rethrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding and is influenced by patient preference.

- **Screening for thrombophilia**:
	- Routine screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state.

Several new anticoagulants with theoretical benefits are emerging.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^115Zrnz2]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Thrombophilia is a generic term used for several acquired or hereditary conditions that indicate that a patient has a higher-than-normal risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Acquired thrombophilia, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also increases the risk of pregnancy complications. The heritability of VTE, which refers to the proportion of variance attributable to genetic effects, is estimated to be as high as 60%. There are several known genetically determined defects associated with thrombophilia, collectively linked to at least a third of cases of VTE.

This guideline focuses on the most common hereditary thrombophilias, including gain-of-function mutations in factor Va (FVL mutation) and the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene, as well as deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S. Among acquired thrombophilias, the focus is on APS, defined as one or more of lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies combined with clinical criteria. This guideline refrains from providing guidance on tests that have been shown not to be associated with VTE or have not been conclusively associated with VTE.

Because in many clinical settings thrombophilia is tested as a panel, we will generally consider the scenario of "testing for any thrombophilia". Selective testing is the term used for "testing for a specific thrombophilia defect", which is of interest in families with known carriers of a specific defect. Details on the background pathophysiology and genetics of thrombophilia can be found in other reviews.

### Usefulness of clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism: A systematic review [^117M8hQW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To summarize the evidence on the predictive value of clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism, we selected all studies in the English literature in which a clinical prediction rule was prospectively validated against a reference standard. We calculated likelihood ratios, predictive values, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each prediction rule.

Twenty-three studies met our eligibility criteria: 17 evaluated prediction rules for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis, and six evaluated rules for pulmonary embolism. The most frequently evaluated prediction rule for deep vein thrombosis was the Wells rule, which had median positive likelihood ratios of 6.62 for patients with a high pretest probability, 1 for moderate pretest probability, and 0.22 for low pretest probability. The median area under the ROC curve was 0.82. The addition of the D-dimer test to the prediction rule increased the median area under the curve to 0.90. The Wells prediction rule was the most commonly studied for pulmonary embolism and had median positive likelihood ratios of 6.75 for those with high pretest probability, 1.82 for moderate pretest probability, and 0.13 for low pretest probability. The median area under the ROC curve was 0.82.

The Wells prediction rule is useful in identifying patients at low risk of being diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. The addition of a rapid latex D-dimer assay improved the overall performance of the prediction rule.

### Validation of a diagnostic approach to exclude recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UmYiz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE) is a challenge in clinical practice. Our objective was to evaluate the safety of a diagnostic strategy utilizing comparison of diagnostic test results with baseline imaging results to rule out suspected reVTE.

- **Methods**: The REVERSE study was a prospective cohort study with the primary aim of developing a clinical prediction rule for reVTE. We included and followed patients who completed 5–7 months of anticoagulant therapy following a first unprovoked VTE. Suspected cases of reVTE were assessed according to standardized diagnostic criteria based on comparison of diagnostic test results with those obtained at the time of anticoagulant treatment withdrawal.

- **Results**: Out of the 398 suspected events, a reVTE was diagnosed in 106 cases (26.6%) and excluded in 292 cases. In 76 cases (19%), the diagnosis of reVTE was excluded because no significant change on diagnostic imaging was detected compared to baseline imaging. During the ensuing 3 months, six patients received anticoagulant therapy after reVTE was excluded, and two were lost to follow-up. Eight of 284 remaining patients, in whom reVTE had been excluded, were diagnosed with subsequent VTE (3-month risk, 2.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–5.5%). Six of these eight patients with subsequent reVTE had a known superficial or distal thrombosis at the time of initial suspected reVTE.

- **Conclusion**: A diagnostic approach utilizing comparison of diagnostic test results with baseline imaging results can effectively exclude suspected reVTE.

Regarding the diagnostic investigations for portal vein thrombosis, specifically in the evaluation for underlying causes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced ultrasound, CT, MRI, or performing a biopsy of the thrombus to rule out neoplastic PVT in patients with underlying HCC.

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule in clinically important subgroups: Individual patient data meta-analysis [^115awxgr]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Controversy remains on the value of the Wells rule in patients with suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Leg problems in patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis can present a clinical dilemma, as the probable causes include either an exacerbation of post-thrombotic syndrome or recurrent disease. Additionally, recurrent deep vein thrombosis is challenging to confirm even with imaging, often leading to long-term anticoagulation treatment. An incorrect diagnosis exposes the patient to unnecessary risks of bleeding complications. Therefore, an accurate method to exclude recurrent thrombosis is of high clinical importance.

An updated version of the Wells rule was created, adding one extra point if a suspected patient has a history of confirmed deep vein thrombosis. However, this modified model was never properly validated. In our individual patient data meta-analysis, seven studies even excluded patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis. Consequently, the ninth American College of Chest Physicians guideline concluded that diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis were never adequately evaluated, and available evidence on this topic was graded as low.

Our individual patient data meta-analysis is the largest dataset available to address the problem of diagnosing deep vein thrombosis in patients with a history of the condition. We included nearly 1000 patients (n = 941) with a history of deep vein thrombosis, with 220 confirmed cases in that particular group.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^112hie2h]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

The aims of this guideline and specific objectives are to identify thrombophilia, either acquired or hereditary, in many patients presenting with VTE.

The currently most commonly tested hereditary thrombophilias include deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and the gain-of-function mutations FVL and PGM. Lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies, which are laboratory features of the acquired thrombophilic APS, are generally included in a thrombophilia testing panel. These types of thrombophilias are rational components of a thrombophilia testing panel, as these are consistently found to be associated with VTE.

This guideline refrains from providing guidance on other tests that, in some laboratories, are being included in thrombophilia test panels because these have been shown not to be associated with VTE, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms (MTHFRs) 677C→T, 1298A→C. Other tests have not been conclusively associated with VTE, for example, factor VIII, factor IX, and factor XI activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and the 4G/5G PAI-1 promoter polymorphism.

It is important to note that results of thrombophilia tests should be interpreted with knowledge of clinical pitfalls in laboratory testing. Most notably, there is a possibility of finding acquired rather than inherited deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S due to comorbidities or hormone exposure, as well as intraindividual fluctuations of anticoagulant proteins. The diagnostic test characteristics are far from perfect.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^112nfW7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). However, nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE; they merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies".

D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy outpatients. Further study and improvements in technology can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### Thrombophilia: Common questions on laboratory assessment and management [^1133SRy8]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia is an inherited or acquired predisposition to thrombosis. This article reviews the clinical manifestations of thrombophilia and addresses common questions concerning laboratory assessment and management: what are the potential indications for thrombophilia testing, who should be tested, what tests should be requested, when should testing be performed, and how should the test results affect primary prevention, acute therapy, and secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis.

None of the McMaster University–affiliated researchers who contributed to the systematic evidence reviews or supported the guideline development process had any material interest in a commercial entity with any product that could be affected by the guidelines. Supplement 3 provides the complete "Disclosure of Interest" forms of the researchers who made substantial contributions to these guidelines. Notably, the eight researchers listed as authors of this report are R.N. M.B. C.C.-A. L.E.C.-L. S.G.K. H.J.S. W.W., and Y.Z.

- **Formulating specific clinical questions and determining outcomes of interest**: The panel used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool and SurveyMonkey to scope and prioritize the questions detailed in supplemental Appendix D. Two questions concerning testing for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in women with previous placenta-mediated complications or re-miscarriage were dropped at the final online panel meetings due to resource constraints.

The panel selected outcomes of interest for each question a priori, following an approach described in detail elsewhere. In brief, the panel initially brainstormed all possible outcomes before rating the relative importance of each outcome for decision-making. During this rating process, the panel used definitions of the outcomes, referred to as "marker states", that were developed for these guidelines. The panel rated the following outcomes as critical for clinical decision-making across questions: mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and major bleeding. The panel did not distinguish between different clinical severities.

### Thrombophilia testing: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^112DUYA3]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Although the effects of thrombophilia testing are significant, their utility is limited. Clinical history, in conjunction with simple tests such as D-dimer in selected patients, can identify those whose risk of recurrence is high enough to warrant long-term anticoagulation, even when the risk is not significantly lowered by the absence of a thrombophilic trait. These factors also identify patients with low risk of recurrence who do not require long-term anticoagulation, even if they possess heritable thrombophilic traits.

There is no evidence that the presence of heritable thrombophilia influences the intensity, choice, or monitoring of anticoagulant therapy in thrombosis treatment, except potentially in those with antithrombin (AT) deficiency. In AT deficiency, diagnosis makes specific treatment (antithrombin concentrate) available, which can be valuable and can also facilitate the interpretation of laboratory monitoring of heparin. Nonetheless, as this is a rare disorder, routine testing is not advised in the absence of a strong family history (defined as two or more first-degree relatives with venous thromboembolism (VTE)).

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: A diagnostic meta-analysis [^1119hm4S]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosing patients suspected of venous thromboembolism — that is, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — is a major challenge because the signs and symptoms are often mild and non-specific. Primary care physicians, particularly those who in many countries are faced with the initial presentation of venous thromboembolism, must decide whether to refer patients for subsequent testing, which can be difficult.

D-dimer testing can be used to improve the cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic process. D-dimers are degradation products of cross-linked fibrin generated during fibrinolysis, and circulating levels are typically elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism. A negative result in a D-dimer test, in combination with a low pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism (as assessed by a validated clinical decision rule), can safely rule out DVT as well as PE. A large variety of laboratory D-dimer tests are currently available, and their accuracy has been described extensively.

Recently, various point of care, or "near patient", D-dimer tests have been introduced. These D-dimer tests can be performed during a patient's consultation, with results available within 10–15 minutes. Using these tests could avoid the need for more labor-intensive and time-consuming laboratory D-dimer testing. This advantage is especially useful for primary care physicians, as they often have to decide on further patient management during the consultation of a patient with suspected venous thromboembolism.

### Does thrombophilia testing help in the clinical management of patients [^117PxF2j]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia can be identified in about half of all patients presenting with venous thrombosis. Testing has increased tremendously for various indications, but whether the results of such tests help in the clinical management of patients has not been settled. Here, we review the most commonly tested thrombophilic abnormalities, i.e. protein C, protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies, the F5 R506Q (factor V Leiden) and F2 G20210A (prothrombin G20210A) mutations, and elevated levels of coagulation factor VIII, and their association with venous and arterial thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications. We conclude that testing for hereditary thrombophilia generally does not alter the clinical management of patients with venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy complications. Because testing for thrombophilia only serves a limited purpose, this should not be performed on a routine basis.

Limitations of these guidelines

Direct evidence to answer our questions would have come from randomized or well-designed observational studies comparing management strategies embedding or not embedding thrombophilia testing strategies. Similar studies exist for the use of D-dimer and other risk stratification strategies, but none focus specifically on the role of thrombophilia. Because of the lack of direct evidence, we used a modeling approach, using the best available evidence from observational studies and applying relative treatment effects from other ASH guidelines. Hence, most of our evidence was graded low to very low quality for risk of bias and precision and often downgraded for indirectness when we had to borrow prevalence and risk association from the most to the least common scenarios.

Besides the quality of the underlying evidence, other considerations were considered to grade our confidence in the body of evidence, which was very low in most cases. In particular, we adopted a simplified modeling approach without the use of formal forecasting techniques such as Bayesian approaches or Monte Carlo–type simulations; we also did not discount risk and benefits over time and used a 1-year horizon to estimate the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE), whereas it is known that recurrence risk decreases over time. Finally, we modeled the variability in prevalence and association, but we did not consider diagnostic test characteristics and clinical pitfalls in laboratory testing of thrombophilia. Specifically, we did not account for the impact of false-positive test results.

### Clinical decision rules and D-Dimer in venous thromboembolism: Current controversies and future research priorities [^117FxJSs]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially lethal clinical condition that is suspected in patients with common clinical complaints across diverse clinical care settings. Once VTE is diagnosed, optimal therapeutic management — including thrombolysis, IVC filters, and the type and duration of anticoagulants — and ideal therapeutic management settings (outpatient vs. critical care) are also controversial.

Clinical prediction tools, including clinical decision rules and D-Dimer, have been developed, and some validated, to assist in clinical decision-making along the diagnostic and therapeutic management paths for VTE. Despite these developments, there is significant practice variation, and many controversies remain in the use of these clinical prediction tools. This narrative review highlights the challenges and controversies in VTE diagnostic and therapeutic management, focusing on clinical decision rules and D-Dimer.

### How I treat unexplained arterial thrombosis [^112CRnWV]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Most arterial thrombotic events have a clear atherosclerotic or cardioembolic etiology. However, hematologists are frequently asked to assist in the diagnosis and management of a patient with a nonatherosclerotic and noncardioembolic arterial event, referred to here as an unexplained arterial thrombosis. Because there is an assorted list of factors that can precipitate an arterial event, we present a systematic diagnostic approach to ensure consideration of not only primary hypercoagulable disorders, but also pro-thrombotic medications or substances, vascular and anatomic abnormalities, and undiagnosed systemic disorders, such as malignancy and autoimmune diseases.

We also review existing literature on the role of hypercoagulable disorders in arterial thrombosis and discuss our approach to thrombophilia workup in patients after an unexplained arterial event. We conclude with three representative cases to illustrate the application of the outlined diagnostic schema and discuss common management considerations. Specifically, we explore the selection of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^115zjaco]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Similar general conclusions as for Recommendation 1 are valid for this recommendation. The information with median prevalence and ranges of prevalence provided in Table 3 can be used to estimate the effect in a specific geographic population as well as for specific thrombophilia defects.

Should thrombophilia testing be performed for patients with an unspecified type of VTE to guide treatment duration?

- **Recommendation 6**: For patients with an unspecified type of VTE who have completed primary short-term treatment, the ASH guideline panel suggests not performing thrombophilia testing to guide anticoagulant treatment duration (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

- **Remarks**:
	- Whenever anticoagulant treatment decisions are being made without considering whether the VTE is provoked or unprovoked, it is advisable not to test for thrombophilia, to start treatment, and to refer the patient to an expert for further decision making.
	- Thrombosis experts would consider the population "with an unspecified type of VTE" (i.e. without reference to provoked or unprovoked) as theoretical because determining if a clot is provoked or unprovoked is a standard way to stratify the risk of VTE recurrence and hence guide treatment decisions. However, in general clinical practice, which is the setting where thrombophilia testing is frequently performed, VTE is often managed regardless of circumstances qualifying the VTE as provoked or unprovoked (an unspecified type of VTE), and for this reason, the panel decided to address this question.

### Decision theoretical foundations of clinical practice guidelines: An extension of the ASH thrombophilia guidelines [^112ZHNus]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Decision analysis can play an essential role in informing practice guidelines. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) thrombophilia guidelines have made a significant step forward in demonstrating how decision modeling integrated within Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Developing, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology can advance the field of guideline development. Although the ASH model was transparent and understandable, it suffers from certain limitations that may have generated potentially wrong recommendations.

Specifically, the panel considered two models separately: after 3 to 6 months of index venous thromboembolism (VTE), the panel compared thrombophilia testing (A) versus discontinuing anticoagulants (B) and testing (A) versus recommending indefinite anticoagulation to all patients (C), instead of considering all relevant options simultaneously (A vs. B vs. C). Our study aimed to avoid what we refer to as the omitted choice bias by integrating two ASH models into a single unifying threshold decision model.

We analyzed six ASH panel's recommendations related to the testing for thrombophilia in settings of "provoked" versus "unprovoked" VTE and low versus high bleeding risk, totaling twelve recommendations. Our model disagreed with the ASH guideline panels' recommendations in four of the twelve recommendations we considered. By considering all three options simultaneously, our model provided results that would have produced sounder recommendations for patient care. By revisiting the ASH guidelines methodology, we have not only improved the recommendations for thrombophilia but also…

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule in clinically important subgroups: Individual patient data meta-analysis [^116X8Sfc]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

The objective was to assess the accuracy of the Wells rule for excluding deep vein thrombosis and determine if this accuracy applies to different patient subgroups. This was achieved through a meta-analysis of individual patient data.

Data sources included authors from 13 studies (n = 10,002) who provided their datasets, which were then merged into one comprehensive dataset. Eligibility criteria required studies to enroll consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis, score all variables of the Wells rule, and perform an appropriate reference standard.

- **Main outcome measures**: Multilevel logistic regression models, including an interaction term for each subgroup, estimated differences in predicted probabilities of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule. D-dimer testing was also included to assess variations in the ability to exclude deep vein thrombosis when using an unlikely score on the Wells rule combined with a negative D-dimer test result.

The results indicated that overall, increasing scores on the Wells rule correlated with a higher probability of having deep vein thrombosis. Estimated probabilities were almost twofold higher in patients with cancer, those with suspected recurrent events, and to a lesser extent, males. An unlikely score on the Wells rule (≤ 1) combined with a negative D-dimer test result was associated with an extremely low probability of deep vein thrombosis (1.2%, 95% confidence interval 0.7% to 1.8%). This scenario was observed in 29% (95% confidence interval 20% to 40%) of patients, with consistency across subgroups defined by type.

### Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of test accuracy [^112QSwJG]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities can be associated with significant morbidity and may progress to pulmonary embolism and postthrombotic syndrome. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to minimize the risk of these complications. We systematically reviewed the accuracy of diagnostic tests for first-episode and recurrent DVT of the lower extremities, including proximal compression ultrasonography (US), whole leg US, serial US, and high-sensitivity quantitative D-dimer assays. We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for eligible studies, reference lists of relevant reviews, registered trials, and relevant conference proceedings. Two investigators screened and abstracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. We pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review included 43 studies.

- **Sensitivity and specificity estimates**: For any suspected DVT, the pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity of proximal compression US were 90.1% (95% confidence interval, 86.5–92.8) and 98.5% (95% CI, 97.6–99.1), respectively. For whole-leg US, pooled estimates were 94.0% (95% CI, 91.3–95.9) and 97.3% (95% CI, 94.8–98.6). For serial US, pooled estimates were 97.9% (95% CI, 96.0–98.9) and 99.8% (95% CI, 99.3–99.9). For D-dimer, pooled estimates were 96.1% (95% CI, 92.6–98.0) and 35.7% (95% CI, 29.5–42.4). Recurrent DVT studies were not pooled.

Certainty of evidence varied from low to high. This systematic review of current studies highlights important variations in the diagnostic accuracy of different tests for DVT.

### When to suspect hypercoagulability and how to investigate it [^114H3e3w]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, encompassing both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The list of genetic defects that predispose carriers to develop thrombosis has grown significantly in recent years, alongside the assays available to test for them. Consequently, hypercoagulability has become a subject of much discussion. This review highlights issues related to hypercoagulability that pathologists, who are not specialists in coagulation, should be familiar with to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to diagnosing this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care for patients at risk.

### D-dimer as a stand-alone test to rule out deep vein thrombosis [^117Tb8do]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of clinical decision rules, such as the Wells score, in combination with D-dimer to assess the need for objective imaging to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the clinical decision rules have limitations, and the use of D-dimer as a stand-alone test has been suggested.

- **Objective**: We aimed to assess the safety and efficiency of D-dimer as a stand-alone test to rule out DVT in outpatients referred with suspected DVT.

- **Methods**: We collected data from consecutive outpatients referred to our hospital with suspected DVT from 2008 to 2018. D-dimer levels were analyzed using the STA® Liatest® D-Di assay. D-dimer as a stand-alone test was theoretically applied in retrospect, and the number of misdiagnosed events was estimated as if such an approach had been initially used. All patients were followed for three months.

- **Results**: Of 1765 included patients, 293 (16.6%) were diagnosed with DVT. A total of 491 patients (27.8%) had a negative D-dimer (< 500 ng/mL). Of these, nine were diagnosed with DVT, yielding a failure rate for D-dimer as a stand-alone test of 1.8% (95% CI 0.8%-3.5%). The majority of the misdiagnosed patients had distal DVT. In analyses restricted to proximal DVTs, the failure rate was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1%-1.8%). D-dimer as a stand-alone approach reduced the proportion of required ultrasounds from 81.8% to 72.2%.

- **Conclusion**: D-dimer as a stand-alone test may be safe for excluding proximal DVT and reduce the proportion of required ultrasounds. Prospective management studies are needed to confirm our findings.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^113kDbZF]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia, using a panel of tests, would mean that individuals with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis or a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis. A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE or thrombophilia. These recommendations do not address homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types. This recommendation does not consider the time it takes to perform the test and is based on the assumption that thrombophilia test results are available at the time the individual is at risk for VTE because of a minor provoking risk factor. These recommendations refer to testing for all hereditary thrombophilias using a panel of tests.

A separate question in this guideline addressed selective testing only for the known familial thrombophilia type in this population (recommendation 11), and the resulting recommendations are the same. It is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia (recommendation 11) rather than test for the entire panel (recommendation 12) because of the trivial additional number of VTE episodes prevented and major bleeds caused by a strategy of panel testing for all hereditary thrombophilias.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^114iC1r9]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

In July 2021, the draft recommendations were made available on the ASH website for external review by stakeholders, including allied organizations, other medical professionals, patients, and the public. The content was published within a PDF file and an online survey that included structured questions and fields for open comment. The survey was viewed 594 times and completed by 41 individuals. Three letters (or emails) were also received, including one letter signed by 75 individuals. The panel did not change the direction or strength of the recommendations; however, they revised supporting remarks and discussion. The panel then developed this guideline report, which was reviewed by the ASH Guideline Oversight Subcommittee in January 2023, approved by the Committee on Quality on February 22, 2023, and by the ASH officers on March 1, 2023, before being subjected to peer review.

- **How to use these guidelines**: ASH guidelines are primarily intended to help clinicians make decisions about diagnostic strategies and associated management. Other purposes are to inform policy, education, and advocacy, and to state future research needs. They may also be used by patients. These guidelines are not intended to serve or be construed as a standard of care. Clinicians must make decisions based on the clinical presentation of each individual patient, ideally through a shared process that considers the patient's values and preferences with respect to the anticipated outcomes of the chosen option. Decisions may be constrained by the realities of a specific clinical setting.

### A rational approach to coagulation testing [^116ZcNEn]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Quality patient care requires the appropriate selection of laboratory tests. Irrelevant testing must be avoided, whereas pertinent testing is indispensable. The goals of this review are threefold:

- **To describe appropriate coagulation test selection for medical and surgical patients**: Proper selection of coagulation tests can enhance patient outcomes and streamline healthcare processes.

- **To describe appropriate coagulation testing specifically in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19**: The nuances of coagulation testing in COVID-19 patients are crucial due to the unique clotting issues associated with the virus.

- **To define the rational use of anticoagulant monitoring**: Effective monitoring of anticoagulant therapy is vital to balance the prevention of thrombosis and the risk of bleeding.

### Commentary on the 2023 ASH guidelines for thrombophilia testing in venous thromboembolism [^1159v6ps]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

We read with interest the latest American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines addressing thrombophilia testing in patients with venous thromboembolism.

Unfortunately, we believe that the following two significant issues were not addressed:

- **Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria screening**: It is essential to screen for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with atypical sites of thromboses, such as splanchnic or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, where there may be evidence of hemolysis or cytopenias. The guidelines mention PNH only in the context of it causing thrombosis at atypical sites. Although PNH is a rare but severe acquired thrombophilia, up to 10% of patients present with thrombosis, making it a leading cause of death and a significant cause of morbidity. In our practice, a PNH screen is included in thrombophilia testing to avoid potential fatal thrombotic events, an opinion shared by other representative bodies.

- **Thromboprophylaxis in antiphospholipid syndrome**: The guidelines do not sufficiently characterize the limited evidence supporting the use of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in antiphospholipid syndrome. Recent randomized controlled trials favor warfarin over apixaban for thromboprophylaxis. This builds upon previous data suggesting a higher risk of re-thromboses in patients treated with rivaroxaban instead of vitamin K antagonists. Many groups recommend against the use of DOACs in these cases.

### Diagnostic management of clinically suspected acute deep vein thrombosis [^115x37dL]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common disease that may lead to potentially fatal complications, such as pulmonary embolism. In the past decades, several diagnostic tools and algorithms for DVT have been studied. Currently, the combination of a clinical decision rule, D-dimer testing, and compression ultrasonography has proved to be safe and effective for the diagnosis of DVT in the lower extremities. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful as additional or secondary imaging modalities.

This review discusses the elements currently used in making the clinical diagnosis of DVT, including clinical decision rules, D-dimer testing, different imaging investigations, and the appropriate use of these within diagnostic algorithms in patients with clinically suspected DVT. Although knowledge of the options available to diagnose DVT of the lower extremities is well established, there are still unresolved issues, including the optimal diagnosis of recurrent distal DVT.

Additionally, the diagnosis of DVT of the upper extremities will be discussed, including the different imaging modalities and the limitations of these techniques.

### Covid-19 coagulopathy and thrombosis: Analysis of hospital protocols in response to the rapidly evolving pandemic [^114LMUSp]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread to the US, so too did descriptions of an associated coagulopathy and thrombotic complications. Hospitals created institutional protocols for inpatient management of COVID-19 coagulopathy and thrombosis in response to this developing data. We collected and analyzed protocols from 21 US academic medical centers developed between January and May 2020.

We found the greatest consensus on recommendations for heparin-based pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients without contraindications. Protocols differed regarding the incorporation of D-dimer tests, dosing of VTE prophylaxis, indications for post-discharge pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, how to evaluate for VTE, and the use of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. These findings support ongoing efforts to establish international, evidence-based guidelines.

### Discretionary thrombophilia test acquisition and outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism in a real-world clinical setting [^115PzvvY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, affects approximately 300,000 to 600,000 individuals annually in the United States. Patients with VTE are at increased risk for future thromboembolism, with recurrence rates as high as 30% at 10 years. Anticoagulants serve as the backbone of VTE therapy to prevent thromboembolism progression and recurrence. According to guidelines, the duration of anticoagulant therapy depends on the identification of a provoking factor. VTE events in patients without instigating factors are labeled as unprovoked, and prolonged treatment (e.g. > 6 months) is suggested. The failure to identify a VTE precipitant may indicate the possibility of an underlying predisposition to thrombosis, also known as thrombophilia.

Thrombophilia testing is used to identify factors that contribute to a VTE event, to refine the estimated risk of recurrent VTE, and to guide decision-making regarding the duration of anticoagulant therapy in patients without an instigating factor. Currently, there is no consensus concerning the value of thrombophilia testing in VTE, and its use in clinical practice is highly variable. Indeed, thrombophilia testing is commonly obtained in the absence of an indication, ordered in the setting of anticoagulation, and frequently not repeated for confirmation. Consequently, the usefulness of discretionary thrombophilia testing in clinical practice to predict recurrence and direct treatment beyond clinical presentation remains unknown.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^113iT4YF]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

For patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), this thrombophilia guideline has issued two separate recommendations. The guidance depends on whether the standard of care is to discontinue anticoagulant treatment after 3 to 6 months (suggesting to test) or to continue indefinitely (suggesting not to test). This approach is partially consistent with guidelines from the European Stroke Organization. On one hand, they suggest not testing for thrombophilia to prevent recurrent venous thrombosis. On the other hand, they recommend testing patients who have a high probability of carrying severe thrombophilia (i.e. a personal and/or family history of venous thrombosis, a young age at CVT, CVT without a transient or permanent risk factor) to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE). Likewise, for patients with splanchnic venous thrombosis, the recommendations, dependent on the standard of care, are partially consistent with the implicit guidance statement from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) on the duration of anticoagulant treatment, where patients with high-risk thrombophilia are mentioned as likely to benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. The novelty of our statements is not in the recommendations themselves but in the objective way we have used to examine the role of thrombophilia in light of the best available evidence.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^111pNvRP]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Our work has several implications for practice and research:

- **Shared decision making**: For the practicing clinician and for patients, our guideline suggests that shared decision making, covering the pros and cons and the practical implications of thrombophilia testing and the adoption of the associated VTE prevention strategies, may improve the quality of care for individuals with an increased risk of clotting events, particularly if they are at high risk of bleeding or have an indication or preference for hormonal therapy. Implementation of the guideline from this perspective will require educational tools and opportunities, which we strongly recommend being provided by scientific societies and patient organizations.

- **Quality of thrombophilia tests**: It is critical that proper thrombophilia tests are performed by high-quality clinical laboratories. Too often, thrombophilia testing includes tests with no supportive evidence, and too often the laboratory results are reported with insufficient details or interpretation. Training of physicians and laboratory medicine clinicians will be required for a positive impact of the proposed recommendations.

- **Decreasing overdiagnosis**: As the guidelines suggest against thrombophilia testing in many clinical scenarios, overdiagnosis may be decreased.

Finally, more research is urgently needed, particularly large implementation studies comparing the impact, in terms of outcome rates, among management strategies involving or not involving thrombophilia testing.

### A thrombin-driven neural net diagnoses the antiphospholipid syndrome without the need for interruption of anticoagulation [^114KGYmB]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

We have previously utilized a combination of global thrombosis tests and artificial intelligence in a clinical symptom-driven diagnostic approach. In this method, laboratory testing for a prothrombotic phenotype was conducted using the thrombin generation (TG) test. The TG test is known to correlate with thrombosis and distinguishes between patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and healthy individuals. Thrombin dynamics (TD) analysis quantifies the procoagulant and anticoagulant processes that influence thrombin generation. TD analysis indicates that prothrombin conversion (PC) and thrombin inactivation are significantly altered in APS. The accelerated PC suggests a prothrombotic state in patients with APS. Additionally, the activated protein C pathway is less effective in those with APS.

Despite the significant differences in TG dynamics between controls and patients with APS, distinguishing between these populations using a single test is not feasible. Previously, we employed an artificial intelligence approach, specifically neural networking, to develop a model diagnosing patients with APS compared to a control cohort. An artificial neural network, a computational model inspired by the structure of the human brain, consists of a collection of artificial neurons. It can be trained to classify patients based on a database containing each patient's characteristics, including general patient information and laboratory test results. The earlier neural network was trained to distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with APS based on TG and TD data, thereby diagnosing APS.

### International society on thrombosis and haemostasis core curriculum project: Core competencies in laboratory thrombosis and hemostasis [^112SWQje]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Laboratory analyses of blood samples are essential for the diagnostics and therapy monitoring of patients with bleeding and thromboembolic diseases. Following the publication of the core curriculum for clinical thrombosis and hemostasis, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recognized that thrombosis and hemostasis laboratory specialists require distinct competencies that differ from medical doctors working clinically with patients. To address this gap, the ISTH formed a working group of international hemostasis and thrombosis laboratory specialists to develop an evidence-based core curriculum for laboratory specialists.

- **Objective**: This research sought consensus from the international community on core competencies required for laboratory specialists in thrombosis and hemostasis.

- **Methods**: A draft list of 64 competencies was developed, and an online stakeholder survey was circulated electronically to 15,302 ISTH members and contacts in the wider international community. The results were analyzed and used to develop the final approved core curriculum.

- **Results**: Three hundred and thirty responses contained meaningful data, with broad international representation of specialists. No draft competencies were excluded, and 58 were rated as "does" or "shows how". The Leik measure of consensus for most competencies was "moderate" (n = 30) or "fair" (n = 32).

- **Conclusions**: The development of an international core curriculum for laboratory specialists provides a foundation for the development and enhancement of education and quality management of the laboratory.

### Testing children for inherited thrombophilia: More questions than answers [^111Xn8tK]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombotic events in children have become an increasingly common problem, particularly in pediatric tertiary care hospitals. The prevalence of inherited thrombophilia in children who develop thrombosis varies substantially depending on the population. Children who develop thrombosis, as well as those who have not but have a positive family history, are frequently tested for inherited thrombophilia. The clinical utility of performing such tests has been questioned in both adults and children. This review will examine the practice of testing for inherited thrombophilia in children, focusing on the rationale for testing and highlighting areas in which more evidence is needed prior to making strong recommendations. Future studies, many of which are currently being performed or proposed, are necessary to address many of the unanswered questions.

### Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis using the Wells rule in clinically important subgroups: Individual patient data meta-analysis [^1156oiri]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the Wells rule for excluding deep vein thrombosis and whether this accuracy applies to different subgroups of patients.

This research was designed as a meta-analysis of individual patient data. The data sources consisted of datasets provided by authors of 13 studies, encompassing a total of 10,002 patients. These individual patient data were merged into one comprehensive dataset.

The eligibility criteria required studies to enroll consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis, score all variables of the Wells rule, and perform an appropriate reference standard.

- **Main outcome measures**: Multilevel logistic regression models, including an interaction term for each subgroup, were used to estimate differences in predicted probabilities of deep vein thrombosis by the Wells rule. Additionally, D-dimer testing was conducted to assess differences in the ability to exclude deep vein thrombosis using an unlikely score on the Wells rule combined with a negative D-dimer test result.

The results indicated that overall, increasing scores on the Wells rule were associated with an increasing probability of having deep vein thrombosis. Estimated probabilities were nearly twofold higher in patients with cancer and in patients with suspected re-events, and to a lesser extent, in males. An unlikely score on the Wells rule (≤ 1), combined with a negative D-dimer test result, was associated with an extremely low probability of deep vein thrombosis (1.2%, 95% confidence interval 0.7% to 1.8%). This combination occurred in 29% (95% confidence interval 20% to 40%) of patients. These findings were consistent in subgroups defined.

### Assessment of algorithms to identify patients with thrombophilia following venous thromboembolism [^1131KeT5]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Routine testing for thrombophilia following venous thromboembolism (VTE) is controversial. The use of large datasets to study the clinical impact of thrombophilia testing on patterns of care and patient outcomes may enable more efficient analysis of this practice in a wide range of settings. We set out to examine how accurately algorithms using International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes and/or pharmacy data reflect laboratory-confirmed thrombophilia diagnoses.

- **Materials and methods**: A random sample of adult Kaiser Permanente Colorado patients diagnosed with unprovoked VTE between January 2004 and December 2010 underwent medical record abstraction of thrombophilia test results. Algorithms using "ICD-9" (positive if a thrombophilia ICD-9 code was present), "Extended anticoagulation (AC)" (positive if AC therapy duration was > 6 months), and "ICD-9 & Extended AC" (positive for both) criteria to identify possible thrombophilia cases were tested. Using positive thrombophilia laboratory results as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value of each algorithm were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: In our cohort of 636 patients, sensitivities were low (< 50%) for each algorithm. "ICD-9" yielded the highest PPV (41.5%, 95% CI 26.3–57.9%) and a high specificity (95.9%, 95% CI 94.0–97.4%). "Extended AC" had the highest sensitivity but lowest specificity, and "ICD-9 & Extended AC" had the highest specificity but lowest sensitivity.

- **Conclusions**: ICD-9 codes for thrombophilia were found to have low sensitivity in identifying patients following VTE.

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be used in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer is also used as part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, there are no robust data available at present on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in a hospital inpatient. Considerable confusion also exists among physicians about its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^1138hsiC]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision-making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations.

Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely to…

### Deep venous thrombosis [^113PaYQ1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: Thrombophilia testing [^116T4dHH]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

The contribution of these ASH guidelines to the broader realm of treatment and prevention of VTE is to ensure that a patient-centered, individualized approach is adopted whenever appropriate. Although establishing unbiased estimates of the effect of specific antithrombotic treatments requires large RCTs, these same trials often do not furnish sufficiently detailed evidence to optimize who should be treated. The ultimate goal is to minimize the number needed to treat, thereby avoiding the treatment of patients who will not benefit, while not denying treatment to those who will.

To achieve this overarching goal of determining whether thrombophilia testing could lead to better individualized treatment, we believe the value of testing lies in driving subsequent treatment decisions. Our approach to appraising the value of thrombophilia testing involves combining prevalence data (the likelihood of an individual having thrombophilia), risk association data (the likelihood of an event occurring in individuals with or without thrombophilia), and measures of treatment effect (the impact on VTE reduction and bleeding events in patients with thrombophilia versus those without). Our panel ultimately focused on the number of events prevented or provoked by adopting a personalized treatment approach for patients with a positive thrombophilia result across various clinical scenarios. Notably, we also considered cost, feasibility, and acceptability.

### Comparing the diagnostic performance of 2 clinical decision rules to rule out deep vein thrombosis in primary care patients [^114K9Pdf]. Annals of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Wells rule is widely used for clinical assessment of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially in the secondary care setting. Recently, a new clinical decision rule for primary care patients, the primary care rule, has been proposed because the Wells rule is not sufficient to rule out DVT in this setting. The objective was to compare the ability of both rules to safely rule out DVT and to efficiently reduce the number of referrals for leg ultrasound investigation that would result in a negative finding.

Family physicians collected data on 1,086 patients to calculate the scores for both decision rules before leg ultrasonography was performed. In all patients, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) testing was performed using a rapid point-of-care assay. Patients were stratified into risk categories defined by each rule and the D-dimer result. Outcomes were DVT (diagnosed by ultrasonography) and venous thromboembolic complications or death caused by a possible thromboembolic event during a 90-day follow-up period. We calculated the differences between the two rules in the number of missed diagnoses and the proportions of patients that needed ultrasound testing.

Data from 1,002 eligible patients were used for this analysis. A venous thromboembolic event occurred during follow-up in 7 patients with a low score and negative D-dimer finding, both with the Wells rule (7 of 447; 1.6%; 95% confidence interval, 0.7%-3.3%) and the primary care rule (7 of 495; 1.4%; 95% CI, 0.6%-3.0%). Using the Wells rule, 447 patients (45%) would…

### American society of hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^112Rwnvz]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

In families of patients with VTE, people often ask whether it is useful to test asymptomatic relatives for thrombophilia. As discussed in the "Introduction", the relevant question and aim of the guideline is to assess whether thrombophilia testing and tailoring management to the test result would improve patient-important outcomes. For instance, should an asymptomatic relative with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis during minor VTE-provoking risk episodes that generally do not require prophylaxis, such as immobility or minor injury, illness, or infection?

For women, should their thrombophilia status affect choices about hormonal contraception or dictate a need for prophylaxis around pregnancy and the postpartum period? In addition, sometimes hereditary thrombophilia is known in a family without anyone having experienced VTE. Examples of such clinical scenarios are testing for thrombophilia in women with recurrent miscarriage or other pregnancy complications, in young patients with arterial thrombosis, or population testing. The question is whether asymptomatic relatives of someone known to have thrombophilia would benefit from thrombophilia testing.

### Discretionary thrombophilia test acquisition and outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism in a real-world clinical setting [^111H4Rwe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The rate of abnormal results may also reflect false-positive results related to the testing of inpatients during the acute event or later when patients are treated with anticoagulants at the time of testing. Furthermore, thrombophilia testing may not have sufficient discriminatory power to aid in risk assessment. As testing improves by becoming more accurate and removing conditions that affect the test, new tests such as exome sequencing and polygenic risk scores may provide direction and be independent of the timing of test acquisition.

Our finding that more than half of testing occurred within 180 days of a VTE event is consistent with the findings of others. It is important to note that this study is not designed to assess the value of any specific component of the thrombophilia panel. The study was performed to assess the impact on outcomes of indiscriminate use of thrombophilia testing by clinicians and their response to the results; therefore, we included all testing, including possible false-positive or inappropriately timed thrombophilia testing, in the analysis to reflect the real-world use of these tests.

### Appropriate use of venous imaging and analysis of the D-dimer/clinical probability testing paradigm in the diagnosis and location of deep venous thrombosis [^113Wiwme]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The D-dimer (DD) level, combined with the pretest Wells criteria probability (WCP) score, can safely exclude deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The objective of this study was to examine the correlation between DD results alongside the WCP score with findings on venous duplex ultrasound (VDU). The hypothesis is that VDU remains overutilized in low-risk patients with negative DD and that higher DD levels may correlate with thrombus burden and location.

- **Methods**: Patients who presented to a high-volume tertiary care center with lower limb swelling, with or without associated pain, were retrospectively examined through June and July for four consecutive years (2012 to 2015). After calculating WCP, patients were divided into low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories. Electronic DD results utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, WCP data, and VDU analysis data were merged and analyzed based on a receiver operator characteristic curve to determine the DD cutoff point for each WCP. An abnormal DD with an average value ≥ 0.6 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEUs) was correlated to positive DVT to differentiate proximal DVT (above the popliteal vein) from distal DVT (below the popliteal vein).

- **Results**: Data of 1,909 patients were analyzed, and 239 (12.5%) patients were excluded secondary to serial repeat visits or follow-ups, surveillance screens, and if they had a previous history of DVT. The average age was 62.1 ± 16.3 years, with more women (55.7%), and the majority presented with limb pain and edema (87%). DD studies were ordered and completed in 202 patients and correlated with all positive findings on venous duplex ultrasound.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AgJ5q]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

- **Target conditions**: The target conditions were acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Suspected PE is usually defined as acute onset of new or worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, with or without hemoptysis, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, low blood pressure, or fainting, without an obvious explanation. Suspected DVT is indicated by unilateral lower limb pain and/or edema, without an obvious explanation.

- **Reference standards**: The reference standard was a final confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis by validated imaging tests (positive reference standards) used within venous thromboembolism (VTE) diagnostic algorithms. For PE, this includes lower limb venous compression ultrasound (CUS), ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and pulmonary angiography; for DVT, lower limb venous CUS is used. The negative reference standard involved the rate of VTE events observed during the 3-month clinical follow-up.

- **Data sources and searches**: Studies using VTE diagnostic algorithms, including D-dimer to rule out the diagnosis of PE and/or DVT in pregnant women, were systematically searched using the MEDLINE (1966 to June 2021, week 1) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2021, week 1) electronic databases. The search strategy was developed without any language restriction using the keywords: "venous thromboembolism" OR "lung embolism" OR "deep vein thrombosis" AND "pregnancy" OR "puerperium" AND "D-dimer". We supplemented our search by manually reviewing the reference lists of all retrieved articles, clinicalTrials.gov, and reference literature (guidelines and systematic reviews), and we consulted experts in VTE diagnostic strategies for possible missing studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Details on data collection and subsequent analysis were not provided in the excerpt.

### Approach to the patient with COVID-19-associated thrombosis: A case-based review [^115LuBdy]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Alongside its potential to cause severe respiratory illness, studies have reported a distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy that is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and slight prolongation of the prothrombin time. Studies have also reported increased rates of thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19, but variations in study methodologies, patient populations, and anticoagulation strategies make it challenging to distill implications for clinical practice. Here, we present a practical review of literature and use a case-based format to discuss the diagnostic approach and management of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.

- **Implications for practice**: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, and increased rates of thromboembolism. Management guidelines are based on limited evidence from retrospective studies that should be interpreted carefully. At this time, all hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should receive coagulation test surveillance and standard doses of prophylactic anticoagulation until prospective randomized controlled trials yield definitive information in support of higher prophylactic doses.
