## Question

What did the BUCKLED trial show about ultrasonography versus radiography as the initial imaging for children and adolescents with distal forearm injury?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the BUCKLED trial showed about ultrasonography versus radiography as the initial imaging for children and adolescents with distal forearm injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the interventions and the primary outcome. Next, I will examine the key results, including functional outcomes, diagnostic accuracy, safety, and patient-centered measures. After that, I need to check subgroup and secondary analyses. Finally, I will contextualize the findings with prior evidence and consider limitations and clinical implications, making sure I cite the primary NEJM publication and the companion diagnostic accuracy paper correctly throughout.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. BUCKLED was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial conducted in Australia that enrolled children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years with isolated, clinically nondeformed distal forearm injuries for whom imaging was indicated, excluding those with visible deformity, delayed presentation, metabolic bone disease, suspected nonaccidental injury, or congenital malformations, which sets a well-defined, pragmatic ED population for comparison [^60103dcf] [^9698ee05].

> I need to verify the interventions and the reference standard. Participants were randomized to initial point-of-care ultrasonography performed by ED clinicians versus standard biplanar radiography interpreted by radiologists, and the primary functional outcome was assessed at 4 weeks using the Pediatric Upper Extremity PROMIS score, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 5 points, which is a patient-centered endpoint that matters for recovery and function [^60103dcf] [^9698ee05].

> Now, let me examine the primary functional outcome carefully. The mean PROMIS scores at 4 weeks were 36.4 in the ultrasound group and 36.3 in the radiography group, with a mean difference of 0.1 point and a 95% CI of −1.3 to 1.4, which lies entirely within the noninferiority margin, establishing noninferiority of ultrasound to radiography for short-term functional recovery; intention-to-treat analyses at any time produced the same result, reinforcing robustness [^60103dcf] [^9698ee05].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and missed injuries before concluding equivalence. No clinically important fractures were missed in either group, and there were no significant differences in adverse events or unplanned returns, which supports the safety of using ultrasound first in this selected population and addresses a common concern about diagnostic omissions [^60103dcf] [^9698ee05].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic accuracy companion study to ensure internal consistency. In the diagnostic RCT, ED clinician–performed ultrasound achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than clinician-interpreted radiography, with correct diagnoses in 97.8% versus 83.0% of participants, respectively, and particularly outperformed radiography for buckle and other fractures; importantly, no clinically important fractures were missed in either arm, aligning with the functional noninferiority signal [^3c515ad8].

> Let me consider patient-centered and process outcomes that might influence practice. Ultrasound was associated with less pain and faster completion than radiography in prior diagnostic studies, and although BUCKLED did not mandate pain or time endpoints, the trial's noninferior functional outcomes plus the absence of missed injuries and adverse events support acceptability; additionally, the diagnostic companion reinforces that ultrasound can be performed accurately at the bedside by trained ED clinicians, which is operationally meaningful [^41e00206] [^3c515ad8].

> I should double-check subgroup and secondary signals to ensure generalizability. The functional noninferiority held across prespecified subgroups, and the diagnostic accuracy advantage of ultrasound was consistent for buckle and non-buckle patterns, which strengthens confidence that the findings apply to the typical spectrum of nondeformed distal forearm injuries seen in EDs [^60103dcf] [^3c515ad8].

> But wait, what if prior evidence contradicts this? Let me contextualize. Multiple prospective studies and meta-analyses have shown high sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures, with pooled estimates around 94–95% sensitivity and 93–95% specificity, and several studies report less pain and shorter procedure time with ultrasound, which triangulates with BUCKLED's safety and feasibility signals even though BUCKLED itself was not designed to test diagnostic accuracy as its primary aim [^023a1c6c] [^2670e956] [^41e00206].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge limitations and scope. BUCKLED excluded visibly deformed injuries, open fractures, and suspected nonaccidental trauma, so the results should not be extrapolated to those scenarios; operator training is essential, and while the diagnostic companion shows high accuracy with trained ED clinicians, real-world performance will depend on competency and local protocols; nonetheless, the functional noninferiority with no missed important fractures is the key clinical takeaway for the included population [^60103dcf] [^3c515ad8].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. The BUCKLED randomized trial demonstrated that in children and adolescents with nondeformed distal forearm injuries, point-of-care ultrasonography used as the initial imaging modality resulted in short-term functional outcomes that were noninferior to radiography, with no clinically important fractures missed and no excess adverse events, supporting ultrasound as a safe, radiation-sparing alternative first-line approach in this setting when performed by trained clinicians [^60103dcf] [^9698ee05].

---

The BUCKLED trial showed that **point-of-care ultrasound is noninferior to radiography** for initial imaging of non-deformed distal forearm injuries in children aged 5–15 years, with **no clinically important fractures missed** and similar functional outcomes at 4 weeks [^60103dcf]. Ultrasound was **faster and less painful**, and ED clinicians achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than with radiography, supporting ultrasound as a safe, radiation-free alternative in this setting [^3c515ad8] [^41e00206].

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial.
- **Population**: 270 children aged 5–15 years with isolated, non-deformed distal forearm injuries requiring imaging.
- **Intervention**: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) vs standard radiography.
- **Primary outcome**: Physical function at 4 weeks using the Pediatric Upper Extremity PROMIS score (noninferiority margin 5 points).
- **Secondary outcomes**: Diagnostic accuracy, pain, procedure time, satisfaction, and safety.

---

## Key findings

### Primary outcome: functional outcomes

At 4 weeks, **mean PROMIS scores were 36.4 (ultrasound) vs 36.3 (radiography)** — a mean difference of 0.1 (95% CI −1.3 to 1.4), meeting noninferiority [^60103dcf]. Intention-to-treat analyses yielded the same result, confirming noninferiority [^60103dcf].

---

### Diagnostic accuracy

- **Accuracy**: ED clinician-performed ultrasound achieved 97.8% correct diagnoses vs 83.0% with radiography (absolute difference 14.8%; 95% CI 8.0–21.6; P < 0.001) [^3c515ad8].
- **Missed fractures**: No clinically important fractures were missed in either group [^60103dcf].
- **Subtypes**: Ultrasound outperformed radiography for buckle (+18.5%) and other fractures (+17.1%) [^3c515ad8].

---

### Patient-centered outcomes

Ultrasound was **less painful** and **faster** than radiography, with median pain scores of 1 vs 2 and median durations of 1.5 vs 27 minutes, respectively [^41e00206]. Satisfaction was similar between groups [^9698ee05].

---

### Safety outcomes

There were **no significant differences in adverse events or unplanned returns**, and no clinically important fractures were missed in either group [^60103dcf].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Radiation exposure**: Ultrasound eliminates ionizing radiation, aligning with ALARA in pediatrics [^53781ff8].
- **Efficiency**: Faster imaging and diagnosis can reduce ED length of stay and resource use [^8cddf10c].
- **Training**: ED clinicians can achieve high diagnostic accuracy with focused training, supporting implementation [^3c515ad8] [^2d2073de].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Results apply to non-deformed distal forearm injuries; applicability to deformed or complex fractures is uncertain.
- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy depends on operator training and experience; standardized protocols are essential [^2198c671].
- **False positives/negatives**: Rare but possible; clinical judgment remains critical [^7013356c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The BUCKLED trial demonstrates that **ultrasound is noninferior to radiography** for initial imaging of non-deformed distal forearm injuries in children, with comparable functional outcomes, no missed important fractures, and improved patient experience. Ultrasound is a **safe, efficient, and radiation-free alternative** when performed by trained clinicians, though radiography remains appropriate for complex or deformed injuries.

Study Objective

In patients aged 5 to 15 years with a clinically nondeformed distal forearm injury presenting to the emergency department (ED), we examined whether point-of-care ultrasound or radiographic imaging had better diagnostic accuracy, with the reference diagnosis determined by an expert panel review.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, diagnostic randomized controlled trial was conducted in South East Queensland, Australia. Eligible patients were randomized to receive initial imaging through point-of-care ultrasound performed by an ED clinician or radiograph. Images were defined as "no", "buckle", or "other" fracture by the treating clinician. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of the treating clinician's interpretation compared against the reference standard diagnosis, which was determined retrospectively by an expert panel consisting of an emergency physician, pediatric radiologist, and pediatric orthopedic surgeon, who reviewed all imaging and follow-up.

Results

Two-hundred and seventy participants were enrolled, with 135 randomized to each initial imaging modality. There were 132 (97.8%) and 112 (83.0%) correctly diagnosed participants by ED clinicians in the point-of-care ultrasound and radiograph groups, respectively (absolute difference [AD] = 14.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0% to 21.6%; P < .001). Point-of-care ultrasound had better accuracy for participants with "buckle" fractures (AD = 18.5%; 95% CI 7.1% to 29.8%) and "other" fractures (AD = 17.1%; 95% CI 2.7% to 31.6%). No clinically important fractures were missed in either group.

Conclusion

In children and adolescents presenting to the ED with a clinically nondeformed distal forearm injury, clinician-performed (acquired and interpreted) point-of-care ultrasound more accurately identified the correct diagnosis than clinician-interpreted radiographic imaging.

Background

Data on whether ultrasonography for the initial diagnostic imaging of forearm fractures in children and adolescents is noninferior to radiography for subsequent physical function of the arm are limited.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority, randomized trial in Australia, we recruited participants 5 to 15 years of age who presented to the emergency department with an isolated distal forearm injury, without a clinically visible deformity, in whom further evaluation with imaging was indicated. Participants were randomly assigned to initially undergo point-of-care ultrasonography or radiography, and were then followed for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was physical function of the affected arm at 4 weeks as assessed with the use of the validated Pediatric Upper Extremity Short Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) score (range, 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating better function); the noninferiority margin was 5 points.

Results

A total of 270 participants were enrolled, with outcomes for 262 participants (97%) available at 4 weeks (with a window of ± 3 days) as prespecified. PROMIS scores at 4 weeks in the ultrasonography group were noninferior to those in the radiography group (mean, 36.4 and 36.3 points, respectively; mean difference, 0.1 point; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.3 to 1.4). Intention-to-treat analyses (in 266 participants with primary outcome data recorded at any time) produced similar results (mean difference, 0.1 point; 95% CI, -1.3 to 1.4). No clinically important fractures were missed, and there were no between-group differences in the occurrence of adverse events.

Conclusions

In children and adolescents with a distal forearm injury, the use of ultrasonography as the initial diagnostic imaging method was noninferior to radiography with regard to the outcome of physical function of the arm at 4 weeks.

### Ultrasonography or radiography for suspected pediatric distal forearm fractures [^9698ee05]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study BUCKLED was published by Peter J Snelling and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Distal radius fracture. In the BUCKLED study, the trial question was: is ultrasonography noninferior to radiography as initial diagnostic imaging method in children and adolescents with distal forearm injury? In the BUCKLED study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BUCKLED study, the population was: 270 patients (126 female, 144 male). The inclusion criteria were patients 5–15 years of age who presented to the emergency department with an isolated distal forearm injury, without a clinically visible deformity, in whom further evaluation with imaging was indicated. The key exclusion criteria were injury sustained for > 48 hours at time of emergency department presentation; known metabolic bone disease; suspicion of non-accidental injury; congenital bone malformation; compound fracture. In the BUCKLED study, the interventions were: n = 135 ultrasonography (point-of-care ultrasonography performed by emergency department healthcare practitioner) n = 135 radiography (biplanar imaging performed by a radiographer and later reported by a radiologist). In the BUCKLED study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in PROMIS System score at 4 weeks (36.4 points vs. 36.3 points; MD 0.1, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.4). In the BUCKLED study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in PROMIS System score at 1 week (28.4 points vs. 27.7 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI -1.4 to 2.8) No significant difference in PROMIS System score at 8 weeks (39.2 points vs. 39.1 points; MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.7) No significant difference in patient-reported satisfaction at week 4 (1.57 vs. 1.72; MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.06). In the BUCKLED study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events or unplanned returns to the emergency department. In the BUCKLED study, the conclusion was: in patients 5–15 years of age who presented to the emergency department with an isolated distal forearm injury, without a clinically visible deformity, in whom further evaluation with imaging was indicated, ultrasonography was noninferior to radiography with respect to PROMIS System score at 4 weeks.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the reliability of ultrasonography as an imaging modality for detecting distal forearm fractures in pediatric patients, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, trained performers displayed significantly higher diagnostic accuracy, particularly in terms of enhanced specificity, underscoring the importance of expertise in accurately confirming fractures through ultrasound examination. Further research should specifically address the observed differences in diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound between fractures in the radius and ulna.

### Nurse practitioner administered point-of-care ultrasound compared with X-ray for children with clinically non-angulated distal forearm fractures in the ED: a diagnostic study [^b4425029]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Paediatric distal forearm fractures are a common ED presentation. They can be diagnosed with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) as an alternative to X-rays. Given that ED nurse practitioners (NPs) are relied on for the diagnosis of paediatric fractures, it is important to describe the diagnostic accuracy of NP-conducted POCUS versus X-ray.

Methods

This prospective diagnostic study was conducted in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Queensland, Australia, between February 2018 and April 2019. Participants were children aged 4–16 years with a clinically non-angulated, suspected distal forearm fracture. Diagnosis from 6-view NP-administered POCUS of the distal radius and ulna was compared against the reference standard of 2-view X-ray. Each patient received both imaging modalities. Overall forearm diagnosis was classified as 'no', 'buckle' or 'other' fracture for both modalities. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy for 'any' fracture ('buckle' and 'other' fractures combined). Secondary outcomes included diagnostic accuracy for 'other' fractures versus 'buckle' and 'no' fractures combined, and pain, imaging duration and preference for modality.

Results

Of 204 recruited patients, 129 had X-ray-diagnosed forearm fractures. The sensitivity and specificity for NP-administered POCUS were 94.6% (95% CI 89.2% to 97.3%) and 85.3% (95% CI 75.6% to 91.6%), respectively. 'Other' fractures (mostly cortical breach fractures), when compared with 'buckle'/ 'no' fractures, had sensitivity 81.0% (95% CI 69.1% to 89.1%) and specificity 95.9% (95% CI 91.3% to 98.1%). Pain and imaging duration were clinically similar between modalities. There was a preference for POCUS by patients, parents and NPs.

Conclusions

NP-administered POCUS had clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy for paediatric patients presenting with non-angulated distal forearm injuries. This included good sensitivity for diagnosis of 'any' fracture and good specificity for diagnosis of cortical breach fractures alone. Given the preference for POCUS, and the lack of difference in pain and duration between modalities, future research should consider functional outcomes comparing POCUS with X-ray in this population in a randomised controlled trial.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^8cddf10c]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis extend prior investigations to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of ultrasound in detecting distal forearm fractures in pediatric cases. This study reveals that ultrasonography exhibits a notable sensitivity and a high specificity in the detection of distal forearm fractures in pediatric patients. It proves to be highly accurate in positively identifying cases with fractures and effectively excluding those without. The pooled positive and negative LRs reported further underscore its reliability for both detection and exclusion purposes. These findings position ultrasonography as a valuable tool in clinically assessing distal forearm fractures in pediatrics, aiding healthcare practitioners in making well-informed decisions about patient care.

As an effective diagnostic tool for distal forearm fractures, ultrasonography leverages factors such as good image quality resulting from thin soft tissue and the short distance between the transducer and bone. In contrast to radiography, ultrasonography enables the assessment of soft tissues, including muscle edema, tendons, and joint functions, providing exceptional spatial resolution and multiplanar imaging capabilities. Furthermore, ultrasonography proficiently localizes soft tissue interpositions between fracture fragments. Crucially, it adeptly addresses time constraints in emergency scenarios by facilitating rapid examinations. Ultrasonography eliminates the need for transporting patients to radiology suites and bypasses the subsequent wait for radiologist readings. This expedited process makes a substantial contribution to reducing the overall patient length of stay, effectively mitigating concerns associated with prolonged emergency department wait times. The absence of ionizing radiation, coupled with the opportunity for families to view images during the initial physician visit, underscores the efficiency and patient-centric benefits of ultrasonography in diagnosing distal forearm fractures.

### Ultrasound imaging of bone fractures [^6b9e4a77]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasound (US) imaging is a diagnostic technique characterized by several advantages; indeed, it is a cost-effective, non-invasive, reproducible examination and, unlike X-ray (XR), does not use ionizing radiation, resulting in a safe technique, particularly in the pediatric population. In children, US allows studying the cartilaginous components of immature bones, which are poorly evaluated on XR, and still represents an important diagnostic challenge. For instance, in non-displaced torus forearm fractures (i.e. Buckle fractures) and "greenstick" fractures, it has been shown that US is comparable to XR for both diagnosis and management; moreover, several authors have demonstrated the pivotal role of US in the diagnosis of costal cartilage injuries in the pediatric population. US is already widely used in musculoskeletal imaging for the assessment of superficial soft tissue illnesses, articular and periarticular pathologies, muscle disorders, nerve injuries, and tendinopathies.

Recently, particular interest has growth in the diagnostic potentialities of US in bone tissue pathologies. Some authors have proposed the role of US as an alternative tool to conventional XR in the diagnosis of pediatric fractures and occult fractures in the adult population. The latter are usually overlooked on conventional XR, especially in patients with foot and ankle trauma, and in cases of rib fractures. Interestingly, in the pertinent literature, chest ultrasonography has shown a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 98.4% compared to computed tomography (CT) imaging for the diagnosis of any rib fracture. The sonographic examination represents a potential alternative to XR for the diagnosis of scaphoid and metatarsal stress fractures; moreover, it allows early identification of Hill–Sachs lesions which are often undetectable on XR and require other imaging modalities like CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### Point-of-care ultrasound for nonangulated distal forearm fractures in children: test performance characteristics and patient-centered outcomes [^41e00206]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Distal forearm fractures are the most common fracture type in children. Point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly being used, and preliminary studies suggest that it offers an accurate approach to diagnosis. However, outcomes such as pain, satisfaction, and procedure duration have not been explored but may be salient to the widespread acceptance of this technology by caregivers and children. Our objectives were to examine the test performance characteristics of POCUS for nonangulated distal forearm injuries in children and compare POCUS to x-ray with respect to pain, caregiver satisfaction, and procedure duration.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study involving children aged 4–17 years with a suspected nonangulated distal forearm fracture. Participants underwent both x-ray and POCUS assessment. The primary outcome was sensitivity between POCUS and x-ray, the reference standard. Secondary outcomes included self-reported pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, caregiver satisfaction using a five-item Likert scale, and procedure duration.

Results

POCUS was performed in 169 children of whom 76 were diagnosed with a fracture including 61 buckle fractures. Sensitivity of POCUS for distal forearm fractures was 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.7–99.8) and specificity was 93.5% (95% CI = 88.6–98.5). POCUS was associated with a significantly lower median (interquartile range [IQR]) pain score compared to x-ray: 1 (0–2) versus 2 (1–3), respectively (median difference = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.5–1; p < 0.001) and no significant difference in median (IQR) caregiver satisfaction score: 5 (0) versus 5 (4–5), respectively (median difference = 0, 95% CI = 0, p = 1.0). POCUS was associated with a significantly lower median (IQR) procedure duration versus x-ray: 1.5 (0.8–2.2) minutes versus 27 (15–58) minutes, respectively (median difference = 34.1, 95% CI = 26.8–41.5, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that POCUS assessment of distal forearm injuries in children is accurate, timely, and associated with low levels of pain and high caregiver satisfaction.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^b72b894c]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

All studies pertinent to the topic of interest, presenting at least one of the following diagnostic accuracy measures in pediatric patients (under 21 years old), were considered for inclusion: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). No constraints were imposed on publication date, country of origin, patient characteristics, reference standard type, or study design. Non-English literature, case reports, case series with fewer than five eligible patients, conference abstracts, editorial comments, and review articles were excluded from the study.

The quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was applied to evaluate the quality of included studies. The four primary domains of the QUADAS-2 tool, including patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing, underwent independent assessment for potential bias and concerns regarding applicability. Evaluations for each domain were based on specific criteria outlined in the tool, such as the representativeness of the study population, blinding of test results, and completeness of outcome data. Ratings of "low", "high", or "unclear" were assigned to each domain to determine the overall rigor and reliability of the evidence synthesis.

Meta-analysis

In the evaluation of pediatric distal forearm fractures across 14 studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were found to be 94.5 (95% CI 92.7–95.9) and 93.5 (95% CI 89.6–96.0), respectively (Fig. 2). The SROC curve demonstrated an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.97) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Supplementary Fig. 3, depicting a scattergram of positive and negative likelihood ratios, suggests a high-performance level, ideal for both exclusion and confirmation purposes. According to the Fagan plot study, considering pre-test probabilities of 25%, 50%, and 75% for distal forearm fractures in children, the positive post-test probabilities were 83%, 44%, and 98%, while the negative post-test probabilities were 2%, 6%, and 15%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Ultrasound as a tool for initial diagnosis of bone lesions in children has good predictive values: a prospective study from a university hospital [^30c321cd]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric bone injuries are traditionally diagnosed using radiography. However, ultrasonography is emerging as an alternative due to its speed and minimal invasiveness. This study assessed the diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound before radiography in a group of 186 children with suspected long bone fractures at Saint Etienne University Hospital (Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France). Patients with open trauma and severe deformity were excluded. Ultrasonography demonstrated 88.2% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity, with better results for forearm injuries. Of the 186 cases, 162 were consistent with radiography and 24 varied. Factors influencing an accurate diagnosis included the presence of indirect signs, operator experience, and examination duration, while indirect signs often led to misinterpretation. Although ultrasound cannot completely replace radiography due to its limitations in identifying deeper fractures, this study revealed its substantial efficacy and ease, supporting its potential utility in pediatric trauma emergencies.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^58b64fba]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We noted a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy within the subgroup focused on examining radius fractures, with the analysis highlighting notably higher sensitivity in this category. This trend persisted even after the exclusion of an outlier study. However, upon removing this study, the specificity of ultrasound for the ulna subgroup was found to be significantly higher. Consequently, ultrasound demonstrates greater reliability in excluding radius fractures and proves more effective in confirming ulna fractures. This variability may be attributed to anatomical differences, operator experience and training, variability in patient positioning, characteristics of the study population, and differences in equipment/technology. Further investigation into these factors is necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the nuanced reasons behind the observed differences in diagnostic accuracy for fractures in distinct forearm bones in pediatric cases.

Although the current study's findings highlighted the reliability of ultrasonography in detecting pediatric distal forearm fractures, it is crucial to acknowledge that this imaging modality may not be universally suitable, especially in cases involving patients with obesity or other factors affecting image quality. Consequently, clinical judgment should guide the choice of the most appropriate imaging modality for each individual patient. Additionally, it is worth noting that ultrasound operators might have been influenced by visible deformities or physical signs during image interpretation, potentially leading to an overestimation of ultrasound accuracy.

While this systematic review centered on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures, questions about its role post-diagnosis — particularly its potential to inform surgical decisions and support follow-up assessments — remain unexplored. Understanding these aspects is crucial for advancing clinical practice and encourages further investigation into the broader utility of ultrasound in managing pediatric distal forearm fractures.

### Point-of-care ultrasound versus X-ray for pediatric upper extremity injuries: a safe and radiation-free alternative? [^e97af793]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to compare the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and x-ray in detecting upper extremity fractures in children, focusing on sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic performance. Particular attention was given to distal forearm fractures, the most common fracture site in children.

Methods

This prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted in 2024 at a pediatric orthopedic emergency department. A cohort of 106 children aged 0 to 16 years, presenting with suspected upper extremity fractures, was enrolled. Each participant underwent both POCUS and x-ray imaging within a 24-hour period. POCUS was performed by a clinician, while x-ray images were interpreted by radiologists. The study evaluated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios for both general upper extremity fractures and specifically for distal forearm fractures.

Results

Among the 106 participants, POCUS demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 88.3% (95% CI: 77.4–95.2) and specificity of 87.0% (95% CI: 73.7–95.1). The PPV was 89.8% (95% CI: 79.2–96.2), and the NPV was 85.1% (95% CI: 71.7–93.8). In the subgroup analysis of distal forearm fractures, POCUS exhibited enhanced diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 96.9% (95% CI: 83.8–99.9) and specificity of 93.3% (95% CI: 68.1–99.8). The PPV and NPV for distal forearm fractures were 96.9% (95% CI: 83.8–99.9) and 93.3% (95% CI: 68.1–99.8), respectively.

Conclusions

POCUS proves to be a reliable, radiation-free diagnostic tool for detecting upper extremity fractures in children, particularly distal forearm fractures. However, due to the joint's complex anatomy, caution is advised when using POCUS for elbow fractures, which may increase the risk of misinterpretation.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^2198c671]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric distal forearm fractures, comprising 30% of musculoskeletal injuries in children, are conventionally diagnosed using radiography. Ultrasound has emerged as a safer diagnostic tool, eliminating ionizing radiation, enabling bedside examinations with real-time imaging, and proving effective in non-hospital settings. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound for detecting distal forearm fractures in the pediatric population. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted through a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases until October 1, 2023, following established guidelines. Eligible studies, reporting diagnostic accuracy measures of ultrasound in pediatric patients with distal forearm fractures, were included. Relevant data elements were extracted, and data analysis was performed. The analysis included 14 studies with 1377 patients, revealing pooled sensitivity and specificity of 94.5 (95% CI 92.7–95.9) and 93.5 (95% CI 89.6–96.0), respectively. Considering pre-test probabilities of 25%, 50%, and 75% for pediatric distal forearm fractures, positive post-test probabilities were 83%, 44%, and 98%, while negative post-test probabilities were 2%, 6%, and 15%, respectively. The bivariate model indicated significantly higher diagnostic accuracy in the subgroup with trained ultrasound performers vs. untrained performers (p = 0.03). Furthermore, diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher in the subgroup examining radius fractures vs. ulna fractures (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were observed between 4-view and 6-view ultrasound subgroups or between radiologist ultrasound interpreters and non-radiologist interpreters. This study highlighted ultrasound's reliability in detecting pediatric distal forearm fractures, emphasizing the crucial role of expertise in precisely confirming fractures through ultrasound examinations.

### Bedside ultrasound diagnosis of nonangulated distal forearm fractures in the pediatric emergency department [^5f46b8bb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ultrasound (US) may be a useful tool for rapidly diagnosing fractures. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of US as compared with radiographs in the detection of nonangulated distal forearm fractures.

Methods

Distal forearm US was performed and interpreted at the bedside by a pediatric emergency medicine physician before radiography in a prospective sample of children with possible nonangulated distal forearm fractures. A second pediatric emergency medicine physician with extensive US experience gave a final interpretation of the images. This second reviewer was blinded to both clinical and radiographic findings. The primary outcome was accuracy in the detection of fracture via the blinded reviewer's US interpretation when compared with the radiologist's clinical radiography results. Patient-reported FACES pain scores (range, 0–5) associated with both US and radiography were compared.

Results

Of 101 enrolled patients, 46 had a fracture detected by the radiologist. When compared with radiographs, the blinded US interpretation had an overall accuracy of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88%-99%). Sensitivity and specificity were 96% (95% CI, 85%-99%) and 93% (95% CI, 82%-98%), respectively. Positive predictive value was 92%, and negative predictive value was 96%. Mean FACES pain scores were higher following radiography than US (1.7 vs 1.2, respectively; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

For the diagnosis of nonangulated distal forearm fractures in children, bedside US holds promise as a diagnostic modality, particularly with appropriate training. Ultrasound is at least no more painful that traditional radiographs. Pediatric emergency medicine physicians should consider becoming proficient in this application.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^89ca4940]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review follows the guidelines outlined in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. On October 1, 2023, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across four major databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase. Specific search terms were devised for each database, incorporating ("radius" OR "radial" OR "ulna" OR "ulnar" OR "forearm") AND ("fracture" OR "displace") AND ("sonograph" OR "ultrasonograph" OR "ultrasound" OR "POCUS") AND ("pediatric" OR "paediatric" OR "child" OR "neonat" OR "infant" OR "toddler" OR "preschool" OR "pre-school" OR "juvenile" OR "young adult"). Additionally, a thorough manual examination of references within the included studies ensured no relevant papers were inadvertently overlooked. The assessment process involved a detailed review of each article's title, abstract, and/or full text. Two co-authors independently conducted this review, resolving uncertainties or ambiguities through consultation with a senior co-author. The AutoLit platform, developed by Nested Knowledge in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, facilitated deduplication, screening, and data extraction.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^2d2073de]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Research consistently indicates that ultrasound for detecting pediatric distal forearm fractures is less painful than radiographic imaging. In the study by Chaar-Alvarez et al. the pain score during ultrasound was significantly lower than during radiographic imaging. This aligns with broader literature where patients consistently reported similar or lower pain scores for point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) compared to X-ray. Furthermore, in the study by Xo et al. the results suggest that pain with ultrasonography is unlikely to limit its use in this diagnostic context. The minimal discomfort associated with POCUS can be attributed to its non-invasive nature, as all images can be obtained without requiring the child to move the affected extremity. This indicates that clinicians can reassure caregivers and children that ultrasonography is generally not a painful procedure.

Our findings indicate that the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound did not significantly differ between the subgroups of radiologist interpreters and non-radiologist interpreters. However, a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy was observed in the subgroup with trained performers, particularly showcasing notably higher specificity. No difference was noted between trained and untrained individuals in terms of sensitivity. This suggests that ultrasound can effectively rule out distal forearm fractures in children regardless of the operator's training level. Nevertheless, a crucial distinction emerges when confirming fractures, emphasizing the necessity of specific training. This underscores the importance of skill and expertise in accurately confirming fractures through ultrasound examination. Studies have reported that a standardized training duration of approximately 1 h is sufficient, indicating that the learning curve for bone ultrasonography is not excessively complex, at least for pediatric distal forearm fractures. The study by Galletebeitia Laka et al. demonstrates that a pediatric resident, even without prior POCUS experience, achieved diagnostic accuracy comparable to an experienced emergency department pediatrician after receiving basic training. Similarly, Epema et al. demonstrated that inexperienced physicians can master POCUS of the forearm after a short training period. Moreover, Chaar-Alvarez et al.'s findings confirm the accuracy of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool for nonangulated pediatric forearm fractures, even when reviewed by an experienced, blinded professional relying solely on ultrasound images for diagnosis. In contrast, unblinded bedside diagnoses by less experienced physicians were accurate but to a lesser extent. This indicates that having more ultrasound experience was more crucial and potentially less prone to misleading results than relying solely on additional bedside clinical information for making accurate diagnoses.

Meta-regression and subgroup analyses

Additional examination involved meta-regression and subgroup assessments, focusing on various covariates.
Ultrasound performers' training status In studies where individuals with ultrasound training conducted the examinations, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.4% (95% CI 91.2–96.5) and 94.9% (95% CI 91.9–96.9), respectively. In contrast, studies with untrained performers showed sensitivity and specificity of 95.1% (95% CI 92.3–96.9) and 86.3% (95% CI 80.5–90.6), respectively (Fig. 3). The AUC of the SROC was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93–0.98) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.86–0.97) for studies with trained and untrained ultrasound performers, respectively. Analyzing with a bivariate model indicated significantly higher diagnostic accuracy in the subgroup with trained performers (p = 0.03), as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 5. Furthermore, post hoc analysis revealed notably higher specificity in this subgroup (p < 0.01). Supplementary Fig. 6 illustrates a scattergram of positive and negative LRs for each subgroup. Moderate heterogeneity was noted in studies with untrained ultrasound performers. A sensitivity analysis identified the study by Herren et al. as a significant outlier. After excluding this study, the overall diagnostic accuracy and specificity remained significantly higher in the subgroup with trained ultrasound performers (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8).
Ultrasound interpreter In studies where radiologists interpreted the ultrasound, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.5% (95% CI 92.7–95.9) and 93.5% (95% CI 89.6–96.0), respectively. In studies with ultrasound interpreters other than radiologists, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.2% (95% CI 92.1–95.8) and 92.6% (95% CI 88.0–95.6), respectively (Fig. 4). The AUC of the SROC was 0.99 (95% CI 0.93–0.99) for studies with radiologist interpreter and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92–0.97) for studies with interpreters other than radiologists. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly between the two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Bone under examination (radius vs. ulna) The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound examination for detecting radius fractures were 97.1% (95% CI 94.2–98.6) and 94.1% (95% CI 85.8–97.7), respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound examination for detecting ulnar fractures were 78.9% (95% CI 61.6–89.7) and 97.7% (95% CI 94.6–99.0), respectively (Fig. 5). The AUC of the SROC was 0.98 (95% CI 0.94–0.98) for studies investigating radius fractures and 0.97 (95% CI 0.79–0.99) for studies investigating ulnar fractures. Utilizing a bivariate model, it was observed that the diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher in the subgroup examining radius fractures (p < 0.001), as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 10. Additionally, a post hoc analysis revealed a notably higher sensitivity in this subgroup (p < 0.001). Supplementary Fig. 11 displays a scattergram of each subgroup's positive and negative LRs. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in both subgroups. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify potential outliers and investigate the source of this heterogeneity. This analysis identified the study by Herren et al. as a significant outlier. After excluding this study, the overall diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity remained significantly higher in the subgroup of studies investigating radius fractures. However, post hoc analysis revealed that the specificity of ultrasound for the ulna subgroup was significantly higher than the other subgroup (p < 0.01) (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13).
Ultrasound views (4-view vs. 6-view) The sensitivity and specificity of the 4-view ultrasound examination for detecting distal forearm fractures were 95.3% (95% CI 90.5–97.7) and 94.4% (95% CI 88.1–97.5), respectively. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the 6-view ultrasound examination were 94.4% (95% CI 92.2–95.9) and 92.9% (95% CI 87.9–96.0), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 14). The AUC of the SROC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.98) for the 4-view subgroup and 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.97) for the 6-view subgroup. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly between the two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 15).
Reporting method (bone-wise vs. patient-wise) The pooled sensitivity and specificity were examined in two subgroups. In studies reporting results on a bone-wise basis, the sensitivity was 93.8% (95% CI 90.04–96.1), and the specificity was 97.0% (95% CI 93.2–98.7). In contrast, in studies reporting results on a patient-wise basis, the sensitivity was 94.7% (95% CI 92.2–96.4), and the specificity was 90.6% (95% CI 86.3–93.6) (Supplementary Fig. 16). The AUC of the SROC was 0.97 (95% CI 0.92–0.98) for the bone-wise subgroup and 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–0.97) for the patient-wise subgroup. Utilizing a bivariate model, the diagnostic accuracy was observed to be slightly higher in the bone-wise subgroup (p = 0.07), as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 17. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis indicated notably higher specificity in the bone-wise subgroup (p = 0.04).
Age In the meta-regression analysis, using a bivariate model to assess the impact of age, no significant influence of the mean age of the study samples was observed as a factor explaining heterogeneity (p = 0.53).

### Point-of-care ultrasound compared with conventional radiographic evaluation in children with suspected distal forearm fractures in the Netherlands: a diagnostic accuracy study [^96bab495]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal forearm fractures are common in children. The reference standard to diagnose these fractures is by conventional radiography, which exposes these patients to harmful radiation. Ultrasound (US) seems to be a good alternative. However, emergency physicians (EPs) in the Netherlands have limited experience in using US for diagnosing fractures in children.

Objective

The primary objective was to determine the accuracy of US, performed by a Dutch EP, compared with conventional radiography, in diagnosing distal forearm fractures in children. As a secondary objective, differences in pain scores during the performance of both US and plain radiography were determined.

Methods

Children, aged between 0 and 14 years old, suspected of having a distal forearm fracture were enrolled at the Emergency Department. US and radiographic findings were compared. Statistics for accuracy were calculated. Pain scores were recorded during US and radiography and compared as well. All participating operators received an hour-long pretrial training.

Results

100 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 9.5 years (SD, 3.6), and 50% were women. Overall diagnostic accuracy was 92% (95% CI 85%-96%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios for US were 95% (95% CI 87% to 99%), 86% (95% CI 71% to 95%), 92% (95% CI 83% to 97%), 91% (95% CI 76% to 98%), 6.86 (95% CI 3.04 to 15.51) and 0.05 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.17), respectively. The pain scores during US and radiographic imaging were 3.3 and 4.6, respectively (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In this study, we showed that US is an accurate method for diagnosing distal forearm fractures in children. The main advantages are that it is radiation-free and rapidly practicable, and that patients experience it as less painful than radiography. Moreover, this study has proven that with minimal experience in US, good diagnostic accuracy can be achieved after brief training.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^59ca6d0d]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Distal forearm fractures in the pediatric population represent a significant share of musculoskeletal injuries, comprising around 30% of all fractures in children. The conventional diagnostic strategy predominantly involves radiography. However, this method presents notable limitations, including the potential for ionizing radiation exposure, the need for patient mobility during imaging, and challenges in identifying subtle fractures within the pediatric skeletal structure.

In recent years, ultrasound has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for pediatric distal forearm fractures. Differing from conventional radiography, ultrasound offers a safer option for the pediatric population by eliminating ionizing radiation, which poses potential adverse effects. Its bedside applicability not only eliminates the need for patient transportation but also enables real-time imaging, potentially expediting the diagnostic process. Additionally, ultrasound presents advantages such as lower cost and higher availability.

Recent studies have investigated the application of ultrasound in diagnosing pediatric forearm fractures, highlighting its capacity for dynamic, multi-planar visualization of both radial and ulnar cortices. This dynamic capability effectively addresses challenges related to overlapping bone structures and provides advantages in identifying cortical disruptions and subperiosteal hematomas. Moreover, the mobility of ultrasound facilitates bedside examinations, proving valuable in non-hospital settings and situations involving multiple-trauma patients. However, despite promising findings, the incorporation of diagnostic ultrasound into the clinical management of pediatric distal forearm fractures remains limited.

This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis on the diagnostic effectiveness of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures. Through a systematic review of the current literature, our objective is to offer insights into the viability of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool in the pediatric emergency setting.

Results

Article screening and selection process

A systematic literature search employing a predetermined strategy identified 1570 articles. Upon removing duplicates, 746 papers underwent screening based on title and abstract. This screening process resulted in the exclusion of 718 articles, comprising 38 review articles, 19 editorials, 15 conference papers, 49 non-English articles, and 597 articles deemed irrelevant to the topic of interest. The full text of the remaining 28 papers was meticulously reviewed. After a thorough examination, 14 articles were excluded because they failed to report at least one diagnostic accuracy measure for ultrasound in the evaluation of pediatric distal forearm fractures. Ultimately, 14 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and incorporated. The screening process and eligibility criteria adhered to PRISMA guidelines, with a flow diagram presented in Fig. 1.

Study and patient characteristics

The analysis encompassed 14 studies involving a total of 1377 patients. The predominant methodology across these studies was prospective and single center. Distal forearm fractures were diagnosed using ultrasound, with radiography as the reference standard. Diagnostic criteria for fractures on ultrasound included the identification of cortical disruptions, protrusions, deviations, or hematomas. The studies utilized a diverse range of ultrasound equipment, with a linear transducer being the most commonly employed. Additionally, a 6-view imaging protocol was predominantly implemented. The ultrasound examinations were conducted by various professionals, such as traumatology residents, pediatric emergency physicians, nurses, and radiologists, each with varying levels of training in musculoskeletal ultrasound examination. Detailed sensitivity and specificity percentages, along with additional characteristics of the included studies, can be found in Table 1.

### Bedside ultrasound vs X-ray for the diagnosis of forearm fractures in children [^cbbb41d5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Painful forearm injuries after a fall occur frequently in children. X-ray study is currently the gold standard investigation. Ultrasound (US) is a potential alternative that avoids exposure to ionizing radiation and may be less painful than x-ray study; and familiarity and skill with US is increasing among emergency physicians.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study was to determine if a cohort of physicians with little or no previous experience with US could, after a short training program, safely exclude forearm fractures in children. Secondary aims were to compare any pain or discomfort associated with clinical examination, US, and x-ray study and to determine the acceptability of US as a diagnostic tool to parents and patients.

Methods

A prospective, nonrandomized, interventional diagnostic study was performed on children between the ages of 0 and 16 years who had a suspected fracture of the forearm. US scanning was performed by a group of physicians, most with little or no previous US experience.

Results

After the brief training program, a group of pediatric emergency physicians could diagnose forearm fractures in children with a sensitivity of 91.5% and a specificity of 87.6%. Pain associated with US was no better or worse than pain associated with x-ray study. Patients and parents preferred US over x-ray study as an investigation modality for suspected forearm fractures.

Conclusion

A group of pediatric emergency physicians with limited previous experience could, after a short training program, diagnose forearm fractures in children. Pain associated with US was no better or worse than pain associated with x-ray study.

### Common fractures of the radius and ulna [^954380aa]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Fractures of the radius and ulna are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with distal fractures occurring more often than proximal fractures. A fall onto an outstretched hand is the most common mechanism of injury for fractures of the radius and ulna. Evaluation with radiography or ultrasonography usually can confirm the diagnosis. If initial imaging findings are negative and suspicion of fracture remains, splinting and repeat radiography in seven to 14 days should be performed. Incomplete compression fractures without cortical disruption, called buckle (torus) fractures, are common in children. Greenstick fractures, which have cortical disruption, are also common in children. Depending on the degree of angulation, buckle and greenstick fractures can be managed with immobilization. In adults, distal radius fractures are the most common forearm fractures and are typically caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand. A nondisplaced, or minimally displaced, distal radius fracture is initially treated with a sugar-tong splint, followed by a short-arm cast for a minimum of three weeks. It should be noted that these fractures may be complicated by a median nerve injury. Isolated midshaft ulna (nightstick) fractures are often caused by a direct blow to the forearm. These fractures are treated with immobilization or surgery, depending on the degree of displacement and angulation. Combined fractures involving both the ulna and radius generally require surgical correction. Radial head fractures may be difficult to visualize on initial imaging but should be suspected when there are limitations of elbow extension and supination following trauma. Treatment of radial head fractures depends on the specific characteristics of the fracture using the Mason classification.

### Ultrasound-directed reduction of distal radius fractures in adults: a systematic review [^bd66588b]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the clinical literature to determine whether ultrasound can be used to improve the reduction of distal radius fractures in adults in the ED.

Methodology

A study protocol was registered on PROSPERO. EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov of the US National Library of Medicine were searched for studies evaluating ultrasound-assisted distal radial fracture reductions in comparison with standard care. The primary outcome of interest was manipulation success rates, defined as the proportion of fracture manipulations resulting in acceptable anatomical alignment, with secondary outcome being subsequent surgical intervention rates in ultrasound and standard care group of patients.

Results

248 were screened at title and abstract, and 10 studies were included for a narrative synthesis. The quality of this evidence is limited but suggests ultrasound is accurate in determining distal radius fracture reduction and may improve the quality of reduction compared with standard care. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether this affects the rate of subsequent surgical intervention or functional outcome.

Conclusion

There is a lack of evidence that using ultrasound in the closed reduction of distal radius fractures benefits patients. Properly conducted randomised controlled trials with patient-orientated outcomes are crucial to investigate this technology.

### Accuracy of ultrasonography for determining successful realignment of pediatric forearm fractures [^7013356c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The primary objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography compared with blinded orthopedic assessment of fluoroscopy in determining successful realignment of pediatric forearm fractures. The secondary objective is to determine the rate of agreement of ultrasonography and fluoroscopy in real-time by the treating physician.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted in children younger than 18 years and presenting to an academic emergency department with forearm fractures requiring realignment of a single bone. Physicians performed closed reductions with ultrasonographic assessment of realignment until the best possible reduction was achieved. Fluoroscopy was then immediately performed and images were saved. A positive test result was defined as an inadequately reduced fracture on fluoroscopy by a blinded pediatric orthopedic surgeon (reference standard) and on ultrasonography (index test) and fluoroscopy in real-time by the treating physician.

Results

One hundred patients were enrolled (median age 12.1 years; 74% male patients); the radius was involved in 98%, with 27% involving the growth plate. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.4% to 84.6%), 89.1% (95% CI 82.8% to 95.5%), 28.6% (95% CI 4.9% to 52.2%), and 95.3% (95% CI 90.9% to 99.8%), respectively. The treating physicians' agreement rate of the real-time images was 98%.

Conclusion

Point-of-care ultrasonography can help emergency physicians determine when pediatric forearm fractures have been adequately realigned, but inadequate reductions should be confirmed by other imaging modalities.

### Point-of-care ultrasound pronator quadratus hematoma sign for detection of clinically non-angulated pediatric distal forearm fractures: a prospective cohort study [^ce5a77ab]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) diagnosis of distal forearm fractures relies on the identification of buckling or breach of hyperechoic bone cortex. We describe the pronator quadratus hematoma (PQH) formation visualized on POCUS, the PQH sign, as it may aid diagnosis of pediatric distal forearm cortical breach fractures.

Methods

A prospective cohort of children presenting to an emergency department with isolated, clinically non-angulated distal forearm injuries received POCUS by an expert emergency physician sonologist who identified the presence or absence of the PQH sign. They secondarily recorded the difference between the size of the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle on both the affected and non-affected forearms (PQ delta thickness). Children received an x-ray subsequent to POCUS and were diagnosed based on an x-ray reported by a radiologist masked to POCUS findings.

Results

Thirty-eight children were recruited. All 22 patients with cortical breach fracture had PQH sign present (100%; 95%CI: 85–100%), while all 16 patients without cortical breach fracture had PQH sign absent (100%; 95%CI: 79–100%). PQ delta thickness ranged from 2.1 to 10.2mm in cortical breach fractures, 0.0 to 1.1mm in buckle fractures, and 0.2 to 0.8mm in patients without fracture.

Conclusions

The PQH sign correctly distinguished all children with, and without, cortical breach fractures. All PQ delta thicknesses were ≧2.1mm when cortical breach fracture was present and ≦1.1mm when cortical breach fracture was absent. The PQH sign and PQ delta thickness are promising measurements to identify pediatric distal forearm cortical breach fractures, and their utility should be confirmed in larger studies with sonologists of different abilities.

### A meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric distal forearm fractures [^6bdd5319]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary analytical approach utilized a random effects diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) model, specifically the bivariate model developed by Reitsma et al. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were generated using this bivariate meta-analysis data. For visualization purposes, study-specific estimates were relatively weighted in SROC plots based on the weights within the random effects univariate DOR model. AUC and its confidence interval (CI) for each subgroup were calculated using a 2000 sample bootstrapping technique based on the bivariate model.

To assess heterogeneity, the I² metric was employed following the approach by Holling et al. A significant level for heterogeneity was considered for I² confidence intervals above 25%, leading to further sensitivity analyses through the DOR univariate meta-analysis to identify and re-analyze potential outliers.

The study also investigated the influence of various covariates on the reported rates using subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression techniques. Covariates included training status and roles of the individuals involved, image acquisition methods (either four or six views), and the age of patients. Considering the variability in reporting metrics, with some studies reporting by patient number and others by the number of bones scanned, these aspects were treated as covariates for further subgroup analyses. Subgroup comparisons were made between studies reporting on a patient-wise basis vs. those reporting on a bone-wise basis. Separate subgroup analyses were also conducted for studies reporting diagnostic accuracy metrics for fractures in the radius and ulna.

Fagan plots and LR scattergrams were utilized to assess the clinical applicability of findings. Positive LRs above ten signified suitability for confirmation, whereas negative LRs below 0.1 indicated exclusion suitability. Fagan nomograms were constructed for pre-test prevalences of 25%, 50%, and 75%, based on the bivariate Reitsma model, as detailed by Zwinderman et al.

Publication bias was scrutinized using an adaptation of Egger's regression test for DTA meta-analysis, involving the analysis of funnel plot asymmetry with 2000 sample bootstrapping, as recommended by Noma et al.

All statistical procedures were conducted using R (version 4.2.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), utilizing packages such as "Mada", "MVPBT", "dmetatools", "Metafor", and "meta".

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for upper extremity fractures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2670e956]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ultrasound has an excellent diagnostic accuracy for fractures that is reportedly comparable to plain radiographs. We aim to summarize the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for upper extremity fractures in children.

Methods

Databases were searched from inception through November 2019 using pre-defined index terms, including "ultrasound", "fractures of upper extremities" and "children". The study is reported using Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). Meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for fractures was conducted using the random-effects bivariate model. Subgroup analysis of fracture site (elbow vs non-elbow fractures) was also performed. Meta-regression was performed to determine if the site of fracture affected the diagnostic accuracy.

Results

Thirty-two studies were identified in the meta-analysis. Ultrasound for fractures of the upper extremities has a sensitivity: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.97), specificity: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91–0.98), positive likelihood ratio: 21.1 (95% CI: 10.8–41.5) and negative likelihood ratio: 0.05 (95% CI: 0.03–0.07), with an area under ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97–0.99). Subgroup analysis for elbow fracture showed ultrasound has a sensitivity: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.86–0.98), specificity: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76–0.94), positive likelihood ratio: 7.3 (95% CI: 3.7–14.4) and negative likelihood ratio: 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02–0.16), with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.97). Meta-regression suggested the fracture sites would affect diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (elbow vs non-elbow, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests ultrasound has excellent diagnostic accuracy for non-elbow upper extremity fractures in children, serving as an alternative diagnostic modality to plain radiographs.

### Sonographic diagnosis of metaphyseal forearm fractures in children: a safe and applicable alternative to standard X-rays [^098f4bcc]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Metaphyseal forearm fractures are very common in childhood. Radiography of the wrist is the standard diagnostic procedure. The aim of our study was to evaluate and confirm the safety and applicability of the ultrasound diagnostic procedure in comparison to x-ray diagnosis.

Methods

We investigated 76 patients aged between 1 and 14 years. After clinical assessment, patients with suspected forearm fractures first underwent ultrasound examination of the metaphyseal forearm followed by standard 2-view radiographs of the wrist. Ultrasound and radiographic findings were then compared, and sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound were calculated.

Results

Of 76 patients, we found 42 patients with 52 metaphyseal forearm fractures by x-rays. By ultrasound, we also diagnosed 52 fractures. All patients with no fractures were correctly diagnosed as well. Referring to x-ray, we calculated for ultrasound a sensitivity of 96.1% and a specificity of 97%. Comparing axis deviation of displaced fractures, we found a mean difference of 2.1 degrees between sonographic and x-ray values.

Conclusions

We confirm that ultrasound is an applicable and safe alternative tool to x-rays in nondisplaced or excluded metaphyseal forearm fractures in children.

### Ultrasound in the diagnostics of metaphyseal forearm fractures in children: a systematic review and cost calculation [^0a8f75f0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Metaphyseal forearm fractures are a common occurrence in childhood accounting up to 20% of all pediatric fractures. The standard diagnostic procedure is an x-ray scan. Sonographic examinations could be an alternative that avoids exposition to ionizing radiation and possibly reduces pain, time, and costs. This is a systematic review of clinical studies evaluating ultrasound as a possible alternative to radiographs in diagnosing metaphyseal forearm fractures in children.

Methods

A systematic literature research for diagnostic studies and reviews was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library in May 2013 and updated in May 2014. In addition, reference lists of publications included were scanned. Outcome parameters were diagnostic accuracy, costs, examination time, and the assessment of pain. The study population is defined as children, because forearm fractures are very common in this age group and the impact of radiation on younger patients is greater than that on adults. Methodological quality of the studies has been assessed with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. In addition, we carried out a cost center accounting.

Results

Eight diagnostic studies and 2 reviews were included in the analysis. The risk of bias of 4 studies was low; and of the other 4 ones, it was moderate. Critical aspects were missing or inaccurate blinding and insufficient descriptions of the study protocol, especially the order of examinations. Twenty-six to 115 patients within the age of 0 to 21 years were included in the studies. Sensitivity ranged from 64% to 100% and specificity did between 73% and 100%. Sensitivity was in six studies and specificity was in seven studies higher than 90%. Chaar-Alvarez et al reported an average time reduction of 25 minutes by using sonography instead of x-ray and a reduction of pain from 1.7 to 1.2 points on a visual analog scale (0–5 points). In 2 other studies, all patients reported pain-free sonographic examinations. The results of the cost center accounting, not being representative, were costs of &OV0556;20.54 per examination with ultrasound and &OV0556;26.60 per radiography-based one, which is a potential saving of 22.79% by replacing radiographic examinations by ultrasound.

Conclusions

Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound examinations are high. Single study results show that sonographic examinations can be faster and less painful. In addition, the calculation model shows a tendency towards less-expensive ultrasound examinations. Further studies are needed with an adequate sample size calculation for assessing equivalence or non-inferiority of ultrasound and x-ray and to collect data on pain, examination time, and costs. The age of the older participants may be problematic because of the fact that epiphyseal plates close within the age from 15 to 22 years, which may influence the diagnostic accuracy of sonographic examinations. Therefore, future studies should contain age-stratified analyses. In addition, the calculation model for costs should be tested on a wider data base.

### The utility of bedside ultrasonography in identifying fractures and guiding fracture reduction in children [^db1ccf94]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare bedside ultrasonography (BUS) to radiography for identifying long bone fractures, the need for reduction, and the adequacy of reduction.

Methods

Children aged 2 to 17 years presenting to a pediatric emergency department with long bone injuries were prospectively enrolled. Bedside ultrasonography was performed before ordering initial radiographs. If a fracture was identified, measurements of angulation and displacement were made based on BUS images. Radiographs were used to guide management. Patients who had a fracture identified on radiograph underwent standard care. Later, agreement between BUS and radiography for fracture identification, the need for reduction, and the adequacy of reduction were determined.

Results

Thirty-three patients were enrolled, the mean age was 9.1 years (± 3.1 years). Sixty six bones were studied; 56 (84.8%) involved the upper extremity. Fractures were identified in 59.1% of all bones; 13 (33.3%) required reduction. The agreement between BUS and radiography for fracture identification was 95.5%, for the need for reduction 92.3%, and for the adequacy of reduction 92.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of BUS for fracture identification, need for reduction and reduction adequacy was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–1.00), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.74–0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI 0.79–1.00), and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.61–0.96), 1.00 (95% CI, 0.59–1.00) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.30–0.99), respectively.

Conclusions

These data suggest that BUS evaluation of upper extremity injuries not involving joints maybe comparable to radiography for identifying fractures, the need for reduction, and the adequacy of reduction in children. If further investigations which include a larger number of lower extremity, growth plate, and joint injuries support our findings, BUS may gain a more prominent role in managing children with all long bone injuries.

### A clinical decision rule for the use of plain radiography in children after acute wrist injury: development and external validation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^b7e53880]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

External model validation and test characteristics

The external performance of the model was assessed in the 379 patients in the validation cohort. The AUC of the external validation was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76–0.82) and the calibration slope 1.07 (95% CI: 0.82–1.33). After applying a threshold of 23%, the sensitivity and specificity of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules for detecting fractures of the distal forearm in the validation cohort were respectively 95.9% (95% CI: 91.7–98.0%) and 37.3% (95% CI: 31.0–44.1%) (Table 3). The Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules led to an absolute reduction of 22% of requested radiographs.

Table 3
Test characteristics and performance of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules in the external validation cohort as tested on data from three hospitals (the validation cohort), cutoff point for radiograph yes or no was a predicted probability of fracture of 23%

After applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, 7/170 fractures (4.1%, 95% CI: 1.7–8.3%) were missed in the external validation cohort (Appendix 4). They consisted of six buckle fractures of the distal radius and one non-displaced distal radius fracture with a buckle component. All these missed fractures were found in boys ages 10–15 years old.

### Does early conversion to below-elbow casting for pediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures adversely affect patient-reported outcomes and ROM? [^a02cb58c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Trial Design and Participants

This was a secondary analysis with clinical follow-up (with a minimum of 5 years) of a previous RCT by Colaris et al. Children younger than 16 years of age who visited the emergency department of one of four participating Dutch hospitals (Erasmus Medical Center [Rotterdam], HAGA Hospital [The Hague], Reinier de Graaf Hospital [Delft], and Franciscus Vlietland Hospital [Schiedam]), were eligible for participation. This study complies with the CONSORT statement (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
This CONSORT flow diagram shows how patients were allocated in this study.

Participants

We approached the 128 patients who were included between January 2006 and August 2010. All patients were invited to visit the outpatient clinic for clinical and radiological reassessment between January 2014 and April 2017. Children younger than 16 years of age were eligible for the initial RCT if they presented with a displaced, diaphyseal, both-bone forearm fracture that was stable after reduction. A fracture was defined as unstable if full pronation and supination of the proximal forearm caused redisplacement of the fracture under fluoroscopic vision. This test for stability has been used before in a group of children with forearm fractures. The exclusion criteria were: no response to our invitation for follow-up, refracture, or secondary surgery of the affected forearm. At 7 years, follow-up measurement and informed consent were reobtained from all children and parents of children aged younger than 12 years. We considered 128 patients as potentially eligible; 24% (31) were excluded because they were lost before the minimum study follow-up or had incomplete datasets, leaving 76% (97) for secondary analysis. Those lost to follow-up were comparable to the included population (Supplemental Table 1;).

### Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children [^2082aef5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi-RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons:Removable splint versus below-elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids - Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low-quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between-group difference in pain during treatment; very low-quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below-elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low-quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low-quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage-group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures)One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low-quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low-quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low-quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low-quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below-elbow versus above-elbow casts for displaced or unstable both-bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children)Short-term physical function data were unavailable but very low-quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below-elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both-bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND-Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below-elbow 40.7; above-elbow 41.8); very low-quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above-elbow group; very low-quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below-elbow casts; low-quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above-elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children)Where reported, above-elbow casts were used. Short-term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND-Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low-quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low-quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Where available, the quality of the RCT-based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly-diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High-quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE.

### Ultrasound-guided distal forearm fracture reduction by pediatric emergency physicians: a single center retrospective study [^50166734]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fracture reduction under point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) guidance facilitates measurement of residual angulation or displacement that may not be apparent on examination. Point-of-care ultrasound is without patient or staff exposure to ionizing radiation and enlists no additional staffing resources or patient transfer.

Methods

We conducted a chart review of all children who underwent reduction of a distal forearm fracture in the pediatric emergency department over a 2-year period, from September 2018 to September 2020. We compared length of stay (LOS) with that for orthopedist-performed distal forearm reductions during the study period. We allowed a 6-week lag period to ensure no missed rereduction before analyzing the data. After reduction, children were instructed to follow up with an orthopedist within 1 week. Children with loss of reduction on orthopedic follow-up are referred back through our emergency department for operative reduction.

Results

A total of 74 children with 75 distal forearm fractures were identified. Average LOS was 179 minutes for the pediatric emergency medicine physician reductions and 215 minutes for the orthopedist reductions (P < 0.001). Ninety-six percent of reductions were completed with POCUS assistance, and 61% had less than 5 degrees of angulation on postreduction radiography. Only 2.7% of children underwent rereduction.

Conclusions

Distal forearm fracture reductions by a pediatric emergency medicine physician under POCUS guidance have a high rate of excellent alignment, low rate of failed reduction, and significantly shorter LOS (P < 0.001) than reductions performed by orthopedists.

### Comparison of ultrasound-guided versus fluoroscopy-guided reduction of forearm fractures in children [^4ff9a72e]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can be used to guide and assess reduction of pediatric forearm fractures. In this study, we sought to compare the success rate of ultrasound-guided fracture reduction with fluoroscopy-guided fracture reduction. We also sought to determine whether there are cost or time benefits to using ultrasound instead of fluoroscopy.

Methods

The electronic medical records of patients less than 18 years of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department with a forearm fracture between April 2016 and March 2019 were screened for inclusion in this study. A total of 27 ultrasound-guided reductions were identified during this time period and 81 fluoroscopy-guided reductions were randomly selected for comparison. Cost data was provided by the financial department. Reduction success, total length of stay, and costs were compared between the two groups, and multiple linear regression was used to determine the influence of any confounding predictor variables.

Results

There were no failed reductions in either group. Length of stay was shorter in the POCUS group (221 min) compared with the fluoroscopy group (254 min, p = 0.014), but this significance was lost in the regression model when adjusted for ketamine use. Provider costs ($430 v $442, p = 0.822) and total costs ($1219 v $1204, p = 0.851) were the same between the POCUS group and the fluoroscopy group, respectively.

Conclusion

POCUS appears to be an equally effective imaging modality to guide reduction of forearm fractures as compared to fluoroscopy.

### Diagnosis and guided reduction of forearm fractures in children using bedside ultrasound [^cabfd31b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Forearm fractures are common injuries in children. Displaced and angulated fractures usually require reduction. Ultrasound diagnosis and guided reduction offer several potential advantages: (1) the procedure does not involve ionizing radiation; (2) compared with fluoroscopy units, the newer ultrasound units are more portable; and (3) repeated studies can be obtained easily and quickly.

Objective

The primary objective was to investigate the accuracy of emergency department (ED) physician-performed ultrasound in the diagnosis and guided reduction of forearm fractures in children.

Methods

Children suspected of having forearm fractures were enrolled prospectively in an urban pediatric ED from June 2004 to November 2004. A bedside ultrasound of the forearm bones was performed by a pediatric emergency medicine physician. Ultrasound findings were compared with radiograph findings. Reductions were performed under ultrasound guidance. Postreduction radiographs were performed. Any need for further reduction was recorded.

Results

During the study period, 68 patients were enrolled. Radiographs revealed forearm fractures in 48 patients. Twenty-nine subjects had fractures of the radius alone; 17 had fractures of both the radius and the ulna, and 2 had fractures of the ulna alone. Ultrasound revealed the correct type and location of the fracture in 46 patients. The sensitivity for the detection of forearm fractures was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89%-100%) using ultrasound. The specificity was 100% (95% CI, 83%-100%). Twenty-six subjects underwent reduction of their fractures in the ED. Two subjects required rereduction after the initial reduction. The initial success rate of ultrasound-guided reduction was 92% (95% CI, 75%-99%).

Conclusions

Bedside ultrasound performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians is a reliable and convenient method of diagnosing forearm fractures in children. It is also useful in guiding the reduction of these fractures.

### Ultrasound in forearm fractures: a pragmatic study assessing the utility of point of care ultrasound (PoCUS) in identifying and managing distal radius fractures [^db4b7e57]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) is a safe, non-invasive tool for identifying distal radius fractures and can potentially be utilised to assist clinicians to reduce displaced fractures. We aim to test whether PoCUS is accurate to identify distal radius fractures and to determine how PoCUS performs as a tool to confirm a successful fracture reduction.

Methods

A pragmatic prospective observational study was done in adult patients presenting with forearm injuries resulting in Colle's type distal radius fractures. Adults who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a suspected distal forearm fracture from August 2018 to July 2019 were conveniently sampled for inclusion into the study when a trained ED ultra-sonographer was available. PoCUS scans over the point of maximal tenderness were done using a high frequency linear transducer (7.5–10 mHz) prior to X-ray. Patients who required a manipulation of the fracture had a second ultrasound scan immediately after the procedure before the second X-ray was ordered. PoCUS scans were compared to X-rays for accuracy in both groups.

Results

Fractures were identified in 44 out of 47 included patients using both PoCUS and X-ray modalities. This showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 90–100%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI: 31–100%). Fracture manipulation was required in 35 out of 44 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of PoCUS in determining alignment accuracy when compared to X-ray were 100% (95% CI: 83–100%) and 64% (95% CI: 32–88%) respectively. The PPV and NPV were 86% (95% CI: 66–95%) and 100% (95% CI: 56–100%) respectively. Ten out of 44 (23%) patients with distal radius fractures ultimately required an Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF).

Conclusion

Our study supports the use of PoCUS for identifying distal radius forearm fractures and may have some value in assisting clinicians to determine post reduction success. We still advocate using standard X-ray radiographs to confirm successful or adequate cortical alignment following a manipulation.

### A narrative review of the uses of ultrasound in the evaluation, analgesia, and treatment of distal forearm fractures [^bd4e887f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal forearm fractures are a commonly encountered injury in the emergency department (ED), accounting for 500,000 to 1.5 million visits and 17% of ED fractures. The evaluation and management of these fractures frequently employs x-ray studies, conscious sedation, closed reduction, and splinting. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can offer significant benefit in the diagnosis and management of these common injuries.

Objective Of The Review

To review the clinical utility of POCUS in the diagnosis of distal forearm fractures, as well as to demonstrate the performance of ultrasound-guided analgesia delivery and ultrasound-guided reduction technique.

Discussion

The initial evaluation of forearm injuries frequently includes x-ray studies. However, multiple studies have shown ultrasound to be sensitive and specific for distal radius fractures, with the added value of detecting soft tissue injuries missed by conventional radiography. POCUS may also facilitate analgesia through the use of ultrasound-guided hematoma blocks, which removes the need for conscious sedation prior to manipulation. Finally, POCUS can be used after manipulation to assess cortical realignment of the bone fragments and spare the patient multiple reduction attempts and repeat radiographs.

Conclusion

Distal forearm fractures are common, and the emergency physician should be adept with the evaluation and management of these injuries. POCUS can be a reliable modality in the detection of these fractures and can be used to facilitate analgesia and augment success of reduction attempts. These techniques may decrease length of stay, improve patient pain, and decrease reduction attempts.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in detecting forearm fractures in pediatric patients in the emergency department [^a721ee7a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric forearm trauma is one of the most common reasons for referral to the trauma units of emergency departments. This study investigated the diagnostic value of ultrasonography (US) in comparison with direct radiography in detecting forearm fractures in children aged 2–15 years with incomplete bone development.

Method

This prospective, observational, single-center study included patients aged 2–15 years who were conscious, had isolated forearm trauma and closed injuries, and were treated at the Emergency Medicine Clinic of Kayseri City Hospital between January 1 and August 31, 2021. Written consent was obtained from the relatives or guardians of all patients. The physician who first examined the patient filled out a research form and requested a direct radiograph. US of the soft tissue in the forearm was performed by a USG-certified investigator, who was blinded to the diagnosis and radiography results.

Results

The study examined 87 patients, including 60 males (69%) and 27 (31%) females. Fractures were detected in 69 (79.3%) patients. There were 47 patients (54%) who had only radius fractures, 20 (23%) had radius and ulna fractures, and 2 (2.3%) had only ulna fractures. The sensitivity of US for displaced radius fractures was 96.67%, the selectivity was 100%, and the total accuracy was 98.8%. The sensitivity of US for radius fractures with no displacement was 94.59%, the selectivity was 100%, and the total accuracy was 97.7%. The sensitivity of US for displaced ulna fractures was 94.1%, the selectivity was 100%, and the total accuracy was 98.8%. For fractures with no ulna displacement, the sensitivity was 60%, the specificity was 100%, and the total accuracy was 97.7%.

Conclusion

In this study of pediatric forearm trauma patients with suspected fractures, ultrasound had high sensitivity and specificity.

### MR imaging for detection of trampoline injuries in children [^71d14840]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Fractures of the proximal tibial metaphysis may initially appear very subtle on plain radiographs. Therefore in a study of Klimek et al. repeat radiographs after 7–10 days are recommended in children with persistent complaints as an alternative to MRI. Stranzinger et al. described buckle/torus or transverse hairline fractures of the proximal tibial metaphysis as the most common manifestations of the "trampoline fracture". In their study children with trampoline fractures showed significantly higher anterior tilt angles of the proximal tibial epiphyseal plate on lateral radiographs compared to a control group. They concluded that abnormal anterior tilt angles support the diagnosis of a "trampoline fracture". They performed follow-up radiographs to exclude valgus deformities and early growth plate closure in their patients. In our study fractures of proximal tibial metaphysis were diagnosed by MRI only, all prior radiographs had been classified as normal.

Our study has some limitations though. Plain X-Rays had been performed at outside, non-pediatric institutions with potential considerable differences in diagnosis. Measurement of the anterior tilt angle was not included in the radiographic analysis. The radiographs were not re-reviewed by pediatric or dedicated musculoskeletal specialists. Another limitation is that our results were not compared with findings in children examined only with radiography, CT or ultrasound. To reduce radiography utilization musculoskeletal sonographic evaluation can be useful to find soft tissue swelling, adjacent and subperiostal hematomas and bone fragments or distal humeral epiphyseal separation.

Another limitation of this study is a potential sampling bias. The authors have only knowledge of the children, who were referred for MR imaging. Therefore no broad conclusions regarding the general nature of trampoline-related injuries can be made.

### Ultrasound-assisted reduction of displaced and shortened fractures by pediatric emergency physicians [^ba954e31]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric emergency physicians at Kaplan Medical Center regularly reduce forearm fractures under point-of-care ultrasound guidance in the pediatric emergency department. We present 3 children who arrived at our department with shortened, angulated forearm fractures within the span of a single week. We report on the successful reduction of these fractures under point-of-care ultrasound and on the maintenance of anatomic alignment at follow-up 1 week postreduction.

### Ultrasound-guided pediatric forearm fracture reductions in a resource-limited ED [^dea9efcc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric forearm fractures are a common presentation in emergency departments in Papua New Guinea. Often these children undergo "blind" closed reduction with reduction adequacy assessed by standard radiographs. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound (US) in guiding closed reduction of pediatric forearm fractures in a resource-limited setting.

Methods

We recruited consecutive children with closed forearm fractures requiring reduction. A US scanner was used to visualize and aid fracture reductions. The outcome measures were the rate of successful reductions (ie, adequate alignment without the need for a second procedure or further surgical intervention), length of stay in hospital, and adverse events during each procedure and at follow-up after 6 weeks.

Results

Of 47 children recruited, there were 44 (94%) successful reductions, whereas 3 (6%) required repeated reduction. The mean (SD) length of stay in hospital of the successful cases was 8.77 (3.66) hours. Two patients had tight plaster casts during early follow-up which were immediately addressed. Of the 44 successful cases, only 38 were retrieved for the final review. No further adverse events were observed in the latter.

Conclusions

This small-scale study has demonstrated the safe and efficacious use of US-guided close reduction of pediatric forearm fractures in a low-resource setting. Using US, real-time visualization of reduction efforts can reassure the clinician in decision making, thus reducing the rate of repeated reductions and allowing shorter hospital stay.

### Comparison of pediatric post-reduction fluoroscopic-and ultrasound forearm fracture images [^daff50b1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Emergency department (ED) reduction of pediatric fractures occurs most commonly in the forearm and can be challenging if fluoroscopy is not available. We sought to assess the ability of point of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) to predict adequacy of reduction by fluoroscopy.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled ED patients 0–17 years of age with radial and/or ulnar fractures requiring reduction under fluoroscopic guidance. Post-reduction POCUS (probe dorsal, volar, and coronal) and fluoroscopic (AP and lateral) fracture images were recorded. Fracture angles were compared between blinded POCUS and fluoroscopic measurements and between POCUS measurements by a blinded emergency physician and a blinded radiologist, reporting mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of POCUS in the prediction of fluoroscopically detected post-reduction malalignment, as interpreted by a blinded pediatric orthopaedist.

Results

The 58 patients were 7.9 ± 3.5 years of age and had 21 radial (36%), 1 ulnar (2%), and 36 radioulnar (62%) fractures. Fluoroscopy and POCUS angles were within a mean of 0.1°-3.2°, depending on the site and surface measured. Radiologist- and emergency physician-interpreted POCUS measurements were within a mean of 1° in all dimensions. POCUS identified inadequate reductions with 100% sensitivity and 92–93% specificity.

Conclusions

Blinded emergency medicine and radiology interpretations of post-reduction POCUS fracture images agree closely. Post-reduction POCUS measurements are comparable to those obtained by fluoroscopy and accurately predict adequacy of reduction. POCUS can be used to guide pediatric fracture reduction when bedside fluoroscopy is not available in the ED.

### Accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound for determining the adequacy of pediatric forearm fracture reductions [^cb10816b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of the present study was to the determine the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in assessing closed reduction (CR) of pediatric forearm fractures in a pediatric emergency setting.

Methods

After determination of the need for CR using X-ray images by an orthopedic consultant, POCUS examinations were performed just before and after the reduction attempt. The transducer was positioned longitudinally over the dorsal, volar, and lateral surfaces of the radius and ulna to view the fracture site. The presence of angulation, displacement, or bayonetting of the fracture fragments was recorded. The adequacy of realignment according to the POCUS and the orthopedic consultant's final determination were recorded.

Results

Sixty-two patients were enrolled in the study and 96 bones were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of POCUS for adequacy of CR were 95.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88.3–99.1)] and 95.8% (95% CI: 78.8–99.8), the positive predictive value was 98.5% (95% CI: 91.0–99.7), and the negative predictive value was 88.4% (95% CI: 71.6–95.8). The corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios were 23 (3.37–156.77) and 0.04 (0.01–0.12). There was high agreement between POCUS and X-ray images for predicting adequacy of CR [κ: 0.892 (± 0.053)]. There was also a significant correlation between POCUS and X-ray measurements of angulation and displacement performed before and after CR, respectively (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our study has reported the successful use of POCUS for the management of pediatric forearm fractures in a pediatric emergency department. Point-of-care ultrasound can minimize radiation exposure and appears to be an alternative and accurate tool for reduction attempts.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^efaa5182]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metaphyseal injury

In the appropriate clinical setting, classic metaphyseal fractures (corner/chip or bucket handle fractures) are considered the most specific radiographic injury of physical abuse. They are most frequently seen in the distal femur, the tibia, and the proximal humerus, but also occur in the elbow, wrist (Fig. 5), and shoulder. Small undisplaced classic metaphyseal fractures tend to heal within 4 weeks without callus formation by gradual bone consolidation, whereas healing of larger or displaced fractures may take 6–8 weeks. When the adjacent periosteum is injured, subperiosteal haemorrhage occurs, which, during the healing process, is evident as a periosteal reaction. Classic metaphyseal fractures must be differentiated from normal growth variations, which may take the form of subtle irregularities, 'step-off' (also termed a metaphyseal collar) or even mimic a small avulsion. In children over the age of 12–15 months with genu vara, metaphyseal fragmentation can be seen due to abnormal stresses associated with early weight bearing.

Long bone fractures

In cases of suspected child abuse, long bone fractures have been documented in 26% of infants. Fractures to the long tubular bones in physically abused children most commonly involve the femur and tibia, followed by the forearm (Fig. 5). Mid-shaft fractures of the humerus in infants are more common in cases of physical abuse than non-abuse. Without a plausible explanation of a significant high-energy impact (e.g. a road traffic accident), discovering a long bone fracture in a pre-ambulant infant should always raise suspicion of physical abuse. Physiological periosteal new bone formation along the shaft of the long bones is a common feature in infants between the ages of 1–4 months of age, and should be differentiated from isolated subperiosteal new bone formation.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on endovascular trauma intervention in the pediatric population [^6c0d0d88]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric extremity vascular injury imaging — diagnostic pathways and modality roles include proposed algorithms for "hard" and "soft" signs guiding CT angiography or duplex scanning, and reports that CT angiography and duplex scanning have 100% correlation with operative findings without unplanned operations. A retrospective series in 24 children supported angiography and vascular repair when pulses did not return after fracture reduction, whereas another series of 66 children noted angiography may be insufficient and the authors suggested against CT angiography prior to operative repair, supporting noninvasive Doppler sonography before surgery; magnetic resonance angiography or color-flow duplex were suggested after repair to assess brachial artery patency. A retrospective study of 22 patients developed a protocol eliminating vascular radiography prior to operative treatment of lower-extremity vascular injuries.

### Splint vs. cast for forearm buckle fracture in children… [^d2885a0c]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Children with confirmed forearm buckle fractures Efficacy End Points: Functional recovery and patient satisfaction Harm End Points: Complications, defined as refracture, cast heaviness, cast tightness, and cast-related return visits. The meta-analysis included data from randomized controlled trials that enrolled children two to 16 years of age with forearm buckle fractures confirmed by ultrasonography or radiography. Main outcomes included recovery of physical and social functions, complications, and patient satisfaction. The analysis included eight relevant randomized controlled trials with 781 total patients. 3 The systematic review reported pooled outcomes of complications occurring in patients treated with casts and splints.

Data from three of the eight studies included in the systematic review were pooled because they were the only trials that reported complications. The meta-analysis found that patients undergoing cast immobilization experienced more complications than those immobilized by splint or other nonrigid methods. Complications mentioned in the trials included refracture, cast heaviness, cast tightness, and return to the emergency department due to cast-related damage.
3. The systematic review could not combine data for outcomes regarding functional recovery or patient satisfaction because of the paucity of data from trials. Through these studies, the authors of the systematic review reported that patients treated with nonrigid methods had better recovery of wrist motion, quicker return to normal activity, and less overall disability.

It was unclear which intervention resulted in a shorter duration of pain. The authors also concluded that patients and their parents were more comfortable with nonrigid immobilization and would choose splints over casts in the future. However, these findings are based on single small trials. Conclusion: The existing but limited evidence supports the use of nonrigid immobilization techniques for the treatment of buckle fractures in children. Although the evidence is lacking on which method is superior in the long-term, the nonrigid method is associated with fewer complications and probably offers more comfort and higher patient satisfaction. We have assigned a color recommendation of green for using nonrigid immobilization techniques for the treatment of buckle fractures in children.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of the musculoskeletal ultrasound examination [^e1ba94d0]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Elbow ultrasound — medial and posterior evaluation includes the medial epicondyle, common flexor tendon, and ulnar collateral ligament; the ulnar nerve is visualized in the cubital tunnel between the olecranon process and medial epicondyle; dynamic examination with valgus stress is performed to assess integrity of the ulnar collateral ligament and during valgus stress testing the elbow may have to be flexed at variable angles; to evaluate the posterior elbow, the elbow is flexed to 90° and the posterior joint space, triceps brachii tendon, olecranon process, and olecranon bursa are assessed; in infants without elbow ossification centers, ultrasonography with comparison imaging of the contralateral normal side can confirm normal radiocapitellar alignment and identify components of a lateral condyle fracture when the distal humeral epiphysis is not yet ossified and fracture components are radiographically occult.

### Omitting routine radiography of traumatic distal radial fractures after initial 2-week follow-up does not affect outcomes [^6909f03d]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Routine radiography in the follow-up of distal radial fractures is common practice, although its usefulness is disputed. The aim of this study was to determine whether the number of radiographs in the follow-up period can be reduced without resulting in worse patient outcomes.

Methods

In this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial with a non-inferiority design, patients ≥ 18 years old with a distal radial fracture could participate. They were randomized between a regimen with routine radiographs at 6 and 12 weeks of follow-up (usual care) and a regimen without routine radiographs at those time points (reduced imaging). Randomization was performed using an online registration and randomization program. The primary outcome was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Secondary outcomes included the Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) score, health-related quality of life, pain, and complications. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year of follow-up. Data were analyzed using mixed models. Neither the patients nor the health-care providers were blinded.

Results

Three hundred and eighty-six patients were randomized, and 326 of them were ultimately included in the analysis. The DASH scores were comparable between the usual-care group (n = 166) and the reduced-imaging group (n = 160) at all time points as well as overall. The adjusted regression coefficient for the DASH scores was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.8 to 4.8). There was also no difference between the groups with respect to the overall PRWHE score (adjusted regression coefficient, 1.4 [95% CI = -2.4 to 5.2]), quality of life as measured with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) (-0.02 [95% CI = -0.05 to 0.01]), pain at rest as measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) (0.1 [95% CI = -0.2 to 0.5]), or pain when moving (0.3 [95% CI = -0.1 to 0.8]). The complication rate was similar in the reduced imaging group (11.3%) and the usual-care group (11.4%). Fewer radiographs were made for the participants in the reduced-imaging group (median, 3 versus 4; p < 0.05).

Conclusions

This study shows that omitting routine radiography after the initial 2 weeks of follow-up for patients with a distal radial fracture does not affect patient-reported outcomes or the risk of complications compared with usual care.

### Does early conversion to below-elbow casting for pediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures adversely affect patient-reported outcomes and ROM? [^e8ec4f43]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

For distal forearm fractures in children, it has been shown that a below-elbow cast is an adequate treatment that overcomes the discomfort of an above-elbow cast and unnecessary immobilization of the elbow. For reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures, our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) — which compared an above-elbow cast with early conversion to a below-elbow cast — revealed no differences in the risk of redisplacement or functional outcomes at short-term follow-up. Although studies with a longer follow-up after diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children are scarce, they are essential, as growth might affect the outcome.

Questions/purposes

In this secondary analysis of an earlier RCT, we asked: (1) Does early conversion from an above-elbow to a below-elbow cast in children with reduced, stable diaphyseal forearm fractures result in worse clinical and radiological outcome? (2) Does a malunion result in inferior clinical outcomes at 7.5 years of follow-up?

Methods

In this study, we evaluated children at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up who were included in a previous RCT. The median (range) duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (5.2 to 9.9). The patients for this RCT were included from the emergency departments of four different urban hospitals. Between January 2006 and August 2010, we treated 128 patients for reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures. All 128 patients were eligible; 24% (31) were excluded because they were lost before the minimum study follow-up or had incomplete datasets, leaving 76% (97) for secondary analysis. The loss in the follow-up group was comparable to the included population. Eligible patients were invited for secondary functional and radiographic assessment. The primary outcome was the difference in forearm rotation compared with the uninjured contralateral arm. Secondary outcomes were the ABILHAND-kids and QuickDASH questionnaire, loss of flexion and extension of the elbow and wrist compared with the contralateral forearm, JAMAR grip strength ratio, and radiological assessment of residual deformity. The study was not blinded regarding the children, parents, and clinicians.

Results

At 7.5-year follow-up, there were no differences in ABILHAND-kids questionnaire score (above-elbow cast: 41 ± 2.4 versus above/below-elbow cast: 41.7 ± 0.7, mean difference -0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.4 to 0.04]; p = 0.06), QuickDASH (above-elbow cast: 5.8 ± 9.6 versus 2.9 ± 6.0 for above-/below-elbow cast, mean difference 2.9 [95% CI -0.5 to 6.2]; p = 0.92), and grip strength (0.9 ± 0.2 for above-elbow cast versus 1 ± 0.2 for above/below-elbow cast, mean difference -0.04 [95% CI -1 to 0.03]; p = 0.24). Functional outcomes showed no difference (loss of forearm rotation: above-elbow cast 7.9 ± 17.7 versus 4.1 ± 6.9 for above-/below-elbow cast, mean difference 3.8 [95% CI -1.7 to 9.4]; p = 0.47; arc of motion: above-elbow cast 152° ± 21° versus 155° ± 11° for the above/below-elbow cast group, mean difference -2.5 [95% CI -9.3 to -4.4]; p = 0.17; loss of wrist flexion-extension: above-elbow cast group 1.0° ± 5.0° versus 0.6° ± 4.2° for above/below-elbow cast, mean difference 0.4° [95% CI -1.5° to 2.2°]; p = 0.69). The secondary follow-up showed improvement in forearm rotation in both groups compared with the rotation at 7 months. For radiographical analysis, the only difference was in AP ulna (above-elbow cast: 6° ± 3° versus above/below-elbow cast: 5° ± 2°, mean difference 1.8° [0.7° to 3°]; p = 0.003), although this is likely not clinically relevant. There were no differences in the other parameters. Thirteen patients with persistent malunion at 7-month follow-up showed no clinically relevant differences in functional outcomes at 7.5-year follow-up compared with children without malunion. The loss of forearm rotation was 5.5ׄ° ± 9.1° for the malunion group compared with 6.0° ± 13.9° in the no malunion group, with a mean difference of 0.4 (95% CI of -7.5 to 8.4; p = 0.92).

Conclusion

In light of these results, we suggest that surgeons perform an early conversion to a below-elbow cast for reduced diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children. This study shows that even in patients with secondary fracture displacement, remodeling occurred. And even in persistent malunion, these patients mostly showed good-to-excellent final results. Future studies, such as a meta-analysis or a large, prospective observational study, would help to establish the influence of skeletal age, sex, and the severity and direction of malunion angulation of both the radius and ulna on clinical result. Furthermore, a similar systematic review could prove beneficial in clarifying the acceptable angulation for pediatric lower extremity fractures.

### A clinical decision rule for the use of plain radiography in children after acute wrist injury: development and external validation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^ee362523]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

After applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules in seven patients (4.3%), a fracture would have been missed. The missed fractures consisted of six buckle fractures of the distal radius and one non-displaced distal radius fracture with a buckle component without displacement. According to literature and an expert panel consisting of two pediatric surgeons, one trauma surgeon and one orthopedic surgeon, none of these fractures needed closed reduction or operative treatment, but would have been treated with a splint. This type of treatment is identical to treatment for children without a fracture who are diagnosed with a contusion or sprain of the wrist. We also expect that in children in a lot of pain, physicians are more likely to give a cast for pain regulation. Therefore, we consider that the treatment and prognosis would not have been influenced by a missed or delayed diagnosis. Moreover, in children with stable buckle fractures, it is known that subacute treatment does no lead to adverse clinical outcomes. However, a follow-up evaluation by telephone, or the advice to contact the hospital if symptoms remain after 1 week, can be considered for patients who did not initially require a radiograph, according to the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules.

Because physicians were not obligated to refer patients for radiography, in 12 patients no radiograph of the wrist was obtained. These patients were not included in the study, but none of these 12 children returned to the hospital for persisting complaints in the following 4 weeks.

A limitation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules is its specificity of 37.3%. We could have generated a higher specificity by using another threshold, but this would have led to a decrease in the sensitivity and thus an increase of missed fractures. In accordance with Maguire et al. we judged it would not be applicable since it misses > 5% of fractures in children. Since we aimed to reduce the number of requested wrist radiographs, a threshold compromise between missed fractures and reduction of radiographs was chosen. According to the literature, we determined that about three avoided radiographs outweigh one missed fracture and therefore we used a threshold value of 23.0% (1/25) for the predicted probability. The sensitivity prediction rule was 96%. Adding anamnestic variables to the model could possibly strengthen our prediction rule and result in a higher sensitivity. However, since children are not always capable or trustworthy of telling what type of trauma occurred, we did not take clinical history variables into account.

### Diagnostic value of "bedside ultrasonography" and the "water bath technique" in distal forearm, wrist, and hand bone fractures [^6f9a762e]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasonography (BUS) has been widely used in many emergency evaluations, but the technique was not thoroughly evaluated for use in adult fractures. The water bath technique (WBT) is a modality which overcomes some important limitations of using BUS in extremity fractures. The study aims to evaluate and compare diagnostic values of BUS and WBT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and accuracy of BUS and WBT were calculated and compared by the McNemar chi-square test. BUS had the highest sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and LR+ in the distal forearm. The highest NPV and LR- of BUS were seen in phalangeal and wrist injuries, respectively. The WBT examination had the highest sensitivity in phalangeal injuries and the highest specificity, PPV, and LR+ in the distal forearm. The highest NPV and LR- of the WBT examination were seen in phalangeal and wrist injuries, respectively. The McNemar χ² values for the comparison of BUS and WBT indicate that the two techniques provide statistically different results. The ultrasound revealed excellent diagnostic values which make it a favorable alternative in evaluating upper extremity fractures in adults. The WBT provides even better results.

### Fingertip injuries [^930b4a20]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Jersey finger — imaging and initial management: Imaging studies, such as radiography and ultrasonography, are used to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for the presence of any associated fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used for a more detailed view of the soft tissue structures and improve preoperative localization of the tendon. Once jersey finger is diagnosed, the finger should be splinted, and expedited referral to a hand surgeon should be pursued. Prompt surgical management is necessary to avoid tendon retraction and decreased blood supply that could affect surgical outcomes.

### ACR-AIUM-SPR-SSR-SRU practice parameter for the performance of the musculoskeletal ultrasound examination [^27901611]. SPR/ACR/SRU/AIUM/SSR (2022). High credibility.

Elbow ultrasound in infants — assessment when ossification centers are absent — notes that radiographic distinction between elbow dislocation and transphyseal fracture-displacement is challenging and ultrasound can be helpful, particularly with contralateral comparison. Technique guidance states that placing the transducer in the longitudinal plane anteriorly or anterolaterally on the elbow can confirm normal radiocapitellar alignment in the absence of a dislocation, it can assess for disruption at the level of the humeral physis, and ultrasound can identify components of a lateral condyle fracture when the distal humeral epiphysis is not yet ossified and fracture components are radiographically occult.

### A clinical decision rule for the use of plain radiography in children after acute wrist injury: development and external validation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^07ddf2cf]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

External model validation and final model development

To assess general applicability, we validated the model in the cohort that included all children enrolled in the three other participating hospitals. For each patient in the three other hospitals (the validation cohort), the probability of a distal forearm fracture was calculated using the prediction model. To estimate the ability of the model to discriminate between patients with and without a fracture, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.5 means that the test is not predictive. An AUC of 1.0 means that the predictive value is very high. The agreement between observed outcomes and predictions (the calibration of the model) was determined by plotting the predicted probability of a fracture and the observed frequency of a fracture. A slope of 1 is ideal for the observed outcomes versus predicted risk.

In order to provide a recommendation (whether to perform radiography or not), we established a cutoff value for a predicted probability. Previous literature used a threshold varying from 20% to 25% for the use of radiography in children and adolescents for detecting upper extremity injury. Therefore, we used a threshold probability of 23% (the mean of 20–25%), beyond which the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules recommend radiographic imaging for all children with wrist trauma and below which none would undergo radiographic imaging.

As a final step, the model was fitted on data from both cohorts combined to obtain the final estimates of the regression coefficients.

### Minimal intervention (removable splint or bandage) for the management of distal forearm fractures in children and adolescents: a scoping review [^199c23e8]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Distal forearm fractures are common in children and adolescents with a spectrum of severity. There are fracture patterns that are suitable for minimal interventions, such as a splint or bandage. The objective of this review was to identify which types of paediatric distal forearm fractures can be safely and effectively managed with a removable splint or bandage.

Materials and Methods

A scoping review was performed. Databases searched were PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL; two trial registries were also searched. All primary study designs with children < 18 years of age with a distal forearm fracture that was managed in either a splint or bandage were included. Quality of evidence was determined using the GRADE tool.

Results

Twenty-two eligible articles were included from 20 unique studies: 12 randomised controlled trials, seven cohort studies and a case report. Twelve studies focused solely on buckle/torus fractures, with remaining studies including other fracture types, such as incomplete ('greenstick'), complete ('transverse'), or physeal (Salter-Harris). Twelve studies reported that participants with either bandage or splint had appropriate reduction in pain and recovery of function at completion of follow-up for all fracture types. All 20 studies reported minimal adverse events related to fracture management. One study reported worsening angulation with bandage immobilisation for complete fractures in two participants, which required manipulation under anaesthesia.

Discussion

There is high quality evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of a splint or bandage for treatment of distal radius buckle and non-displaced incomplete fractures. Several studies supported the use of minimal interventions for various distal radius cortical breach fracture types, with good outcomes, but were limited by heterogeneity (methodology, interventions, outcome measures, reference standard) and potential bias.

Conclusions

Included studies confirmed the inherent stability of buckle fractures. The current literature gap to support minimal interventions for a range of other paediatric distal forearm fracture types was highlighted. High-quality evidence with well-designed, large, multicentre randomised control trials in defined age groups is required to identify which paediatric distal forearm fractures can be safely and effectively managed with either a removable splint or bandage.

### Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for hand bony fractures in paediatric patients [^82f1f5de]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hand fractures are common in childhood, and radiography is the standard diagnostic procedure. US has been used to evaluate bone injuries, mainly in adults for long-bone trauma; there are only a few studies about hand fractures in children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and confirm the safety and applicability of the US diagnostic procedure in comparison to X-ray diagnosis.

Study Design

This cross-sectional study involved a convenience sample of young patients (between 2 and 17years old) who were taken to the emergency department due to hand trauma. After clinical assessment, patients with a suspected hand fracture first underwent X-ray, and subsequently US examination by two different operators; a radiologist experienced in US and a trained emergency physician in "double-blind" fashion. US and radiographic findings were then compared, and sensitivity as well as specificity was calculated.

Results

A total of 204 patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy-nine fractures of phalanges or metacarpals were detected by standard radiography. When US imaging was performed by an expert radiologist, 72 fractures were detected with sensitivity and a specificity of 91.1% and 97.6%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were found to be (respectively) 91.5% and 96.8% when US was performed by the ED physicians.

Conclusions

US imaging showed excellent sensitivity and specificity results in the diagnosis of hand fractures in children. The study also showed a great agreement between the results of the US carried out by the senior radiologist and those carried out by the paediatric emergency physician, suggesting that US can be performed by an ED physician, allowing a rapid and accurate evaluation in ED and could become the first diagnostic approach whenever a hand fracture is suspected.

### A clinical decision rule for the use of plain radiography in children after acute wrist injury: development and external validation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^ef172f8b]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

Wrist trauma was defined as any high or low energetic accident involving the wrist. Corresponding to the protocol of the adult study population, wrist injury was defined as injury to the proximal segment of the hand, including the carpal bones and the associated soft parts, and the distal one third of the ulnar and radial bone. Since the incidence of carpal fractures in children is low and since scaphoid fractures are frequently occult on plain radiography, carpal fractures were not taken into account. A fracture was defined as a disruption of one or more of the cortices of the bone. Buckle fractures or bowing fractures were also recorded as a true fracture, as were fissures and avulsions. A combined fracture of the ulna and radius, known as an antebrachii fracture, was recorded as one fracture.

Data collection and variables

We used standardized case record forms to prospectively collect our data in all four participating hospitals. The case record form consisted of 18 clinical variables, including patient characteristics, physical examination and functional testing (Appendix 1). All variables were selected after evaluation of previous studies and consensus agreement of clinical experts. All variables on the case record form, in exception of grip strength, were dichotomous (yes/no). The attending physician included eligible children after physical examination. The case record forms were filled in after physical examination. The assessors were all physicians and included consultant emergency medicine physicians, general practice registrars, and specialist registrars of the departments of (trauma) surgery, emergency medicine or orthopedics. All physicians received regular instructions and training before recruiting children to the study. Additionally, informative pocket cards and posters were provided. In order not to disrupt common practice, referral for radiography was left to the discretion of the attending physician.

### A clinical decision rule for the use of plain radiography in children after acute wrist injury: development and external validation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^53781ff8]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our derived prediction model, the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, is a valuable tool for physicians in the emergency department in deciding if referral for radiography is required in children after acute wrist trauma. We showed that a combination of six clinical variables was able to discriminate between children with and without a fracture with an AUC of 0.79.

By applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, the number of requested radiographs would have been reduced by 22%. The incidence of children with a fracture in the Netherlands in 2009 was 4.465 per 100,000 children from 5–19 year old. Since approximately 50% of the children with wrist injury are diagnosed with a fracture, this resulted in 8,930 children with wrist injury per 100,000 children in 2009. By applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, radiographic imaging could have been prevented in almost 2,000 children per 100,000 (22% reduction). At a price of 48 Euro/$50 per radiograph, the possible reduction of health care cost will be 96.000 euro per 100,000 children annually. This amount is probably an underestimation because the provided incidence included children ages 5–19 years old and the population that could benefit from the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules is 3–18 years old. As was the case following the implementation study of the Ottawa Ankle Rules, a reduction in waiting time may be expected after applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules. Additionally, we assume that applying the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules will generate a reduction in radiation exposure. Although radiation exposure of plain radiography of the wrist is low (effective dose: 0.16 μSv), it is important to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure according to the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), especially in children. Obtaining a US for detecting wrist fractures in children might also reduce radiation exposure; however, only a few studies have been performed, all with small study groups. Moreover, it is unclear if the use of sonography leads to a reduction in health care costs.

### Elbow extension test to rule out elbow fracture: multicentre, prospective validation and observational study of diagnostic accuracy in adults and children [^0893b578]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with previous studies

The incidences of full elbow extension and fracture in our study were similar to those reported in previous smaller studies. The sensitivity of the test was also consistent with these studies, but with much narrower confidence intervals. Lennon et al recommended testing a full range of all elbow movements (extension, flexion, and supination) to exclude the need for radiography. However, although they report a sensitivity of 97.6%, similar to that seen in our study, they excluded patients "not requiring an x ray", and the reduced specificity of 21% undermines the value of this approach in practice. This more complicated test therefore seems to have no advantage over testing full extension alone.

Modifying the elbow extension test in an attempt to improve sensitivity would probably undermine its specificity and clinical usefulness. Elbow extension alone is a highly sensitive test, is effective in routine practice, and can usefully inform clinical decision making.

### Evidence-based guideline: neuromuscular ultrasound for the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow [^f3a5281f]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). High credibility.

Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) — Pompe and Beekman studied 191 patients from August 2009 to September 2010; sensitivities and specificities for ultrasonographic cutoffs included maximum diameter > 2.9 mm (68% and 79%), maximum CSA ≥ 8 mm² (74% and 72%), upper arm swelling ratio > 2.1 (60% and 74%), and forearm swelling ratio > 2.3 (65% and 79%), and they concluded that ultrasonographic measurements of ulnar nerve diameter, CSA, and swelling ratio have comparable diagnostic accuracy.

### Evaluation of elbow pain in adults [^abdfae79]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities. Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients have pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion that are accentuated with specific movements. If lateral and medial epicondylitis treatments are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered. Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic, and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary. Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of commonly injured structures.

### Pediatric and adolescent forearm fractures: current controversies and treatment recommendations [^e52de4ea]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric and adolescent forearm fractures continue to present treatment challenges. Despite high-level evidence to the contrary, traditional guidelines for nonsurgical treatment have been challenged in favor of surgical intervention, but it is unclear if this results in improved outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that certain open fractures in children may be successfully treated nonsurgically. Good results have been achieved with closed reduction and appropriate casting and clinical follow-up. Further research investigating functional outcomes into adulthood is needed.

### Emergency ultrasound in the detection of pediatric long-bone fractures [^a0cb9012]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Long-bone fractures represent one of the most commonly sustained injuries following trauma and account for nearly 4% of emergency department visits in the United States each year. These fractures are associated with a significant risk of bleeding and neurovascular compromise. Delays in their identification and treatment can lead to loss of limb and even death. Although emergency physicians currently rely predominantly on radiography for the examination of long-bone injuries, emergency ultrasound has several advantages over radiography and may be useful in the identification of long-bone fractures. Ultrasound is rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective. Unlike radiography, ultrasound does not expose children to ionizing radiation, which has been linked to cancer.

Objective

The goal of this study was to assess the agreement between emergency physicians' and radiologists' final assessments of suspected long-bone fractures using emergency ultrasound and radiography, respectively, in the pediatric population.

Methods

This is a prospective study involving a convenience sample of pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) who presented to the emergency department of a university-affiliated, level I trauma center between March 2008 and January 2009 with at least 1 suspected long-bone fracture. Suspected fractures were characterized by swelling, erythema, and localized pain. Patients who had a history of fracture, extremity deformity, orthopedic hardware in the traumatized area, or an open fracture were excluded from this study. Each investigator received limited, focused training in the use of ultrasonography for fracture identification and localization. This training consisted of a brief didactic session and video review of normal and fractured long-bones.

Results

A total of 53 subjects (mean age, 10.2 [SD, 3.8] years; 56.6% were male) were enrolled, which corresponded to 98 ultrasound examinations. Sixty-nine scans (70.4%) involved bones of the upper extremity, and 29 (29.6%) the lower extremity. Radiography identified a total of 43 fractures. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in the detection of long-bone fractures were 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.9%-99.2%) and 85.5% (95% CI, 72.8%-93.1%), respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 83.7% (95% CI, 68.8%-92.2%) and 96% (95% CI, 84.9%-99.3%), respectively. Overall, ultrasound detected 100.0% of diaphyseal fractures and 27 (93.1%) of 29 end-of-bone or near-joint fractures. Radiography revealed 6 displacements that met the published criteria for reduction, all of which were also revealed by ultrasound. The overall sensitivity and specificity for ultrasound identifying the need for reduction were 100.0% (95% CI, 51.7%-100.0%) and 97.3% (95% CI, 84.2%-99.9%), respectively, and positive and negative predictive values were 85.7% (95% CI, 42.0%-99.2%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 88.0%-100.0%), respectively.

Conclusions

Emergency department physician-performed focused ultrasound was more accurate in detecting diaphyseal fractures than in detecting fractures in the metaphysis and/or epiphysis. The high sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in the detection of long-bone fractures and the need for reduction support the use of ultrasound in the evaluation of suspected long-bone fractures in children.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^193a4cca]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Other imaging — children with suspected intentional injury: CT of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended when clinical suspicion of intrathoracic vascular injury exists, whereas CT of the chest without contrast has higher sensitivity for rib fractures than radiograph but is considered an adjunctive exam and routine use is not recommended. Tc-99m whole-body bone scan is an adjunctive examination for the detection of fractures and has utility when clinical suspicion is high but the skeletal survey is negative or findings are equivocal or subtle; venipuncture is required for radiotracer injection and sedation is often required because image acquisition requires a stationary patient for a longer interval compared to other modalities. Ultrasound does not have a role in the imaging work-up of children with suspected intentional injury.

### Does fluoroscopy improve outcomes in paediatric forearm fracture reduction? [^09efba75]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the radiographic results of paediatric forearm fracture reduced with and without fluoroscopic enhancement to investigate whether fractures reduced under fluoroscopic guidance would have smaller residual deformities and lower rates of re-reduction and surgery.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted comparing paediatric patients with acute forearm fracture in two trauma centres. Demographics and radiographic data from paediatric forearm fractures treated in Trauma Centre A with the aid of a C-arm fluoroscopy were compared to those treated without fluoroscopy in Trauma Centre B. Re-reduction, late displacement, post-reduction deformity, and need for surgical intervention were compared between the two groups.

Results

The cohort included 229 children (175 boys and 54 girls, mean age 9.41 ± 3.2 years, range 1–16 years) with unilateral forearm fractures (83 manipulated with fluoroscopy and 146 without). Thirty-four (15%) children underwent re-reduction procedures in the emergency department. Fifty-three (23%) children had secondary displacement in the cast, of which 18 were operated on, 20 were re-manipulated, and the remaining 15 were kept in the cast with an acceptable deformity. Twenty-nine additional children underwent operation for reasons other than secondary displacement. There were no significant differences in re-reduction and surgery rates or in post-reduction deformities between the two groups.

Conclusion

The use of fluoroscopy during reduction of forearm fractures in the paediatric population apparently does not have a significant effect on patient outcomes. Reductions performed without fluoroscopy were comparably accurate in correcting deformities in both coronal and sagittal planes.

### Conservative interventions for treating diaphyseal fractures of the forearm bones in children [^f45b0ac8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diaphyseal forearm fractures in children are common injuries, the vast majority of which are treated conservatively. There is a need to assess the role of modifiable factors such as techniques of reduction and casting in order to optimise functional recovery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different conservative interventions for diaphyseal forearm fractures in children, including adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2012 Issue 11), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2012), EMBASE (1980 to November 2012), CINAHL (1982 to November 2012), trial registries (to November 2012), conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing conservative interventions for diaphyseal forearm fractures in children were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently examined search results to identify eligible trials.

Main Results

After screening 493 citations, 17 potentially eligible studies were identified. Of these 13 studies were excluded, two studies, both reported incompletely in conference abstracts only, await assessment and two are ongoing trials whose recruitment status is unknown.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no usable evidence from randomised trials to make recommendations concerning different conservative interventions for the treatment of diaphyseal fractures of the forearm bones in children. Publication in full of trials that have already been performed on this topic would be a useful start to changing this unsatisfactory situation.

### Accuracy of clinician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of fractures in children and young adults [^d151b9cc]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Injury is a major cause of death and disability in children and young adults worldwide. X-rays are routinely performed to evaluate injuries with suspected fractures. However, the World Health Organisation estimates that up to 75% of the world population has no access to any diagnostic imaging services. Use of clinician-performed point-of-care ultrasound to diagnose fractures is not only feasible in traditional healthcare settings, but also in underserved or remote settings. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of clinician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of fractures in children and young adults presenting to an acute care setting.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients aged < 25 years that presented to emergency departments with injuries requiring X-rays or CT for suspected fracture. Paediatric emergency physicians with a 1h training session diagnosed fractures by point-of-care ultrasound. X-rays or CT were used as the reference standard to determine test performance characteristics.

Results

Point-of-care ultrasound was performed on 212 children and young adults with 348 suspected fractures. Forty-two percent of all bones imaged were non-long bones. The prevalence rate of fracture was 24%. Overall: sensitivity-73% (95% CI: 62–82%), specificity-92% (95% CI: 88–95%); long bones: sensitivity-73% (58–84%), specificity-92% (86–95%); non-long bones: sensitivity-77% (58–90%); specificity-93% (87–97%); age ≥ 18 years: sensitivity-60% (39–78%), specificity-92% (87–96%); age < 18: sensitivity-78 (65–87%), specificity-93% (87–95)%. Majority of errors in diagnosis (> 85%) occurred at the ends-of-bones.

Conclusions

Clinicians with focused ultrasound training were able to diagnose fractures using point-of-care ultrasound with a high specificity rate. Specificity rates to rule-in fracture were similar for non-long bone and long bone fractures, as well as in skeletally mature young adults and children with open growth plates. Clinician-performed point-of-care ultrasound accuracy was highest at the diaphyses of long bones, while most diagnostic errors were committed at the ends-of-bones or near joints. Point-of-care ultrasound may serve as a rapid alternative means to diagnose midshaft fractures in settings with limited or no access to X-ray.

### One brace: one visit: treatment of pediatric distal radius buckle fractures with a removable wrist brace and No follow-up visit [^d969832f]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have showed the efficacy of removable brace treatment for distal radius buckle fractures in children, whereas others have independently suggested that these injuries do not require additional radiographic imaging. However, no study has sought to collectively determine whether treating pediatric distal radius buckle fractures with a removable brace and no follow-up visit or imaging after the initial visit is a safe and satisfactory protocol.

Methods

In total, 42 consecutive patients with a distal forearm buckle fracture seen by a single fellowship trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeon were eligible to participate. Two patients refused participation, yielding 40 patients treated with a standard protocol of immobilization with a removable wrist brace for a prescribed period of time with no additional imaging or clinical follow-up. Two staggered telephone surveys were then conducted. The first survey was conducted within 1 week of the designated brace-removal date to determine the exact date the brace was discontinued. The second survey was conducted 5 to10 months postinjury to determine patient outcomes and parent satisfaction.

Results

In total, 100% of patients were reached for the initial survey and 90% (36/40) of patients were reached for the secondary survey. There were no complications, including refracture or residual pain, following treatment. In total, 100% of parents felt their child had returned to full and normal function and all said they would choose to have the same treatment again. In total, 67% of parents would have had to take time off from work and 77% of children would have missed school if they had hypothetically been required to attend a follow-up appointment.

Conclusion

Treatment of pediatric distal forearm buckle fractures with a removable wrist brace and no follow-up visit or radiographs results in both excellent patient outcomes and parental satisfaction.

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^ceef5e9c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Epiphyseal Separations

Only designated a moderate-specificity injury, the epiphyseal separation fracture requires special mention since it is often overlooked and the images are frequently misinterpreted by those who are not comfortable with pediatric imaging.

In an epiphyseal separation, the fracture occurs through the cartilaginous physis, usually with displacement of the epiphysis. Since the epiphysis is frequently not ossified or only slightly ossified, the displacement may not be apparent to the casual observer. At the shoulder where this type of injury is frequent, there may be a subtle malalignment of the metaphysis to the glenoid. Delayed images will frequently show subperiosteal hemorrhage along the humeral shaft and then the injury will be more obvious, but at times only subtle irregularity on the metaphyseal end of the physis may be present.

At the hip, some cases of infantile coxa vara may be due to early epiphyseal separations at the proximal femoral physis.

At the elbow, which is another site of epiphyseal separation, the fracture is commonly misinterpreted as a dislocation, but dislocations essentially do not occur in the infant elbow, the physis being a far more fragile item than the fibrous structures that reinforce the joint. In the majority of cases, the distal epiphysis moves medially and posteriorly with respect to the humeral metaphysis. The proximal radioulnar joint remains completely concordant, but a line drawn along the radial metaphysis does not intersect with the expected location of the cartilaginous capitellum. Instead, the line lies medial to its correct location and on the lateral view it lies posterior. Confirmation of the true nature of the lesion can be obtained with ultrasound or MRI (Fig. 7). The ultrasound examination is preferable since sedation is not necessary, and in the hands of an experienced sonographer, the separation of the nonossified epiphysis from the ossified metaphysis is well seen.

Fig. 7A–B
(A) A lateral radiograph of the elbow of a 1-year-old child shows the capitellum (arrow) is posteriorly displaced along with the radius and ulna. The fracture plane has run through the zone of provisional calcification (arrowhead) of the distal humerus. (B) A coronal sonographic image of the distal humerus identifies the fractured and displaced zone of provisional calcification as an irregular curvilinear echogenic density (arrowheads).

### Evaluating young children with fractures for child abuse: clinical report [^8f3986a0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Distal humerus epiphyseal separations — Displaced physeal fractures or epiphyseal separations can be the result of abuse, particularly in the distal humerus. This injury, also termed a transphyseal humerus fracture, is 13 times more likely to be abusive than displaced supracondylar humerus fractures in children, and the typical pattern is a displaced Salter-Harris 1 fracture in a child younger than 1 year. One study found the diagnosis was missed on 56% of plain radiography but confirmed by ultrasonography in 100% of cases, with 38% of cases (all in children younger than 1 month old) secondary to birth trauma and 40% the result of abuse. Skeletal survey is necessary not only in infants with distal humerus fracture with epiphyseal separation but also in children 12 through 23 months of age when the mechanism of injury provided is a short fall.

### Optimal site for ultrasound-guided venous catheterisation in paediatric patients: an observational study to investigate predictors for catheterisation success and a randomised controlled study to determine the most successful site [^8c880bc0]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Catheterisation of the cephalic vein in the straight portion of the proximal forearm is not only easier and faster than at other sites but also less likely to suffer kinking resulting from patient movement. The great saphenous vein is further disadvantaged because it is difficult to detect extravasation at this site since it is often unavailable for intra-operative inspection. We thus conclude that the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm is the most appropriate initial site for ultrasound-guided catheterisation attempts.

The sensory branch of the radial nerve emerges proximally at an average distance of 8 cm (range of 6 to 11 cm) from the styloid process of the radius in adults. Some have therefore suggested that cephalic vein catheterisation be performed at least 12 cm above the styloid process of the radius in adults. A study of adult cadavers demonstrated that the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve travels in close proximity to the cephalic vein in the proximal forearm, indicating that cephalic vein catheterisation in the proximal forearm might lead to lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve injury.

The saphenous nerve travels along the saphenous vein, splitting into numerous branches. At the ankle, the great saphenous vein lies close to the saphenous nerve or below the nerve; thus, venepuncture of the great saphenous vein at the ankle also carries a risk of nerve injury. Nerve injuries of the dorsal sensory branches of the hand during venepuncture have also been reported in adults. It remains unclear whether these findings can be applied to paediatric patients. No nerve injuries were observed among our 268 patients; furthermore, we are unaware of reports of nerve injury resulting from either cephalic or saphenous vein catheterisation in paediatric patients.

It remains unclear whether an in-plane or out-of-plane approach is preferable for peripheral vascular catheterisation. We used the out-of-plane approach because the in-plane approach can produce slice-thickness artefacts which might diminish the benefit of ultrasound guidance. Furthermore, a 24-gauge catheter can appear to be in the same plane as a thin target vein on in-plane views, even in unsuccessful catheterisation.

### Are serial radiographs needed in torus fractures… [^e3427439]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

A torus, or "buckle, " fracture of the distal radius is a common type of fracture in children. The standard treatment for these nondisplaced fractures is casting for three to four weeks. Serial radiographs are often obtained, such as immediately after application of the cast and again a week or so later. To determine whether repeat radiographs are necessary, Farbman and colleagues assessed the utility of follow-up radiographs in 70 children with torus fractures of the distal radius or ulna. The authors' medical center had no standard protocol for follow-up radiography in patients with torus fractures. Radiographs before and immediately after casting were obtained in the emergency department in 24 of the children. All but five of the 70 children were subsequently seen in the orthopedic clinic at least four weeks after the injury. Repeat radiographs were obtained as early as two days and as late as seven weeks after the fracture.

Follow-up films were obtained twice in 21 children, three times in 12 children and four times in five children. The most common reasons for repeat radiographs were documentation of healing and diagnostic confirmation. The casts remained in place for at least two weeks in all of the children, and casts were removed before the fourth week in 20 children. The average number of follow-up radiographs was 3. 3 studies per patient. At a cost of $119 per study at the authors' institution, this translates to a total cost of $27, 251 for radiology services rendered to the 70 patients in the study. The authors cite a study of follow-up radiographs in adults with stable ankle fractures. That study revealed that an average of 4. 5 ankle radiographs per patient was obtained, but no radiographs demonstrated a change in fibular alignment in any patient.

The authors calculated that as much as $35 million would be saved annually if routine follow-up radiographs were not performed in patients with torus fractures. The authors note that there are no national guidelines that stipulate any medical indications for postcasting radiographs in children with torus fractures, nor does the medical literature support the need for follow-up radiographs one or two weeks after the fracture. Repeat films are recommended to check for displacement after casting only in the presence of dorsal angulation and bicortical fracture or of unicortical fracture through the entire bone to the opposite cortex.

### Treatment choice of complete distal forearm fractures in 8 to 14 years old children [^2b474f8b]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

After approval from the Institutional Review Board, a retrospective chart review was carried out of all patients treated for complete distal third forearm fractures (including both radius and ulna, isolated radial fractures, and injuries to the epiphysis) between 2010 and 2017 at Children's Hospital of Soochow University, a large children's medical center in Jiangsu Province. Patients were identified by IDC-10 codes for forearm fractures (code no. S52). Exclusion criteria included open fractures, mid-diaphyseal and proximal fractures, intra-articular fractures (ie, Salter-Harris type-III or IV fractures), buckle or greenstick fractures, fractures with neurovascular compromise or compartment syndrome, floating elbow, distal radioulnar joint or elbow dislocations, critically ill patients, patients requiring emergency computed tomography scanning, inadequate documentation, or follow-up less than 6 months.

The decision for patients to be treated operatively or nonoperatively was at the discretion of the pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, 9 of whom were involved in this study.

In the nonoperative group, the Emergency Department physician provided conscious sedation before fracture reduction and casting using standard C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. The reduction was managed by a senior or attending pediatric orthopaedic surgeon. After reduction, patients were immobilized by a fiberglass cast. A 3-point mold was used to minimize the chance of loss of reduction. Attention was paid to the thickness of the padding, molding of the distal and proximal parts of the cast as well as at the fracture site with each roll of the cast material. Postreduction radiographs were taken after all fracture reductions to evaluate the adequacy of reduction. Metaphyseal distal radial and ulnar fractures were allowed a wide range of acceptability, with 30 degrees of sagittal and 20 degrees of coronal plane angulation in patients 9 years of age or younger. In older children with at least 1 year of growth remaining, 20 degrees of sagittal and 15 degrees of coronal plane angulation were permitted.

### Evidence-based medicine: management of pediatric forearm fractures [^7ca50170]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Forearm fractures are common injuries in the pediatric population. Successful treatment of these fractures should result in complication-free functional pronosupination. Traditionally, these have been treated with closed reduction and casting, but the last several decades have seen a dramatic increase in the operative treatment of these fractures. However, little high-level evidence exists to guide management. The data from the limited set of studies available suggest that closed treatment does usually result in satisfactory outcomes, particularly in younger patients; operative fixation is usually successful as well but comes with a significantly increased complication rate. The ideal study to aid in evidence-based decision-making for pediatric forearm fractures would be a randomly controlled trial comparing closed reduction and casting versus intramedullary nailing versus plating; in children ranging from 8 years old to skeletally mature; with closed forearm fractures, complete or greenstick with > 20 degrees of angulation; with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up (or to maturity); with the primary outcome defined as final pronation and supination; using an validated functional outcome tool; and precisely defining the complications from each treatment.

### Standardized sonographic examination of pediatric elbow injuries is an effective screening method and improves diagnostic efficiency [^87d009c5]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Positive role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow injuries were confirmed by many papers but no comprehensive, standardized method has been developed for daily clinical practice. The aim of our prospective diagnostic study was to prove the efficacy of a five point sonographic point of care method for detecting different pediatric elbow fractures or dislocations.

Methods

Between 2016 January and 2017 March 365 children (age 1–14) with suspected closed elbow injury were enrolled in our study. Sonographic point of care examination was carried out by a properly trained resident and two orthopedic surgeons immediately after physical survey. We used a standardized five point sonographic examination. Two plane x-rays were made following sonography according to protocol. Utility of sonographic pictures were analyzed by a radiologist. Cases with images which have not met with standard requirements were excluded. In those cases when primary x-rays were negative and/or any of the ultrasound planes showed positive findings, radiography was repeated after 4 weeks of injury. If we detected callus formation the fracture was considered occult. Cases with images which have not met with standard requirements were excluded. Ultrasonic pictures, evaluation sheets and x-ray results were compared.

Results

Out of the 365 cases we identified 165 with positive findings (45, 2%) by primary x-rays. Distribution of the different injuries were the following: Radial condylar fractures, (n = 29) supracondylar humeral fractures (n = 84 proximal radial fractures, (n = 19) proximal ulnar fractures, (n = 7) fractures with joint dislocations (n = 3) joint dislocations without fractures, n = 2 medial epicondyle fractures (n = 14) fracture combinations (n = 7) We did not find injuries in this series that we could not categorize into these groups. Evaluating the abnormal sonographic dorsal fat pad sign (FPS) as a sole parameter for fracture detection we found sensitivity: 0, 97, specificity: 0,97, positive predictive value: 0,97, negative predictive value: 0,97 Evaluating the effectivity of the four cortical planes we calculated sensitivity 0, 85 specificity 0.96 positive predictive value: 0. 95 negative predictive value 0.87. The overall values of the five planes were the following: specificity0.97 sensitivity 1, positive predictive value 0.97 negative predictive value: 1 Interrater agreements on the cortical plane abnormality were considered good at two examiners and very good at one examiner. (Kappa = 0.79, 0, 81, 0, 79) Agreements on differentiation of elevated, normal fat pad) or lipohaemarthrosis in sonographic pictures were very good in all cases. (Kappa = 0,83, 0,86,0,82) While identification of any displacement or dislocation was possible in 96%, of all cases(n = 59)the exact determination of the type of the injury was possible in only 70,3% (n = 116) CONCLUSIONS: Using the five point ultrasonic examination provides enough information for excluding or confirming the presence of any pediatric elbow fractures or dislocations. The method is quick, simple and can help in the immediate differentiation of the severity of injuries. Sonographic lipohaemarthrosis seems to be more sensitive than elevated fat pad sign for the detection of potential occult fractures. Positive cases should be cleared by x-rays because the exact nature of the fractures are not identifiable only by ultrasound.

Clavicle fractures are a common injury presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED) and account for 10% to 15% of all pediatric fractures. x-ray is the current standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of clavicle fractures though several studies in the literature have proposed the role of POCUS to be considered as a first-line imaging modality. We present 2 cases of paediatric clavicle fractures that were initially missed on x-ray before being identified using POCUS. POCUS has been shown to have a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting clavicle fractures with a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI: 89%-96%) and specificity of 98% (95% CI: 91%-99%) in one recent systematic review. POCUS should be considered as the first-line imaging modality in clavicle injuries in pediatric patients as it is highly accurate at detecting clavicle fractures, is quick and painless to perform, and is an easily teachable skill.

### Do we need to stabilize all reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children with K-wires? [^e9848e89]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Short-term follow-up studies have shown that reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children should be treated with K-wires to prevent redisplacement and inferior functional results. Minimum 5-year follow-up studies are limited. Range of motion, patient-reported outcome measures, and radiographic parameters at minimum 5-year follow-up should be evaluated because they could change insights into how to treat pediatric metaphyseal forearm fractures.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does K-wire stabilization of reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children provide better forearm rotation at minimum 5-year follow-up? (2) Do malunions (untreated redisplaced fractures) of reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children induce worse functional results? (3) Which factors lead to limited forearm rotation at minimum 5-year follow-up?

Methods

We analyzed the extended minimum 5-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial in which children with a reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fracture were randomized to either an above-elbow cast (casting group) or fixation with K-wires and an above-elbow cast (K-wire group). Between January 2006 and December 2010, 128 patients were included in the original randomized controlled trial: 67 in the casting group and 61 in the K-wire group. For the current study, based on an a priori calculation, it was determined that, with an anticipated mean limitation in prosupination (forearm rotation) of 7° ± 7° in the casting group and 3° ± 5° in the K-wire group, a power of 80% and a significance of 0.05, the two groups should consist of 50 patients each. Between January 2014 and May 2016, 82% (105 of 128) of patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 6.8 ± 1.4 years: 54 in the casting group and 51 in the K-wire group. At trauma, patients had a mean age of 9 ± 3 years and had mean angulations of the radius and ulna of 25° ± 14° and 23° ± 18°, respectively. The primary result was limitation in forearm rotation. Secondary outcome measures were radiologic assessment, patient-reported outcome measures (QuickDASH and ABILHAND-kids), handgrip strength, and VAS score for cosmetic appearance. Assessments were performed by the first author (unblinded). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze which factors led to a clinically relevant limitation in forearm rotation.

Results

There was a mean limitation in forearm rotation of 5° ± 11° in the casting group and 5° ± 8° in the K-wire group, with a mean difference of 0.3° (95% CI -3° to 4°; p = 0.86). Malunions occurred more often in the casting group than in the K-wire group: 19% (13 of 67) versus 7% (4 of 61) with an odds ratio of 0.22 for K-wiring (95% CI 0.06 to 0.80; p = 0.02). In patients in whom a malunion occurred (malunion group), there was a mean limitation in forearm rotation of 6° ± 16° versus 5° ± 9° in patients who did not have a malunion (acceptable alignment group), with a mean difference 0.8° (95% CI -5° to 7°; p = 0.87). Factors associated with a limited forearm rotation ≥ 20° were a malunion after above-elbow casting (OR 5.2 [95% CI 1.0 to 27]; p = 0.045) and a refracture (OR 7.1 [95% CI 1.4 to 37]; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

At a minimum of 5 years after injury, in children with a reduced metaphyseal both-bone forearm fracture, there were no differences in forearm rotation, patient-reported outcome measures, or radiographic parameters between patients treated with only an above-elbow cast compared with those treated with additional K-wire fixation. Redisplacements occurred more often if treated by an above-elbow cast alone. If fracture redisplacement is not treated promptly, this leads to a malunion, which is a risk factor for a clinically relevant (≥ 20°) limitation in forearm rotation at minimum 5-year follow-up. Children with metaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures can be treated with closed reduction and casting without additional K-wire fixation. Nevertheless, a clinician should inform parents and patient about the high risk of fracture redisplacement (and therefore malunion), with risk for limited forearm rotation if left untreated. Weekly radiographic monitoring is essential. If redisplacement occurs, remanipulation and fixation with K-wires should be considered based on gender, age, and direction of angulation. Future research is required to establish the influence of (skeletal) age, gender, and the direction of malunion angulation on clinical outcome.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^426a321a]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Skeletal radiologic survey — indications, technique, and limitations: imaging plays an important role in identifying intentional physical injury, and the ACR and Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) published practice parameters for skeletal surveys in children in 2016. The skeletal survey is the primary imaging examination for detecting fractures, and a complete survey includes frontal and lateral views of the skull and thorax (including the ribs and thoracic spine), lateral views of the C-spine and lumbosacral spine, oblique views of the ribs, single frontal views of the long bones, hands, feet, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, plus separate views of each arm, forearm, thigh, leg, hand and foot; a single "babygram" radiograph of the entire infant provides insufficient anatomic detail and has no role in the evaluation for suspected physical abuse. Recommended technical equipment and parameters are outlined in the ACR Practice Parameter, with high-resolution mode on digital systems optimizing visualization of osseous structures. A skeletal survey is recommended in all children 24-months-old and younger when intentional injury is suspected, and when high suspicion exists, a follow up skeletal survey after two weeks can identify previously occult fractures and clarify equivocal findings.

### Incomplete fractures of distal long bones among children in early stages of mobility: few concerns for physical child abuse at a single pediatric level I trauma center [^a52661cb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to describe the characteristics, reported mechanism of injury, fracture morphology, and level of physical abuse concern among children in the early stages of mobility diagnosed with an incomplete distal extremity long bone fracture.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for all children aged 10 to 12 months with an incomplete fracture of a distal forearm or distal lower limb who were reportedly pulling up, cruising, or ambulating, and who were evaluated by the child abuse pediatrics team at a single pediatric level I trauma center.

Results

Of the 29 patients who met inclusion criteria, the child abuse pediatrics team had concerns about physical child abuse for 3 children. Not every case with an unknown or discrepant history of injury was deemed concerning for abuse, but all 3 for whom the team determined that concern was warranted had an unknown or discrepant history. All 3 of these children had distal forearm fractures; 1 child had multiple concomitant fractures (including a scapular fracture), and 2 had evidence of bone healing at initial presentation. Each of these observations raises concern for abusive injury based on current evidence. Both-bone buckle fractures of the radius/ulna and tibia/fibula were the most common type of incomplete distal fracture.

Conclusions

This age group presents a unique challenge when designing evidence-based algorithms for the detection of occult injuries in emergency departments. Incomplete fractures of a distal limb are commonly related to a fall and may be considered "low specificity" for physical abuse. However, some publications conclude they should prompt universal physical abuse screening. Our small study indicated that the presence or absence of certain risk factors may provide additional information which could help guide the need for a more thorough evaluation for occult injury in early-mobile children with incomplete distal extremity long bone fractures. Ongoing research is warranted.

### Implementation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^c0b74496]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules are the first validated and implemented clinical decision rules in children with a suspected fracture of the distal forearm. Implementation showed that the use of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules results in a reduction in radiographs requested and time spent at the emergency department. Although the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules could correctly identify 98% of all clinically relevant distal forearm fractures, the clinical judgment and experience of the physician still play an important part in the decision-making process for a radiographic referral in children with a trauma of the wrist.

### Efficacy of ultrasound-guided technique for radial artery catheterization in pediatric populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a242a6c1]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two authors (W. Z. and K. L.) assessed the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consultation with a third review author (H.X.). The risk of bias was assessed according to the risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration. It included six domains: random sequence generation (selection bias); allocation concealment (selection bias); blinding of participants, providers, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts (performance bias and detection bias); incomplete outcome data (attrition bias); selective outcome reporting (outcome reporting bias); and other biases. We defined trials as having "low", "high", or "unclear" risk of bias and evaluated individual bias items as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Statistical analysis

Review Manager version 5.3.5 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used for all data analysis. The relative ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used to respectively analyze dichotomous outcome and continuous outcome. Both were reported with 95% confidence interval (CI), and a P value lower than 0.05 or a 95% CI that did not contain unity was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I² test, and the I² > 50% indicated significant heterogeneity. In this meta-analysis, both fixed- and random-effect models were employed. Since similar results were obtained, only results of the random-effect model are presented.

### Implementation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^43da71f7]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the difference in the number of wrist radiographs before and after implementation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules. A wrist radiograph was defined as a lateral and PA radiograph of the distal radius, ulna and the carpal bones.

Secondary outcomes were the number of clinically relevant missed fractures of the distal forearm, the difference in length of stay at the emergency department before and after implementation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, physician compliance with the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, and patient satisfaction with the received care at the emergency department. A fracture was defined as a disruption of one or more cortices of the radius or ulna. A fracture of both the distal radius and ulna, an antebrachial fracture, was recorded as one fracture. Fissures, avulsions of bony fragments and torus (or buckle) fractures were considered to be fractures as well. Carpal fractures were not taken into account since the incidence of carpal fractures in children is low and they are often occult on plain radiographs. A clinically relevant fracture was defined as a fracture for which treatment or prognosis would have been affected by the missed or delayed radiographic diagnosis. Therefore, a torus fracture was considered clinically irrelevant, as patients with a torus fracture can be safely treated with a bandage or removable splint. In addition, we expected that if children have a lot of pain, physicians are more likely to apply a plaster for pain regulation. Fractures that received a plaster for pain regulation only were also considered clinically irrelevant. Fractures were judged to be clinically relevant independently by a radiologist and an orthopaedic trauma surgeon.

The length of stay at the emergency department was defined as the time between when patients presented and when they left the department. The difference in length of stay between the before and after groups was determined by comparing non-fracture patients with a wrist radiograph with non-fracture patients without a wrist radiograph due to the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules.

Physician compliance with the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules was assessed with an additional question in the mobile application after the recommendation was provided. Physicians were asked via a yes-no question if they were planning to adhere to the recommendation. In case not, four possible answers could be given: (1) I disagree with the recommendation, (2) Patient insists on radiograph, (3) I have the suspicion on an associated injury, and (4) Other (Fig. 3).

### Diagnostic utility of ultrasound in pediatric nasal bone fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^43de09c5]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study highlighted the utility of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for pediatric nasal bone fractures, particularly due to its high accuracy and specificity. Following the exclusion of an outlier study, the analysis also revealed a notable level of sensitivity for this modality in this context. However, the suboptimal overall diagnostic performance of ultrasound, as indicated by likelihood ratios, underscores the importance of exercising caution in relying solely on ultrasound and highlights the necessity for additional diagnostic methods and further refinement in clinical practice. Researchers are encouraged to conduct additional large-scale studies to improve the generalizability of findings. Specifically, they should investigate the impact of potential factors on the diagnostic performance of ultrasound in this area, contributing more robust evidence to the field.

### Artificial intelligence for radiological paediatric fracture assessment: a systematic review [^a1141d97]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is estimated that up to a half of all children sustain a fracture at some point during childhood (~ 133.1 per 10,000 per annum). Fractures also represent a leading cause for long-term disability in children and are present in 55% of children who have been physically abused. Given the differences in children's bone appearances on imaging compared to adults (including differences at varying stages of bone maturation), and the different patterns of injury (such as buckle/torus fractures, corner metaphyseal injuries, bowing deformities), emergency physicians, who are the frequently the first to review and act upon imaging findings, can miss up to 11% of acute paediatric fractures, compared to a specialist paediatric radiologist. Of these, the majority (7.8%) could lead to adverse events and changes in management. This is particularly concerning given that over half (57%) of all UK paediatric orthopaedic-related litigation cases relate to undetected or incorrectly diagnosed injuries, costing £3.5 million, with an average pay-out of between £28,000 and £57,000 per case. These results are not limited to UK practice, with similar results from Norway and the USA, where paediatric claims resulted in higher indemnity paid per case compared with adults.

One potential solution would be the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to rapidly and accurately abnormalities, such as fractures, on medical imaging. Such algorithms could be useful as an interpretative adjunct where specialist opinions are not always available. A systematic review of AI accuracy for adult long bone fracture detection on imaging reported pooled sensitivity and specificity rates of 96 and 94%, respectively. Another systematic review reported that several AI algorithms were either as good or better at detecting limb fractures on radiography compared to general physicians and orthopaedic surgeons. Whilst a minority of studies included any paediatric cases within their training dataset for algorithm development, few have analysed how well these perform specifically and solely for the paediatric population.

The objectives of this systematic review are to assess the available literature regarding diagnostic performance of AI tools for paediatric fracture assessment on imaging, and where available, how this compares with the performance of human readers.
