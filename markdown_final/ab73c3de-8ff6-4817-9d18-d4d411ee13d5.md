## Question

Under what circumstances do surgeons choose an ostomy rather than a primary anastomosis after resecting a colon mass?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when surgeons choose an ostomy rather than a primary anastomosis after colon mass resection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about urgency (elective versus emergency) and how that shifts morbidity and anastomotic risk. Then, I should consider anatomic location (right versus left colon), because base leak risk and default strategies differ. Next, I will review disease-specific scenarios (cancer with perforation or obstruction, diverticulitis with peritonitis, volvulus/ischemia) and patient physiology (hemodynamics, nutrition, immunosuppression). After that, I need to examine intraoperative factors (contamination, perfusion, vasopressors, viability) and technical options (protective diversion type). Finally, I'll integrate reversal likelihood and long-term outcomes to frame a practical, risk-stratified algorithm for decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the global context. Right-sided resections generally have lower anastomotic leak risk and favor primary anastomosis even in many emergencies, whereas left-sided resections carry higher baseline leak risk and generate more debate about diversion or Hartmann's procedure. Wait, I should verify the figures for right-sided leak risk and emergency penalties. The ileocolic anastomotic leak rate is about 2.4% in large elective datasets, and right emergency colectomy series demonstrate primary anastomosis in roughly 80% of cases, while emergency surgery overall increases morbidity and mortality compared to elective cases, underscoring the need to modulate strategy by urgency and physiology [^116SpqiB] [^114WUHWa] [^113JoEv4] [^117VQw1Q].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors that push me toward an ostomy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking credibility. Advanced age with comorbidities, high ASA class, hemodynamic instability or septic shock with vasopressors, malnutrition (e.g., low albumin), significant immunosuppression (steroids, chemotherapy, anti-TNF), diabetes with poor control, and severe cardiovascular disease impairing perfusion all raise anastomotic failure risk; guidelines recommend a low threshold for staged procedures in such patients, even if the evidence base is often retrospective [^113JoEv4] [^11491Pm8] [^117V2rM8].

> I will now examine disease-specific indications, starting with perforated colon cancer and diffuse peritonitis. I need to ensure I apply guideline-grade statements accurately. For critically ill patients or those with multiple comorbidities, Hartmann's procedure is recommended, whereas primary anastomosis with or without a diverting ileostomy is reserved for clinically stable, low-risk patients; the rationale is the unacceptably high leak risk in diffuse fecal contamination with physiologic derangement, so a staged reconstruction is safer and often necessary [^1132gi3q] [^11491Pm8].

> Now, obstructing left-sided colon cancer. Let me first confirm palliative versus curative intent, because that dramatically alters strategy. In patients with incurable metastatic disease or limited life expectancy, endoscopic stenting or diverting colostomy is preferred over immediate colectomy; when cure is possible, choices should be individualized among stent-bridge-to-surgery, diverting colostomy with interval resection, or initial oncologic colectomy, depending on stability and local expertise. But wait, what if decompression with an ileostomy is attempted in complete obstruction? If the ileocecal valve is competent and the obstruction complete, a loop ileostomy will not decompress the colon, so colostomy is required for effective decompression. Stenting can reduce emergent operations and stomas, although long-term oncologic equivalence remains debated and should be weighed carefully [^114Ekci5] [^114KaLbG] [^114AUhBr] [^1171FMjx] [^116uWbws].

> Complicated diverticulitis with peritonitis is the next pivotal scenario. Let me check contemporary guidance: in Hinchey III–IV, HP remains common worldwide, yet many guidelines and studies support primary resection with anastomosis plus diversion in carefully selected, stable patients. Hmm, wait a minute — did the "Goodbye Hartmann" data show similar stoma reversal rates at 1 year or better outcomes with primary anastomosis? I initially thought reversal rates were similar, but I should double-check. One report notes higher 30-day mortality and severe complications with HP and suggests no 1-year reversal difference, while another associated dataset indicates dramatically lower 1-year permanent stoma after RPA compared with HP; reconciling these differences likely reflects patient selection and analytic methods. Nationwide data also show higher ostomy closure rates and faster time-to-closure after primary anastomosis with ileostomy compared with HP, at the cost of more readmissions, reinforcing that patient selection and center expertise are key [^1132gi3q] [^112ar8fM] [^111ocCGQ] [^114WtkLN] [^117RHVCM].

> For sigmoid volvulus or ischemia, I should confirm whether anastomosis or end colostomy meaningfully changes major complications. After matching, major complication rates appear similar between primary anastomosis and end colostomy, but when bowel viability is questionable or perfusion is compromised, diversion is prudent to mitigate catastrophic leaks and facilitate recovery, especially in frail patients [^113Esr74] [^114WUHWa].

> Let me now consider intraoperative technical and physiologic signals that should sway the decision. I need to ensure hemodynamics are optimized because hypotension and vasopressors reflect perfusion risk to the anastomosis; enhanced recovery guidelines emphasize avoidance of even brief mean arterial pressures below 65 mmHg and goal-directed hemodynamics in higher-risk cases, which I should integrate into leak risk assessment. I should confirm oncologic adequacy is not sacrificed by the urgency; even in emergencies, margins, lymphadenectomy targets, and proper planes should be respected whenever feasible, and documentation aligned with operative standards, while acknowledging higher physiologic stress and contamination [^114o7K9r] [^112JDx5J] [^115eBC5J] [^115osRWM].

> Right-sided resections deserve a specific check because the default differs. Electively, diversion after ileocolic resection is rarely indicated given the low leak rate; an internally validated risk score can help identify the rare "extreme risk" patient in whom diversion might be considered. In emergencies, primary anastomosis is still often feasible; however, if instability, ischemia, or questionable viability are present, a damage-control resection with a planned second look or a temporary ostomy may be safer, with delayed restoration of continuity after physiologic optimization, provided OR access and resources permit this pathway [^116SpqiB] [^114WUHWa] [^112ishQ7] [^117VQw1Q].

> Choosing the type of diversion requires a moment to verify the anatomy and purpose. For fecal diversion to protect a left-sided anastomosis, a loop ileostomy or loop colostomy is acceptable; however, if the goal is decompression in the setting of complete large-bowel obstruction with a competent ileocecal valve, a colostomy is mandatory because an ileostomy will not decompress the colon. I should also remember that early closure of a protective ileostomy can be considered in selected low-risk patients once anastomotic integrity is confirmed clinically and, if indicated, radiographically [^113QhjyH] [^1171FMjx] [^113jYbK9].

> Anticipating stoma reversal and long-term quality of life should factor into the index decision. I should double-check comparative closure rates: patients managed with primary anastomosis plus diverting ileostomy have higher 1-year closure rates and shorter time-to-closure than those undergoing HP, although they may experience more readmissions; many HPs are never reversed, especially in older, comorbid, or malignant-disease cohorts, so selecting HP commits a significant proportion to permanent stoma, which should be discussed upfront when feasible [^117RHVCM] [^115sQcvj].

> Pulling this together, here is the practical flow I would use, with self-checks at each step. First, confirm urgency and stability; in unstable, contaminated, or severely comorbid patients, prefer staged strategies with HP or diversion and delayed reconstruction. Second, incorporate anatomy; favor primary anastomosis on the right when viable and perfused, reserving diversion or damage-control for extreme risk, and be more selective with left-sided primary anastomosis, adding a diverting ileostomy when physiology is acceptable but risk remains nontrivial. Third, tailor to disease; for perforated cancer with diffuse peritonitis or Hinchey IV diverticulitis in frail patients, HP is appropriate, whereas stable patients without major risk factors may undergo resection with primary anastomosis plus diversion. Fourth, in left-sided malignant obstruction, use stent or diverting colostomy as a bridge or palliation, and ensure decompressing ostomy selection respects ileocecal valve competence. Finally, verify intraoperative perfusion and hemodynamics, and plan for reversal early to optimize long-term outcomes and expectations [^11491Pm8] [^114AUhBr] [^117VQw1Q].

Surgeons choose an **ostomy** over a **primary anastomosis** after colon mass resection when the patient is **hemodynamically unstable** [^1132gi3q], has **diffuse peritonitis**, or carries a high risk of anastomotic leak because of poor perfusion, malnutrition, immunosuppression, or multiple comorbidities [^113JoEv4] [^11491Pm8]. An ostomy is also preferred in **emergency settings** such as obstruction or perforation [^1171FMjx]; when the bowel is severely inflamed or edematous [^1132gi3q]; or when a tension-free, well-perfused anastomosis cannot be achieved [^114WUHWa]. Primary anastomosis is favored in **stable patients** [^1132gi3q] with good perfusion, minimal contamination, and low leak risk [^116SpqiB], often with a **diverting stoma** when risk is moderate [^114WtkLN]. The decision is individualized according to patient factors, intraoperative findings, and surgeon judgment [^114AUhBr].

## Indications for ostomy creation

Ostomy creation is indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Patients in shock or requiring significant vasopressor support [^1132gi3q] are at high risk for anastomotic failure, making ostomy the safer option [^113JoEv4].

- **Diffuse peritonitis or fecal contamination**: Extensive contamination significantly increases the risk of anastomotic leak, favoring ostomy [^1132gi3q].

- **Poor bowel perfusion or ischemia**: Inadequate blood supply to bowel ends contraindicates primary anastomosis [^114WUHWa].

- **Severe inflammation or edema**: Marked bowel wall inflammation or edema, as seen in IBD or diverticulitis [^117V2rM8], increases leak risk, favoring ostomy [^1132gi3q].

- **Patient factors**: Advanced age, malnutrition, immunosuppression, or multiple comorbidities increase leak risk, making ostomy preferable [^113JoEv4] [^111ocCGQ].

- **Emergency settings**: Obstruction or perforation often necessitates ostomy due to high leak risk [^1171FMjx] [^114AUhBr].

---

## Indications for primary anastomosis

Primary anastomosis is preferred when the following conditions are met:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Stable patients [^1132gi3q] without significant vasopressor support are suitable for primary anastomosis [^116UESCM].

- **Good bowel perfusion**: Well-perfused bowel ends [^1132gi3q] are essential for successful anastomosis.

- **Minimal contamination**: Limited contamination or localized peritonitis [^1132gi3q] allows for primary anastomosis.

- **Low-risk patient profile**: Younger patients without significant comorbidities or immunosuppression are ideal candidates [^112ar8fM].

- **Elective surgery**: Elective resections in optimized patients favor primary anastomosis [^11491Pm8].

---

## Role of diverting stomas

When a primary anastomosis is performed but the leak risk is moderate, a **temporary diverting stoma** (usually a loop ileostomy) may be created to protect the anastomosis and reduce the severity of complications if a leak occurs [^114WtkLN] [^117RHVCM].

## Summary table: ostomy vs. anastomosis

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred approach** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemodynamic instability [^1132gi3q] | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| Diffuse peritonitis | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| Poor bowel perfusion [^114WUHWa] | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| Severe inflammation/edema [^117V2rM8] | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| High-risk patient (age, comorbidities) [^113JoEv4] | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| Emergency obstruction/perforation [^1171FMjx] | Ostomy | High leak risk |
| Hemodynamic stability [^116UESCM] | Anastomosis | Low leak risk |
| Good bowel perfusion [^1132gi3q] | Anastomosis | Low leak risk |
| Minimal contamination [^1132gi3q] | Anastomosis | Low leak risk |
| Low-risk patient [^112ar8fM] | Anastomosis | Low leak risk |
| Elective surgery [^11491Pm8] | Anastomosis | Low leak risk |

### Emergency right colectomy: Which strategy when primary anastomosis is not feasible [^113JoEv4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Elective right colectomy entails a risk for postoperative complications and mortality around 22% and 1% respectively. In the emergency setting, these rates increase up to 50% and 10%, especially if risk factors are present. Patient-related risk factors include age > 70 years, male gender, malnutrition, ASA score > 3, diabetes, tobacco smoking, or immunosuppression. Procedure-related risk factors, other than emergency situations, include intra-operative blood transfusion, surgeon experience, operative duration, or operations performed during night shifts.

Safety strategies are beneficial for emergency procedures if several risk factors are present. For left-sided emergency colonic resections, valuable options include the creation of an end colostomy or primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy. However, safety strategies have not been established for emergency right-sided resections. Resection with primary anastomosis remains the standard of care in emergency settings. Nevertheless, overall morbidity and mortality rates raise the question of whether safer strategies are needed.

The aim of the present study was to assess our institutional practice and outcomes for emergency right colectomy and to evaluate alternative treatments to primary anastomosis, and determine if the definitive ostomy rate can be reduced.

### Use of primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy in patients with acute diverticulitis requiring urgent operative intervention [^114WtkLN]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that urgent colectomy and primary anastomosis with diversion is safe for perforated diverticulitis. Guidelines support this approach.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to describe the use of urgent or emergent primary anastomosis with diversion in diverticulitis before the 2014 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons guidelines and compare national outcomes of primary anastomosis with diversion to the Hartmann procedure.

- **Design**: This was a national retrospective cohort study.

- **Settings**: The study was conducted with a national all-payer US sample from 1998 to 2011.

- **Patients**: Patients included those admitted and treated with urgent or emergent colectomy for diverticulitis. Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years, inflammatory bowel disease, and elective surgery beyond 24 hours after admission.

- **Main outcome measures**: In-hospital mortality was measured.

- **Results**: A total of 124,198 patients underwent emergent or urgent colectomy for acute diverticulitis; 67,721 underwent fecal diversion, including 65,084 (96.1%) who underwent end colostomy and 2,637 (3.9%) who underwent anastomosis with ileostomy. The rate of primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy increased from 30 to 60 diverting ileostomy cases per 1000 operative diverticulitis cases in 1998 versus 2011 (incidence rate ratio = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.70–2.50). However, overall use remained low, with more than 90% of patients undergoing end colostomy. Complication rates were higher (32.1% vs. 23.3%; p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality remained elevated.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^1132gi3q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Should primary anastomosis with or without protecting stoma be preferred instead of Hartmann's procedure in patients with diffuse peritonitis from diverticular perforation?

- **Recommendations for different patient groups**: We recommend Hartmann's procedure (HP) for managing diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients and in selected patients with multiple comorbidities (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2B). In clinically stable patients with no comorbidities, we suggest primary resection with anastomosis with or without a diverting stoma (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2B).

- **Advantages and disadvantages of HP**: HP has been considered the procedure of choice in patients with generalized peritonitis and remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in diverticular peritonitis. It is especially useful in critically ill patients and in patients with multiple comorbidities. However, restoration of bowel continuity after an HP is associated with significant morbidity and resource utilization. As a result, many of these patients do not undergo reversal surgery and remain with a permanent stoma.

- **Study findings on HP usage**: The common use of the HP in treating diverticular perforation worldwide is confirmed by a recent Australian study analyzing administrative data of patients with acute diverticulitis admitted from 2009 to 2013 in eight tertiary referral centers with specialist colorectal services. The HP was the most commonly performed emergency operation, accounting for 72% of resections.

Another population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative discharge data, conducted in Ontario, Canada, was published in 2014. Among 18,543 patients.

### Goodbye Hartmann trial: A prospective, international, multicenter, observational study on the current use of a surgical procedure developed a century ago [^112ar8fM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Literature suggests colonic resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) instead of Hartmann's procedure (HP) for the treatment of left-sided colonic emergencies. We aim to evaluate the surgical options globally used to treat patients with acute left-sided colonic emergencies and the factors leading to the choice of treatment, comparing HP and RPA.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, international, multicenter, observational study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 1,215 patients with left-sided colonic emergencies who required surgery were included from 204 centers during the period of March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, with a 1-year follow-up.

- **Results**: 564 patients (43.1%) were females. The mean age was 65.9 ± 15.6 years. HP was performed in 697 (57.3%) patients and RPA in 384 (31.6%) cases. Complicated acute diverticulitis was the most common cause of left-sided colonic emergencies (40.2%), followed by colorectal malignancy (36.6%). Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3b) were higher in the HP group (P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality was higher in HP patients (13.7%), especially in cases of bowel perforation and diffused peritonitis. The 1-year follow-up showed no differences in ostomy reversal rate between HP and RPA (P = 0.127). A backward likelihood logistic regression model showed that RPA was preferred in younger patients, having low ASA score (≤ 3), in cases of large bowel obstruction, absence of colonic ischemia, longer time from admission to surgery, operating early during the day's working hours, by a surgeon who performed more than 50 colorectal resections.

Regarding surgical interventions for colon cancer, specifically concerning technical considerations for surgery and postoperative care, the ASCRS/SAGES 2023 guidelines suggest offering sham feeding (such as chewing gum for at least 10 minutes, 3–4 times daily) after colorectal surgery. This practice is associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and small improvements in gastrointestinal recovery.

### Can we respect the principles of oncologic resection in an emergency surgery to treat colon cancer [^115eBC5J]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with colorectal cancer admitted to the emergency room are generally at a more advanced stage of the disease and usually undergo resection with curative intent on a smaller scale. In this scenario, one aspect to consider is whether the principles of oncologic resection are observed when patients diagnosed with colon cancer are treated surgically. We selected 87 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or upper rectum who underwent emergency surgical resection. The major variables reviewed retrospectively were the extent of resection performed, the number of dissected regional lymph nodes, and the overall survival rate. Intestinal obstruction was observed in 67 patients (77%), while perforation was found in 20 patients (23%). Seven specimens (8%) had compromised circumferential margins, all found in patients with T4 tumors combined with poor clinical status. The number of dissected regional lymph nodes was greater than or equal to 12 in 71% of patients. While the average stay in the ICU was 5.7 days, the median was 3 days. The morbidity and peri-operative mortality rates stood at 33.6% and 20%, respectively. The outcome of emergency surgery for colorectal cancer observed in this study was similar to those found in the literature. The principles of oncologic resection were respected when considering and analyzing the extent of resection, surgical margins, and the number of dissected lymph nodes.

### Current controversies in colorectal surgery: The way to resolve uncertainty and move forward [^116RhUoc]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

There are currently a number of unsolved clinical questions in colorectal surgery, with new surgical principles being introduced without proper scientific high-level evidence. These include complete mesocolic excision with central ligation for colonic cancer, extralevator abdominoperineal excision for low rectal cancer, robotic surgery for various colorectal procedures, laparoscopic lavage without resection for Hinchey Stage III perforated sigmoid diverticulitis, and the use of the single port technique for laparoscopic surgery. Before general implementation, these new modalities should ideally be evaluated in randomized studies and meta-analyses.

Many randomized studies, however, cannot provide the final answer to the research question because they are underpowered. Therefore, it is important to perform well-designed studies that are large enough to provide definitive answers. A way forward could be to form multicenter and even multinational research groups in order to ensure the accrual of sufficient sample sizes.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: Obstruction and perforation [^1171FMjx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Despite this, in case of an emergency rectal obstruction and a planned future anastomosis, a loop ileostomy is a viable option only if the obstruction is incomplete or the ileocaecal valve is patent; otherwise, colonic distension would not be solved. In the presence of a complete obstruction and a competent ileocaecal valve, a colostomy is mandatory. Scientific evidence to guide the choice of type and location of the emergency colostomy is limited.

As stated above, the choice of type (end or loop) and site (transverse versus sigmoid colon) of colostomy should be tailored to the individual patient, considering the planned definitive treatment.

Limited to patients at high risk for general anaesthesia, a loop left side colostomy could be fashioned under local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation via a left side skin incision (the so-called trephine stoma).

A widely used practical approach consists of a right-sided loop transverse colostomy. This is preferred over a sigmoid colostomy because it can be left in place to protect the anastomosis after the planned surgical resection, it is easier to fashion due to the mobility of the transverse colon, it avoids the risk of damage to the marginal arcade, and it does not alter the left abdominal region in case a permanent end colostomy becomes necessary at the time of definitive surgical resection. When an abdominal-perineal resection is predictable, an end sigmoid colostomy could be a valid alternative.

### Management of malignant left colonic obstruction: Is an initial temporary colostomy followed by surgical resection a better option [^114QhQFm]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The surgical management of obstructed left colorectal cancer (OLCC) is still a matter of debate. Guidelines recommend Hartmann's procedure (HP). This study evaluated the results of surgical management with a focus on a strategy of initial colostomy (IC) followed by elective resection.

All patients operated on for OLCC were reviewed, noting clinical, surgical, histological, morbidity, and long-term results. From 2000 to 2011, 83 patients (48 men) with a mean age of 70.3 ± 15.1 years underwent surgery for OLCC. Eleven patients (13.3%) had a subtotal colectomy due to a laceration of the caecal wall. Eleven others underwent HP for tumor perforation (n = 6) or as palliation in severely ill patients (n = 5). The remaining 61 patients (73.5%) had an IC with the intention of performing an elective resection shortly after recovery.

Postoperative complications occurred in six patients (9.8%), and there were two deaths (3.3%). Fifty-nine operation survivors had a colonoscopy shortly afterward, revealing synchronous cancer in two patients (3.4%). Twelve of the 59 patients had synchronous metastases. The subsequent elective resection, including the colostomy site, could be performed in 45 patients (74%) during the same admission at a median interval of 11 days (7–17 days). The overall median length of hospital stay was 20 days, and the 30-day mortality was 3 out of 61 (5%).

In conclusion, IC followed by surgical resection is a technically simple strategy. It allows initial abdominal exploration with a short period of having a colostomy and permits elective surgery with low morbidity.

### Role of resection and primary anastomosis of the left colon in the presence of peritonitis [^116UESCM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Classically, a primary colonic anastomosis is not performed in the presence of left colonic peritonitis. Recently, there has been a trend towards resection and anastomosis in selected patients, but no prospective study concerning the safety of this approach has been published. The objective of this study was to define the role of intraoperative colonic lavage with resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) in left colonic peritonitis, and to evaluate the differences in outcome in patients with diffuse or localized peritonitis.

- **Methods**: Between January 1994 and December 1998, 127 patients underwent emergency operations for a distal large bowel perforation. RPA was the operation of choice and was performed in 61 patients, 38 with localized and 23 with diffuse peritonitis. Septic shock, fecal peritonitis, immunocompromised status, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade IV were contraindications to the one-stage procedure. Alternative operations used in high-risk patients included Hartmann's procedure in 55 patients, subtotal colectomy in eight, and colostomy in three.

- **Results**: There were two deaths (3 percent) among 61 patients treated by RPA and one (2 percent) case of clinical anastomotic dehiscence. Overall morbidity was 39 percent, and the overall mean (s.d.) hospital stay was 18 (15) days. No statistical differences were observed between patients with localized and diffuse peritonitis treated by RPA.

- **Conclusion**: RPA may be the operation of choice in selected patients with left colonic diffuse peritonitis.

### Cost and outcomes of side-to-side versus end-to-end anastomosis in right colectomy: A retrospective cohort study [^115yDsuG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The optimal anastomotic configuration for right-sided colectomies remains controversial, with comparable postoperative outcomes across techniques. Thus, economic considerations may play a larger role in decision-making within cost-constrained healthcare settings.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study evaluated right-sided colectomies with ileocolic anastomosis at a Swiss tertiary center between 2016 and 2021. We compared costs and outcomes among three anastomotic techniques: end-to-end (EE), side-to-side stapled (SSS), and side-to-side hand-sewn (SSH).

- **Results**: Out of 468 patients (mean age 67.7 ± 16.2 years; 51.7% female), EE was used in 95 cases (20.3%), SSS in 191 (40.8%), and SSH in 182 (38.9%). The majority (72.0%) underwent elective surgery. Insurance coverage included basic (62.2%), semi-private (24.2%), and private (13.7%). Mean operation times were shortest for EE (173.6 ± 72.3 min), followed by SSS (188.0 ± 65.4 min) and SSH (195.1 ± 61.5 min). The median total costs were €26,449. The SSS group had the lowest median total costs, €2,424 less than SSH and €2,095 less than EE, with no significant differences (p = 0.1657). Significant differences were observed in operating room (OR) costs, with EE being the lowest and SSH the highest (p < 0.0001). Adjusted OR costs in SSH were 23% more than EE and 21% more than SSS. No significant difference was found between EE and SSS OR costs. For mean OR material costs, EE had the lowest, followed by SSS and SSH. Adjusted costs for EE were 52% lower than SSS (p = 0.0005) and 65% lower than SSH (p = 0.0191).

### Laparoscopic colectomy for cancer [^114rTUrX]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Since the first minimally invasive colon resection 15 years ago, laparoscopic colectomy has been implemented as techniques have evolved. Like the laparoscopic approach for other operations, minimally invasive colectomy has potential benefits of improved short-term outcomes. Questions have been raised, however, regarding its use for colorectal cancer resection. Until recently, it was unclear whether minimally invasive surgery for colonic malignancies would achieve adequate oncologic resection. This review provides an overview of laparoscopic colectomy and techniques and examines recent data from randomized controlled trials that report the short- and long-term outcomes after laparoscopic colectomy for cancer.

### Colonic stent vs. emergency surgery for management of acute left-sided malignant colonic obstruction: A decision analysis [^116uWbws]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Acute colonic obstruction due to malignancy is often a surgical emergency. Surgical decompression with colostomy, with or without resection and eventual re-anastomosis, is the traditional treatment of choice. Endoscopic colonic stent insertion effectively decompresses the obstructed colon, allowing for surgery to be performed electively. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of colonic stent vs. surgery for emergent management of acute malignant colonic obstruction.

- **Methods**: Decision analysis was employed to calculate the cost-effectiveness of two competing strategies in a hypothetical patient presenting with acute, complete, malignant colonic obstruction: (1) emergent colonic stent followed by elective surgical resection and re-anastomosis; (2) emergent surgical resection followed by diversion (Hartmann's procedure) or primary anastomosis. Cost estimates were obtained from a third-party payer perspective. Primary outcome measures were mortality, stoma requirement, and the total number of operative procedures.

- **Results**: Colonic stent resulted in 23% fewer operative procedures per patient (1.01 vs. 1.32 operations per patient), an 83% reduction in stoma requirement (7% vs. 43%), and lower procedure-related mortality (5% vs. 11%). Colonic stent was associated with a lower mean cost per patient ($45,709 vs. $49,941).

- **Conclusions**: Colonic stent insertion followed by elective surgery appears more effective and less costly than emergency surgery under base-case conditions. This finding remains robust over a wide range of assumptions.

### Primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy vs. Hartmann's procedure for acute diverticulitis: What happens after discharge? Results of a nationwide analysis [^117RHVCM]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend resection with primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy over Hartmann's procedure if deemed safe for acute diverticulitis. The primary objective of the study was to compare the utilization of these strategies and describe nationwide ostomy closure patterns and readmission outcomes within one year of discharge.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, population-based, cohort study of United States hospitals reporting to the Nationwide Readmissions Database from January 2011 to December 2019. There were 35,774 patients identified undergoing non-elective primary anastomosis with diverting loop ileostomy or Hartmann's procedure for acute diverticulitis. Rates of ostomy closure, unplanned readmissions, and complications were compared. Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to control for patient and hospital-level confounders as well as severity of disease.

- **Results**: Of the 35,774 patients identified, 93.5% underwent Hartmann's procedure. Half (47.2%) were aged 46–65 years, 50.8% female, 41.2% publicly insured, and 91.7% underwent open surgery. Primary anastomosis was associated with higher rates of 1-year ostomy closure (83.6% vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) and shorter time-to-closure [median 72 days (interquartile range 49–103) vs. 115 (86–160); p < 0.001]. Primary anastomosis was associated with increased unplanned readmissions [hazard ratio = 2.83 (95% confidence interval 2.83–3.37); p < 0.001], but fewer complications upon stoma closure [odds ratio 0.51 (95% 0.42–0.63); p < 0.001].

### Consensus statements on complete mesocolic excision for right-sided colon cancer-technical steps and training implications [^114KnqEo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Complete mesocolic excision (CME) is a radical resection for colon cancer, but it is a technically demanding procedure with significant variation in practice. A standardized approach to the optimal technique and training is desirable to minimize technical hazards and facilitate safe dissemination. The aim is to develop an expert consensus on the optimal technique for CME for right-sided and transverse colon cancer to guide safe implementation and training pathways.

- **Methods**: Guidance was developed following a modified Delphi process to gain consensus from 55 international experts in CME and surgical education representing 18 countries. Domain topics were formulated and subdivided into questions pertinent to different aspects of CME practice. A three-round Delphi voting on 25 statements based on specific questions was conducted, with 70% agreement considered as consensus.

- **Results**: Twenty-three recommendations for the CME procedure were agreed upon, describing the technique and optimal training pathway. CME is recommended as the standard of care resection for locally advanced colon cancer. The essential components include central vascular ligation, exposure of the superior mesenteric vein, and excision of an intact mesocolon. Key anatomical landmarks necessary for a safe CME dissection include identification of the ileocolic pedicle, superior mesenteric vein, and root of the mesocolon. A proficiency-based multimodal training curriculum for CME was proposed, including a formal proctorship program.

- **Conclusions**: Consensus was reached on the standardization of technique and training frameworks.

### Restoration of intestinal continuity following emergency sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid volvulus: An American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis using coarsened exact matching [^113Esr74]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

There is limited data to guide decision-making between performing a primary anastomosis and fashioning an end colostomy following emergency sigmoid colectomy for patients with sigmoid volvulus. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of these two approaches.

- **Methods**: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database from 2006 to 2021 was retrospectively analyzed. Missing data were multiply imputed, and coarsened exact matching was performed to generate matched cohorts. Rates of major complications and other postoperative outcomes were evaluated among patients who had a primary anastomosis compared with matched controls who had an end colostomy following emergency sigmoid colectomy.

- **Results**: Overall, 4041 patients who had a primary anastomosis and 1240 who had an end colostomy met the inclusion criteria. After multiple imputation and coarsened exact matching, 895 patients who had a primary anastomosis had a matched control. The rate of major complications was lower in patients who had an end colostomy (33.2% vs. 36.7%), but this difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70–1.05). Results were similar in subgroup analyses of higher-risk patients. There were no significant differences in the overall complication rate, mortality, length of hospital stay, or readmission rate. Patients with a colostomy were more likely to be discharged to a care facility (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09–1.67).

- **Conclusion**: Differences in rates of major complications and many other outcomes after primary anastomosis in comparison with end colostomy were not statistically significant.

### Consensus statements on complete mesocolic excision for right-sided colon cancer-technical steps and training implications [^1164veSj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Outcomes for patients with rectal cancer have improved following the acceptance of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery, while outcomes for patients with colonic cancer have remained relatively static. Right-sided colon cancers are associated with worse 5-year overall survival for stage II and III disease compared to rectal cancer. This may be attributed to the variability of the technique of right hemicolectomy and the lack of standardization of the oncology sound resection. Hohenberger was the first to publish a reduction in local recurrence and improved survival rates in patients with right-sided colon cancer undergoing complete mesocolic excision (CME) and central vascular ligation (CVL) based on the same TME concept and following the embryological planes, but applied to the CME plane.

While results of ongoing randomized controlled trials such as the 'RELARC' trial and the Russian COLD trial are still awaited, the evidence in Europe suggests a 15% increase in survival and lower rates of 5-year local recurrence for stages I-III when this technique is adopted. Additionally, retrospective studies have shown the importance of dissection in the correct mesocolic plane for the resection of colon cancer, as Heald et al. postulated for rectal cancer.

CME is a technically challenging surgical procedure with potentially high morbidity that requires intensive training. Lack of anatomical knowledge, gaps in surgical training, a paucity of high-quality evidence, and the potential morbidity have deterred surgeons from routinely adopting CME in their practice.

### Minimal invasive surgery for left colectomy adapted to the Covid-19 pandemic: Laparoscopic intracorporeal resection and anastomosis, a 'don't touch the bowel' technique [^116pXaNq]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The Covid-19 pandemic has forced surgeons to adapt their standard procedures. The modifications introduced are designed to favor minimally invasive surgery. Positive results obtained with intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in the right colon and rectum prompt us to adapt these procedures to the left colon. We describe a 'don't touch the bowel' technique and outline the benefits to patients of using less surgically aggressive techniques and also to surgeons in terms of the lower emission of aerosols that might transmit the Covid-19 infection.

- **Methods**: This was an observational study of intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in left colectomy. We describe the technical details of intracorporeal resection, end-to-end stapled anastomosis, and extraction of the specimen through mini-laparotomy in the ideal location.

- **Results**: We present preliminary results of 17 patients with left-sided colonic pathologies, 15 neoplasia, and two diverticular disease, who underwent four left hemicolectomies, six sigmoidectomies, and seven high anterior resections. Median operating time was 186 min (range 120–280). No patient required conversion to extracorporeal laparoscopy or open surgery. Median hospital stay was 4.7 days (range 3–12 days). There was one case of an anastomotic leak managed with conservative treatment.

Intracorporeal resection and end-to-end anastomosis, with the possibility of extraction of the specimen by a mini-laparotomy in the ideal location, may present benefits and also adapts well to the conditions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Future studies will further evaluate these adaptations to enhance patient and surgical outcomes.

### When is diversion indicated after right-sided colon resections [^116SpqiB]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). High credibility.

Ileocolonic anastomoses have a low anastomotic leak (AL) risk, resulting in infrequent diverting loop ileostomy use. Identifying patients who warrant a diverting loop ileostomy with right-sided resection is challenging due to this low incidence of AL. Therefore, a multicenter database was used to develop an AL risk score to help inform when diversion should be strongly considered after right-sided resections.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients undergoing elective right-sided resections within the 2012–2020 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-targeted colectomy participant user files were identified. Multivariable logistic regression identified AL risk factors that were then converted to point values to develop an AL risk score. The developed AL risk score was then assessed for visual correspondence and analyzed for internal validity.

- **Results**: A total of 42,176 patients underwent right-sided resection without diversion, and the incidence of AL was 2.4%. The risk calculator exhibited excellent calibration and fair discrimination. Strong visual correspondence was observed for predicted and actual AL rates within the 95% confidence interval for nine of ten risk score deciles.

- **Conclusions**: An internally validated AL risk score for elective ileocolic resections was developed. Most patients had scores that categorized them at a low risk of AL. Diversion after elective right-sided resections should be reserved for extreme cases.

### Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with transrectal extraction of the colon and ileorectal anastomosis [^117G9BWo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the growing acceptance of laparoscopic colon surgery, an abdominal incision is needed to remove the specimen and perform an anastomosis.

- **Methods**: Five trocars (one 12 mm and four 5 mm) were used. The video describes the technique of performing laparoscopic subtotal colectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, transrectal removal of the gallbladder and the entire colon, and intracorporeal stapled ileorectal anastomosis in a 27-year-old female with colonic inertia and biliary dyskinesia.

- **Results**: There were no intraoperative complications. The operating time was 180 minutes. Blood loss was 10 cc. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4.

- **Conclusion**: Laparoscopic subtotal colectomy with transrectal removal of the colon is a safe and effective procedure that can be added to the armamentarium of surgeons performing laparoscopic colon surgery. This technique may provide both an attractive way to reduce abdominal wall morbidity and a bridge to NOTES colon surgery.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^116JKgaU]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

The original clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the ASCRS and the SAGES were published in 2017. The present guideline was constructed using the 2017 guidelines as a platform. Compared with 2017, this guideline has three new recommendations and five statements with updated levels of evidence. All other statements have been reviewed and updated with evidence.

A systematic search was conducted under the guidance of a librarian. In brief, a systematic search was conducted from January 1, 2016, to May 1, 2022, using the Cochrane Library, Embase, and MEDLINE databases with a variety of keyword combinations. A supplemental search was conducted using related articles and bibliographies of previously identified articles. Directed searches of embedded references from the primary articles were performed in certain circumstances. Prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses were given preference.

A total of 7,712 abstracts were identified; 6,962 articles were excluded, and a total of 750 full-text articles were evaluated. Of those, 547 were excluded, and along with 212 articles from the 2017 guidelines, a total of 415 articles were included in the final document. The final grade of recommendation was performed using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.

When agreement was incomplete regarding the evidence base or treatment guideline, consensus was sought from the committee chair, vice chair, and two assigned reviewers.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of colon cancer: A consensus statement of the Hellenic and Cypriot Colorectal Cancer Study Group by the HESMO [^114xBb4A]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Anastomosis to reestablish bowel continuity can be performed using either sutures or stapling devices. Evidence indicates that there are no differences in the anastomotic leak or stenosis rates between these two approaches. Possibly, stapled ileo-colic anastomosis may be associated with fewer anastomotic leaks than hand-sewn ones. Additionally, there is no difference in the anastomotic complication rate between single and double-layer sutured anastomoses.

- **Recommendations**:
	1. The non-obstructing colonic cancer should be treated by surgical resection, irrespective of stage (LOE I, SOR A) (ROVC: 83%).

	2. A curative resection (R0) of the non-obstructing colonic cancer involves removal of the tumor-bearing colonic segment with adequate proximal and distal margins, central ligation and division of the supplying vessels, and removal of the attached mesocolon (CME). The exact length of bowel removed, vessels ligated and divided, and mesocolon removed depends on the exact location of the tumor (LOE III, SOR A) (ROVC: 98%).

	3. In cases of colon cancer invading adjacent organs (T4b), en-bloc R0 resection of the colon and involved organ should be attempted (LOE III, SOR A) (ROVC: 100%).

	4. Anastomosis can be fashioned with sutures or stapling devices, without significant differences in the anastomotic complication rate (LOE I, SOR A) (ROVC: 95%).

### Goodbye Hartmann trial: A prospective, international, multicenter, observational study on the current use of a surgical procedure developed a century ago [^111ocCGQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Only 21.6% of HP patients underwent surgery for ostomy reversal during the 1-year follow-up, compared to 64.7% of RPA patients. The complication rate after ostomy reversal was higher in the HP groups (P = 0.41). Anastomotic leakage was 7.5% in the HP group compared to 9.0% in the RPA group (P > 0.05). Permanent stoma was reported in 430 (78.3%) cases in the HP group, similar to the ostomy group with 77 cases (76.2%). In the RPA group, only 22 (6.6%) patients had a stoma after 1 year from surgery (P < 0.001).

- **Primary aim**: Which factors influence the choice of HP and RPA? The logistic regression model was developed by dividing patients into two groups: primary anastomosis of the colon (n = 384) and Hartmann's procedure or ostomy alone (n = 831). The logistic regression model was highly significant (P < 0.001) with a Nagelkerke R Square of 0.2. The analysis predicted several factors that contributed to performing RPA instead of HP.

The choice of surgical procedure is related to patient factors, etiology, hospital setting, and surgeon characteristics. RPA was preferred in younger patients having low ASA scores (≤ 3) and in cases of large bowel obstruction.

### Goodbye Hartmann trial: A prospective, international, multicenter, observational study on the current use of a surgical procedure developed a century ago [^1119i8RT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Literature suggests colonic resection and primary anastomosis (RPA) instead of Hartmann's procedure (HP) for the treatment of left-sided colonic emergencies. We aim to evaluate the surgical options globally used to treat patients with acute left-sided colonic emergencies and the factors that lead to the choice of treatment, comparing HP and RPA.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, international, multicenter, observational study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 1,215 patients with left-sided colonic emergencies requiring surgery were included from 204 centers during the period of March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, with a 1-year follow-up.

- **Results**: Of the patients, 564 (43.1%) were female, and the mean age was 65.9 ± 15.6 years. HP was performed in 697 (57.3%) patients and RPA in 384 (31.6%) cases. Complicated acute diverticulitis was the most common cause of left-sided colonic emergencies (40.2%), followed by colorectal malignancy (36.6%). Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3b) were higher in the HP group (P < 0.001). Thirty-day mortality was higher in HP patients (13.7%), especially in cases of bowel perforation and diffused peritonitis. One-year follow-up showed no differences in ostomy reversal rate between HP and RPA (P = 0.127). A backward likelihood logistic regression model showed that RPA was preferred in younger patients with a low ASA score (≤ 3), in cases of large bowel obstruction, absence of colonic ischemia, longer time from admission to surgery, operating early in the day's working hours, by a surgeon who performed more than 50 colorectal resections.

### Emergency right colectomy: which strategy when primary anastomosis is not feasible [^112ishQ7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

One of the most interesting findings of this study was the difference in permanent ostomy rate within the group of 18 patients who had a two-staged procedure. After right colectomy, the surgeon chose to perform a second-look 2–4 days later, either because the patient was deemed unstable to continue the intervention, or the surgeon wanted to reassess the viability of the remaining intestine (usually in an ischemic context) before restoring bowel continuity. By applying this strategy, more continuity restoration was done compared to the group with primary split stoma (10/18 vs. 5/14; p = 0.265).

The patients in the split stoma groups and the two-stage procedure did not differ in their comorbidities. The patients seemed to benefit from the two-stage procedure. However, this comparison is too small to draw final conclusions, but a two-staged procedure appears to be a valid approach and a bailout option for selected high-risk patients. A two-staged procedure with a planned second-look allows for a short first surgery ("just" the resection or damage control), minimizes surgical trauma, and allows for early intensive care. If the evolution is favorable, some of these patients can still benefit from an anastomosis at the planned second or third look. However, a two-staged procedure implies easy access to operating rooms, which could be difficult to achieve in some centers.

This study also shows that junior surgeons more often performed split stoma than two-stage procedures. The comparison with senior surgeons was not significant, but a trend cannot be denied.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons is dedicated to assuring high-quality patient care by advancing the science, prevention, and management of disorders and diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The Standards Committee is composed of society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by the development of clinical practice guidelines based on the best available evidence.

These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. They are intended for use by all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines.

It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

### The effect of surgical training and operative approach on outcomes in acute diverticulitis: Should guidelines be revised [^116iSDCp]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines accept partial colectomy and primary anastomosis with proximal diversion for select patients with perforated diverticulitis based on low-quality evidence.

This study aimed to compare the effect of operative approach and surgeon training on outcomes following urgent/emergent colectomy for diverticulitis. It is a statewide retrospective cohort study with data obtained from the New York State all-payer sample from 2000 to 2014.

All patients who underwent an urgent/emergent sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis, with the creation of an end colostomy or primary anastomosis with proximal diversion, were included. We excluded all patients under the age of 18, and those with IBD, colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, or those who had elective operations.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes measured were postoperative in-hospital mortality and complications. A total of 10,780 patients underwent urgent/emergent colectomy for diverticulitis: 10,600 (98.3%) received a Hartmann procedure and 180 (1.7%) received primary anastomosis with proximal diversion. Colorectal surgeons performed 6.0% of all operations. Utilization of primary anastomosis with proximal diversion was greater among colorectal surgeons but remained low overall (4.2% vs. 1.5%; p < 0.001). Postoperative mortality was two-fold greater when noncolorectal surgeons performed primary anastomosis versus Hartmann procedure (15% vs. 7.4%; p < 0.001) and 1.4 times greater among noncolorectal surgeons than among colorectal surgeons (7.5% vs. 5.3%; p = 0.04).

### Can we respect the principles of oncologic resection in an emergency surgery to treat colon cancer [^113QM7RR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with colorectal cancer admitted to the emergency room are generally at a more advanced stage of the disease and are usually submitted to a resection with curative intent on a smaller scale. In such scenarios, one of the aspects to be considered is whether the principles of oncologic resection are observed when those patients diagnosed with colon cancer are treated surgically.

We selected 87 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or upper rectum submitted to an emergency surgical resection. The major variables reviewed retrospectively were the extent of resection performed, the number of dissected regional lymph nodes, and the overall survival rate. Intestinal obstruction was observed in 67 patients (77%), while perforation was found in 20 patients (23%). Seven (8%) specimens had circumferential compromised margins, all found in patients with T4 tumors combined with poor clinical status. The number of dissected regional lymph nodes was greater than or equal to 12 in 71% of patients. While the average days of stay in the ICU was 5.7 days, the median was 3 days. The morbidity and peri-operative mortality stood at 33.6% and 20%, respectively.

The outcome of an emergency surgery for colorectal cancer observed in this study was similar to those found in the literature. The principles of oncologic resection were respected when considering and analyzing the extent of the resection, the surgical margins, and the number of dissected lymph nodes.

### Emergency right colectomy: which strategy when primary anastomosis is not feasible [^114ikiHF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This retrospective audit analysis included all consecutive patients who underwent a right-sided emergency colectomy from July 2006 to June 2013 in the Department of Visceral Surgery at Lausanne University Hospital. Right emergency colectomies included formal right colectomy with resection of up to 20 cm of small bowel. Transverse colic resections or extended right colonic resections were excluded. An emergency operation was defined as being performed during an unplanned hospital admission. The indication for surgery was given by the surgeon on call, and surgeries were performed by a board-certified surgeon. Although this is a retrospective study, Swiss law demands submission of the project to an Ethics Committee. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

- **Data collection**: Demographics, risk factors, and outcome measures were defined a priori and entered into an anonymized database. All data were collected retrospectively after the last included patient was operated on.

Demographic data and patients' comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, cardiopathy, tobacco smoking, or consumption of immunosuppressive drugs including corticoids, anti-TNF, and chemotherapy) were included in the database. Comorbidities and patient preoperative health were prospectively graded using the Charlson Comorbidity Index and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score. Surgical data included operative time, blood loss, and intraoperative vasopressor requirements (Noradrenalin > 10 ug/min intravenous).

### Cost and outcomes of side-to-side versus end-to-end anastomosis in right colectomy: A retrospective cohort study [^1116KCMQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The optimal anastomotic configuration for right-sided colectomies remains controversial, with comparable postoperative outcomes across techniques. Thus, economic considerations may play a larger role in decision-making within cost-constrained healthcare settings.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study evaluated right-sided colectomies with ileocolic anastomosis at a Swiss tertiary center between 2016 and 2021. We compared costs and outcomes among three anastomotic techniques: end-to-end (EE), side-to-side stapled (SSS), and side-to-side hand-sewn (SSH).

- **Results**: Out of 468 patients (mean age 67.7 ± 16.2 years; 51.7% female), EE was used in 95 cases (20.3%), SSS in 191 (40.8%), and SSH in 182 (38.9%). The majority (72.0%) underwent elective surgery. Insurance coverage included basic (62.2%), semi-private (24.2%), and private (13.7%). Mean operation times were shortest for EE (173.6 ± 72.3 min), followed by SSS (188.0 ± 65.4 min) and SSH (195.1 ± 61.5 min). The median total costs were 26,449 €. The SSS group had the lowest median total costs, 2424 € less than SSH and 2095 € less than EE, with no significant differences (p = 0.1657).

	- Significant differences were observed in operating room (OR) costs, with EE being the lowest and SSH the highest (p < 0.0001). Adjusted OR costs in SSH were 23% more than EE and 21% more than SSS. No significant difference was found between EE and SSS OR costs. For mean OR material costs, EE had the lowest, followed by SSS and SSH. Adjusted costs for EE were 52% lower than SSS (p = 0.0005) and 65% lower than SSH (p = 0.0191).

### Operative management of anastomotic leak after sigmoid colectomy for left-sided diverticular disease: Ileostomy creation may be as safe as colostomy creation [^113LD5bX]. Colorectal Disease (2023). High credibility.

The management of anastomotic leak after sigmoid colectomy for diverticular disease has not been well defined. Specifically, there is a lack of literature on optimal types of reoperations for leaks. The aim of this study was to describe and compare reoperative approaches and their postoperative outcomes.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the NSQIP Colectomy Module (2012–2019) and single-institution chart review. Patients with diverticular disease who underwent elective sigmoid colectomy were included. Primary outcomes were anastomotic leak requiring reoperation and management of anastomotic leak.

- **Results**: Of 37,471 patients who underwent sigmoid colectomy for diverticular disease, 1003 (2.7%) suffered an anastomotic leak, of whom 583 underwent reoperation. Of the 572 patients who were not initially diverted and underwent reoperation for leak, 302 (52.8%) were managed with stoma creation: 200 (35.0%) with colostomy and 102 (17.8%) with ileostomy. The remaining 47.2% underwent colectomy with reanastomosis, suturing of the large bowel, and drainage. There were no differences in length of stay, readmission, or mortality between patients who underwent ileostomy or colostomy at reoperation (p > 0.05). Single-institution analysis demonstrated that 100% of patients with ileostomies underwent subsequent ileostomy closure, compared to 60% of patients with colostomies.

- **Conclusions**: In patients who suffer anastomotic leaks after sigmoid colectomy for diverticular disease and undergo reoperations, ileostomy at the time of reoperation appears to be safe.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^117VQw1Q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Management of obstruction in the right colon involves various surgical and non-surgical procedures that could be offered in the case of obstructive right colon cancer (ORCC); however, right colectomy with anastomosis is considered safe, and the literature is poor or absent in comparing theoretical options.

- **Treatment options for ORCC**: In cases of right-sided colon cancer causing acute obstruction, right colectomy with primary anastomosis is the preferred option. A terminal ileostomy associated with colonic fistula represents a valid alternative if a primary anastomosis is considered unsafe. The level of evidence is 2, with a grade of recommendation B.

The literature regarding ORCC is definitely less extensive than for obstructive left colon cancer (OLCC). This may be related to favorable anatomical reasons and the limitation of alternatives to surgery, leading to the predominance of right colectomy with primary anastomosis as the treatment of choice.

Several anatomical reasons can explain this phenomenon. First, the hepatic flexure is easier to mobilize compared to the splenic flexure. Second, the mobility of the small bowel allows for ileo-colic anastomosis without adjunctive surgical maneuvers. Third, the ileo-colic anastomosis benefits from optimal blood supply, as compared to some critical zones of the left colon and rectum, whose blood supply depends on the patency of the marginal arcade and the hypogastric vessels. Segmental right colon resection is extremely rare due to the reduced length of the right colon and the common compromise of the cecum.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: Do international guidelines agree [^111rzUEx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer remains the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults, and around 20% of patients with colorectal cancer will present with this surgical emergency. For obstructing right-sided colon cancers, there is a general consensus that primary resection and ileocolic anastomosis is the treatment of choice. However, the most common site for malignant large bowel obstruction (MBO) is the sigmoid colon, and over 75% of obstructing cancers occur distal to the splenic flexure. The optimal management of left-sided MBO is less clear.

Several surgical options exist for left-sided MBO, including primary resection (with or without anastomosis), subtotal colectomy (with or without anastomosis), or defunctioning ileostomy/colostomy with interval resection. Unfortunately, emergency surgery is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. This is due, in part, to this cohort of patients often being elderly, with multiple co-morbidities and reduced physiological function. Mortality rates for emergency surgery have been reported to be almost three times that of elective resections.

More recently, self-expanding colonic endoluminal stents have been successfully used as a non-invasive technique to relieve left-sided MBO. This allows surgical resection to be performed on an elective rather than emergency basis. Stenting as a bridge to surgery has resulted in higher rates of primary anastomosis, reduced numbers of permanent stomas, and fewer wound infections, with no increase in mortality compared to emergency surgery. Concerns have been raised regarding the long-term outcomes of stent use; however, it remains a viable option for improving patient quality of life and reducing surgical complications.

### Cost and outcomes of side-to-side versus end-to-end anastomosis in right colectomy: a retrospective cohort study [^112Xx4yL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Right-sided colectomy, a common surgical procedure for benign and malignant colorectal diseases, requires precise and effective anastomotic techniques to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of this surgery, a gold standard has yet to be established for the anastomotic technique to restore intestinal continuity between the ileum and colon. Various methods have been employed, including side-to-side or end-to-end configurations and hand-sewn or stapled anastomoses. Yet, comparative studies have failed to demonstrate a definitive advantage of one technique over the others. This lack of differentiation pertains to several critical factors such as surgical or oncological outcomes, postoperative complications, and functional recovery.

One of the most significant postoperative concerns is anastomotic leakage, a complication with serious implications for patient recovery and an increase in readmission rates. However, research does not indicate a clear superiority of any specific anastomotic technique in reducing the incidence of this feared complication. Similarly, assessments of functional outcomes and oncological outcomes have not revealed substantial differences among the different anastomotic methods.

In light of the inconclusive evidence regarding the optimal anastomotic technique in relation to safety, it becomes imperative to consider other factors that might influence the choice of method. In the context of increasingly cost-constrained healthcare settings, the financial implications of each technique warrant closer examination. Understanding these factors is crucial to making informed decisions in surgical practice.

### Consensus statements on complete mesocolic excision for right-sided colon cancer-technical steps and training implications [^112LQPAJ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

In order to assess performance in CME, the experts group recommended taking specimen photographs immediately after the operation to evaluate the length of both the anterior and posterior mesocolic surfaces, along with a metric scale for calibration and measurement of the distance from the tumour to the high vascular tie. The experts agreed that these measurements were important, but there was no agreement on the need for recording the length of resected colon, the mesenteric area, or the distance from the bowel to the high vascular tie, despite the previous literature recommending a colonic resection 10 cm beyond the tumour. Additionally, intraoperative photographs of the dissected field were recommended by the experts. These images should capture the area of central vessels division to ensure complete CME had been performed.

The expert group encouraged video recording of all procedures to be used as a platform to provide a structured feedback assessment to the learners. Review of pathological outcomes was agreed on by the vast majority of the expert panel as the optimal method to assess performance in CME. An international registry for data collection was highly recommended to audit outcomes and serve as a resource for further studies.

A limitation of this study is the reliance on expert opinion, inherent in the Delphi process, to inform recommendations rather than primary research. A robust consensus-seeking process was followed to overcome the inherent limitations to group pooling and discussion by virtue of its structure and element of anonymity.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^114JWMEs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A comparison of primary resection and anastomosis, with or without defunctioning stoma, to the HP as the optimal operative strategy for patients presenting with Hinchey stage III–IV was published by Constantinides et al. A total of 135 primary resections and anastomoses, 126 primary anastomoses with defunctioning stoma, and 6,619 HPs were considered in the study. Morbidity and mortality were 55% and 30% for primary resection and anastomosis, 40% and 25% for primary anastomosis with defunctioning stoma, and 35% and 20% for the HP. Stomas remained permanent in 27% of HPs and in 8% of primary anastomoses with defunctioning stoma. The authors concluded that primary anastomosis with defunctioning stoma may be the optimal strategy for selected patients with diverticular peritonitis and may represent a good compromise between postoperative adverse events, long-term quality of life, and risk of permanent stoma.

A small randomized trial of primary anastomosis with ileostomy versus an HP in patients with diffuse diverticular peritonitis was published by Oberkofler et al. in 2012. Sixty-two patients with acute left-sided colonic perforation (Hinchey III and IV) from four centers were randomized to the Hartmann procedure (n = 30) and to primary anastomoses with diverting ileostomy (n = 32). A planned stoma reversal operation was performed after three months in both groups. The study reported no difference in initial mortality and morbidity (mortality 13% vs. 9% and morbidity 67% vs. 75% in the HP vs. primary anastomosis), but a reduction in length of stay, lower costs, and fewer serious complications was observed.

### Which factors influence the decision to perform Hartmann's reversal in various causative disease situations? A retrospective cohort study between 2006 and 2021 [^115sQcvj]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Low credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the predictive factors for Hartmann's reversal and to describe the differences in the rates and timings of Hartmann's reversal for various causative diseases.

In this multicentre retrospective cohort study, patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure (HP) between 2006 and 2018 were enrolled. To describe the demographic patterns of Hartmann's reversal through to 2021, we analysed the cumulative incidence rate of Hartmann's reversal over time based on the Kaplan-Meier failure estimate. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed with cluster-adjusted robust standard errors to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the assessment of variables associated with colostomy reversal.

Of 250 patients who underwent the index HP and survived to discharge, 112 (45%) underwent subsequent Hartmann's reversal (36% for malignant and 51% for benign disease). The causative diseases with the highest probability of colostomy reversal were trauma (85%) and diverticular disease (73%). Conversely, colostomy reversal was performed in only 16% for colonic volvulus and 17% for bowel ischaemia. Home discharge after index HP (HR 5.22, 95% CI 3.31–8.23) and a higher body mass index (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04) were associated with a higher probability of Hartmann's reversal, whereas older age, malignant disease, and a history of cardiovascular and psychoneurological diseases were independently associated with a lower probability of colostomy reversal.

The probability and timing of Hartmann's reversal varied considerably with the surrounding factors.
