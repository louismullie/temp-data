## Question

Patient has right lower quadrant pain with leukocytosis and anorexia. What is the diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what diagnosis best fits a patient with right lower quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and anorexia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which single diagnosis best fits this triad. Then, I should verify how to apply validated clinical scoring systems to quantify probability. Next, I will consider the differential diagnoses that can mimic appendicitis and check for key discriminators. After that, I need to review imaging pathways by patient population, including adults, children, and pregnant patients. Finally, I should outline immediate management implications and when to involve surgery or observation, anchoring each step to high-quality guidance and likelihood data [^112bHDkA] [^1146XbnY] [^1151gNfw].

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Right lower quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and anorexia constitute a classic triad that, when combined, strongly suggest acute appendicitis, and the ACEP clinical policy notes that right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis are among the most reliable clinical features in patients ultimately diagnosed with appendicitis, with a high positive likelihood ratio for RLQ pain, while anorexia adds supportive but less specific weight [^112bHDkA] [^111wABHK] [^1144NoEn] [^111NC37S].

> Wait, let me verify how to quantify this probability rather than relying on gestalt alone. I should calculate an Alvarado or related score, since these tools synthesize key variables including RLQ tenderness, leukocytosis, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, migration, fever, and rebound, and then stratify risk into actionable categories. In this case, I can assign at least 2 points for RLQ tenderness, 2 points for leukocytosis, and 1 point for anorexia, totaling at least 5 points before even accounting for fever, rebound, migration, or nausea/vomiting, which would typically push the score into the "probable" range if present [^117WV2Mk] [^115Kx1L8]. Hold on, I should verify thresholds; the ACEP version interprets 7–8 as probable and 9–10 as very probable, so adding fever, migration, or rebound would readily elevate this patient into high-probability strata and supports prompt imaging or surgical consultation rather than discharge [^117WV2Mk].

> I need to check pediatric and adult nuances next. For children, the Pediatric Appendicitis Score parallels this logic and similarly weights anorexia, RLQ tenderness, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia, with high scores supporting high risk; decision rules such as pARC also emphasize focal RLQ pain and neutrophil elevation, enabling risk stratification that guides observation versus imaging in low-risk children and expedited care in high-risk children [^115zwxhY] [^111CTuiB]. In adults, alternative adult scores such as the AIR score or Adult Appendicitis Score incorporate CRP, guarding, and symptom evolution, and they generally outperform Alvarado in some cohorts, though they remain adjuncts to clinical judgment and imaging rather than replacements [^111u63nW] [^116Mzu24].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without reviewing mimics. Right-sided diverticulitis, mesenteric adenitis, epiploic appendagitis, omental torsion, Meckel's diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract pathology, gynecologic disease in females, and rare entities like cecal ischemia or cystic lymphangioma can present with RLQ pain and leukocytosis; however, the combination of focal RLQ tenderness, anorexia, and leukocytosis is most parsimoniously explained by appendicitis, and careful attention to pain migration, fever, urinalysis, and CT features helps differentiate these entities when the story is atypical or the patient fails to improve [^1169b6pf] [^116G2i4R] [^111Lj6Q3] [^112ARMhy] [^111Ttnh6].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy by population, because pretest probability plus imaging choice determines diagnostic yield. In adult patients with moderate to high probability, contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT is recommended as first-line to confirm appendicitis and to identify complications or alternative diagnoses, with high sensitivity and specificity and a demonstrated reduction in negative appendectomy rates when used appropriately [^112LGR8q] [^1146XbnY]. For pregnant patients, ultrasound is first-line and, if indeterminate, MRI without contrast is preferred to avoid ionizing radiation, with CT reserved for select situations where benefits outweigh risks; these approaches balance diagnostic accuracy with maternal–fetal safety [^116dxDrt] [^1146XbnY]. For children, many centers favor graded compression ultrasound first, recognizing operator dependence and the high frequency of nonvisualized appendices; if the appendix is not seen, secondary signs such as RLQ inflammatory changes, elevated WBC or CRP, and short symptom duration increase the likelihood of appendicitis and support escalation to CT or MRI based on clinical concern and institutional protocols [^111n2Yma] [^117CtoGR].

> I should double-check what to do when the appendix is not visualized on ultrasound, because that is common. When ultrasound is non-diagnostic, inflammatory changes adjacent to the appendix, free fluid, focal tenderness with the probe, and supportive labs strengthen the case for appendicitis; conversely, their absence reduces likelihood and can support observation in clinically low-risk patients, with a composite negative predictive value approaching 94% in some pediatric cohorts, which is helpful for shared decision-making [^117CtoGR]. But wait, if the clinical probability remains high or the patient deteriorates, cross-sectional imaging should not be delayed, as recommended by surgical guidelines for persistent RLQ pain with nonresolving features despite initial non-diagnostic tests [^1151gNfw].

> Let me consider immediate management implications. In a patient with moderate to high probability of appendicitis based on history, exam, and labs, early surgical consultation is warranted even before imaging if the pretest probability is very high, given the risk of progression to perforation and the morbidity of delay; imaging can proceed in parallel to define anatomy and complications and to confirm the diagnosis prior to incision [^111NC37S]. I need to ensure timely analgesia, antiemetics, and intravenous fluids as indicated, because symptom control does not mask diagnostic accuracy and improves patient comfort while definitive care is arranged [^111NC37S].

> I will now examine alternatives when the presentation is equivocal or the patient is high risk for surgery. Conservative management with antibiotics may be appropriate for select adults with uncomplicated appendicitis, ideally after imaging confirmation and in systems equipped for close follow-up; however, this approach requires careful selection, patient counseling, and reliable access to care, and it does not obviate the need for surgical evaluation in uncertain or high-risk scenarios such as pregnancy, immunocompromise, or suspected perforation [^111kuDPa] [^111VL6RX] [^1163ARHT].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls and delays to avoid misdiagnosis. Delayed diagnoses are more likely when classic features are absent or when key tests are omitted; ensuring documentation of RLQ tenderness, guarding or rebound, migration, fever, and labs, and escalating to imaging when symptoms persist, reduces missed appendicitis and its complications, particularly perforation and the need for multiple procedures, which are more common in delayed cases [^113CiBhs] [^115BL2gz]. I should confirm that the care pathway includes re-evaluation if pain localizes, new peritoneal signs develop, or the patient fails to improve, as disease evolution often clarifies the diagnosis within 12–24 hours [^1169JEG2].

> In summary, I should conclude that acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis here, supported by RLQ pain, leukocytosis, and anorexia and reinforced by the high diagnostic weight of RLQ pain and leukocytosis in validated models; next steps are to calculate a clinical score to communicate risk, obtain contrast-enhanced CT in adults to confirm and stage disease, tailor imaging to pediatric or pregnant populations, and involve surgery early for moderate to high probability presentations while providing analgesia and supportive care in parallel [^112bHDkA] [^112LGR8q] [^117WV2Mk] [^111VL6RX].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute appendicitis** [^112bHDkA], given the classic triad of right lower quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and anorexia [^116mBUfj]. This presentation is highly specific for appendicitis [^notfound], and **prompt imaging** [^1146XbnY] and surgical consultation are indicated to confirm the diagnosis and prevent complications such as perforation or abscess [^111NC37S].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis, other conditions can mimic these symptoms [^111Ttnh6]. The **differential diagnosis** includes:

- **Mesenteric adenitis**: Often follows a viral illness, more common in children, and typically lacks the classic migration of pain [^111Vw99B].

- **Crohn's disease**: Can present with RLQ pain, fever, and leukocytosis, but usually has a more chronic course with diarrhea and weight loss [^notfound].

- **Right-sided diverticulitis**: Less common than left-sided, but can present similarly [^1146XbnY].

- **Gynecological conditions**: Ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, or pelvic inflammatory disease can present with RLQ pain and leukocytosis, particularly in women of reproductive age [^notfound].

- **Urinary tract infections**: Pyelonephritis or nephrolithiasis can cause RLQ pain and leukocytosis, but usually have urinary symptoms [^1146XbnY].

---

## Clinical scoring systems

Several clinical scoring systems can aid in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^111NC37S]. The **Alvarado score** uses eight clinical and laboratory variables (including RLQ tenderness, leukocytosis, and anorexia) to stratify patients into low, moderate, or high probability groups [^115Kx1L8] [^117WV2Mk]. A score of 7 or higher indicates a high probability of appendicitis and warrants surgical consultation and imaging [^115Kx1L8]. The **Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)** is similar and includes RLQ tenderness, leukocytosis, and anorexia, and is validated for children aged 3–18 years [^113xa6Xn] [^115zwxhY].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to confirm the diagnosis and guide management. In adults, **computed tomography (CT) scan** [^1146XbnY] with contrast is the gold standard, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90% [^113AVbgj]. In pregnant patients, ultrasound or MRI without contrast is preferred to avoid radiation exposure [^116dxDrt] [^1146XbnY].

---

## Management

The standard treatment for acute appendicitis is **surgical appendectomy**, either open or laparoscopic [^111NC37S]. Antibiotic therapy alone may be considered in select cases of uncomplicated appendicitis, but recurrence rates are significant [^1163ARHT].

---

## Potential complications

Delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Perforation**: Occurs in 17–32% of cases, increasing morbidity and mortality [^111NC37S].

- **Abscess formation**: Requires drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy [^1163ARHT].

- **Sepsis**: Life-threatening complication requiring intensive care [^116i84C4].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis for a patient presenting with right lower quadrant pain, leukocytosis, and anorexia is **acute appendicitis** [^1146XbnY]. This classic triad is highly specific for appendicitis, and prompt imaging and surgical consultation are essential to confirm the diagnosis and prevent complications [^1146XbnY] [^111NC37S].

### A practical score for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^115Kx1L8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (1986). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Alvarado score" for acute appendicitis.

The Alvarado Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. It was developed by Dr. Alfredo Alvarado in 1986. The score is calculated based on eight clinical features, each assigned a certain number of points. These features include symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

The Alvarado Score is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, helping clinicians decide whether a patient requires surgical consultation, further diagnostic imaging, or can be safely discharged. It is applicable to all age groups, but it should be used with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for atypical presentations of appendicitis in this population.

The score is not recommended for use in patients with known gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal surgeries, or other conditions that may mimic the symptoms of appendicitis, as these could potentially skew the results.

The Alvarado score is a diagnostic tool used to assess the likelihood of appendicitis based on a patient's clinical presentation. It considers eight specific signs and symptoms, with each receiving a designated point value. The sum of these values yields a total score that helps in evaluating the likelihood of appendicitis.

What this involves is a checklist of symptoms and signs:

- Right lower quadrant tenderness is worth 2 points.
- An elevated temperature (higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius) adds 1 point.
- Rebound tenderness contributes an additional 1 point.
- Migration of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant counts for 1 point.
- Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is also scored as 1 point.
- Nausea or vomiting likewise adds 1 point to the total.
- Leukocytosis, defined as a white blood cell count exceeding 10,000, provides 2 points.
- A left shift in leukocyte count, a sign of increased immature white blood cells, contributes 1 point.

To calculate the Alvarado score, determine the presence of each symptom or sign. If present, assign the associated points and sum them to get a score between 0 and 10.

The resulting score is then interpreted as follows:

- A score of 7 or above indicates "Probable appendicitis". This suggests a high likelihood of appendicitis, often prompting further medical evaluation, such as imaging or surgical consultation.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 6 denote "Possible appendicitis", indicating that appendicitis could be present. Medical professionals would typically consider additional clinical judgment and possibly further testing.
- A score below 5 implies "Unlikely appendicitis", suggesting that appendicitis is less probable, although it's important that clinicians still consider the broader clinical context.

This scoring system provides a structured approach, aiding healthcare providers in the initial assessment and decision-making process regarding suspected appendicitis.

Alvarado score for acute appendicitis — The score assigns points to symptoms, signs, and laboratory values to a total of 10, with components including migration (1), anorexia-acetone (in the urine) (1), nausea-vomiting (1); tenderness in right lower quadrant (2), rebound pain (1), elevation of temperature (> 37.3°C measured orally) (1); and leukocytosis (> 10,000/mm3) (2) and shift to the left (> 75% neutrophils) (1). Interpretation categories are 1–4 appendicitis unlikely, 5–6 appendicitis possible, 7–8 appendicitis probable, and 9–10 appendicitis very probable.

### Computed tomography utilization for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children decreases with a diagnostic algorithm [^113xa6Xn]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) is a clinical calculator used in the pediatric population to assess the likelihood of appendicitis. It is specifically designed for children and adolescents, typically between the ages of 3 and 18 years. The PAS is used to stratify the risk of appendicitis, helping clinicians decide whether further diagnostic testing, observation, or surgical consultation is needed. It includes variables such as anorexia, nausea/vomiting, pain migration, tenderness over the right lower quadrant, rebound pain, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. The PAS is not applicable to patients outside the pediatric age range or those with pre-existing abdominal conditions that could confound the diagnosis of appendicitis.

The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) provides a straightforward method to assess the likelihood of appendicitis in children by evaluating specific clinical signs and symptoms. This scoring system is based on user responses to a series of questions related to their symptoms. Each symptom, if present, contributes a specific number of points to the overall score.

The symptoms assessed and their corresponding scores are as follows:

- **Cough, percussion, or hopping tenderness in the right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Tenderness in right lower quadrant**: 2 points
- **Anorexia**: 1 point
- Fever of 38.0ºC (100.4ºF) or higher: 1 point
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point
- **White blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm³**: 1 point
- **Neutrophilia with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 7,500**: 1 point
- **Migration of pain to the right lower quadrant**: 1 point

To calculate the PAS, each boolean input reflecting the presence of these symptoms is evaluated. The response indicating the presence of a symptom adds its assigned score to the total.

Interpreting the total score offers a clear understanding of the risk level for appendicitis:

- A total score of 3 or less suggests a low risk of appendicitis.
- A score ranging from 4 to 6 indicates an intermediate risk.
- A score of 7 or more signifies a high risk of appendicitis.

This scoring system allows for quick assessment and can aid in clinical decision-making regarding the need for further diagnostic evaluation or intervention.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^111WBnQX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

The data were prospectively collected over a period from January 18th 2011 to January 2nd 2012 in a large care facility providing both secondary and tertiary level of surgical care in Finland. During the data collection period 13396 surgical patients visited emergency department. All patients admitted into emergency department for suspected appendicitis or pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant (RLQ) were initially included into the study.

Surgeons with their level of experience varying from first year residents to experienced specialists collected the basic data for the construction of the score during the initial examination at the emergency department.

The collected data included clinical findings (tenderness in RLQ, guarding in RLQ, and body temperature), and symptoms (pain in RLQ, migration of pain, vomiting and anorexia), together with laboratory test results (C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte count, proportion of neutrophils), as well as time passed between the onset of symptoms to clinical evaluation. In addition, the surgeons were requested to estimate the probability of appendicitis on clinical basis only with three-step scale: likely, possible, or improbable. Before this estimation, no diagnostic imaging was performed.

Clinical features

Clinical features of appendicitis include right lower quadrant pain, pain migration, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, rebound tenderness, pyrexia and elevated white cell count. However, not all children with appendicitis present with such classical symptoms and this can prolong the diagnosis. Any delay in the surgical management can lead to complications as appendicitis usually does not resolve spontaneously. Potential complications include perforation, peritonitis, abscess formation and death. Because of atypical presentations and the risk of potential complications, imaging is often requested. In children, this imaging technique is usually US.

History and physical examination in suspected appendicitis — In a meta-analysis of approximately 4,000 patients, right lower quadrant abdominal pain was reported as the most useful clinical finding with positive likelihood ratio 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.31 to 8.46 and negative likelihood ratio 95% CI 0 to 0.28. In a separate meta-analysis, pain migration had positive likelihood ratio 2.06 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.60) and negative likelihood ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), while pain progression had positive likelihood ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.50) and negative likelihood ratio 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.77). Additional Class III data indicate right lower quadrant tenderness had positive likelihood ratios of 2.3 and 1.1 with negative likelihood ratios of 0 and 0.1; rigidity carried a positive likelihood ratio of 3.8, and anorexia, rectal tenderness, guarding, fever, and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant had positive likelihood ratios below 2.9.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^111kuDPa]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

There is a paucity of data on time course of clinical response to antibiotics. In one adult trial, mean total white blood cell count decreased to normal within 1 day. One pediatric trial reported that the mean duration of fever in the antibiotic group was about 1 day. One adult trial described that appetite returned in 55% of participants by 18 hours and 98% by 24 hours. In one pilot RCT, individual participant responses were described over the first 24 hours of antibiotic treatment. Figure 2 shows Alvarado scores initially and after approximately 24 hours in 16 consecutive antibiotic-randomized patients; all initially received one dose of a long-acting antibiotic. The Alvarado score contains components that clinicians might use to follow the progress of an antibiotic-treated patient, that is, fever, nausea, tenderness, and leukocytosis. Most participants substantially improved over the first day. A few participants had lower scores that stayed constant over 1 day, but ultimately, their symptoms resolved. At 2 days, 3 to 5 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month, the proportion participants who were pain-free was 31%, 63%, 75%, and 88%, respectively.

Figure 2
Modified Alvarado scores* at Day 1 and Day 2 for 16 participants with the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated appendicitis randomized to antibiotics-first treatment.*The modified Alvarado score consists of the following components (points): right lower quadrant tenderness (0/2); elevated temperature (≥ 37.3°C or 99.1°F) (0/1); rebound tenderness (0/1); anorexia (0/1); nausea or vomiting (0/1); leukocytosis level of greater than 10,000 cells/μL (0/2); polymorphonuclear cell count of greater than 75% (0/1). The modified score does not include migration of pain to the right lower quadrant since this variable would not be applicable for comparison of serial scores among a cohort of patients with imaging-confirmed appendicitis. The maximum modified Alvarado score is 9 instead of 10 for the original score. There was no change in score between Day 1 and Day 2 scores for patient numbers 15 and 16. Permission was obtained from Elsevier to reprint this figure, which is from Talan et al.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^1169JEG2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical method

Here I am presenting my own method for the early diagnosis of acute appendicitis which has been proved to be helpful in many studies around the world. The method relies on a combination of factors derived from physical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests. The method uses a simple mnemonics (MANTRELS) that is easy to remember and can be applied in many settings without the need of a computer. This mnemonics makes the method even easier to follow: First you check for the three main symptoms: Migration, Anorexia, and Nausea or vomiting; then you follow with the signs which are: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, Rebound pain (Blumberg sign) and Elevation of the temperature (oral temperature of 37.3 C or more); and finally, you do the lab tests, essentially a CBC to look for Leukocytosis and Shift to the left (increased Stabs or Segmented neutrophils), and a urinalysis to look for acetone as an indication of anorexia if it is not clinically apparent. Rebound pain can be replaced with other indirect signs such as the Rovsing sign and also with the Dunphy's sign (cough test) or the Markle's test (heel-drop jarring test). Another indirect sign that can replace the rebound pain is tenderness by gentle direct percussion with the fist, as a mallet, on the right lumbar area in cases of a retrocecal acute appendicitis. In order of decreasing importance the eight best predicting factors proved to be: Localized tenderness on the right lower quadrant, leukocytosis, migration of pain, shift to the left, temperature elevation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia or acetone in the urine and direct rebound pain. I assigned a value of 2 to each of the two of the more important factors tenderness and leukocytosis), and a value of 1 to each one of the others, for a possible total score of 10. A score of 5 or 6 is compatible with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, a score of 7 or 8 indicates a probable appendicitis, and a score of 9 or 10 indicates a very probable appendicitis. To this score the clinician could subtract 2 points if the patient complains of headache because this symptom is very rare in cases of acute appendicitis. In this particular situation the patient may need further investigation to rule out a different disorder. Scores of five or six are in a grey area, and in this case, you may want to observe the patient for a short time (reevaluate every four to six hours) for 12 or 24 h and if the score stays the same consider other tests such as ultrasound or diagnostic laparoscopy. When the score is three or four, the clinician has two options: This could represent a very early stage of an acute appendicitis so the clinician could keep the patient under observation and repeat the tests, or even more, order additional tests such as an US or CT scan if they are available in that particular setting. Another option is to rely on his clinical impression because, as I already mentioned in my original article, "there is always an intangible ingredient in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. If there is any question about the diagnosis, more physical examinations and laboratory tests should be performed and the patient should be evaluated every four or six hours, preferably in the hospital". If the score remains the same or increases after this evaluation, the patient may need surgery. As we can see the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is a dynamic process that go hand to hand with the pathological changes of the disease. As we all know, medicine is a combination of science and art, both of them equally important in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, so we cannot discard one of them in favor of the other. It is for this reason that we cannot depend on the technological advances only but we should use our common sense and clinical experience to arrive to a correct diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right lower quadrant pain: 2022 update [^1146XbnY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This document focuses on imaging in the adult and pregnant populations with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, including patients with fever and leukocytosis. Appendicitis remains the most common surgical pathology responsible for RLQ abdominal pain in the United States. Other causes of RLQ pain include right colonic diverticulitis, ureteral stone, and infectious enterocolitis. Appropriate imaging in the diagnosis of appendicitis has resulted in decreased negative appendectomy rate from as high as 25% to approximately 1% to 3%. Contrast-enhanced CT remains the primary and most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate this patient population. MRI is approaching CT in sensitivity and specificity as this technology becomes more widely available and utilization increases. Unenhanced MRI and ultrasound remain the diagnostic procedures of choice in the pregnant patient. MRI and ultrasound continue to perform best in the hands of the experts. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected appendicitis: approved by ACEP board of directors February 1, 2023 [^111CTuiB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric suspected appendicitis — Kharbanda et al prospective cohort derivation and validation of decision rules: Children aged 3–18 years (total 601 patients) were evaluated, and a logistic regression rule using nausea, history of focal right lower quadrant pain, difficulty walking, rebound tenderness and absolute neutrophil count > 6.75×10³ μL yielded that a score of 5 or less identified 108 patients with 106 without appendicitis, with sensitivity 98.7% (95% CI 95.5%-99.9%) and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.1% (95% CI 93.5%-99.7%); validation sensitivity was 96.3% (95% CI 87.5%-99%) and NPV 95.6% (95% CI 90.8%-99%). A recursive partitioning rule (absolute neutrophil count > 6.75, nausea/emesis/anorexia, maximal tenderness in right lower quadrant) achieved derivation sensitivity 100% (95% CI 97.7%-100%) and NPV 100% (95% CI 96.0%-100%), with validation sensitivity 98.1% (95% CI 90.1%-99.9%) and NPV 97.5% (95% CI 86.8%-99.9%). Patients identified as low risk by either prediction model should be considered for observation instead of imaging.

### Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the presentation of paediatric acute appendicitis: an observational study [^111qaWD9]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine whether there were differences in the clinical presentation of patients imaged to evaluate for acute appendicitis in 2020 compared to 2019 with the hope that this information might better identify patients who should undergo imaging work-up and those who should not.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective observational study included patients < 18 years who were evaluated for appendicitis between 1 March and 31 May 2019 and 2020. A total of 465 patients were stratified by final diagnosis (appendicitis versus not appendicitis) and compared based on presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, vital signs, and laboratory test results.

Results

Symptoms and physical examination findings that were significant in the positive cohort in both years included right lower quadrant pain, pain with movement, migration of pain, right lower quadrant tenderness, and peritoneal findings. Reporting upper respiratory symptoms was an independent predictor of negative results among all patients and in 2019. Both negative cohorts were more likely to have negative physical examinations. Anorexia and nausea/vomiting were more likely among positive cases in 2019 whereas diarrhoea was more likely among positive cases in 2020.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly change the presenting features of acute appendicitis. The results of the present study emphasise the importance of the physical examination. The ambiguity of symptoms that mimic gastroenteritis justifies imaging in these patients.

### When fever, leukocytosis, and right lower quadrant pain is not appendicitis [^111Lj6Q3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Mesenteric cystic lymphangioma (MCL) is an uncommon, benign, slow-growing abdominal tumor that is derived from the lymphatic vessels (World J Gastroenterol. 2012;18:6328–6332, Radiographics. 1994;14:729–737). It is most often diagnosed in the head and neck of affected children. Rarely, a lymphangioma can develop within the small bowel (Pan Afr Med J. 2012;12:7). The clinical presentation of patients with an abdominal MCL can range from asymptomatic to acute abdominal pain (J Korean Surg Soc. 2012;83:102–106). We report a case of small bowel volvulus caused by an MCL in a 3-year-old child who presented to the pediatric emergency department with right lower quadrant pain. The child was thought to have a perforated appendicitis and was taken to the operating room where an MCL was identified and resected. This case illustrates the need to consider MCL when a patient presents to the emergency department with right lower quadrant pain.

### The diagnosis of acute appendicitis: clinical assessment versus computed tomography evaluation [^113AVbgj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to validate Alvarado's predictive model as a diagnostic test and to assess the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) scan as a supplemental tool in the evaluation of acute appendicitis. Clinical and radiologic data of 215 patients with acute abdominal pain were evaluated. Clinical assessment was based on positive findings of migration of pain, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tenderness of the lower right quadrant, rebound tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis with a left shift. Evaluation by CT scan had a sensitivity of 90.1% and a specificity of 94.1%. Clinical assessment based on the MANTRELS criteria had a sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 84.7%. With the assistance of CT scan, sensitivity and specificity increased to 98.3% and 95.8%, respectively.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### The great gut mimicker: a case report of MIS-C and appendicitis clinical presentation overlap in a teenage patient [^1129VXh1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with MIS-C can present with findings characteristic of acute appendicitis, including RLQ pain, fever, nausea, emesis, anorexia, and radiographic evidence of appendicitis. This presents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Although difficult to exclude appendicitis in the case of CT evidence, certain laboratory criteria, namely relative leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may be helpful in differentiating these patients. However, the use of immunomodulatory agents in the treatment of MIS-C may complicate the care of a patient with potential appendicitis, and appendectomy may still be preferable as the lowest risk option despite a low clinical suspicion for appendicitis.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^111ofRkD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 1.1. We suggest the use of scoring systems for excluding acute appendicitis in elderly patients with a low-probability score (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).

Statement 1.2. We suggest against basing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in elderly patients only on scoring systems (Conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
2 Could the diagnosis of acute appendicitis be based only on clinical signs and symptoms in elderly patients? In adult patients, laboratory tests of the inflammatory response and the clinical descriptors of peritoneal irritation and migration of pain are the strongest discriminators and should be included in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected appendicitis.

According to most included studies, among elderly patients, there is a lower rate of correct pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis compared to younger population.

Furthermore, in almost all the included studies, the average time from symptoms onset to admission and from admission to theatre was greater in older patients than in younger ones.

There is still controversy on whether the presentation of appendicitis in the elderly patients differs significantly from those in the younger age groups.

According to some authors the typical triad of migrating right lower quadrant pain of short duration, fever and leucocytosis is infrequently observed. Many elderly patients with acute appendicitis have signs and symptoms consistent with ileus or bowel obstruction. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting are common. The reported rate of the presence of fever ranges from 30 to 80%. However, only a minority of the patients has all of typical signs and symptoms together.

According to other authors, appendicitis does not present atypically in older patients. On the contrary, symptoms and signs reflect the severity of the abdominal disease, the delay of hospital admission and the high rate of perforations. Indeed, significantly more signs and symptoms of peritonitis (abdominal distension, generalised tenderness and guarding, rebound tenderness, palpable abdominal mass) are recorded among older patients. Probably, comorbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

### How to improve the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource limited settings [^111T2Uwy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

When you get to seven, the probability of appendicitis raises dramatically so you may want to operate especially if the patient is a young male. If the patient is a woman, additional investigations may be required to rule out gynecological disorders. This particular situation was validated in a meta-analysis study of adult and pediatric patients which proved that an Alvarado score below four to five rules out the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children, and in adults, an Alvarado score of eight to nine or higher rules in the diagnosis. The Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) did not identify clinically useful low- or high-risk groups at typical pretest probabilities.

The only laboratory tests that are needed in the initial evaluation for acute appendicitis is a complete CBC to determine if there is shift to the left, that is to say, stabs or bands (more than 5%) or increased segmented neutrophils (more than 75%) since they are elevated in the early stages of the inflammatory process. Then, several hours later, there is an increase of the whole number of leucocytes and you will find a leukocytosis of more than 10.000/ml. A urinalysis is useful to determine if there is acetone which indicates a fasting state related to anorexia, and also it may show a few red blood cells due to an inflammatory process around the appendix. If the urine shows too many red cells it may point to a ureteral calculus and further investigation should be done. The C-reactive protein test is not enclosed in my score because it is a non-specific test that detects an inflammatory process only and is not diagnostic for any particular condition. Besides this, it would be a redundancy because the shift to the left and leukocytosis are doing the same thing.

### Prospective validation of the pediatric appendicitis score [^115zwxhY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively validate the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS), developed on a cohort of children with abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis, in unselected children with abdominal pain who present to the emergency department.

Study Design

Over a 19-month period, we prospectively recruited children 1 to 17 years old who came to our tertiary pediatric emergency department, with a chief complaint of abdominal pain of duration less than 7 days. PAS components included fever > 38 degrees C, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, cough/percussion/hopping tenderness (2 points), right-lower-quadrant tenderness (2 points), migration of pain, leukocytosis > 10 000 cells/mm³, and polymorphonuclear neutrophilia > 7500 cells/mm³. A follow-up call was made to verify final outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver operating characteristic curve of the PAS with respect to diagnosis of appendicitis were calculated.

Results

We collected data on 849 children. 123 (14.5%) had pathologic study-proven appendicitis. Mean (median, range) score for children with appendicitis and without appendicitis was 7.0 (7, 2–10) and 1.9 (1, 0–9), respectively. If a cutoff PAS of ≤ 2 was used to discharge patients without further investigation, only 3 (2.4%) with appendicitis would be sent home. If a PAS of ≥ 7 was used to take children to the operating room without further investigation, only 29 (4%) would not have appendicitis. For the PAS the area under the receiver operator curve was 0.95.

Conclusions

The PAS is useful, because a value ≤ 2 (found in 73% of children without appendicitis) has high validity for ruling out appendicitis, and a score ≥ 7 (found in 61% of children with appendicitis) has a high validity for predicting the presence of appendicitis. Children with PAS of 3 to 6 (37% with appendicitis and 23% without appendicitis in this study) should undergo further investigation such as observation, ultrasonography, or computed tomography.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Development of the RIPASA score: a new appendicitis scoring system for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis [^114aRdrz]. Singapore Medical Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "RIPASA score for acute appendicitis" for acute appendicitis.

The RIPASA score, or Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis score, is a clinical calculator used for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is applicable to patients presenting with acute abdominal pain where there is a suspicion of appendicitis. The RIPASA score is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce negative appendectomy rates, and aid in decision-making regarding the need for surgery. It incorporates a range of clinical, laboratory, and demographic factors, including symptoms, signs, and blood test results. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may be less accurate in atypical presentations of appendicitis or in patients with other abdominal conditions that mimic appendicitis.

The RIPASA score calculator evaluates the likelihood of acute appendicitis based on multiple clinical criteria. Each criterion is assigned a numerical value depending on specific user responses input into the system. The criteria include factors such as sex, age, and various symptoms. These factors are scored as follows:

- **Sex**: Female = 0.5, Male = 1
- **Age**: Less than 40 = 1, 40 or more = 0.5
- **Foreign national**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Right iliac fossa pain**: Yes = 0.5, No = 0
- **Pain migration to the right iliac fossa**: Yes = 0.5, No = 0
- **Anorexia**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Duration of symptoms**: 48 hours or less = 1, more than 48 hours = 0.5
- **RIF tenderness**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Right iliac fossa guarding**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Rebound tenderness**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Rovsing's sign**: Yes = 2, No = 0
- **Fever**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Elevated white blood cell count**: Yes = 1, No = 0
- **Negative urine analysis**: Yes = 1, No = 0

The calculator collects these responses, converts them into their respective scores, and sums them to produce a total score ranging from 1.5 to 16. The interpretation of the resulting score is straightforward: a score of 7 or less indicates that appendicitis is unlikely, while a score of more than 7 suggests that appendicitis is likely.

### Pediatric appendicitis score [^111F5QvT]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Morbidity in children treated with appendicitis results either from late diagnosis or negative appendectomy. A Prospective analysis of efficacy of Pediatric Appendicitis Score for early diagnosis of appendicitis in children was conducted.

Methods

In the last 5 years, 1,170 children aged 4 to 15 years with abdominal pain suggestive of acute appendicitis were evaluated prospectively. Group 1 (734) were patients with appendicitis and group 2 (436) nonappendicitis. Multiple linear logistic regression analysis of all clinical and investigative parameters was performed for a model comprising 8 variables to form a diagnostic score.

Results

Logistic regression analysis yielded a model comprising 8 variables, all statistically significant, P < .001. These variables in order of their diagnostic index were (1) cough/percussion/hopping tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen (0.96), (2) anorexia (0.88), (3) pyrexia (0.87), (4) nausea/emesis (0.86), (5) tenderness over the right iliac fossa (0.84), (6) leukocytosis (0.81), (7) polymorphonuclear neutrophilia (0.80) and (8) migration of pain (0.80). Each of these variables was assigned a score of 1, except for physical signs (1 and 5), which were scored 2 to obtain a total of 10. The Pediatric Appendicitis Score had a sensitivity of 1, specificity of 0.92, positive predictive value of 0.96, and negative predictive value of 0.99.

Conclusion

Pediatric appendicitis score is a simple, relatively accurate diagnostic tool for accessing an acute abdomen and diagnosing appendicitis in children.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113gnDzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing diverticulitis requires an approach that considers atypical presentations in older adults (Figure 2). The 2022 European multi‐society guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults provide recommendations for how to incorporate these differences into clinical practice. They suggest avoiding diagnosis based solely on exam findings or laboratory results, as this may lead to underdiagnosis. Instead, cross‐sectional CT imaging with IV contrast is suggested for all patients older than 65 years with suspected diverticulitis. Obtaining a CT scan in every patient over 65 with abdominal pain and suspected diverticulitis may not be feasible, and this may be omitted in select cases with mild local symptoms and reliable close clinical follow‐up. However, patients with any systemic signs, including atypical symptoms such as fatigue, renal insufficiency, chest pain, or syncope should be evaluated with CT imaging to rule out complicated disease that may require inpatient management or procedural intervention.

Case example part 1: A 78‐year‐old woman with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, prior stroke, obesity, COPD and one prior episode of diverticulitis presents to clinic with 3 days of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, loose stools, anorexia, and fatigue. Physical exam reveals tachycardia to 105 with an irregular rhythm, fever to 38°C, and focal left lower quadrant tenderness. Her white blood cell count is 13,000 and creatinine is 1.4. Other laboratory values are normal. Given her systemic symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, in addition to her elevated creatinine, a CT scan is obtained which demonstrate acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Acute right lower quadrant pain is a nonspecific but common clinical complaint. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute right lower quadrant pain and CT has become the most reliable imaging method in the evaluation of these patients. Although there is controversy regarding the best way to perform CT in this setting, oral and i.v. contrast-enhanced CT remains the most commonly used technique. CT with oral and i.v. contrast material facilitates diagnosis of appendicitis and the numerous other entities that may cause right lower quadrant pain.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^115BL2gz]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Cases were also reviewed for the secondary outcome of preventable delayed diagnosis, defined as a missed opportunity to improve diagnosis (MOID). To grade the likelihood of a MOID, we used the validated Modified Safer Dx checklist. The Safer Dx measures the likelihood of a MOID using 13 items relating to individual elements of an encounter that could lead to MOIDs. The first 12 items include the history, physical examination, data gathering, presence of "red flags", incomplete caregiver information, completeness of evaluation, diagnostic reasoning, test interpretation, follow-up of results, differential formation, disease evolution, and how closely the index presentation reflected typical features of the disease. The final item, the MOID score, graded the overall likelihood of a MOID. All items are measured on a scale of 1 to 7. We further classified a score of 1 to 2 as an unlikely MOID, 3 to 5 as a possible MOID, and 6 to 7 as a likely MOID.

Variables

Potential clinical features associated with delayed diagnosis were chosen a priori based on clinical features related to the ultimate diagnosis of appendicitis from previous literature. These features included age, sex, duration of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, history of fever, pain with walking, maximal pain in the right lower quadrant, and abdominal guarding. If the symptom was not mentioned in the record, it was assessed as being absent, as is typical for this type of study. We also assessed the presence of a complex chronic condition based on same- and previous-encounter diagnosis codes.

We hypothesized that several care features would be associated (positively or negatively) with delayed diagnosis, including obtaining ultrasonographic imaging, obtaining a CT scan, use of a nonopioid analgesic (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, or naproxen), use of an opioid analgesic (fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, or oxycodone), or use of ondansetron. Finally, because we planned to evaluate disparities between timely and delayed diagnosis, we collected race, ethnicity, and insurance information as recorded in the source database.

### A case of cystic lymphatic malformation mimicking acute appendicitis in an adult patient: a rare diagnostic pitfall [^111wSTbP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Abdominal cystic lymphatic malformations are rare pathological entities of uncertain aetiology that usually present in early childhood with indolent abdominal distention. We report the case of a 17-year-old man who presented to our hospital with acute right lower quadrant pain, nausea and anorexia. His blood tests revealed a raised white cell count and elevated inflammatory markers. Clinical examination revealed signs of localised right lower quadrant peritonism. A diagnosis of clinical appendicitis was made, and in keeping with local management protocols, the patient proceeded to theatre for a diagnostic laparoscopy without radiological investigations. Operative findings yielded a normal appendix and a large abdominal cystic malformation. This article highlights the need to keep a broad differential diagnosis when performing surgery on patients with clinically presumed appendicitis and the importance of radiological investigations in clinical decision-making, we also review abdominal cystic lymphatic malformations as a rare diagnostic pitfall.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Chronic appendicitis "syndrome" manifested by an appendicolith and thickened appendix presenting as chronic right lower abdominal pain in adults [^112QMjHh]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

In this short report, we describe a small series of adult patients with chronic appendicitis presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The clinical presentation was unusual and atypical for classic appendicitis because of the absence of fever, peritoneal tenderness on focused graded compression of the abdomen, and leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) findings included the presence of an appendicolith and appendiceal thickening, without mesenteric infiltration, abscess, or collection. In this series, the appendicolith appeared to represent a marker rather than an actual cause of appendicitis. Focused CT scans with additional lung and bone windows proved optimal in detecting appendicoliths, which were not visible on the scout localizer scans, despite windowing modifications. Our findings suggest that chronic appendicitis may be a phenomenon unique to adults and should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic right lower quadrant pain in patients seen in the emergency room setting. Surgery is curative in such patients, although expectant management is an alternative when tolerated by the patient.

### Intraoperative diagnosis of solitary cecal diverticulum not requiring surgery: is appendectomy indicated? [^116YSqXa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the clinical diagnosis in 85% of the cases of cecal diverticulitis. In the setting of inflammation, leukocytosis would be characteristic. Clinically, patients with SCD present with a long history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, with the absence of systemic toxic signs and of nausea/vomiting. Unlike in appendicitis, the pain remains in the right lower quadrant instead of migrating from the epigastrium.

Only 10 of 5000 (0.2%) radiological examinations would diagnose cecal diverticulitis in Oriental people; this improves to 9% if the patient has had a previous AP, and improves further to 65% intraoperatively. The radiological diagnosis with an abdominal radiograph revealed a fecalith in 50% of cases, and a barium enema may show the diverticulum as obliteration of its lumen because of surrounding inflammation and edema. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a hypoechoic area on a portion of a thickened cecal wall; this radiological procedure has a sensitivity of 91.3%, specificity of 99.8%, and an accuracy of 99.5% for the diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis. CT scans are being increasingly used; this radiological examination showed thickened cecal wall with an extraluminal mass associated with haziness and linear stranding of the pericecal fat. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used in case of equivocal ultrasound features or in case of young or pregnant patients who need to avoid ionizing radiation.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

Case Summary

A healthy 65-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of sudden-onset severe lower abdominal pain. This is her first episode. She reports nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Her last colonoscopy was at age 60, and was normal, except for diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Physical examination is significant for fever, tachycardia, and generalized abdominal pain with rebound tenderness. Pertinent laboratory findings include a leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A CT scan is obtained and is consistent with freely perforated diverticulitis, including a thickened sigmoid colon, free fluid in the pelvis, and free air noted near the diaphragm (). The surgeon completes the patient evaluation, recommends initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, and plans to go immediately to the operating room for surgical resection.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### Nonoperative management of omental infarction: a case report in a child [^115hhrgP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Omental infarction is a rare entity in children that is usually diagnosed during surgery for suspected appendicitis. We report the clinical case of an obese boy presenting with abdominal pain and right-sided tenderness without fever, anorexia, or leukocytosis. Abdominal ultrasonography suggested omental infarction, and computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis. Nonoperative management was adopted with rapid and uneventful recovery. Nonoperative treatment of omental infarction is safe and effective; accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial to enable a conservative approach. Suggestive clinical features and diagnostic workup are addressed.

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^113CiBhs]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case-control study, children with delayed diagnosis at their index ED encounter were more likely to have a longer duration of abdominal pain, no pain with walking, abdominal pain outside the right lower quadrant, no abdominal guarding, and a complex chronic condition compared with children with a timely diagnosis of appendicitis. Based on PAS or pARC scores, children with delayed diagnoses were less clinically discernible. They were more likely to receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiemetic therapy and less likely to receive opioids or undergo imaging. In 76.8% of patients with a delayed diagnosis, there were possibly or probably opportunities to improve diagnosis. Children with delayed diagnosis had worse outcomes. When the diagnosis was made, hospitalizations were longer, appendectomy was less likely, and appendiceal perforation and multiple abdominal surgical procedures were more likely. Taken together, our findings suggest that delayed diagnosis was more likely in patients with less classic presentations, that such patients were less likely to undergo imaging or receive appendicitis-directed treatments, and that a substantial fraction of delayed diagnoses were preventable despite being less clinically apparent.

Among children with delayed diagnosis of appendicitis, progression of disease occurred between the index and delay ED encounters. Nearly every classic symptom or sign of appendicitis was more likely to be present during the later visit. The PAS and pARC scores, which measure the likelihood of appendicitis, were higher during the delay encounter than during the index encounter. Abdominal guarding and migration of pain to the right lower quadrant were especially likely to develop after the index encounter: each feature was more than 10 times as likely to be present later. The presence of more classic symptoms during a second ED visit makes the diagnosis more discernible to clinicians. Conversely, the absence of classic appendicitis symptoms puts a patient at risk of a delayed diagnosis.

Nevertheless, in this study, most delayed diagnoses were probably or possibly MOIDs, indicating that there were potential opportunities to prevent delay. The 3 elements of the diagnostic process most associated with a MOID were failures in diagnostic reasoning that indicated that the patient's history should have prompted a deeper evaluation. Most children with delayed diagnosis had neither a WBC count nor an imaging study performed at the index encounter. Children with a characteristic history or physical examination should undergo these tests in an effort to prevent delayed diagnosis. In this study, only 22.0% to 61.3% of children received indicated imaging based on a pARC score above the threshold at which imaging is cost-effective. This finding suggests an opportunity to improve detection.

### The value of pancreatic stone protein in predicting acute appendicitis in patients presenting at the emergency department with abdominal pain [^116i84C4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is defined as an inflammation of the vermiform appendix and is a common condition and an urgent surgical illness. It is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain and remains a diagnostic challenge. It has variable manifestations and generous overlap with other clinical syndromes. In fact morbidity increases significantly with the diagnostic delay and left untreated, appendicitis has the potential for severe complications, including perforation or sepsis, and may even cause death. Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancement in medicine, appendicitis still remains a clinical emergency.

No single sign, symptom, or diagnostic test exists which accurately confirms an appendiceal inflammation. The classic history of anorexia and periumbilical pain followed by nausea, right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and vomiting occurs in only 50% of cases.

Accepted etiologic factors of appendicitis are appendiceal lumen obstruction and infection. The main therapeutic option still remains the surgical removal of the vermiform appendix even though a few studies promote an antibiotic treatment. After admission to the emergency department (ED), patients presenting with abdominal pain caused by a variety of different etiologic factors have to be worked up with the goal of approaching 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis in a time-, cost-, and consultation-efficient manner.

It is reported that appendectomy carries a complication rate of up to 15%, as well as increased associated costs and the discomfort of hospitalisation and surgery. Delay in diagnosis and treatment account for much of the associated mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the goal of the surgeon is to diagnose appendicitis as early as possible.

The overall mortality rate of 0.2–0.8% is attributable to complications of the disease rather than to surgical interventions. The mortality rate in children ranges from 0.1% to 1%; in patients older than 70 years, the rate rises above 20%, primarily because of diagnostic and therapeutic delay.

Appendiceal perforation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with non-perforating appendicitis. The mortality risk of acute but not gangrenous appendicitis is less than 0.1%, but the risk rises to 0.6% in gangrenous appendicitis. The rate of perforation varies from 16% to 40%, with a higher frequency occurring in patients below 50 years (40–57%) and in patients older than 50 years (55–70%), in whom misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common. Complications occur in 1–5% of patients with appendicitis. Postoperative wound infections account for almost one third of the associated morbidity.

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

### "Cecal gangrene": a rare cause of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis [^1151rMVD]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report on a 58-year-old man with known diabetes, congestive heart failure, and need for chronic hemodialysis presenting with right lower abdominal quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Although initial clinical findings were highly suggestive of acute appendicitis, CT revealed marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum, which was interpreted as cecal infarction by the radiologist. Intraoperatively, cecal necrosis was confirmed, but the ileocecal valve and, especially, the appendix showed no ischemia. No vascular occlusions were found. Histopathologic analysis of the resected cecum demonstrated isolated transmural cecal necrosis with marked infiltration of the cecal wall by numerous bacteria and neutrophils. We present the CT features and histopathologic findings of isolated cecal gangrene, review the pathogenesis of occlusive and nonocclusive cecal ischemia or infarction, and discuss the role of bacterial superinfection as a potential cofactor in the pathogenesis of isolated cecal necrosis which should be included in the differential diagnosis of right-sided inferior abdominal quadrant pain.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A pregnant adult patient at 35 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for morbid obesity status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism presented with nausea and diffuse, progressive abdominal pain that started several hours after arrival, with no fever or vomiting reported. She reported good fetal movement without vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid, or contractions. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for rebound tenderness in left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an inflamed, dilated appendix with periappendiceal stranding and edema without fecalith.

Patient 2

A pregnant adult patient at 33 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for inflammatory bowel syndrome, status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic repair of internal hernia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus presented with 2 days of nausea, emesis, and right-sided epigastric pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient denied fever, chills, or cough, and reported regular fetal movement. The patient's presenting vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed focal tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory analysis showed a leukocytosis of 14.3×10³/μL. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated appendiceal wall thickening and periappendiceal stranding without fecalith.

### Evaluation of the appendicitis inflammatory response score for patients with acute appendicitis [^114KD3vC]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

The present study selected consecutive emergency room patients with suspicion of acute appendicitis between January 2006 and January 2009. The population consisted of all patients who complained of sudden-onset, non-traumatic abdominal pain. The data of these patients were previously used for a different study evaluating the use of imaging for acute appendicitis.

A senior surgical resident initially examined the patients, and the decision to operate was subsequently confirmed by a senior surgical staff member. Imaging by means of US or CT was used selectively in the present study and at discretion of the surgeon. The surgical procedures consisted of either a laparotomy or diagnostic laparoscopy followed by a laparoscopic appendectomy. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis during laparoscopy was established on the basis of macroscopic findings. A macroscopically normal appendix found at laparoscopy was left in situ. The diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed histologically in all resected specimens. Appendicitis was pathologically diagnosed when infiltration of the muscularis propria by neutrophil granulocytes was seen. Patients were classified into two groups: (1) phlegmonous appendicitis and (2) advanced appendicitis, defined as a macroscopic gangrenous appendix with or without perforation. A periappendicular abscess confirmed on CT was defined as an appendix that is surrounded by a fluid collection and extensive tissue infiltration, which prevents spread of infection into the free abdominal cavity.

Variables recorded to evaluate the scoring systems include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), pain in the RLQ, rebound tenderness, muscular defense, body temperature, high white blood cell (WBC) count, proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and a high level of C-reactive protein (CRP). These variables are necessary to calculate both the Alvarado score and the AIR score. The two scores are based on different variables, with different points assigned to each variable. In the pediatric population, the child's history obtained from the parents was used if the patient was too young to give a complete history. An overview of the scoring system is given in Table 1.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^111u63nW]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score (AIR score)" for acute appendicitis.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is specifically applicable to patients presenting with acute abdominal pain suggestive of appendicitis. The AIR score uses clinical and laboratory parameters such as fever, nausea, migration of pain, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk of having appendicitis.

The clinical utility of the AIR score is to aid in the decision-making process for the management of suspected appendicitis. It can help to identify patients who may require immediate surgical intervention, those who may benefit from further diagnostic imaging, and those who can be safely discharged with close follow-up.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the AIR score. However, it may be less accurate in certain patient populations such as pregnant women, elderly patients, or those with atypical presentations of appendicitis. It should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score is a clinical tool used to evaluate the likelihood of appendicitis in patients by analyzing symptoms and lab results. Input variables include vomiting, right iliac fossa pain, rebound tenderness, fever, polymorphonuclear leukocytes percentage, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein levels. Each response assigns a numeric score per predefined criteria. These scores are cumulatively calculated to determine the risk of appendicitis, guiding subsequent medical actions.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Vomiting**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Right Iliac Fossa Pain**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Rebound Tenderness**

- **None**: 0
- **Light**: 1
- **Medium**: 2
- **Strong**: 3

- **Fever (≥ 38.5ºC; 101.3ºF)**

- **No**: 0
- **Yes**: 1

- **Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes**

- **Less than 70%**: 0
- **70% to 84%**: 1
- **85% or more**: 2

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**

- **Less than 10**: 0
- 10.0 to 14.9: 1
- **15 or more**: 2

- **C-Reactive Protein Level (mg/L)**

- **Less than 10**: 0
- **10 to 49**: 1
- **50 or more**: 2

The aggregate of these scores can range from 0 to 12. Interpretation of the total score is essential for clinical decision-making:

- A score of 0 to 4 suggests a low risk of appendicitis. Patients in this category might be suited for outpatient follow-up if they are stable.
- A score ranging from 5 to 8 indicates an indeterminate risk. Such cases often require active in-hospital observation, which could involve rescoring, imaging, or even diagnostic laparoscopy based on clinic protocols.
- A score between 9 and 12 signals a high risk of appendicitis, where surgical exploration becomes a considerable option.

Summarizing, the AIR score aids clinicians by utilizing patient data to produce a coherent, actionable risk assessment for appendicitis, thereby informing optimal pathway selection based on the severity of risk.

### Surgical management of acute right lower-quadrant pain in pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^113s4teP]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of right lower-quadrant pain in pregnant patients is a challenge in diagnosis. We discuss the surgical issues among pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain and demonstrate the method to diagnosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study with enrollment during 2 years. Pregnant patients presenting with acute right lower-quadrant abdominal pain and requiring surgical consult were included. Demographics, gestational age, symptoms, workup, operative results, and pathology were recorded.

Results

One-hundred patients were enrolled, 38 had nonspecific abdominal pain, 15 of whom were admitted. There were no differences in temperature, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift among the admitted and nonadmitted patients. Forty-one patients underwent surgery and had a substantially higher gestational age, leukocyte count, and neutrophil shift than those who did not. Ultrasound was performed considerably more often on first-trimester patients (81.6%) compared with second- (58.1%) and third-trimester (57.9%) patients, and CT scan was used considerably less in the first trimester compared with the second and third trimesters, and considerably less than ultrasound for the first trimester. Sensitivity of ultrasound for appendicitis was inversely correlated to fetal gestational age, and CT scan retained high sensitivity and specificity throughout pregnancy.

Conclusions

This is one of the first prospective studies assessing diagnoses and workup of pregnant patients with right lower-quadrant pain. We recommend abdominal ultrasound be the first imaging modality for patients for whom surgical consultation is necessary, thereby determining if the pathology is obstetric. If inconclusive, a CT scan is necessary to guide treatment.

### The great gut mimicker: a case report of MIS-C and appendicitis clinical presentation overlap in a teenage patient [^114hC2m7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Our patient had some findings of appendicitis with RLQ tenderness, fever, nausea, emesis, and decreased appetite. Many of the classic signs of appendicitis (fever, anorexia, nausea, guarding, and migration of pain from the umbilical region to the RLQ) may be absent in children with appendicitis; these findings also may be present with diseases other than appendicitis. Up to 20% of patients with appendicitis present without leukocytosis, and our patient presented with an initially normal WBC count.

The patient's CT had findings concerning for acute appendicitis. CT has a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 95% for appendicitis. Causes of false positive CT include appendiceal neoplasms, IBD, cystic fibrosis, viral infections, and tubo-ovarian infection. In a study of radiologic findings in MIS-C, abdominal imaging showed small-volume ascites (38%), hepatomegaly (38%), echogenic kidneys (31%), bowel wall thickening (19%), gallbladder wall thickening (19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (13%), splenomegaly (6%), and bladder wall thickening (16%). Appendiceal dilation and fat stranding on CT, diagnostic of appendicitis and present in our patient, have not previously been described.

Non-operative management with antibiotics alone has been quite successful in managing acute uncomplicated appendicitis meeting strict inclusion criteria and was a strong consideration in this patient. However, the success of antibiotics to treat appendicitis in the setting of concurrent treatment with IVIG and steroids for MIS-C is unknown with no outcomes data currently available in the literature. Additionally, given the high likelihood that the patient's abdominal symptoms would continue given her MIS-C (independent of the diagnosis of appendicitis), the team was concerned they would be unable to reliably follow her abdominal exam to determine if her appendicitis was being adequately treated with antibiotics.

While our patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings necessitated surgical evaluation, her surgical and pathologic findings ultimately were not consistent with appendicitis. Laboratory criteria may be important in helping to differentiate MIS-C from acute appendicitis - specifically, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and inappropriately normal WBC count. Our patient had a progressive lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia that did not fit with the classic presentation of appendicitis.

### Pain as the only consistent sign of acute appendicitis: lack of inflammatory signs does not exclude the diagnosis [^116sM8Km]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis in adults remains tricky, but radiological examinations are very helpful to determine the diagnosis even when the adult patient presents atypically. This study was designed to quantify the proportion of patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis that had isolated right lower quadrant pain without biological inflammatory signs and then to determine which imaging examination led to the determination of the diagnosis.

Methods

In this monocentric study based on retrospectively collected data, we analyzed a series of 326 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis and isolated those who were afebrile and had isolated right lower quadrant pain and normal white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels. We determined whether the systematic ultrasonography examination was informative enough or a complementary intravenous contrast media computed tomography scan was necessary to determine the diagnosis, and whether the final pathological diagnosis fit the preoperative one.

Results

A total of 15.6% of the patients with a preoperative diagnosis of acute appendicitis had isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant, i.e., they were afebrile and their white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were normal. In 96.1% of the cases, the ultrasonography examination, sometimes complemented by an intravenous contrasted computed tomography scan if the ultrasonography result was equivocal, fit the histopathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis cannot be excluded when an adult patient presents with isolated rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant even without fever and biological inflammatory signs. In our study, ultrasonography and computed tomography were very helpful when making the final diagnosis.

### Propylthiouracil [^113Rh4ZB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (anorexia, pruritus, jaundice, light colored stools, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, etc.), particularly in the first six months of therapy. When these symptoms occur, measurement should be made of liver function (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and hepatocellular integrity (ALT/AST levels).

Patients who receive propylthiouracil should be under close surveillance and should be counseled regarding the necessity of immediately reporting any evidence of illness, particularly sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. In such cases, white blood cell and differential counts should be obtained to determine whether agranulocytosis has developed. Particular care should be exercised with patients who are receiving concomitant drugs known to be associated with agranulocytosis.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while taking an antithyroid drug, they should contact their physician immediately about their therapy.

Patients should report immediately any evidence of illness, in particular sore throat, skin eruptions, fever, headache, or general malaise. They also should report symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (anorexia, pruritus, right upper quadrant pain, etc.).

Inform patients that cases of vasculitis resulting in severe complications and death have occurred with propylthiouracil. Inform patients to promptly report symptoms that may be associated with vasculitis including new rash, hematuria or decreased urine output, dyspnea or hemoptysis (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Laboratory Tests

Because propylthiouracil may cause hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding, monitoring of prothrombin time should be considered during therapy with the drug, especially before surgical procedures.

Thyroid function tests should be monitored periodically during therapy. Once clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism has resolved, the finding of an elevated serum TSH indicates that a lower maintenance dose of propylthiouracil should be employed.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^112ARMhy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Making the clinical diagnosis

When encountering a new patient in the emergency department (ED), the surgeon first makes the clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis based on history, physical exam and routine laboratory testing. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting symptom. It is typically located in the left lower quadrant; however, a redundant sigmoid colon can reach the right lower quadrant and mimic appendicitis. Localized peritoneal irritation can result in guarding and rebound tenderness. Free perforation often presents as frank peritonitis. Fever and leukocytosis are usually present and assist in making the clinical diagnosis. Nausea and vomiting are the most notable symptoms when a stricture results in an obstruction. The initial assessment should include a) an assessment of the severity of the signs of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and white blood cell count, b) peritonitis on physical exam and c) signs of organ dysfunctions. Patients with clinical diagnosis consistent with diverticulitis who have concerning signs of sepsis should be considered to be at high risk for complicated diverticulitis. They should have IV access obtained, be given a bolus of IV isotonic crystalloids (20 ml/kg), be administered IV antibiotics, and be admitted to the hospital.

These patients should undergo CT scanning with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis with the exception of pregnant women where ultrasound is recommended. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity in confirming the diagnosis and identifying patients who are candidates for therapeutic PCD. CT scanning also excludes other causes of left lower quadrant abdominal pain (e.g. leaking abdominal aortic aneurism or an ovarian abscess), but is not reliable in differentiating acute diverticulitis from colon malignancy.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### A new adult appendicitis score improves diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis – a prospective study [^116Mzu24]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS)" for acute appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) is a clinical calculator used in the evaluation of adult patients who present with suspected acute appendicitis. This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, helping to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories based on a variety of clinical factors such as symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The AAS can help guide clinical decision-making, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary imaging or surgery in low-risk patients. It is not applicable to pediatric patients, pregnant women, or individuals with previous appendectomy. It should also not be used in patients with other clear causes of abdominal pain.

The Adult Appendicitis Score (AAS) calculator assesses the likelihood of acute appendicitis by evaluating patient symptoms and lab results. Users input data related to seven key indicators which are translated into numerical scores based on established categories. The scoring system assigns weights to patient symptoms and lab values as follows:

- **Right Lower Quadrant Pain**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Pain Relocation**:

- Yes = 2 points
- No = 0 points

- **Right Lower Quadrant Tenderness**:

- Present, male = 3 points
- Present, female aged 16–49 years = 1 point
- Present, female aged > 50 years = 3 points
- Absent = 0 points

- **Guarding**:

- None = 0 points
- Mild = 2 points
- Moderate or severe = 4 points

- **White Blood Cell Count (×10⁹/L)**:
- ≥ 7.2 and < 10.9 = 1 point
- ≥ 10.9 and < 14.0 = 2 points
- ≥ 14.0 = 3 points

- **Neutrophils (%)**:
- ≥ 62 and < 75 = 2 points
- ≥ 75 and < 83 = 3 points
- ≥ 83 = 4 points

- **C-Reactive Protein, mg/L (for symptoms > 24 hours)**:
- ≥ 4 and < 11 = 2 points
- ≥ 11 and < 25 = 3 points
- ≥ 25 and < 83 = 5 points
- ≥ 83 = 1 point
(alternative ranges for CRP are scored similarly based on different thresholds)

To compute the AAS score, each input response is translated into its respective point value. These scores are summed to produce a total score ranging between 4 and 23. This total score then helps provide a snapshot of appendicitis risk:

- A score of 10 or lower suggests a low risk of acute appendicitis.
- Scores from 11 to 15 indicate an intermediate risk.
- A score of 16 or higher points to a high risk of acute appendicitis.

These interpretations guide clinicians in assessing the probability of appendicitis, allowing for more informed decision-making in potential cases.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Ku9vA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include largely minimal or absent symptoms during acute and chronic phases, laboratory-only abnormalities, and risks for progressive liver disease. Both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and fewer than 20% of patients with acute infection have characteristic symptoms such as low-grade fever, mild right-upper-quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dark urine, and jaundice; unexplained elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may be the only laboratory finding. Recognition of acute HCV infection with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important since treatment during the early phases of infection is more efficacious than during the chronic phase; over time, cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, with risk factors including older age at infection, male sex, obesity, and concomitant alcohol use, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV infection.

### Is it possible to predict the severity of acute appendicitis? Reliability of predictive models based on easily available blood variables [^116LLzmF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency surgical admission. In the past, almost invariably, a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, often but not always associated with laboratory confirmation (leucocytosis), led to a surgical operation of appendicectomy. As a consequence, the rate of negative appendicectomies (i.e. whose macroscopic or pathologic examination did not find any sign of inflammation) was quite high. The advent of laparoscopy, with its diagnostic capabilities, should have reduced the rate of negative appendicectomies but this has never been definitely proven. In actual facts, a certain number of cases where symptoms would suggest acute appendicitis were due to other diseases such as tubo-ovarian inflammation, ectopic pregnancy, active ileitis or colitis or simply to mesenteric adenopathy, among the others. In some cases, even laparoscopic exploration is not able to find the cause of right iliac fossa pain. Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pain in the right iliac fossa are not always consistent and there are still areas for discussion. Laparoscopic exploration is nowadays considered the gold standard for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. While the indication for appendicectomy is straightforward in case of macroscopically confirmed acute appendicitis, it has been suggested not to remove the appendix if another possible cause for pain has been detected and possibly treated. The issue remains in those cases where abdominal exploration does not reveal any abnormality in a patient with clear symptoms of appendicitis. The European Association of Endoscopic Surgery Guidelines and the World Society of Emergency Surgery Guidelines suggest removing the appendix anyway, considering the possibility of a mucosal only appendicitis which is not visible from the serosal surface, but this approach may be considered an overtreatment and expose to unnecessary, albeit low, risk of complications in cases of innocent appendixes. Ultrasound scan is rarely diagnostic of acute appendicitis, and the rate of false negatives is quite high. Nonetheless, most surgeons still consider blood tests and abdominal USS the basis of the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. To reduce the risk of unnecessary appendicectomies, some Authors and guidelines suggested a liberal use of preoperative CT scan. However, it is well known that also CT scan can be associated with false negative results and it is not immune from radiation-associated risks, in particular in young people. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive and time-consuming, and its real indications in emergency are usually limited to pregnant patients and in case of suspected inflammatory bowel, unless new MRI protocols are developed and implemented specifically for the emergency evaluation of right iliac fossa pain. Up to date, no reliable test, either imaging or laboratory based, has been found to be able to accurately predict the presence of acute appendicitis.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^115dNVdH]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests are not specific for the diagnosis of renal abscess. In our study, all 17 patients had leukocytosis with elevated CRP levels, and 64.7% of them presented with WBC counts > 15,000/μL. In addition, 58.8% of the 17 children showed pyuria, but none manifested renal function impairment. According to these results, we suggest that emergency physicians should keep the diagnosis of renal abscess in mind when children present with triad symptoms, pyuria, and significant elevated serum WBC counts and CRP levels.

We compared the clinical presentations and laboratory results between the children who presented with multiple abscesses and single abscess. We found that flank pain, anorexia or vomiting, significant leukocytosis, pyuria, and urine culture were more frequently noted in the multiple-abscess patient group. Early imaging studies and intravenous antibiotics are advocated in this group of children to minimize hospital stay.

### How to diagnose acute appendicitis: ultrasound first [^116xsjyA]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of appendicitis

Clinical signs and symptoms

According to, AA might be called simple AA in the absence of gangrene, perforation or abscess around the inflamed appendix, or complicated AA when perforation, gangrene or periappendicular abscess are present. Abdominal pain is the primary presenting complaint, followed by vomiting with migration of the pain to the right iliac fossa, described first by J Murphy in 1904. However, this classical presentation is quite often absent, either due to variation in the anatomic position of the appendix or the age of the patient, with atypical presentations seen often in infants and elderly patients.

Laboratory markers

A good review of laboratory markers for the diagnosis of AA is provided by DJ Shogilev et al. The degree of white blood cell elevation, the value of C-reactive protein, the proportion of polymorphonuclear cells, a history of fever and other factors have been studied extensively for the diagnosis of AA, but lack sufficient specificity either alone or in combination. On the contrary, the absence of all of these laboratory parameters can potentially rule out the diagnosis of AA.

### Current management of acute appendicitis in adults: what you need to know [^1163ARHT]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common acute surgical diseases in the world today. Acute appendicitis can present with a well-recognized clinical presentation with abdominal pain which localize in the right lower quadrant. This presentation is more typical in men than in women of child baring age. Several clinical and laboratory calculations can be used to increase the likelihood of making a correct diagnosis. Various imaging modalities can be used to make the diagnosis which include ultrasound, computer tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Each study has well known sensitivity/specificity of positive predictive value of making the diagnosis of appendicitis. The management of acute appendicitis is based on the presentation of the patient and dividing it into uncomplicated and complicated disease. Each requires management with antibiotics and followed with timely appendectomy. Recent studies have demonstrated nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis without no fecalith that can be managed with antibiotics alone. Complicated acute appendicitis should undergo timely surgical intervention. Patients presenting with a large appendiceal abscess or phlegmon should undergo percutaneous drainage and antibiotic management. There are certain patient populations that should be considered for surgical intervention. Pregnant patients as well as immunosuppressed patients should undergo timely surgical intervention to decrease the risk of complications. This review outlines the current principles of the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of acute appendicitis based on the best available evidence of acute appendicitis in adults.

Appendicitis is one of the most common sources of abdominal pain in the emergency setting and is generally considered a straightforward diagnosis. However, atypical appearances, non-visualization, and inconclusive features can make these cases more complicated. The objectives of this article are to review the differential diagnoses for right lower quadrant pain, discuss the imaging characteristics of simple appendicitis on computed tomography (CT), and provide guidance for equivocal cases, complicated appendicitis, and appendicitis mimics. This review will also discuss the identification and management of neoplasms of the appendix.

### Clinical approach to a child with abdominal pain who might have appendicitis [^112bSawA]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Appendicitis can usually be diagnosed on completion of a history and physical examination (abdominal pain, vomiting, right lower quadrant tenderness and guarding), although laboratory evaluation with a urinalysis and white blood cell count can be of assistance. In the few cases where doubt remains, plain films of the chest and abdomen can be helpful. Whether and when further imaging is indicated remains controversial. We reviewed reports of studies published since 2003 in which the sensitivity and specificity of CT and sonography for diagnosing appendicitis were determined. Sonography had an average sensitivity of 87.1% and an average specificity of 89.2% in the nine studies reported during that period. The average sensitivity of CT was 90.8% in 11 studies during that period, and there was an average specificity of 94.2% in 10 studies. We also looked at data from 299 patients who underwent appendectomies at our hospital. Of the appendices removed, only 10.7% did not have appendicitis. In many cases, CT or US imaging data were available in the form of reports or images or both from outside institutions. CT and US images were also available from our institution when the diagnosis was in question. This is how patients present in the real world-with studies that might not be the best, might not have been indicated, and might not have images available for another interpretation. Among patients operated on with neither CT nor US images, 10.9% did not have appendicitis. Among those in whom US imaging had been performed, 11.1% were negative for appendicitis, and among those in whom CT had been performed, 9.7% were negative. Although these studies were necessary because they were performed in patients whose diagnosis was the most difficult, it is in every patient's best interest to have a thorough examination by a surgeon prior to having a CT scan.

### Imaging of right lower quadrant pain in children and adolescents: expert panel narrative review [^111n2Yma]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain is a common clinical presentation in children, and accurate clinical diagnosis remains challenging given that this nonspecific presentation is associated with numerous surgical and nonsurgical conditions. The broad differential diagnosis varies by patient age and sex. Important considerations in the selection of a diagnostic imaging strategy include the sequencing, performance, and cost of tests. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of the diagnostic imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents, including a discussion of the complementary roles of ultrasound, CT, and MRI; description of key imaging findings based on available evidence; and presentation of salient differential diagnoses. Subspecialized pediatric emergency medicine and surgical perspectives are also provided as further clinical insight into this common, but often challenging, scenario. Finally, the current status of imaging of RLQ pain in children and adolescents is summarized on the basis of expert consensus.

### A clinical prediction model for complicated appendicitis in children younger than five years of age [^112uMQhS]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design

The characteristics of subjects from derivation sample, including (1) demographic data: age, gender, body mass index (BMI); (2) symptoms and signs: duration of symptoms (DS), body temperature, right lower quadrant (RLQ) tenderness and rebound pain, migration of pain to RLQ, abdominal distention, nausea and (or) vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea; (3) intraoperative observation and postoperative pathological results, were extracted from inpatient medical records. The white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), percentage of neutrophils (PN), lymphocyte count (LYMPH), mononuclear cell count (MC), platelet count (PLT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) data tested on admission (within 2 h) in venous blood samples were collected. After the establishment of prediction model for complicated appendicitis, clinical data such as the age, DS, and WBC of validation sample were collected. Furthermore, we performed the ALVARADO score and PAS for patients in validation sample. For these symptoms and signs, "unsure", "don't know", and "missing" responses were coded as not having the sign or symptom. DS was defined as the period from the moment the patient first felt ill (any of fever, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation and diarrhea) until the time of admission, as reported by the family members of patients.

AA was divided into simple appendicitis and complicated appendicitis according to the following diagnostic code. Simple appendicitis is diagnosed on the basis of (1) intraoperative findings: inflamed appendix without signs of gangrene, perforation, purulent fluid, contained phlegmone or intra-abdominal abscess and (2) histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of appendicitis without necrosis or perforation. Complicated appendicitis is diagnosed on the basis of (1) intraoperative findings: signs of a gangrenous appendix with or without perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, appendicular contained phlegmone, or purulent free fluid and (2) histopathology confirming the diagnosis based on extensive necrotic tissue in the muscular layer of the appendix or signs of perforation. In case of discrepancies between clinical and pathological findings, the final result refers to the pathologist.

### Imaging right lower quadrant pain: not always appendicitis [^116G2i4R]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Although acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the commonest causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain (RLQP), there are numerous other conditions in the abdomen and pelvis that can simulate the clinical presentation of AA for which imaging is essential in detection. We discuss the approach to evaluation of patients presenting with acute onset RLQP and the choice of various imaging modalities that can be utilized. Although CT remains the workhorse in evaluation, US and MRI, given lack of radiation, play an important ancillary role, particularly in the pediatric and pregnant patients. We present a spectrum of conditions presenting with RLQP which we have classified systematically ranging from conditions affecting the bowel, mesentery/omentum/peritoneum, vasculature, urinary and reproductive systems to give the reader a checklist of conditions to consider when evaluating a case of RLQP.

### CT imaging findings of epiploic appendagitis: an unusual cause of abdominal pain [^112pgiSH]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of epiploic appendagitis is challenging due to the lack of pathognomonic clinical signs or laboratory markers. Clinical presentation may vary among patients. This condition is often an underestimated and overlooked mimicker, easily misdiagnosed with other causes of abdominal pain requiring urgent care or surgical evaluation in emergency department, particularly acute diverticulitis (left iliac pain) or acute appendicitis (right iliac pain). On physical examination, patients complain of focal non-migratory abdominal pain in the lower abdominal quadrants (left more commonly than right), not exacerbated by physical movement, without significant guarding or rigidity, and in the absence of a palpable mass. The pain is typically circumscribed and the patient may often point his finger on the place where the lesion is situated. Patients may also report postprandial fullness, swelling, vomiting, early satiety, diarrhea, and rarely mild fever. White blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels are within normal range in the majority of patients, while mild leukocytosis may occasionally be observed due to inflammatory response.

Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, self-limiting condition which spontaneously resolves within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Surgery is not indicated, since the treatment is conservative with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the patient's symptoms. The risk of recurrence is low and complications are even rarer. Some authors believed that surgical intervention with ligation and excision of the inflamed epiploic appendages was the only way to prevent recurrences and complications, such as adhesions and intussusception induced by inflammation. However, invasive intervention is usually avoided due to the potential complications present in all surgical procedures. In some cases, epiploic appendagitis has been reported as an unexpected finding in patients who underwent laparotomy for acute abdominal pain with clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis or acute diverticulitis. It can also be a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes of acute abdominal pain are disproved.

### Beyond appendicitis: common and uncommon gastrointestinal causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain at multidetector CT [^1169b6pf]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Right lower quadrant abdominal pain is one of the most common causes of a patient visit to the emergency department. Although appendicitis is the most common condition requiring surgery in patients with abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain can be indicative of a vast list of differential diagnoses and is thus a challenge for clinicians. Other causes of right lower quadrant pain beyond appendicitis include inflammatory and infectious conditions involving the ileocecal region; diverticulitis; malignancies; conditions affecting the epiploic appendages, omentum, and mesentery; and miscellaneous conditions. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the modality of choice for evaluation of patients with several acute traumatic and nontraumatic conditions causing right lower quadrant pain. Multidetector CT is an extremely useful noninvasive method for diagnosis and management of not only the most common causes such as appendicitis but also less common conditions.

### Right lower-quadrant pain-more than one diagnosis [^114GQDV4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

When a patient presents with right-lower-quadrant pain in the emergency room, the diagnosis of appendicitis must always be considered, but the differential diagnosis for this symptom includes many other etiologies. We describe a case of an 8-year-old girl with von Willebrand disease who presented with right-lower-quadrant pain and was found to have an appendiceal wall hematoma. During her evaluation, an ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, and the results were initially interpreted as an intussusception. Although ultrasound is a highly reliable way to diagnose appendicitis and intussusception, the case illustrates that the thickened abdominal wall that occurs in a mural hematoma can appear like the "target sign" that is usually associated with intussusception, and in certain clinical scenarios, alternative forms of imaging may be of value.

### 18F-FDG PET / CT scan can predate clinical presentation in acute appendicitis [^116r4Dqq]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis typically presenting with right lower quadrant pain. We describe the case of an asymptomatic 53-year-old man with stage 2A diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who underwent F-FDG PET/CT at the completion of chemotherapy. The scan showed complete lymphomatous disease remission. Incidentally, there was increased FDG uptake in a tubular structure adjacent to the cecum. Clinical examination was negative. Subsequently, the patient presented 6 days later with typical acute appendicitis symptoms. This case is interesting wherein increased FDG uptake in the appendix predated the appearance of clinical symptoms.

### A curious cause of appendicitis [^1157d4Wy]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A previously fit and well 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 48-hour history of colicky, central abdominal pain, one episode of loose stool, five episodes of vomiting and anorexia. He had not eaten out, travelled abroad or been around anyone else unwell over the preceding days, and there was no history of upper respiratory tract symptoms, rashes or fever. The boy had no significant medical or surgical history, and he did not take any regular medications. All vaccinations were up-to-date. He had no family history of note and was an only child. As he had a soft, non-tender abdomen, his symptoms were attributed to gastroenteritis. Inpatient treatment was not required as the boy appeared adequately hydrated with normal observations and was tolerating oral fluids. He was, therefore, discharged with the advice to stay well hydrated and to return if symptoms worsened. A stool sample had been requested, but the boy was unable to provide this in the ED. He reattended the following day with constant, right-sided, abdominal pain, and ongoing diarrhoea and vomiting. Examination revealed tenderness which had now localised to the right iliac fossa (RIF) and a temperature of 37.8°C.

### Zafirlukast [^111Tj3fp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hepatotoxicity:

Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with zafirlukast. Cases of liver injury without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of zafirlukast (40 mg/day). In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient's symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping zafirlukast. In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death. In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.

Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.

Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (e.g., right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur. Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.

### The appendicitis inflammatory response score: a tool for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis that outperforms the Alvarado score [^112hJEDP]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical diagnosis of appendicitis is a subjective synthesis of information from variables with ill-defined diagnostic value. This process could be improved by using a scoring system that includes objective variables that reflect the inflammatory response. This study describes the construction and evaluation of a new clinical appendicitis score.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively from 545 patients admitted for suspected appendicitis at four hospitals. The score was constructed from eight variables with independent diagnostic value (right-lower-quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, muscular defense, WBC count, proportion neutrophils, CRP, body temperature, and vomiting) in 316 randomly selected patients and evaluated on the remaining 229 patients. Ordered logistic regression was used to obtain a high discriminating power with focus on advanced appendicitis. Diagnostic performance was compared with the Alvarado score.

Results

The ROC area of the new score was 0.97 for advanced appendicitis and 0.93 for all appendicitis compared with 0.92 (p = 0.0027) and 0.88 (p = 0.0007), respectively, for the Alvarado score. Sixty-three percent of the patients were classified into the low- or high-probability group with an accuracy of 97.2%, leaving 37% for further investigation. Seventy-three percent of the nonappendicitis patients, 67% of the advanced appendicitis, and 37% of all appendicitis patients were correctly classified into the low- and high-probability zone, respectively.

Conclusion

This simple clinical score can correctly classify the majority of patients with suspected appendicitis, leaving the need for diagnostic imaging or diagnostic laparoscopy to the smaller group of patients with an indeterminate scoring result.

### Clinical diagnosis of primary epiploic appendagitis: differentiation from acute diverticulitis [^115BGCdS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Primary epiploic appendagitis (PEA) is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain that occurs either from appendageal torsion or spontaneous thrombosis of an appendageal draining vein. Primary epiploic appendagitis is frequently misdiagnosed as either appendicitis or diverticulitis, depending on its location.

Study

Clinical and radiologic characteristics of 8 patients with PEA were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 18 patients with acute diverticulitis.

Results

Patients with PEA presented with lower abdominal pain of recent onset that was localized to the left (seven cases) and right (one case) lower quadrants. Well-localized tenderness without peritoneal irritation sign was usually the only physical finding. Blood tests were not significant. In acute diverticulitis, the pain was more evenly distributed throughout the lower abdomen and findings like nausea, fever, and leukocytosis were more frequently associated than in PEA. Computed tomography findings, such as pedunculated oval fatty mass with streaky densities connected to the serosal surface of the adjacent colon, can lead to the diagnosis of PEA. Symptoms of PEA were resolved within 1 week (mean, 4.7 days) without surgery.

Conclusions

When patients with very localized lower abdominal pain and tenderness do not have associated symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, a high index of suspicion for PEA and early radiologic examinations are required.

Baseline demographic and laboratory characteristics of the study population

Among the 174 participants, the majority experienced generalized abdominal pain (66.7%, n = 116). Pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) was reported in 14.9% (n = 26), while periumbilical pain was observed in 10.3% (n = 18). Other less common pain locations included the left lower quadrant (LLQ) and hypogastric region, each reported in 2.9% (n = 5), and the epigastric region in 2.3% (n = 4). The most frequently reported associated symptom was nausea and vomiting, occurring in 40.2% of patients (n = 70), followed by fever in 26.4% (n = 46). Diarrhea and constipation were each observed in 10.3% of patients (n = 18). Additional symptoms included anorexia (8%, n = 14), tenderness (9.2%, n = 16), and abdominal distention (2.9%, n = 5). Less commonly, dysuria (1.1%, n = 2) and irritability (1.7%, n = 3) were reported. The duration of symptoms ranged widely, with a mean duration of 2.8 ± 2.3 days. These findings highlight the varied presentations of abdominal pain and associated clinical features in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (Table 2).

### Emergency general surgery in pregnancy [^1134gSKx]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis

A case of acute appendicitis during pregnancy was first reported in the literature by Hancock in 1848. It is the most common non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. It occurs in about 1 in 1000–2000 pregnancies and may occur at any time during the pregnancy. The diagnosis is more frequently missed in pregnant than in non-pregnant patients, because signs and symptoms of appendicitis, such as leukocytosis, nausea and vomiting, are also commonly seen during pregnancy. There is a question of reliability of the abdominal examination in pregnant patients suspected of having appendicitis. The classical teaching is that the location of pain from appendicitis moves progressively upward as the pregnancy progresses based on Baer's 1932 study of barium images of 78 pregnant patients. More recent retrospective studies have failed to corroborate this hypothesis showing roughly 90% of patients having pain in the right lower quadrant regardless of trimester. Maternal morbidity is usually the result of a delay in diagnosis. Fetal loss occurs in 3%–5% of pregnant patients without perforation but can be as high as 36% with perforation. This high risk of fetal loss with perforation along with the difficulty of diagnosing appendicitis in the pregnant patient explains the high rate (50% in many series) of normal appendices found at operation. Traditionally, this high rate of negative operation had not been found to increase maternal or fetal morbidity; however, recent data suggest that negative appendectomy may be associated with an increase in fetal loss. Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis before heading to the operating room. Ultrasound, CT, MRI or diagnostic laparoscopy can confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasound should be the first-line study for abdominal pain in the pregnant female; however, the sensitivity ranges from only 20% to 36%. If ultrasound is indeterminate, the next study that should be ordered if available is an MRI. A review of imaging strategies for right lower quadrant pain in pregnant females performed a meta-analysis of six studies examining the role of MRI in diagnosing appendicitis in pregnant females. They found a pooled sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 0.98. If MRI is unavailable, a CT may be ordered. While the diagnostic accuracy of CT for appendicitis in the non-obstetric population has been well demonstrated, there is a paucity of data for pregnant females. Two small studies looking specifically at pregnant patients demonstrated successful diagnoses of appendicitis in 5/7 patients and 12/13 patients. Protocols involving abdominal ultrasound followed by CT scan, if inconclusive, have been associated with a reduction of negative appendectomy rates. Our diagnostic algorithm for appendicitis is shown in figure 1. Appendectomy can be performed open or laparoscopicallydepending on the surgeon's comfort level with the patient's body habitus and degree of pregnancy. The laparoscopic approach has advanced to become the standard of care at many centers; this is the authors' preference as well.

Case presentation

A 53-year-old caucasian G1P1 otherwise healthy female patient was known for a long history of diffuse right and left colonic diverticular disease, with repeated episodes of abdominal pain due to recurrent diverticulitis.

She presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left-lower-quadrant abdominal pain, cramping and anorexia. Physical examination revealed a soft abdomen, with localized left lower quadrant sharp tenderness, guarding and moderate rebound on examination. Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed bowel wall thickening and contrast-enhancement along a 45 mm portion of the medium-to-distal sigmoid colon. A marked increase in soft tissue density was also observed within the pericolonic fat, with evidence of a 23 mm paramedian fluid collection in the pre-sacral area. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and antibiotic coverage was started together with analgesics. Symptoms resolved quickly, she was discharged home a week later with a diagnosis of self-limited diverticular microperforation, and an outpatient follow-up was scheduled for elective surgical planning.

### A diagnostic challenge: primary omental torsion and literature review-a case report [^113H2D8C]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Patient with omental torsion present with constant, non-radiating pain of increasing severity, nausea and vomiting. Clinically 50% of patients have a low grade fever and leukocytosis. These findings are non specific, making pre-operative diagnosis of omental torsion a challenge. The majority of cases present with a single episode of abdominal pain but recurrent pain may suggest intermittent torsions. On examination 50% of patients present with an abdominal mass and localised peritonitis. Common differential diagnosis include appendicitis, cholecystitis or twisted ovarian cyst. In general patients with omental torsion are less systemically unwell compared to acute appendicitis and the disease process extends over a longer period of time.

On laboratory findings a moderate leukocytosis is present in 50% of cases. Imaging investigations such as Ultrasonography and Computed Tomography (CT) have been suggested in the literature. On Sonography a complex mass consisting of hypoechoic and solid zones may be identified, but this imaging technique is operator dependent with limited sensitivity due to overlying bowel gas. On CT, omental torsion is characterised by diffuse streaking in a whirling pattern of fibrous and fatty folds. With increased use of CT, pre-operative diagnosis of omental torsion may increase in frequency of preoperative diagnosis and lead to conservative management in patients without complications.

The current investigation tool and therapeutic management of choice is laparoscopy proceeding to laparotomy, identifying and removing the infarcted section of omentum. Normal appendix, gallbladder and pelvic cavity make the diagnosis of omental torsion likely. Free serosanguineous fluid as a result of haemorrhagic extravasion is a characteristic finding in the peritoneal cavity. In the literature the treatment of choice included additional appendicectomy to prevent future diagnostic problems. Successful conservative management has also been reported.

Histology findings of haemorrhagic infarction and fat necrosis confirm the diagnosis with the presence of fibrosis indicative of a longer disease process.

The prognosis for primary omental torsion is good with fast post operative recovery and minimal morbidity. The natural disease progress if left untreated will result in fibrosis, necrosis and occasional autoamputation and clinical improvement. Prognosis in secondary torsion depends in the underlying pathology.

Left sided omental torsion may be commonly misdiagnosed as diverticulutis and managed conservatively, resulting in less common diagnosis.

### Developing and validating of ramathibodi appendicitis score (RAMA-AS) for diagnosis of appendicitis in suspected appendicitis patients [^113FdHpd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

The design was a cross-sectional study consisting of derivation and validation phases. Derived data were collected at Ramathibodi Hospital (RH), whereas validated data were collected at Thammasat University Hospital (TH) and Chaiyaphum Hospital (CH) from January 2013 to May 2015. The RH and TH are the Schools of Medicine, whereas CH is a provincial hospital.

The study was conducted and reported according to Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) and STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Consecutive suspected appendicitis patients presenting with abdominal pain were included with following criteria: aged 15–60 years, right side abdominal pain within 7 days, had at least one of the following symptoms (i.e. right lower abdominal pain, migration of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting) and signs (i.e. raised body temperature, right lower quadrant tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, and decreased bowel sound), and willing to participate and gave consent. Exclusion criteria were patients who could not give the history of illness, had myocardial infarction or terminal illness, abdominal mass, tumor or malignancy of appendix.

Outcome and predictors

The interested outcome was acute appendicitis by histopathological diagnosis for operative patients. For those patients with conservative management, telephone was made to confirm the final diagnosis 6 weeks after visiting.

Sample size

As for our literature review, a total of 8–10 variables were potentially included in the final risk prediction score. A simulation study indicated that a number of events per variable of at least 10 to 30 yielded less bias in coefficient estimation of logistic regression, which was known as a rule of thumb as per recommendation. Using a rule of thumb of at least 20 appendicitis patients per variable required 200 appendicitis patients for 10 variables. The prevalence of appendicitis in our setting was 62% from our pilot study. As a result, 355 patients were needed. Taking into account for missing data of 20%, at least 388 patients were finally required. In addition, an additional 100 subjects (i.e. about 30% of derived subjects) were enrolled from each of the external sites for external validation.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: rare presentation of an old disease [^113zWCJZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Case report

A 55-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a 48-h history of pain in the lower left hemithorax with pleuritic characteristics. Two days before she experienced vomiting and diarrhea. At arrival, she complained of moderate pain in the left lower hemithorax. The pain was characterized as dull, constant, radiating to the left upper abdominal quadrant, aggravated by body posture changes without any alleviating factors, and accompanied by nausea and low-grade fever. Her medical history was unremarkable except for previous appendectomy. The patient did not take any medications, and she was not a smoker or an alcohol consumer. She looked ill with a blood pressure of 123/88 mmHg, a pulse rate of 84 beats/min and a temperature of 38.5°C. A thorough physical examination revealed hypoventilation in the left lower base without other relevant findings. The laboratory examination was unremarkable except for poly-morphonuclear leukocytosis (total leukocyte count, 18000/mL; neutrophils, 86%) and an elevated C-reactive protein (86 mg/dL; reference range, 0–5). An upright chest radiograph demonstrated elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and free gas under the diaphragm (Fig. 1).

General medical — abdominal pain assessment for suspected appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, and pyelonephritis lists condition-specific findings. Appendicitis findings include focal right lower quadrant tenderness possibly with rebound and guarding, right lower quadrant tenderness noted during palpation of the left lower quadrant (positive Rovsing's sign), peri-umbilical or diffuse abdominal tenderness with palpation of the abdomen/pelvis, fever, nausea/vomiting, and lack of appetite. Acute cholecystitis findings include right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness, fever, nausea and vomiting, and history of gallstones. Pyelonephritis findings include fever, nausea/vomiting, urinary frequency/urgency, dysuria, hematuria, back/flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion.

### Acute appendicitis: efficient diagnosis and management [^111NC37S]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in adults and children, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in males and 6.7% in females. It is the most common nonobstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Findings from the history, physical examination, and laboratory studies aid in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Right lower quadrant pain, abdominal rigidity, and periumbilical pain radiating to the right lower quadrant are the best signs for ruling in acute appendicitis in adults. Absent or decreased bowel sounds, a positive psoas sign, a positive obturator sign, and a positive Rovsing sign are most reliable for ruling in acute appendicitis in children. The Alvarado score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score, and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response score incorporate common clinical and laboratory findings to stratify patients as low, moderate, or high risk and can help in making a timely diagnosis. Recommended first-line imaging consists of point-of-care or formal ultrasonography. Appendectomy via open laparotomy or laparoscopy is the standard treatment for acute appendicitis. However, intravenous antibiotics may be considered first-line therapy in selected patients. Pain control with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen should be a priority and does not result in delayed or unnecessary intervention. Perforation can lead to sepsis and occurs in 17% to 32% of patients with acute appendicitis. Prolonged duration of symptoms before surgical intervention raises the risk. In moderate- to high-risk patients, surgical consultation should be accomplished quickly to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from perforation.

### Case report: COVID-19 masquerading as an acute surgical abdomen [^112qnQnH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

The first case was a 40-year-old woman who presented with a 2-day history of a vague right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain that was severe on the day of admission. On further inquiry, she reported fever, nausea, and vomiting but no diarrhea. Examination revealed RLQ abdominal tenderness, however, with no guarding or rigidity. Laboratory workup was unremarkable, except for a mild elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 1). Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed no evidence of appendicitis but bilateral basal lung consolidations (Figure 1). Thus, COVID-19 suspicion arose and was confirmed subsequently with nasopharyngeal swab testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Consequent to this, a surgical evaluation was not sought further. The patient was treated as COVID-19 pneumonia (hydroxychloroquine, darunavir/cobicistat, and azithromycin). The abdominal symptoms improved on day 10 of the admission. She remained in good health after completing her treatment course until she was discharged 31 days after the first positive COVID-19 PCR. The COVID-19 local management protocol at the time mandated the negativity of two consecutive COVID-19 PCR tests before discharging the patients; this caused the prolonged hospital stay.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116PVW9q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Clinician

Left upper quadrant pain commonly results from gastritis, colitis (splenic flexure), pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, splenic enlargement or infarction, or left lower lobe pneumonia. Intermittent headaches frequently accompany systemic illness, so the challenge is determining if the associated fever signals an intracranial infectious process such as meningitis, encephalitis or brain abscess. The severity and duration of headache, lack of previous headache history, presence of meningeal signs and neurological deficits are common indications for imaging the central nervous system and analyzing the CSF.

### Diagnostic accuracy of laboratory and ultrasound findings in patients with a non-visualized appendix [^117CtoGR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound (US) and laboratory testing are initial diagnostic tests for acute appendicitis. A diagnostic dilemma develops when the appendix is not visualized on US. Objective: To determine if specific US findings and/or laboratory results predict acute appendicitis when the appendix is not visualized. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on children (birth-18 yrs) presenting to the pediatric emergency department with suspected acute appendicitis who underwent right lower quadrant US. Children with previous appendectomy, US at another facility, or eloped were excluded. US findings analyzed: inflammatory changes, right lower quadrant and lower abdominal fluid, tenderness during US exam and lymph nodes. Diagnoses were confirmed via surgical pathology. Results 1252 subjects were enrolled, 60.8% (762) had appendix visualized and 39.1% (490) did not. In children where the appendix was not seen, 6.7% [33] were diagnosed with appendicitis. Among patients with a non-visualized appendix, the likelihood of appendicitis was significantly greater if: inflammatory changes in the RLQ (OR 18.0, 95% CI 4.5–72.1), CRP > 0.5 mg/dL (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.0–6.8), or WBC > 10 (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.66–11.58). Duration of abdominal pain > 3 days was significantly less likely associated with appendicitis in this model (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.003–0.395). Combined, the absence inflammatory changes, CRP < 0.5 mg/dL, WBC < 10, and pain, ≤ 3 days had a NPV of 94.0%. Conclusion When the appendix is not visualized on US, predictors for appendicitis include the presence of inflammatory changes in the RLQ, an elevated WBC/CRP and abdominal pain < 3 days.

Diagnostics — targeted testing under specified circumstances: Stool testing should be performed under clearly identified circumstances (Table 2) for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile, and STEC in symptomatic hosts (strong, low). Specifically, test for Yersinia enterocolitica in people with persistent abdominal pain (especially school-aged children with right lower quadrant pain mimicking appendicitis who may have mesenteric adenitis), and in people with fever at epidemiologic risk for yersiniosis including infants with direct or indirect exposures to raw or undercooked pork products. In addition, test stool specimens for Vibrio species in people with large volume rice water stools or either exposure to salty or brackish waters, consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or travel to cholera-endemic regions within 3 days prior to onset of diarrhea.

### Acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain… [^115PFAik]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A previously healthy 4-year-old girl with a history of prematurity presented as a transfer from an outside facility with abdominal pain. She had presented to an outside emergency department 2 days prior with lower abdominal pain that subsequently localized to the right lower quadrant. Her pain was accompanied by anorexia and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. She denied fevers or chills. She was noted to have voluntary guarding and focal right lower quadrant tenderness to palpation. Laboratory analyses demonstrated a mild leukocytosis and normal urinalysis results. Abdominal ultrasonography images were obtained that failed to show her appendix and demonstrated no secondary signs of inflammation. Because of her notable tenderness, she was admitted for observation at the referring facility. No antibiotics were initiated, and her activity improved with intravenous hydration.

However, her right lower abdominal pain persisted, prompting further evaluation. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained, and the representative images are shown in Figure 1. She was transferred to our facility for surgical evaluation. In our emergency department, pelvic ultrasonography images were obtained that failed to show both the appendix and right adnexal structures. Rellinger EJ, Speck KE.
