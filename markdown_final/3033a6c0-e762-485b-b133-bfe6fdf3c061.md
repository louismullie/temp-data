## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to classify a 74-year-old man with a non-IgM monoclonal protein of 12 g/L, 4% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency, and negative whole-body imaging, and to choose the most appropriate diagnosis among MGUS, smoldering myeloma, symptomatic myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the quantitative thresholds for MGUS versus SMM. Then, I should verify whether any myeloma-defining events (CRAB or SLiM) are present. Next, I will check imaging adequacy and whether any bone disease was missed. After that, I should confirm that the M-protein is non-IgM and that this excludes WM. Finally, I will integrate the competing anemia etiologies and reconcile the apparent conflict between M-protein and plasma cell burden before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic cutoffs, because I need to ensure I am applying the right criteria. MGUS is defined by M-protein < 30 g/L, clonal bone marrow plasma cells < 10%, and absence of end-organ damage, whereas SMM requires M-protein ≥ 30 g/L and/or clonal plasma cells 10–59% with no CRAB or SLiM features, and symptomatic MM requires either clonal plasma cells ≥ 10% with any CRAB feature or any SLiM biomarker, even without CRAB [^111HFvEG] [^111NSLNf] [^114RUPwy] [^116dHGpf].

> Wait, let me verify the specific numbers for this patient. The M-protein is 12 g/L, which is 1.2 g/dL, so it is below the 3 g/dL (30 g/L) threshold used to separate MGUS from SMM, and the marrow shows 4% clonal plasma cells, which is below the 10% threshold required for SMM or MM, so strictly by quantitative criteria this looks like MGUS, not SMM or active MM [^116dHGpf] [^111NSLNf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for any myeloma-defining events that would trump the quantitative thresholds. CRAB features are absent: calcium is normal, creatinine is normal, hemoglobin is 10 g/dL but in a man this does not meet the IMWG anemia criterion of < 10 g/dL or more than 2 g/dL below normal, and there are no bone lesions on MRI, so no CRAB is present [^116dHGpf] [^113VgLhv]. I also need to check SLiM biomarkers: marrow plasma cells are not ≥ 60%, we do not have a free light chain ratio provided, and MRI shows no focal lesions, so none of the SLiM biomarkers are fulfilled, which means there is no biomarker-defined MM either [^114RUPwy] [^113VgLhv].

> I will now examine the imaging adequacy, because I should confirm we did not miss occult disease. Whole-body MRI with no pathologic findings is a sensitive modality for marrow infiltration and focal lesions, and when combined with the absence of lytic lesions, it supports the absence of myeloma bone disease; although low-dose whole-body CT or FDG-PET/CT are often preferred as first-line bone surveys in contemporary practice, a negative whole-body MRI still substantially lowers the likelihood of missed myeloma-related bone disease in this context [^116xi3iA] [^1129kbsu].

> Next, I should review whether the M-protein phenotype fits the differential. The M-protein is non-IgM, which makes Waldenström macroglobulinemia unlikely, since WM is an IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Thus, WM is not the correct diagnosis here [^116gQx49].

> But wait, what if the anemia is actually myeloma-related rather than iron deficiency; I need to ensure we are not attributing causality incorrectly. The iron studies show ferritin 5 μg/L with low transferrin saturation, a classic iron deficiency pattern, and the microcytosis fits, so the anemia is adequately explained by iron deficiency rather than myeloma, which aligns with the absence of CRAB features and supports MGUS rather than SMM or MM in this case [^111whJmb] [^115HMvHZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if the presence of any monoclonal protein with anemia might imply SMM, but that would be a mistake. I should correct that thought. SMM requires either M-protein ≥ 30 g/L or clonal plasma cells ≥ 10% plus no CRAB/SLiM, and neither threshold is met here, so this remains MGUS despite the coexistence of anemia that is attributable to iron deficiency rather than the plasma cell disorder [^116dHGpf] [^111NSLNf].

> Let me reconsider the final classification to ensure internal consistency. The patient has non-IgM MGUS with 4% clonal marrow plasma cells and M-protein 12 g/L, no CRAB features, and no SLiM biomarkers, and the anemia is due to iron deficiency, so the most appropriate additional diagnosis is MGUS, with continued surveillance per risk-adapted follow-up strategies [^111LKe6K] [^116Tg2pk].

> Final answer: A. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^111NSLNf] [^116dHGpf].

The most appropriate diagnosis is **monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)** [^111LKe6K]. The patient has a non-IgM monoclonal protein of 12 g/L and 4% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, with no CRAB features or SLiM biomarkers, and normal skeletal imaging [^116dHGpf] [^113VgLhv]. This profile meets MGUS criteria and excludes smoldering myeloma, symptomatic myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia [^111NSLNf] [^116gQx49].

## Diagnostic criteria for MGUS, SMM, and symptomatic multiple myeloma

According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the diagnostic criteria for MGUS, SMM, and symptomatic multiple myeloma are as follows:

| **Diagnosis** | **Monoclonal protein (m-protein)** | **Bone marrow plasma cells (bmpcs)** | **Crab features** | **Slim biomarkers** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| MGUS | < 3 g/dL | < 10% | Absent | Absent |
| SMM | ≥ 3 g/dL or ≥ 10% BMPCs | ≥ 10% | Absent | Absent |
| Symptomatic MM | ≥ 3 g/dL or ≥ 10% BMPCs | ≥ 10% | Present | Present |

---

Additionally, **Waldenström macroglobulinemia** is characterized by an IgM monoclonal protein and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, which is not present in this patient [^116gQx49].

---

## Analysis of the patient's laboratory and clinical findings

- **Monoclonal protein**: 12 g/L (1.2 g/dL), which is less than the 3 g/dL threshold for MGUS.
- **Bone marrow plasma cells**: 4%, which is less than the 10% threshold for MGUS.
- **CRAB features**: Absent (normal calcium, normal renal function, hemoglobin 10 g/dL which is not below the 10 g/dL threshold, and no bone lesions on skeletal survey and MRI).
- **SLiM biomarkers**: Absent (BMPCs < 60%, no focal lesions on MRI, and no information provided regarding free light chain ratio).

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **MGUS**: Meets all criteria (M-protein < 3 g/dL, BMPCs < 10%, no CRAB features, no SLiM biomarkers).
- **SMM**: Does not meet criteria (BMPCs < 10% and M-protein < 3 g/dL).
- **Symptomatic MM**: Does not meet criteria (no CRAB features or SLiM biomarkers).
- **Waldenström macroglobulinemia**: Does not meet criteria (non-IgM monoclonal protein and no lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma).

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient meets all criteria for **MGUS** [^111LKe6K]. MGUS is a premalignant condition with a low annual risk of progression to multiple myeloma or related disorders (approximately 1% per year) [^111r8DPV]. Regular monitoring of the M-protein level, complete blood count, renal function, and calcium is recommended, along with periodic clinical assessments for new symptoms or signs of progression [^notfound].

---

The most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is **monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)** [^111NSLNf].

### Criteria for the classification of monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma and related disorders: a report of the international myeloma working group [^111NSLNf]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

The monoclonal gammopathies are a group of disorders associated with monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells. The characterization of specific entities is an area of difficulty in clinical practice. The International Myeloma Working Group has reviewed the criteria for diagnosis and classification with the aim of producing simple, easily used definitions based on routinely available investigations. In monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or monoclonal gammopathy, unattributed/unassociated (MG[u]), the monoclonal protein is < 30 g/l and the bone marrow clonal cells < 10% with no evidence of multiple myeloma, other B-cell proliferative disorders or amyloidosis. In asymptomatic (smouldering) myeloma the M-protein is ≥ 30 g/l and/or bone marrow clonal cells ≥ 10% but no related organ or tissue impairment (ROTI)(end-organ damage), which is typically manifested by increased calcium, renal insufficiency, anaemia, or bone lesions (CRAB) attributed to the plasma cell proliferative process. Symptomatic myeloma requires evidence of ROTI. Non-secretory myeloma is characterized by the absence of an M-protein in the serum and urine, bone marrow plasmacytosis and ROTI. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone, extramedullary plasmacytoma and multiple solitary plasmacytomas (± recurrent) are also defined as distinct entities. The use of these criteria will facilitate comparison of therapeutic trial data. Evaluation of currently available prognostic factors may allow better definition of prognosis in multiple myeloma.

Key Points

- Ferritin is the best test for predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders. Other blood tests do not add value.
- Low ferritin indicates iron deficiency. However, ferritin or other blood tests rarely rule out iron deficiency.

Conclusion of the report

A clear summary statement should highlight the most important findings regarding overall disease status. It should include number and distribution of osteolyses, presence/absence of extraosseous soft tissue masses, likelihood of cord/nerve root compression, number of focal medullary deposits in the appendicular skeleton, presence/absence of diffuse medullary disease in the appendicular skeleton and a comment on vertebral compression fractures and/or vertebral fracture risk. Regarding osteolyses, since there are no validated data yet on the prognostic significance of the number of lytic lesions detected by WBLDCT, an exact number should be given for up to 10 lesions only. Appropriate recommendations regarding short-term follow up or alternative imaging studies should be also made in the case of equivocal findings. Lastly, any incidental finding that raises concern should be mentioned, along with the appropriate recommendation.

Differential diagnosis

A diagnosis of IgG lambda pPCL, Revised-International Staging System (stage 3) was made. The Durie–Salmon Staging System for this patient was stage II (haemoglobin concentration < 8.5 g/dL, serum calcium < 3 mmol/L, renal impairment present, IgG component protein < 70 g/L, urine lambda light chain < 4 g/24 hours and skeletal survey demonstrated no bony lesions).

The diagnosis of pPCL was based on bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetic studies, serum and urine protein electrophoresis. The differential diagnoses need to be considered are amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, marginal zone lymphoma and reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis. Amyloidosis is often diagnosed on a positive Congo-red stain biopsy sample taken from the subcutaneous abdominal fat or involved organ system. In this case, the Congo-red stain of the bone marrow trephine biopsy was negative for amyloid deposition. Multiple myeloma without transformation to sPCL would not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of 20% or more clonal plasma cells on the peripheral blood film. Reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis is usually associated with infection or autoimmune disorders. Absence of kappa or lambda light-chain restriction excludes reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis. In this case, they were no clinical features of underlying infection or autoimmune disorders. Other forms of leukaemia and lymphoma are distinguished from pPCL by bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry, trephine immunohistochemistry and lymph node biopsy.

### The role of bone marrow biopsy in patients with plasma cell disorders: should all patients with a monoclonal protein be biopsied? [^115r5xW9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Assessment of the BM plays a key role in differentiating patients presenting with MGUS from SMM and MM and for prognostication in all groups –. The clinical presentations of patients with SMM and MM are variable, with clinical and laboratory signs guiding physicians on the need for more invasive investigation with BM or advanced imaging. However, the prevalence of MGUS increases with age, seen in 8.7% of patients above the age of 80. At presentation, nearly three-quarters of MGUS patients are low-risk or low-intermediate risk, and with increasingly sensitive techniques for screening for MGUS, that proportion will increase. It was our hypothesis (and a part of consensus guidelines) that performing a BM and advanced imaging in all patients is unnecessary.

We demonstrate that only 0.3% of patients with MM present without myeloma defining events other than excessive BM plasmacytosis. The vast majority (98.7%) of MM patients presented with some objective abnormality in CRAB features or with a markedly elevated ratio of involved-to-uninvolved FLC. More often, CRAB type abnormalities are the initial triggers for physicians to identify a monoclonal protein. Among such patients a BM with genetic risk assessment is mandatory to prognosticate the MM.

### Recommendations for acquisition, interpretation and reporting of whole body low dose CT in patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders: a report of the IMWG bone working group [^115NH4xy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

WBLDCT has important advantages as a first-line imaging modality for the assessment of bone disease in patients with plasma cell neoplasms. It has been proven to be more sensitive than the conventional skeletal survey for the detection of osteolyses, and lytic lesions detected by WBLDCT justify initiation of treatment in patients with otherwise asymptomatic disease. Selection of optimal imaging parameters and proper patient positioning are mandatory, to ensure the acquisition of images of diagnostic quality, while maintaining a low effective radiation dose delivered to the patient. A systematic approach to the interpretation of myeloma-related bone disease, including osteolyses, peripheral intramedullary lesions and fractures is advised and potential pitfalls should be acknowledged. Structured reporting facilitates reading and communication of findings, and should include a clear conclusion as well as appropriate recommendations for further workup, where indicated.

### How I manage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^112zY9TQ]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is, in many ways, a unique hematologic entity. Unlike most hematologic conditions in which the diagnosis is intentional and credited to hematologists, the discovery of MGUS is most often incidental and made by nonhematologists. MGUS is considered an obligate precursor to several lymphoplasmacytic malignancies, including immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Therefore, long-term follow-up is generally recommended. Despite its high prevalence, there is surprisingly limited evidence to inform best clinical practice both at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. We present 7 vignettes to illustrate common clinical management questions that arise during the course of MGUS. Where evidence is present, we provide a concise summary of the literature and clear recommendations on management. Where evidence is lacking, we describe how we practice and provide a rationale for our approach. We also discuss the potential harms associated with MGUS diagnosis, a topic that is rarely, if ever, broached between patients and providers, or even considered in academic debate.

Multiple myeloma — solitary plasmacytoma is described as a biopsy-proven solitary lesion of bone or soft tissue with evidence of clonal plasma cells, normal skeletal survey and MRI (or CT) of spine and pelvis (except for the primary solitary lesion), absence of myeloma defining events, and normal bone marrow with no evidence of clonal plasma cells. Solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement has the same lesion, imaging, and absence of myeloma defining events, with clonal bone marrow plasma cells < 10%.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^111d8KLL]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines (orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology and oncology) before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely. These tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients. Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcome. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^111r8DPV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell dyscrasia that consistently precedes multiple myeloma (MM) with a 1% risk of progression per year. Recent advances have improved understanding of the complex genetic and immunologic factors that permit progression from the aberrant plasma cell clone to MGUS and overt MM. Additional evidence supports bidirectional interaction of MGUS cells with surrounding cells in the bone marrow niche that regulates malignant transformation. However, there are no robust prognostic biomarkers. Herein we review the current body of literature on the biology of MGUS and provide a rationale for the improved identification of high-risk MGUS patients who may be appropriate for novel clinical interventions to prevent progression or eradicate premalignant clones prior to the development of overt MM.

POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes) diagnostic criteria — The diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is confirmed when both of the mandatory major criteria, one of the other three major criteria, and one of the six minor criteria are present. Mandatory major criteria are polyneuropathy (typical demyelinating) and monoclonal plasma cell-proliferative disorder (almost always λ). Other major criteria (one required) include Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, and vascular endothelial growth factor elevation. Minor criteria include organomegaly (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy); extravascular volume overload (edema, pleural effusion, or ascites); endocrinopathy (adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid, pancreatic); skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, glomeruloid hemangiomata, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing, white nails); papilledema; and thrombocytosis/polycythemia. Other signs and symptoms include clubbing, weight loss, hyperhidrosis, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, thrombotic diatheses, diarrhea, and low vitamin B12 levels. There is a Castleman disease variant of POEMS that occurs without evidence of a clonal plasma cell disorder that is not accounted for in this table and this entity should be considered separately. Because of the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus and thyroid abnormalities, this diagnosis alone is not sufficient to meet this minor criterion, and approximately 50% of patients will have bone marrow changes that distinguish it from a typical MGUS or myeloma bone marrow; anemia and/or thrombocytopenia are distinctively unusual in this syndrome unless Castleman disease is present.

### The role of low dose whole body CT in the detection of progression of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma [^114nR8f4]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy and it is characterized by bone marrow infiltration of monoclonal plasma cells and end-organ involvement. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder, characterized by the absence of symptoms and organ involvement and limited plasma cell infiltration. MGUS usually precedes MM evolution. The progression rate of MGUS to MM is ~1% per year. Smoldering MM (SMM) is an intermediate clinical entity between MGUS and MM, with a risk of progression to symptomatic disease at 10% per year. The diagnosis of MM is based on the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, which include: bone marrow plasma cell infiltration ≥ 10% and at least one CRAB feature (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions), or ≥ 60% monoclonal plasma cell infiltration on bone marrow biopsy, serum involved to uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥ 100 or more than one > 5 mm focal lesion at magnetic resonance imaging or a biopsy-proven bone or extramedullary plasmacytoma.

Introduction

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies is based on clinical, biological and radiological criteria but remains challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients. The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100 or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Both the SLIM biomarker and CRAB criteria are listed in Figure 1. Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and current care of patients'.

Figure 1.
The differential diagnosis between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma and multiple myeloma. The discrimination between these monoclonal gammopathies is based on: (i) the plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow, (ii) the presence of clinical symptoms related to myeloma disease and (iii) the existence of biomarkers of disease that allow initiation of treatment. MGUS: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance; SMM: smoldering multiple myeloma; MM: multiple myeloma; BM: bone marrow; PC: plasma cells; FLC: free light chain; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging.

Investigations

The haemogram portrayed normochromic normocytic anaemia of 6.8 g/dL, leucocytosis of 15.2×10⁹/L and thrombocytopenia of 31×10⁹/L. His creatinine clearance (Cockcroft–Gault equation) was 56 mL/min. The other laboratory parameters are as tabulated in table 1.

Table 1
Tabulation of laboratory parameters

The peripheral blood film (figure 1A) at diagnosis showed rouleax formation with 45% of circulating plasma cells. The peripheral blood smear immunophenotyping by flow cytometric analysis revealed 49% cluster of neoplastic plasma cells expressing CD20, CD38, CD138 and cLambda. The bone marrow aspiration (figure 1B) portrayed 90% of neoplastic plasma cells. The plasma cells were described as multinucleated, containing basophilic cytoplasm and indiscernible nucleoli. Bone marrow for flow cytometry showed 44% cluster of cells expressing positivity for CD20, CD38, CD138 and cLambda. The cells lacked CD56 and cKappa positivity. Fluorescent in-situ hybridisation cytogenetics revealed t(4:14) and TP53 deletion. The bone marrow trephine biopsy showed infiltration by sheets of plasma cells staining positive for CD20, CD38, CD138 and demonstrating severe lambda light-chain restriction. Congo red stain of the bone marrow trephine biopsy was negative for amyloid deposition. Serum protein electrophoresis (figure 2A, B) and immunofixation (figure 3) revealed IgG lambda paraproteinaemia of 48 g/L in the gamma region with severe immunoparesis. The serum-free light-chain ratio (lambda–kappa ratio was elevated at 1800; lambda of 450 mg/dL, kappa of 0.25 mg/dL). The 24 hours urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation studies showed monoclonal free lambda light chain of 185 mg. Skeletal survey did not demonstrate any lucencies or lytic bone lesions. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging showed hypermetabolic activity in the thoracic and lumbar spine with visible pelvic lesions.

### Does my patient with a serum monoclonal spike have multiple myeloma? [^117BdLZc]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

A monoclonal spike on serum protein electrophoresis is a frequent finding in the general population and pathognomonic of a plasma cell dyscrasia. In otherwise healthy individuals, it is diagnostic of two asymptomatic, premalignant conditions called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) which carry a lifelong risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) or related malignancy. This article discusses the criteria for diagnosis of MGUS, SMM, and MM; current recommendations for follow-up and risk factors for progression to MM of patients with MGUS and SMM; and diagnostic evaluation of suspected MM transformation.

Assessing the strength of recommendations — development of recommendations required that the panel review identified evidence and make key judgments, including determining significant findings for each key question or outcome and determining any regulatory requirements and/or evidence that support a specific action. The overall strength of evidence for each key question or outcome is graded as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low, and the strength of recommendations is designated as Strong or Conditional. According to the GRADE approach, the strength of a recommendation demonstrates the extent to which an EP is confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh undesirable effects, with strong recommendations indicating high confidence that desirable effects outweigh undesirable effects, and conditional recommendations reflecting more central or dispersed judgments indicating lower confidence.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a consensus statement [^113bp3f8]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

On February 25, 2009, a panel of international experts on plasma cell dyscrasia and skeletal disease met to discuss monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). This non-malignant B-cell disorder is the most common plasma cell dyscrasia and is associated with an increased risk of developing serious B-cell disorders. Individuals with MGUS also have an increased risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia associated with an increased likelihood of developing fractures especially in the vertebral column, peripheral neuropathy and thromboembolic events. The goal of the meeting was to develop a consensus statement regarding the appropriate tests to screen, evaluate and follow-up patients with MGUS. The panel also addressed the identification and treatment of MGUS-related skeletal problems, thromboembolic events and neurological complications. The following consensus statement outlines the conclusions and marks the first time that a consensus statement for the screening and treatment of MGUS has been clearly stated.

A 55-year-old man without prior medical problems presented to the emergency room with a 2-month history of progressive fatigue. Initial workup showed a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL and an increased total protein level of 12.6 g/dL. Further testing revealed a normal serum calcium and creatinine, an IgG kappa paraprotein of 5.4 g/dL, and a Bence Jones proteinuria of 450 mg of kappa light chain in 24 hours. The bone marrow showed 60% plasma cells with normal cytogenetics and t(4;14), but no other associated genetic abnormalities by FISH. Skeletal survey and MRI of the spine were negative for myeloma bone disease. The patient's oncologist recently began therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and recommended the initiation of zoledronic acid monthly. The patient questions the benefit of this drug because he has no bone disease.

### Approach to the treatment of the older, unfit patient with myeloma from diagnosis to relapse: perspectives of a US hematologist and a geriatric hematologist [^116U16B6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Mrs. A. is a 73-year-old woman who has developed increasing fatigue and lower back pain over the past year. The pain limits her exercise tolerance such that she can now walk only 1 block. She is a retired schoolteacher who does volunteer efforts in her community but has limited her activities due to fatigue. Karnofsky performance status is 70%. She has a history of chronic hypertension treated with a diuretic, adult-onset diabetes mellitus treated with metformin, and hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine. Initial evaluation reveals anemia, renal dysfunction, an elevated total protein, and an L2 compression fracture on lumbosacral radiographs. Results of initial and subsequent evaluation are shown below, and she is referred to a hematologist for further evaluation, which revealed the following: calcium 9.0 mg/dL, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL with estimated creatinine clearance using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation of 15 mL/min, hemoglobin 9.6 g/dL, total protein 11 g/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL, immunoglobulin A (IgA) λ M protein 6.8 g/dL, total IgA 7.2 g/dL, IgG 0.4g/dL, IgM 0.03 g/dL, free κ < 0.01 mg/L, free λ 1000 mg/L, serum free light chain ratio < 0.01, β-2-microglobulin 4.2, viscosity 3.0, lactate dehydrogenase 200 U/L, urine protein electrophoresis: 125 mg/dL with 30% M protein, and urine immunofixation: λ light chain. Skeletal bone survey showed lytic lesions in femurs and humeri and diffusely in ribs bilaterally as well as compression fractures at T4, T6, and L2. Bone marrow biopsy revealed λ-restricted plasma cells comprising 50% of the bone marrow core. Fluorescence in situ hybridization testing on marrow showed that del 17p was present in 80% of the plasma cells. Mrs. A. is informed of the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and the need for therapy. She requests consultation with 2 of the leading world experts. However, she wants to be treated near her home and does not want treatment on a clinical trial.

### State-of-the-art imaging and staging of plasma cell dyscrasias [^116gQx49]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) is a clinically asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell or lymphoplasmacytic proliferative disorder. Smoldering multiple myeloma, also called asymptomatic multiple myeloma, is an intermediate stage between MGUS and symptomatic multiple myeloma. As the name implies, extraosseous or extramedullary myeloma refers to the presence of myeloma deposits outside the skeletal system. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a distinct subtype of plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in the bone marrow with an associated IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by extracellular deposition of fibrils composed of a variety of normal serum proteins.

a Myeloma-like: serum M-protein of ≥ 3 g/dL or urinary M-protein ≥ 500 mg per 24 h.

b MGUS-like: serum M-protein of < 3 g/dL and urinary M-protein < 500 mg per 24 h.

Had no BM been performed, these MGUS-like SMM would have been incorrectly called MGUS, with 97 of them being classified as low- or low-intermediate-risk MGUS and 151 Intermediate- or high-risk MGUS; 66 had missing information precluding classification. Amongst patients with data available of MGUS risk classification 64% (158/248) had an abnormality in hemoglobin, calcium, renal function, albeit insufficient to classify them as active MM. Of the 90 (36%) patients without an abnormality in these laboratory parameters, MGUS risk stratification would have been 3% (n = 3) low, 29% (26) low-intermediate, 63% (n = 57) high-intermediate, and 4% (n = 4) high risk. Of the 29 MGUS-like patients without a laboratory abnormality who would have been classified as low or low-intermediate-risk MGUS, only four (1% of whole SMM cohort) had high-risk SMM features. Among the MGUS-like SMM, none of those who would have been classified as low-risk MGUS and only 13%(10/75) of the low-intermediate-risk MGUS had high-risk SMM (Fig. 2).

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma: emphasis on risk factors for progression [^112PM3yw]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is characterized by a serum monoclonal protein < 30 g/l, < 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow, and absence of end-organ damage (CRAB-hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia, or bone lesions). MGUS is present in 3% of persons > 50 years and in 5% > 70 years of age. The risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) or a related disorder is 1% per year. Patients with risk factors consisting of an abnormal serum free light chain ratio, non-immunoglobulin G (IgG) MGUS, and an elevated serum M protein ≥ 15 g/l had a risk of progression at 20 years of 58%, compared with 37% with two risk factors present, 21% with one risk factor present, and 5% when none of the risk factors were present. Smouldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma is characterized by having a serum IgG or IgA monoclonal protein of 30 g/l or higher and/or 10% or more plasma cells in the bone marrow but no evidence of end-organ damage. The cumulative probability of progression to active MM or amyloidosis was 51% at 5 years, 66% at 10 years and 73% at 15 years; the median time to progression was 4.8 years.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma: biology, clinical manifestations and management [^11122Gqv]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a heterogeneous group of asymptomatic plasma cell disorder characterized by the presence of monoclonal protein ≥ 30g/L and/or 10–60% of bone marrow plasma cells and no evidence of SLiM-CRAB criteria according to the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) recommendations. Once the effort to reclassify SMM with active disease as MM requiring treatment was completed, the need to redefine new high-risk SMM arose. The 20/2/20 and the IMWG risk model with the add-on high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities allow to identify high-risk SMM with 50% risk of progression to MM within 2 years, and therefore might help to propose a better therapeutic approach, either with the goal to « cure » by profoundly debulk the MM with aggressive therapies, or alternatively to restore the immune surveillance like a « delay » strategy with immune-based therapies. The debate is still ongoing but clearly challenges the watch-and-wait standard of care.

### Patterns of progression in a contemporary cohort of 447 patients with smoldering multiple myeloma [^112skXuh]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is considered an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder preceding multiple myeloma (MM). The course of SMM disease is heterogenous, largely driven by disease biology and tumor burden. Routine clinical surveillance or early treatment, mostly within clinical trials, is thus based on the likelihood of developing a myeloma defining event (MDE) requiring systemic treatment. Current stratification models for risk of progression include bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) infiltration, monoclonal (M) protein component, ratio of involved/uninvolved serum free light chains (FLCr), and cytogenetic abnormalities. Early systemic treatment of high-risk SMM has shown to improve progression free survival in two trials and overall survival (OS) in one of them. However, early treatment of SMM is not considered a standard of care.

The revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM and its precursor states in 2014 ushered a novel era in the treatment of MM with MDE encompassing biomarkers of malignancy besides established criteria for end-organ damage. The inclusion of biomarkers of malignancies into MDE allows treatment of MM before end-organ damage can occur. In patients diagnosed SMM, end-organ damage can thus potentially be prevented.

In their current publication, N.H. Abdallah and colleagues from the MAYO Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA) retrospectively investigated the mode of progression in 406 patients with SMM. They demonstrate that among MDE, bone lesions and anemia (e.g. 36% and 34% in patients with untreated high-risk SMM) remain the prevailing criteria of end-organ damage. Among patients untreated for high-risk SMM, only 13 patients (26%) progressed only by biomarkers of MM malignancy and 23 patients (45%) by clinically significant MDE (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, or bone lesions). These important observations pose a spotlight on the current debate on whether and how to observe or treat SMM in the current era.

CHALLENGES IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and SMM are precursor conditions for multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a malignancy of plasma cells traditionally defined by the presence of hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone lesions (the CRAB criteria). MGUS nearly always precedes the onset of MM. Table 1 lists the diagnostic criteria for these plasma cell disorders.

TABLE 1.
Criteria for Diagnosis of MGUS, Smoldering Multiple Myeloma, and Multiple Myeloma

SMM, initially described in 1980, occupies the middle space between MGUS and MM, with higher disease burden but without the clinical sequelae of the CRAB criteria or "myeloma" defining biomarkers.SMM is less common than MGUS, representing an estimated 13.7% of patients with MM, with 4,100 new patients per year. The rate of progression to active MM is 10% per year for the first 5 years, declines to 3% per year for the next 5 years, and is then 1% per year for the following 10 years. The cumulative probability of progression from SMM to MM is 73% at 15 years. There is debate as to whether SMM is a condition to be treated as an early stage of MMor simply observed, as with MGUS. To date, neither genomic sequencing nor expression profiling have identified a molecular predictor for patients with SMM who progress to MM. It is possible that factors independent of the myeloma cell, but related to the microenvironment, play a more important role in disease progression.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^117HW4V1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM) is an intermediate condition between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), it is defined by a clonal plasma cell population in the bone marrow of at least 10% but no more than 60%, and/or a serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) concentration of at least 3 g/dL or urine monoclonal protein (U-protein) concentration of at least 500 mg/24 h, without the co-presence of the conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, osteolytic bone lesions) or AL amyloidosis or biomarkers indicative of active myeloma (SLiM criteria: 60% or more clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage, involved to uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio 100 or higher, more than 1 focal lesion at least 5 mm on magnetic resonance imaging). A recent population-level screening study in Iceland indicated that the incidence of sMM among screened individuals aged over 40 years in the general population is 0.53%. Among them, one third were classified as intermediate or high risk for progression to active myeloma. Individuals with sMM are asymptomatic but possess a fluctuating risk of advancing to MM ranging from 10% per year for the first 5 years, to 3% per year for the next 5 years, and 1% per year for the next 10 years. However, high-risk patients present a progression rate of up to 50% within two years. The identification of risk factors, including the percentage of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, the level of the M-protein, the involved to uninvolved FLC ratio, the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities such as translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16), 1q addition/amplification, deletion 13q, age, serum creatinine levels and hemoglobin dynamics in time has led to the development of several risk stratification systems that inform physician decisions for patient management.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^115HMvHZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm 3, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### How I approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^1112cF8X]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic clonal proliferation of plasma cells that can progress to MM. It was first described in 1980, and since then, efforts have been made to identify laboratory and imaging markers for impending MM. The first identified markers of progression risk included light chain proteinuria and plasma cell proliferative index (labeling).SMM is defined by the presence of either serum monoclonal protein ≥ 3 g/dL (or ≥ 500 mg per 24-hour urine) or ≥ 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) without evidence of a myeloma-defining event.

SMM is a heterogeneous entitycomprising 3 patient populations: in the first, disease biology resembles that of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS); in the second, disease is slowly progressing to MM; and in the last, disease is myeloma in evolution and will develop into overt disease in < 2 years. There is an urgent need for better risk stratification for all 3 groups. The risk of progression to MM decreases over time; overall risk of progression is 10% per year for the first 5 years (50% in 5 years), 3% per year for the next 5 years (65% in 10 years), and 1% per year for thereafter (similar to the risk of progression from MGUS). An estimated 25% of patients with SMM never progress to symptomatic disease.

Patients with high-risk SMM (HR-SMM) are described as having disease in which the risk of delaying therapy exceeds any benefits of continued observation. Can this group be reliably identified? There are several risk models of progression to active MM, but there is a significant degree of discordance between these risk models, and there is currently no uniformly accepted definition of HR-SMM. HR-SMM is not a disease. It represents a statistical estimate of time to symptom development. Consensus suggests that an 80% likelihood of symptomatic myeloma within 24 months of diagnosis is sufficient to warrant intervention in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.

The search for early interventions in SMM arises from the significant rate of early mortality in MM, which was previously found to be > 10%, and the risk of irreversible kidney damage, spinal cord compression, debilitating fractures, and chronic pain related to bone disease. The ideal strategy would involve not treating too early, to avoid the toxicity of therapy, and not treating too late, to avoid irreversible complications, balancing toxicity with need for treatment in asymptomatic patients. Finding this sweet spot is challenging.

### Smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma: current diagnostic criteria, new predictors of outcome, and follow-up recommendations [^114SDzWx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide an overview on smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma (SMM) including current diagnostic criteria, predictors of progression, pattern of progression, and outcome.

Design

A comprehensive review of the literature on risk factors for progression, treatment attempts to delay progression and outcome in patients with SMM.

Results

The risk factors for progression of SMM include: plasma cell mass including M-protein size and percentage of bone marrow clonal plasma cells (BMPC), abnormal free light chain ratio, proportion of phenotypically abnormal BMPC, immunoparesis, evolution pattern (evolving v nonevolving), and pattern of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. Most patients with SMM progress with anemia and/or skeletal involvement. Immediate therapy with cytotoxic agents, such as melphalan/prednisone has not resulted in improved outcome. Patients should not be treated until progressive disease with end-organ damage occurs. Increasing anemia is the most reliable indicator of progression.

Conclusion

These recently recognized predictors of outcome may be helpful for better disease monitoring and for investigation of new treatment approaches. Thus, recommendations for follow-up every to 3 to 6 months depending on the risk of progression are suggested, and clinical trials with new noncytotoxic biologically derived agents to delay progression, particularly in high-risk patients, are ongoing.

### SLiM CRAB criteria revisited: temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of' biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1166taR2]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with biomarker defined MM should be carefully followed up by skeletal imaging (whole body MRI, or diffusion-weighted MRI, or PET/CT, or skeletal CT) and laboratory tests at reasonable intervals. In case of an evolving pattern, including the M-component, hemoglobin, GFR, and skeletal findings, initiation of therapy should be considered. Finally, it is not the disease itself which has changed its behavior; it is rather the advancement in myeloma diagnostics, better access to care, and care by myeloma specialists that allows us to better define the prognosis of patients with smoldering myeloma and of those with biomarker-defined MM. Clearly, further advances in prognostication are needed to finetune management of individual patients.

### Functional cure and long-term survival in multiple myeloma: how to challenge the previously impossible [^1143gsvQ]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Advances in diagnosis and prognosis

Advances in diagnosis and prognosis have brought about significant improvements for early detection and prognostication in MM, increasing the chances of achieving potential long-term disease control and/or functional cure.

Changes in diagnostic criteria and prognostic indicators

Several developments have emerged, including changes in diagnostic criteria such as the introduction of the SLiM-CRAB criteria, integration of prognostic indicators like MRD assessment, whole-genome sequencing, and novel single-cell sequencing techniques to study the underlying disease biology. These advances have revolutionized the field by enabling earlier detection, more accurate risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing the prospects of achieving long-term remission and potentially curing MM (Table 2).

Figure 1.
Correlation of depth of response and survival. CR: complete remission; MRD: measurable residual disease.

Table 3.
Selected, phase III trials of those in which multiple myeloma treatment was adapted according to measurable residual disease.

One notable advancement in the diagnosis of MM was the introduction of the SLiM-CRAB criteria by the IMWG in 2014. The traditional CRAB criteria, which include hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia and bone lesions, were initially used to identify patients with active disease requiring treatment. However, they often failed to capture early-stage myeloma or rapidly evolving disease, which could delay the initiation of appropriate therapy. The SLiM-CRAB criteria address this issue by incorporating additional parameters, such as the presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥ 100, or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission computed tomography. These criteria enable the identification of asymptomatic patients at higher risk of progression and facilitate early intervention, leading to improved outcomes.

### AL amyloidosis for the cardiologist and Oncologist: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^113afS7i]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance versus myeloma versus AL amyloidosis

As noted previously, systemic AL amyloidosis most commonly arises from clonal light chains produced by a clonal plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow. Because 2 other more common conditions (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS] and myeloma) also arise from clonal plasma cell proliferation, this can lead to confusion as to how the diseases relate to one another (Table 2).

Table 2
Spectrum of Clonal Plasma Cell Disorders

When a plasma cell clonally proliferates, it can cause illness in 2 distinct ways:

- The plasma cell clone itself can be proliferative, such that it occupies much of the marrow space (crowding out normal marrow), causing complications such as cytopenias, lytic bone lesions, or hypercalcemia.
- The plasma cell clone can produce monoclonal immunoglobulin and/or monoclonal light chains, which circulate in the bloodstream and cause damage.

Importantly, most plasma cell clones do not cause illness; frequently, the clone is not overly proliferative (taking over < 10% of the marrow and not affecting the bone tissue), and the immunoglobulins and/or light chains are eliminated harmlessly in the urine. This scenario, called MGUS, is increasingly common as people age and itself does not require treatment. Although patients with MGUS should be monitored to make sure they do not develop myeloma or AL amyloidosis, most will never require treatment.

When the plasma cell clone is itself more malignant, proliferating to > 10% of marrow cellularity, it is now called "myeloma". Depending on whether or not the proliferation is causing certain laboratory abnormalities/organ dysfunction, it is considered "asymptomatic myeloma" (typically not requiring treatment) or "symptomatic myeloma" (typically requiring treatment). Traditionally, the criteria used to define symptomatic myeloma were the CRAB criteria (hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia and lytic Bone lesions). However, more recently, additional myeloma-defining events have been identified including serum free light chain (FLC) ratio (involved:noninvolved light chain) ≥ 100, clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, and lytic lesion detection by more sensitive imaging techniques (whole-body low-dose computed tomography, whole-body magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or positron emission tomography/computed tomography). For patients meeting these so-called "SLiM-CRAB criteria", plasma cell–directed treatment is recommended.

Multiple myeloma — IMWG CRAB and SLiM-CRAB diagnostic criteria — The CRAB criteria that define MM include: increased calcium levels (> 11.5 mg/dL), renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or 2 g/dL less than normal), and presence of bone lesions, and the presence of one or more osteolytic lesions seen on skeletal radiography, whole-body MRI, or whole-body FDG-PET/CT fulfills the criteria for bone disease. The MM-defining biomarkers identified by the IMWG SLiM features include one or more of the following: greater than or equal to sixty percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow; involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio of 100 or more with the involved FLC being greater than or equal 100 mg/L; or MRI with more than one focal marrow (non-osteolytic) lesion, and asymptomatic patients fulfilling these criteria should be treated as having active MM.

### International myeloma working group updated criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma [^114RUPwy]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

This International Myeloma Working Group consensus updates the disease definition of multiple myeloma to include validated biomarkers in addition to existing requirements of attributable CRAB features (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, and bone lesions). These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.

### Risk stratification of smoldering multiple myeloma incorporating revised IMWG diagnostic criteria [^117SgLTq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

We used 3-year progression as a binary end point to define optimal cutoffs for continuous variables. Patients who are at highest risk of progression do so within the first few years from diagnosis. Our cutoff of 3 years allowed us to capture these patients. The 3-year cutoff helped us to avoid missing patients who had shorter follow-up (had we taken 4 or 5 years as cutoff) or labeling patients who had progression after 2 years as non-progressors (had we taken 2 years as cutoff). BMPC% > 20%, arrived using this method was associated with a short median TTP of 29.8 months, and was a strong predictor of progression in the multivariate model; similar observations were made in the original Mayo Clinic cohort published in 2007. BMPC% ≥ 20%, along with evolving changes in hemoglobin and monoclonal protein, was a strong predictor of progression in a subset of 190 patients seen at our institution between 1973 and 2014, thus lending further support to our approach. We did not include evolving change in this study, as our goal was to identify patients' risk at their first evaluation as this would be most useful for consideration in clinical trials. The changes observed during observation period allow for dynamic assessment of progression as shown by the studies examining the influence of evolving changes, and identifying additional patients at higher risk of progression.

Restricting our analysis to only those patients who underwent an advanced imaging at diagnosis could have resulted in a cohort closer to SMM as defined by the 2014 criteria. We hypothesized that this would introduce a bias for selecting patients with higher than usual risk, considering the retrospective design of our study. We felt that patients who underwent advanced imaging at diagnosis of SMM, when it was not part of the standard-of-care investigations, could have had some other "high-risk" clinical feature, which could have alerted the treating physician, leading to an advanced imaging to exclude bone lesions. Our suspicion is partially supported by the observation that patients who had an advanced imaging tended to have shorter TTP, even though the difference was not statistically significant. Larger prospective studies are required where patients undergo an advanced imaging at diagnosis, before a definitive conclusion can be made.

### Diagnosis and management of smoldering multiple myeloma: the razor's edge between clonality and cancer [^115CMVsc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a rare plasma cell disorder, and as the disease is asymptomatic, diagnosis is often incidental. SMM is characterized by increased marrow infiltration by clonal plasma cells and/or elevated serum M-protein in the absence of a myeloma-defining event (MDE). In recent years, SMM has gained increased attention owing to a broadening of the criteria for MDE, which include apart from the CRAB criteria, three additional parameters. Survival advantage may be offered by early treatment in the high-risk subset, based on a single trial. In this review, we assess the risk factors and models for progression to multiple myeloma. A review of our diagnostic and management approaches to SMM is presented.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^115r8diq]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While novel agents have certainly improved the outcomes of patients with myeloma, prompt diagnosis and close follow-up of MM patients remain highly relevant and contribute to better survival. In most cases, the diagnosis of MM is straightforward, being based on biological and radiological evidence when evocative clinical signs are present. During response assessment, the evaluation of MRD will become increasingly important and, within the next few years, will guide treatment choices in clinical trials and possibly also outside trial scenarios. International efforts are needed to standardize the different techniques that can be used to evaluate MRD. Guidelines on appropriate follow-up and patient-tailored monitoring have been updated in this EMN consensus paper and should help to improve the outcome and prognosis of our patients.

### Evolving diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma [^115J1Wps]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy historically defined by the presence of end-organ damage, specifically, hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions (CRAB features) that can be attributed to the neoplastic process. In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) updated the diagnostic criteria for MM to add specific biomarkers that can be used to make the diagnosis of the disease in patients who did not have CRAB features. In addition, the update allows modern imaging methods including computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT to diagnose MM bone disease. These changes enable early diagnosis, and allow the initiation of effective therapy to prevent the development of end-organ damage in patients who are at the highest risk. This article reviews these and several other clarifications and revisions that were made to the diagnostic criteria for MM and related disorders. The updated disease definition for MM also automatically resulted in a revision to the diagnostic criteria for the asymptomatic phase of the disease termed smoldering MM (SMM). Thus the current diagnosis and risk-stratification of SMM is also reviewed in this article. Using specific prognostic factors, it is possible to identify a subset of patients with SMM who have a risk of progression to MM of 25% per year (high-risk SMM). An approach to the management of patients with low- and high-risk SMM is discussed.

### Personalised progression prediction in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma (PANGEA): a retrospective, multicohort study [^114yusga]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma is often preceded by two precursor conditions, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma, with current diagnostic criteria differentiating these from symptomatic multiple myeloma, as defined by SLiM-CRAB guidelines: clonal bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 60%; serum free light chain (FLC) ratio greater than or equal to 100, provided involved FLC level is 100 mg/L or higher; more than one focal lesion on MRI; hypercalcaemia; renal failure; anaemia; and bone lesions. Various criteria have been developed to stratify patients with precursor disease into risk groups based on predicted probability of progression to multiple myeloma and to identify which patients might benefit from early intervention. The Mayo criteria stratify patients with smouldering multiple myeloma into risk categories depending on no risk factors (low-risk), one risk factor (intermediate-risk), or two or more risk factors (high-risk), which include a free light chain (FLC) ratio of more than 20, a monoclonal protein concentration of more than 2·0 g/dL, and a bone marrow plasma cell percentage (BMPC%) of more than 20%. This 20/2/20 stratification system was updated by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) to include the fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) results of t(4;14), t(14;16), gain(1q), and del(13/13q). These models are applied at precursor diagnosis and rely on discrete cutoffs despite inherent variation in biomarkers throughout disease monitoring. Consequently, the models are rarely used to restratify patients according to evolving laboratory findings, despite improvements to the ability of the 20/2/20 model to prognosticate when applied at discrete timepoints after diagnosis.

### Multiple myeloma: diagnosis and treatment [^117X4HbD]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma accounts for 1.6% of all cancer cases and approximately 10% of hematologic malignancies in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 28,850 new cases of multiple myeloma were diagnosed in the United States, and the disease caused more than 11,000 deaths. Patients older than 65 years account for 85% of those diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and there is a twofold increased incidence in blacks compared with whites. Patients may present with bone pain or with symptoms that are often nonspecific, such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, recurrent infections, and weight loss. Many patients present with only laboratory abnormalities, such as anemia, renal disease, and elevated protein levels. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires increased numbers of immature, abnormal, or atypical plasma cells in the bone marrow; a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine; or characteristic bone lesions. The diagnostic workup in a patient with suspected multiple myeloma should include a complete blood count with differential; serum chemistries; creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta2-microglobulin tests; immunoglobulin studies; skeletal survey; and bone marrow evaluation. Initiation of chemotherapy and assessment of eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation require referral to an oncologist. Most patients with multiple myeloma will receive thromboprophylaxis, bisphosphonate therapy, and prophylaxis against infection at some point in their treatment. Family physicians play a role in assessing these patients for infection, adverse treatment effects, and renal and thrombotic complications, and in managing issues related to pain, nutrition, and psychosocial support.

### What Do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders? [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally, B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient, to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Current risk stratification and staging of multiple myeloma and related clonal plasma cell disorders [^116Tg2pk]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance

Multiple myeloma consistently develops from the premalignant precursor condition, termed MGUS. MGUS is defined by the presence of a circulating monoclonal (M) protein < 3 g/dL, clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) < 10%, and no evidence of end-organ damage attributable to the plasma cell disorder. While MGUS is relatively common in the general population, affecting 3–6% of adults over the age of 50, only a small proportion of individuals with MGUS will ever develop clinical consequences. The annual risk of progression from MGUS to MM or related malignancies requiring treatment is approximately 1% per year. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in progression risk among patients with MGUS. In a Mayo Clinic study of 1384 patients with MGUS, the presence of three of the following risk factors — an abnormal serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, an M-protein concentration ≥ 1.5 g/dL, or a non-IgG isotype — was associated with a 58% risk of progression to MM over 20 years. In contrast, patients without any of these risk features had only a 5% risk of progression over the same period. This risk stratification model, subsequently adopted by the IMWG, is recommended for evaluating patients with MGUS at initial diagnosis (Table 2). Notably, longitudinal application of the IMWG model at follow-up continues to demonstrate robust prognostic value. Presence of immunoparesis (characterized by suppression of 2 or more uninvolved immunoglobulins) and a high fraction of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow are other important risk factors associated with an early progression of MGUS.

Risk stratification in MGUS plays a critical role in guiding baseline evaluation and surveillance strategies. For example, in low-risk MGUS, the probability of identifying ≥ 10% BMPCs or skeletal lesions at baseline is typically < 5%, making extensive diagnostic workup potentially unnecessary. Similarly, after demonstrating clinical stability over the first 6–12 months, follow-up for low-risk MGUS can be performed at less frequent intervals. The iStopMM study has further refined the predictive capacity of the IMWG model by incorporating serum immunoglobulin levels alongside the original three variables to better predict BMPC infiltration.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^1155BAio]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The improvement in PFS is notable, especially in preventing bony events, which can be a significant cause of morbidity, although we do not know whether these events were symptomatic. Moreover, this benefit is seen without necessarily achieving a deep response, and even with the dose reductions and limited duration of treatment, important questions regarding dose and duration of treatment in this SMM population remain.

On the screening spine and pelvis MRI, nearly half of patients (47.2%) had an abnormality present (the specifics are not reported currently). Although plasmacytomas were an exclusion in the protocol, it would be of interest to know whether any of these MRI abnormalities could be considered myeloma-defining events under the 2014 diagnostic criteria, whether there were differences in progression and the type of progression based on the MRI findings, and whether lenalidomide made a difference. Similarly, a small proportion of patients had myeloma-defining biomarkers with the 2014 criteria: 3.3% had bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, and 8.2% had free light chain ratio > 100 of 8.2%. If the analyses were repeated without these ultra–high-risk patients, does the magnitude of the benefit change?

Because patients with SMM are, by definition, asymptomatic, it is critical to weigh the impact of lenalidomide treatment on adverse effects and quality of life. Moreover, although the reported quality of life was similar between both arms, 51% of patients in the lenalidomide arm discontinued treatment, and 40% of the discontinuations were for adverse events. Ultimately, the best case for early initiation of treatment is demonstration of an OS benefit (which is not known at this time) and reduction in myeloma-related deaths.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^113tHbyY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: multiple myeloma, version 1.2025 [^112jvFY4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — bone marrow evaluation: The percentage of clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs; ≥ 10%) is a major criterion for the diagnosis of MM. The percentage of plasma cells in bone marrow is estimated by unilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry can confirm monoclonal plasma cells and more accurately quantify plasma cell involvement. Abnormal plasma cells contain either kappa or lambda light chains, and predominance of one or the other light chain–expressing plasma cells indicates clonality; specific immunophenotypic profiles may have prognostic implications.

### How I treat smoldering multiple myeloma [^116uop2x]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Smoldering myeloma is a heterogeneous clinical entity where a subset of patients has an indolent course of disease that mimics monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance, whereas others have a more aggressive course that has been described as "early myeloma". It is defined as either serum M-protein ≥ 3 g/L or ≥ 10% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. There are currently no molecular factors to differentiate risks of progression for these patients. Current recommendations of therapy continue to be patient observation or patient enrollment in clinical trials. However, new definitions of active multiple myeloma recently agreed upon by the International Myeloma Working Group may alter the timing of therapy. On the basis of emerging data of therapy in these patients, it seems reasonable to believe that future recommendations for therapy of patients with smoldering myeloma will become an increasingly important topic. In this article, we review the current knowledge of this disease and risk factors associated with progression. We also examine biological insights and alterations that occur in the tumor clone and the surrounding bone marrow niche. Finally, we review clinical trials that have been performed in these patients and provide recommendations for follow-up of patients with this unique disease entity.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^1129kbsu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Imaging for myeloma bone disease — Recommendation 4.4 — specifies that whole-body low-dose computed tomography (WBCT) scan has been shown to be superior to skeletal survey with plain x-rays and is the preferred method for baseline and routine bone surveillance, with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acceptable as baseline alternatives and used in select situations (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Literature notes limited sensitivity of skeletal survey, as there must be 30% trabecular bone loss to detect lytic lesions and expert review found additional abnormalities in 23% of cases; modern techniques identified upwards of 80% more lesions, WBCT versus skeletal survey revealed up to 60% more relevant findings leading to treatment changes in up to 20% of patients, IMWG recommends WBCT as the standard diagnostic tool, MRI and FDG-PET/CT have been equivalent for detection rates, and in smoldering myeloma 30% to 50% of patients have bone marrow abnormalities on MRI.

### Time to redefine myeloma [^111yJ9ac]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In November 2014 the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) revised the definition of multiple myeloma, such that asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma without any of the traditional 'CRAB' (hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, anaemia, bone disease) end organ damage criteria but with one of three new criteria would be recommended to start treatment. Previously, the standard of care for such patients was expectant management. These three new criteria are: greater than 60% clonal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, a serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio of > 100 (the involved sFLC must be > 100 mg/l) and greater than one unequivocal focal lesion on advanced imaging (low dose whole body computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, (18) F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography). Although this would appear to affect a small number of patients, the impact of these changes are broad, leading to an increased use of advanced imaging, a debate around the management of patients previously diagnosed with smouldering myeloma, changed terminology and clinical trial design and an extension of the use of biomarkers. For the first time the philosophy of treatment in myeloma will change from treatment initiation only being triggered by overt end organ damage to an era where sub clinical risk factors will also be taken into account.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^116x7xsL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) expanded the definition of MM to include a category of myeloma-defining biomarkers: clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥ 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥ 100, or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The motivation behind the biomarker definition was to identify asymptomatic patients with a high risk (80% or more) of developing a CRAB-related event within 2 years. Nearly 15% of patients previously considered to have SMM would be upstaged to active MM under the 2014 biomarker definition. Subsequent studies suggest that these criteria, such as the free light chain criteria, may not confer as high a risk as initially defined, underscoring the challenges in predicting MM development.

The updated criteria emphasize the importance of imaging in SMM to carefully exclude myeloma-defining bone lesions. Conventional skeletal surveys are inadequate for this purpose, because a lytic lesion needs to involve more than 50% of the bone before it can be detected.CT is more sensitive than plain radiographs, and whole-body CT protocols using lower doses of radiation have been evaluated. In one study, low-dose whole-body CT (LDWBCT) detected lytic lesions in 22.5% of patients with SMM and MM that were not visualized on conventional skeletal survey. The IMWG recently recommended LDWBCT, and if negative, proceeding to whole-body MRI or spine and pelvis MRI.PET-CT is an appropriate alternative to LDWBCT.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^111VdbKn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 54-year-old man was seen for smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Five years ago, a routine physical examination showed an elevated total protein level. Laboratory studies at that time revealed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) lambda monoclonal protein level of 2.39 g/dL, with a normal CBC and metabolic panel, consistent with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Serum protein electrophoresis now shows a monoclonal protein level measuring 4.52 g/dL. Serum free lambda chains were elevated at 426.6 mg/L, with an elevated involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio of 40. A positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography (CT) scan did not show any evidence of bone disease. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of 26% clonal plasma cells, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed monosomy 13 and hyperdiploidy. The patient returns to discuss therapeutic options.

### Best treatment strategies in high-risk multiple myeloma: navigating a gray area [^113ngKuJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 62-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with a 3-month history of fatigue and unremitting back pain. Physical examination revealed mucosal pallor, point tenderness at T10-T12, and a normal neurologic examination with preserved lower extremity strength and sphincter tone. Laboratory work-up disclosed hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 101 fL and otherwise normal blood cell counts; reticulocytes, 0.98%; stable creatinine, 1.1 mg/dL; calcium, 9.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.4 g/dL; β2-microglobulin, 5.7 mg/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 397 IU/L; and normal liver function tests. Bone survey showed lytic lesions at T10, T12, and throughout the axial skeleton and osteopenia. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) demonstrated a 3.5 g/dL monoclonal peak in the gamma region, with monoclonal immunoglobulin G and lambda light chain detected on immunofixation. Serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio was 0.0001. Twenty-four-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was normal. Bone marrow biopsy showed 60% infiltration with lambda light chain-restricted plasma cells staining positive for CD138 and CD56 and negative for CD45 by flow cytometry (Fig 1). Congo red stain on bone marrow biopsy and fat pad aspirate was negative for amyloid light-chain deposition. Cytogenetics of the malignant cells identified a t(4;14) translocation, confirming the diagnosis of high-risk, International Staging System stage III immunoglobulin G lambda multiple myeloma (MM). The patient began treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) plus monthly intravenous zoledronic acid therapy. He has tolerated therapy well, and the monoclonal protein peak is rapidly declining. He is now referred to discuss indications for autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and overall prognosis.

### A personalized mass spectrometry-based assay to monitor M-protein in patients with multiple myeloma (easyM) [^113PDdAQ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow; it is often accompanied by CRAB features (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions; ref.). In most patients with multiple myeloma, malignant plasma cells produce either intact immunoglobulin (Ig) or free light chain (FLC; ref.). Thus, the secreted product of plasma cells, called M-protein or paraprotein, has long been used as a biomarker to monitor multiple myeloma disease status, response to treatment, and relapse. At the time of diagnosis, the M-protein concentration in serum is typically higher than 30 g/L, but over the course of treatment the responders' M-protein levels drop several orders of magnitude due to the reduction of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Several diagnostic tests are currently employed in the clinic. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) quantify and characterize the M-protein based on the detection of the monoclonal protein on the gel or membrane with the respective detection limits of 0.5 and 0.1 g/L. Serum FLC assay relies on nephelometry to measure the abundance of kappa and lambda FLC and their ratio with the sensitivity of less than 0.001 g/L. These methods are inexpensive, widely available, and appropriate for routine use. However, recent development of highly effective combination therapies has resulted in the high rates of complete responses (CR) marked by the absence of detectable M-protein by IFE, and thus requires the development of highly sensitive approaches to better estimate and monitor minimal residual disease (MRD; ref.). Moreover, introduction of highly effective monoclonal Ab-based therapeutics poses additional challenges with CR assessment as these can be detected as individual monoclonal bands in serum IFE.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma: evolving diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies [^117Y9bSi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The adage for smoldering myeloma (SMM) has been to observe without treatment, until criteria for active multiple myeloma were satisfied. Definitions and risk stratification models have become more sophisticated, with prognostication tailored to include high-risk cytogenetics as per the most recent International Myeloma Working Group 2020 risk model. Moreover, progress in defining genomic evolution and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment through the monoclonal continuum have given insight into the complexities underlying the different patterns of progression observed in SMM. Given recent data showing improved progression-free survival with early intervention in high-risk SMM, the current dilemma is focused on how these patients should be treated. This case-based article maps the significant advancements made in the diagnosis and risk stratification of SMM. Data from landmark clinical trials will also be discussed, and ongoing trials are summarized. Ultimately, we outline our approach to SMM and hope to impart to the reader a sound concept of the current clinical management of SMM.

### Two independent hematological malignancies in a B-cell deficient good syndrome patient [^111JUovi]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

His laboratory results indicated low levels of IgM and IgA (0.3 g/l (normal range: 0.4–2.3) and 0.6 g/l (0.7–4.0), respectively), but high levels of IgG (20.1 g/l (7.0–16.0), of which 18.4 g/l monoclonal IgG-lambda protein) and increased free lambda light chain (60.9 mg/l (8.3–27), with a kappa/lambda ratio of 0.29 (0.31–1.56)). Previously, at the time of the thymoma treatment, immunoglobulin titers were not measured. A pneumococcal vaccination demonstrated inadequate anti-pneumococcal antibody response. Additional flow cytometry lymphocyte subset analysis repeatedly revealed a complete absence of B (CD19 +) lymphocytes or plasma cells (CD38+ CD138+) (Supplementary figure S1, available at Rheumatology online). Natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were identified in normal absolute amounts. There was no evidence for HIV infection.

Good syndrome was diagnosed based on the history of thymoma, absence of circulating B cells and immunodeficiency with recurrent infections. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) 0.4 gram per kilogram in combination with prophylactic azithromycin and fluconazole was initiated. High levels of monoclonal IgG in absence of circulating B cells as a feature of Good syndrome has not previously been described. Bone marrow biopsy showed presence of all three hematopoietic cell lines, a complete absence of B cells and a markedly increased presence of 15% plasma cells (CD38 +, CD138 + cells) by volume, expressing IgG-lambda immunoglobulin (Figure 1C-D). In the absence of lytic bone lesions, anaemia, hypercalcemia or renal insufficiency, we classified the plasma cell proliferation as a smouldering myeloma.

Several months later, our patient reported novel complaints of redness, irritation and swelling around the left eye. A computed tomography scan revealed a subconjunctival mass. Additional conjunctival biopsy demonstrated > 95% CD20 + PAX5 + CD79a + BCL2 +, CD10 - CD23 - BCL6 - monoclonal B cells with wt-MYD88, fitting a diagnosis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (Figure 1E-F). CD138 staining revealed no significant plasma cell presence in this biopsy. Patient was referred for 2×2 Gy palliative radiotherapy.

Current diagnosis and monitoring

SMM is currently diagnosed according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, based on amount of M-component, percentage of clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) infiltration and no evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB) or amyloidosis (Table 1). Updated IMWG criteria re-classified 10–15% of patients previously diagnosed as having SMM, on the basis of new myeloma-defining events (biomarkers of malignancy: > 60% BMPC, free light chains [FLC] ratio > 100 42 and > 1 focal lesion with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), the so-called "SLIM CRAB" criteria, as "ultra-high-risk" SMM. These patients are considered eligible for full MM treatments, having a risk of progression of about 80% at 2 years.

The new IMWG criteria emphasize the role of imaging to risk-stratify SMM, with patients having two or more focal lesions > 5 mm detected by MRI qualifying for active treatments. In particular, the IMWG recommends sensitive low-dose whole-body CT for the staging of monoclonal gammopathies. This imaging technique was recently validated in a prospective study of 100 patients with SMM at different timepoints to identify early bone lesions related to MM evolution. If low-dose wholebody CT is negative, whole-body or spine and pelvis MRI, where possible, should be pursued, although the latter MRI protocol can miss around 10% of non-axial lesions. Given the spatial distribution of focal bone lesions, it has been recently suggested that the cutoff for the number of focal lesions should be adapted according to the MRI protocol used. 47 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)-CT may be considered an appropriate alternative to low-dose whole-body CT. It is highly recommended to distinguish between SMM and active MM, if low-dose whole-body CT is negative and whole-body MRI is unavailable. In the case of uncertain or borderline lesions, radiological studies should be repeated, preferably alternating different techniques, every 3–6 months or whenever clinically indicated, until a definitive diagnosis of symptomatic MM is reasonably made or excluded, (i.e. the suspicious lesion remains stable, is not accompanied by other signs of progression, or is disappearing).

### Diagnosis and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a review [^111LKe6K]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Nearly 5% of adults have the precursor malignant condition monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Management centers on differentiating MGUS from more serious conditions to determine additional diagnostic testing, monitoring, and potential therapy.

Observations

MGUS is defined by the absence of end-organ damage or symptoms, a small amount of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein), and low volume of plasma cells. MGUS must be distinguished from overt malignant diseases like multiple myeloma (MM), immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, and monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), all of which cause organ damage or symptoms. Although testing for M proteins is often prompted by clinical findings (eg, osteoporosis or autoimmune disease), recent evidence from screened populations suggests that previous MGUS disease associations were likely overestimated and that testing for M proteins should be reserved for when malignant disease or MGCS is suspected. Risk of progression to malignant disease ranges from 0.5% to 1%, meaning most patients have indolent disease. Guideline-concordant management of MGUS is determined by predicted risk of progression to malignant disease, which depends on subtype of immunoglobulin, M protein concentration, and free light chain ratio. Patients with low-risk MGUS can safely defer bone marrow biopsy and advanced imaging, and should undergo periodic laboratory monitoring. Intermediate- and high-risk MGUS should trigger bone marrow biopsy and bone imaging to detect overt MM and shorter monitoring intervals. Advanced molecular testing may improve on current risk stratification to target monitoring and treatment to those with highest risk of malignant progression and avoid overtreatment of those with low-risk disease. Management will also be informed by results of several clinical trials to clarify the risks and benefits of screening, optimal monitoring strategy, predictors of progression, and potential preventive or curative therapies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence-based management of MGUS currently rests on separating clinically indolent from high-risk precursor disease. Research using novel detection methods, incorporating molecular testing into risk stratification, and evaluating screening, monitoring, and therapeutic or lifestyle interventions has the potential to improve outcomes.
