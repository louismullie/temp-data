## Question

Rnp antibodies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of anti-RNP antibodies, including what they target, how they are detected, their diagnostic and prognostic implications across diseases, and how to interpret and act on results in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immunologic definition and targets of anti-RNP. Then, I should verify the laboratory detection methods and their limitations. Next, I will examine disease associations, starting with mixed connective tissue disease, followed by systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and primary Sjögren's syndrome. After that, I should review prognostic implications, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and interstitial lung disease. Finally, I will synthesize practical interpretation and management considerations, including assay variability, titers, and when to retest, and close with a concise clinical takeaway anchored in current evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immunologic definition and targets. Anti-RNP antibodies target the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, typically directed at the 70 kDa, A, and C protein components of U1 snRNP, which is central to spliceosome function and is a classic extractable nuclear antigen recognized in ANA-associated rheumatic diseases [^1127VPpK] [^112GZC8e].

> I need to check the laboratory detection landscape and its pitfalls. Anti-RNP is usually detected by solid-phase assays such as line immunoassay, multiplex bead assays, or ELISA, but results are analyte- and platform-dependent, with variable sensitivity and specificity across commercial systems; for example, RNP68/A on BioPlex is more sensitive but less specific than Sm/RNP panels, underscoring the need to report the specific analyte and method when interpreting results [^113rjWDA]. Hold on, I should verify the broader ANA testing context: ANA by indirect immunofluorescence remains a screening cornerstone, but anti-RBP antibodies like anti-RNP tend to be stable over time, so a single determination often suffices clinically, unlike anti-dsDNA which fluctuates with activity [^115Mm26w] [^112DeUmt].

> Now, let me consider mixed connective tissue disease, where anti-RNP is most emblematic. High-titer anti-U1 RNP is a serologic hallmark of MCTD and is embedded in multiple diagnostic criteria sets; however, I should confirm that MCTD remains controversial as a distinct entity, with some experts viewing it as an overlap phenotype rather than a separate disease, which affects how strictly we interpret isolated anti-RNP positivity without the full clinical constellation [^114w791K] [^114naErH] [^114LrzFt]. Wait, let me verify the clinical triad often cited: Raynaud phenomenon, swollen hands, and myositis in the setting of high-titer anti-RNP supports MCTD, but overlap features with SLE, SSc, and PM/DM are common, and pulmonary involvement, including PAH and ILD, drives prognosis in this group [^113jTM4L].

> Next, I should review systemic lupus erythematosus associations. Anti-RNP is present in roughly one-quarter to one-half of SLE cohorts and is less specific than anti-Sm or anti-dsDNA; it clusters with anti-Sm and has been linked to Raynaud phenomenon, leukopenia, and serositis, though these associations vary by cohort and methodology [^111t2CMQ] [^1127VPpK] [^115xsQnV]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in SLE, anti-RNP positivity can also flag overlap features or an undifferentiated phenotype, so I should integrate the full autoantibody profile and clinical picture before assigning prognostic weight to anti-RNP alone [^115e7DXm].

> I will now examine systemic sclerosis. Anti-U1 RNP is not SSc-specific but occurs in a minority of patients and often signals overlap features, including myositis, ILD, and PAH; importantly, anti-U1 RNP positivity in CTD-associated PAH has been associated with better survival in some cohorts, which I should keep in mind when counseling patients with pulmonary vascular disease [^114gja3E] [^111ugTTE]. But wait, what if other RNP specificities are present? Anti-U11/U12 RNP (RNPC-3) is a distinct SSc-associated antibody linked to severe ILD and poor outcomes, and anti-U3 RNP (fibrillarin) tracks with PAH and cardiac involvement; these are different from anti-U1 RNP and should not be conflated in interpretation or prognostication [^112K1dua] [^111ugTTE].

> Let me consider primary Sjögren's syndrome. Anti-RNP positivity in pSS is uncommon but, when present, correlates with younger age at onset, higher systemic activity, and more frequent myositis and pulmonary involvement; importantly, this association persists even when restricting to anti-SSA–positive patients, suggesting anti-RNP captures a distinct inflammatory endotype within pSS [^114AY1br] [^113G9XCw]. I should double-check that these patients often have higher gammaglobulin and more B-cell activation, aligning with a systemic rather than purely glandular phenotype, which has implications for monitoring and treatment escalation [^114AY1br].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications, especially pulmonary disease. In CTD-associated PAH, anti-U1 RNP positivity has been linked to improved survival in univariable and multivariable analyses, despite similar hemodynamics, which is a critical prognostic modifier to document in clinic [^114gja3E]. Conversely, in SSc, anti-U11/U12 RNP positivity predicts higher risks of ILD progression and worse event-free survival, highlighting that "RNP" is not monolithic and that the specific analyte matters for risk stratification and surveillance planning [^112K1dua]. Hold on, I should verify that these data come from different cohorts and methods, so external validation and clinical context remain essential before overgeneralizing [^112K1dua] [^114gja3E].

> I need to ensure I address assay variability and titration. Because platforms differ in antigen targets and cutoffs, discordant results across laboratories are common; reporting the specific analyte and method improves interpretability, and in ambiguous cases, confirmatory testing on an alternative platform or with a different method is reasonable [^113rjWDA]. Let me reconsider titers: unlike anti-dsDNA, anti-RNP levels are relatively stable over time, so routine serial testing is not usually necessary unless the clinical picture evolves or classification is uncertain; however, in seronegative patients with evolving features, periodic reassessment can be justified [^112DeUmt] [^114LJKGn].

> Now, I should translate this into practical interpretation and management. Anti-RNP positivity, especially at high titer in the right clinical context, should prompt evaluation for MCTD or an overlap syndrome with attention to Raynaud phenomenon, myositis, ILD, and PAH; conversely, low-titer positivity in isolation is nonspecific and may reflect UCTD or even be seen in other settings, so I must avoid overcalling disease based on serology alone [^112GZC8e] [^112xNQSS]. Wait, let me verify pediatric considerations: in children, ANA and anti-ENA testing have low positive predictive value in low-prevalence settings, so results must be interpreted strictly within the clinical context to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions [^114hpoEV].

> I should confirm special populations and edge cases. Maternal anti-U1 RNP has been implicated in neonatal lupus phenotypes, including cutaneous disease and, rarely, congenital heart block, so pregnancy counseling and fetal surveillance plans should incorporate this possibility when anti-RNP is present, even in the absence of classic anti-SSA/SSB [^11188zYb] [^112n9j6a]. Hold on, I should verify that these reports are case-based and that guidelines still prioritize anti-SSA/SSB in risk stratification, but the signal for anti-RNP–mediated NLE is real and clinically relevant in select cases [^11188zYb].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaway. Anti-RNP antibodies target U1 snRNP proteins and, when present at high titer in the right clinical context, strongly support MCTD or an overlap CTD; they are less specific for SLE but cluster with anti-Sm and associate with Raynaud and hematologic features; in SSc, anti-U1 RNP can mark overlap disease and may portend better survival in PAH, whereas anti-U11/U12 RNP predicts severe ILD; in pSS, anti-RNP flags a more systemic, B-cell–active phenotype; across settings, assay heterogeneity demands cautious interpretation and correlation with phenotype, and routine retesting is generally unnecessary unless the clinical picture changes [^112GZC8e] [^113rjWDA] [^114gja3E] [^112K1dua] [^114AY1br].

Anti-RNP antibodies target the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex [^111ugTTE] and are **most strongly associated with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)** [^114naErH], typically presenting with overlapping features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis [^116M1Qb3]. They are also found in SLE, Sjögren's, and systemic sclerosis, but with **lower specificity** [^115e7DXm]. Anti-RNP positivity is linked to Raynaud's, myositis, arthritis, and pulmonary involvement, especially ILD and PAH [^1127VPpK] [^111ugTTE] [^111KPDeL] [^115xsQnV] [^114gja3E]. Testing is best done with multiplex or ELISA assays, and results must be interpreted in clinical context due to cross-reactivity and assay variability [^113rjWDA] [^112GZC8e]. Management is organ-based and may include glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants; prognosis varies by disease and organ involvement [^113jTM4L].

---

## Molecular targets and immunological significance

Anti-RNP antibodies primarily target the **U1 snRNP complex**, binding the 70 kDa, A, and C proteins [^1127VPpK]. These autoantibodies are typically **IgG** and are central to the diagnosis of MCTD and related overlap syndromes [^114w791K].

---

## Clinical associations and disease specificity

Anti-RNP antibodies are **most specific for MCTD** but also occur in other autoimmune diseases, with varying clinical implications:

| **Disease** | **Prevalence of anti-rnp antibodies** | **Clinical associations** |
|-|-|-|
| Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) | 95–100% | - Raynaud's phenomenon <br/> - Myositis <br/> - Arthritis <br/> - Pulmonary involvement (ILD, PAH) <br/> - Overlap features of SLE, SSc, and PM/DM [^11189yn8] |
| Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | 20–50% | - Raynaud's phenomenon <br/> - Myositis <br/> - Arthritis <br/> - Less specific than anti-Sm or anti-dsDNA [^111t2CMQ] [^115e7DXm] |
| Sjögren's syndrome | 2–10% | - More active disease <br/> - Muscular and pulmonary involvement [^114AY1br] |
| Systemic sclerosis (SSc) | 2–10% | - Overlap features <br/> - Myositis <br/> - ILD <br/> - PAH [^111ugTTE] |

---

## Diagnostic methods and clinical interpretation

Anti-RNP antibodies are detected by **multiplex immunoassays** or ELISA; multiplex assays are sensitive but less specific, so results should be interpreted in clinical context [^113rjWDA]. Positive results, particularly at high titer, support MCTD or overlap syndromes, whereas isolated positivity may be nonspecific [^11189yn8].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Anti-RNP antibodies are implicated in immune complex formation and organ damage, particularly in the lungs and joints [^117MVRKm]. They may also **impair lymphocyte function**, contributing to immune dysregulation [^113ta44i].

---

## Clinical manifestations and complications

Anti-RNP positivity is associated with several **clinical manifestations**:

- **Raynaud's phenomenon**: Common in MCTD and SLE [^notfound].
- **Myositis**: Frequent in MCTD and overlap syndromes [^notfound].
- **Arthritis**: Common in MCTD and SLE [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary involvement**: ILD and PAH are major complications, especially in MCTD [^notfound].
- **Renal involvement**: Less common than in SLE but can occur [^113sNRh1].

---

## Prognostic implications

Prognosis varies by disease and organ involvement. In MCTD, pulmonary disease (ILD, PAH) is the **main driver of mortality** [^113jTM4L]. In SLE, anti-RNP associates with overlap features and a more benign renal course than anti-dsDNA or anti-Sm. In SSc, anti-RNP correlates with overlap features and a higher risk of myositis and ILD [^111ugTTE].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

There is **no specific therapy** for anti-RNP positivity; management is organ-based:

- **Glucocorticoids**: For arthritis, myositis, and mild systemic disease [^notfound].
- **Immunosuppressants**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil for moderate disease [^notfound].
- **Biologics**: Rituximab or belimumab for refractory disease [^notfound].
- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Vasodilators (e.g. bosentan, sildenafil) for PAH [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory testing and clinical guidelines

Routine screening for anti-RNP is not recommended; testing should be guided by clinical suspicion of MCTD or overlap syndromes. Positive results should be interpreted in clinical context, considering other autoantibodies and organ involvement [^112GZC8e].

---

Anti-RNP antibodies are a hallmark of MCTD and overlap syndromes, with clinical manifestations including Raynaud's, myositis, arthritis, and pulmonary disease. Testing should be **guided by clinical suspicion**, and management is organ-based with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants; prognosis depends on disease and organ involvement [^114naErH].

### Autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of mixed connective tissue disease [^111RMyK8]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Antibodies to U1-RNP are part of the clinical definition of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). These antibodies and other well-defined antibodies tend to arise together in affected patients. Although still speculative, hypotheses that link U1-RNP antibodies to the development of autoimmunity in MCTD and that associate U1-RNP antibodies with mechanisms of tissue injury in MCTD have emerged and are being tested. Salient features of these hypotheses include: (1) an antigen-driven response that is due to impaired clearance of potentially immunogenic self-antigens, (2) inadequate B- and T-cell tolerance to RNP autoantigens, and (3) immunogenic properties of the RNA component of targeted ribonucleoproteins. Further studies are needed to establish whether anti-RNP antibodies have prognostic importance that is relevant to practicing clinicians.

### Clinical significance of anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibody is analyte dependent: implications for laboratory reporting, interpretation, and interassay correlations [^113rjWDA]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context —

Antibodies to U1 ribonucleoprotein (U1RNP) were first described more than 50 years ago, and although clinically relevant for antinuclear antibody-associated connective tissue disease (ANA-CTD), test results are challenging to interpret.

Objective —

To evaluate the impact of anti-U1RNP analyte diversity in the assessment of patients at risk for ANA-CTD.

Design —

Two multiplex assays for U1RNP (Smith [Sm]/RNP and RNP68/A) were used to test serum specimens from consecutive patients (n = 498) under evaluation for CTD in a single academic center. Discrepant specimens were further tested for Sm/RNP antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the BioPlex multiplex assay. Data were evaluated for antibody positivity per analyte and their method of detection, correlations between analytes, and impact on clinical diagnoses through retrospective chart review.

Results —

Of the 498 patients tested, 47 (9.4%) were positive in the RNP68/A (BioPlex) and 15 (3.0%) were positive in the Sm/RNP (Theradiag) immunoassays. U1RNP-CTD, other ANA-CTD, and no ANA-CTD were diagnosed in 34% (16 of 47), 12.8% (6 of 47), and 53.2% (25 of 47) of the cases, respectively. The prevalence of antibody by method in patients with U1RNP-CTD was 100.0% (16 of 16), 85.7% (12 of 14), 81.5% (13 of 16), and 87.5% (14 of 16) for RNP68/A, Sm/RNP BioPlex, Sm/RNP Theradiag, and Sm/RNP Inova, respectively. For other ANA-CTD and no ANA-CTD, the highest prevalence was observed with RNP68/A; all others had comparable performance.

Conclusions —

In this study, the overall performance characteristics of Sm/RNP antibody assays were comparable; however, the RNP68/A immunoassay was very sensitive but less specific. In the absence of harmonization, reporting the type of U1RNP analyte in clinical testing may be useful in guiding interpretation and interassay correlations.

### Detection of anti-ribosome antibodies: a long story of lights and shadows [^111Z5gR7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Circulating autoantibodies against ribosomal proteins characterise a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Following the identification of three phosphorylated proteins as the main ribosomal autoantigens recognised by these autoantibodies, several studies have been carried out in the last decade to set up a reliable and sensitive method of detecting anti-ribosome autoantibodies and disclosing their possible clinical relevance in the diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms and signs of the disease. Although a number of clinical associations have been proposed, contrasting results have emerged from these investigations. This review analyses the methodological problems linked with the various techniques used to detect anti-ribosome antibodies and provides a critical update of the clinical associations described in lupus patients to date.

### The implication of anti-Ro60 with or without anti-Ro52 antibody in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^116viaKZ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-Ro60 and anti-Ro52 antibodies are among the most frequently detected autoantibodies and are used for diagnosis and classification for Sjögren's disease. Apart from Sjögren's disease, anti-Ro autoantibodies are most frequently associated with SLE. Even though Ro60 and Ro52 antigens are different ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes interacting with small cytoplasmic RNA at 60 kDa and 52 kDa, respectively, with separate cellular functions, the two autoantibodies are closely linked in presentation. While the utility of anti-Ro antibody testing in Sjögren's disease as a key defining autoantibody is well known, there remains a paucity of data regarding the significance of anti-Ro positivity in SLE.

Previous studies have reported on association of anti-Ro positivity with specific organ involvement, most notably with skin disease, arthritis and haematological manifestations. Some studies have suggested a severe phenotype in patients with SLE/Sjögren overlap but the observations were not consistent and tend to be cross-sectional. Our study aims to examine the clinical associations of anti-Ro positivity on longitudinal outcomes of SLE patients.

### Understanding and interpreting antinuclear antibody tests in systemic rheumatic diseases [^112GZC8e]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are valuable laboratory markers to screen for and support the diagnosis of various rheumatic diseases (known as ANA-associated rheumatic diseases). The importance of ANA testing has been reinforced by the inclusion of ANA positivity as an entry criterion in the 2019 systemic lupus erythematosus classification criteria. In addition, specific ANAs (such as antibodies to Sm, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), SSA/Ro60, U1RNP, topoisomerase I, centromere protein B (CENPB), RNA polymerase III and Jo1) are included in classification criteria for other rheumatic diseases. A number of techniques are available for detecting antibodies to a selection of clinically relevant antigens (such as indirect immunofluorescence and solid phase assays). In this Review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of these techniques, as well as the clinical relevance of the differences between the techniques, to provide guidance in understanding and interpreting ANA test results. Such understanding not only necessitates insight into the sensitivity and specificity of each assay, but also into the importance of the disease context and antibody level. We also highlight the value of titre-specific information (such as likelihood ratios).

### Antinuclear antibody testing-misunderstood or misbegotten? [^115Mm26w]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a diverse group of autoantibodies that recognize nuclear macromolecules and their complexes. ANAs represent key biomarkers in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases, most prominently systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ANA testing is commonly performed in the clinical setting. In addition, ANA testing is now used to assess eligibility for participation in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents for SLE. ANAs can be assayed by various techniques, with the fluorescent ANA assay often viewed as the gold standard. Whereas a positive ANA test represents a classification criterion for SLE, up to 20–30% of the healthy population, depending on the assay used, is positive for an ANA, complicating the use of this test for diagnosis or the detection of preclinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, ANAs might be expressed in SLE less commonly than often thought. This Perspectives article discusses important questions about the use of ANA testing in both the clinical and research settings.

### Prevalence and clinical significance of anti-SSA antibody in the Chinese health screening population [^112LvHoR]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Result

The prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies in the health screening population

The study screened 30 216 females and 33 829 males, with a mean age of 44.5 ± 12.5 years, for autoimmune antibodies. The prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies in this population was 1.7% (1091/64 045). As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies was significantly higher in females than in males within the same age group, with no significant difference in individuals aged 71 years or older. Among women, the prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies increased significantly with age, peaking at 3.4% during the ages of 51–70 years (Table 1). In contrast, among men, there were no significant differences among age groups, with anti-SSA antibodies being most common in individuals aged 71 years or older (1.9%).

Table 1:

the prevalence of anti-SSA antibodies in health screening population % (n)

The demographical and laboratory characteristics of anti-SSA antibody-positive individuals

The majority of anti-SSA antibody-positive individuals tested strong positive (54.7%), followed by weak positive (23.2%) and positive (22.1%). Among the 1091 anti-SSA antibody-positive individuals, 48.5% (529/1091) were positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA). Anti-SSA was associated with other ANAs including anti-SSB, AMA-M2, AMA, anti-RNP, anti-rRNP, ACA, anti-Scl70, anti-Jo-1, and anti-Sm, but not with dsDNA (Supplementary Table S1). The most common concurrent ANAs with anti-SSA was anti-SSB antibodies (12.7%), followed by AMA-M2 (7.1%; Supplementary Table S1). However, anti-SSA was not associated with anti-SMA and anti-CCP.

### The prevalence and clinical significance of anti-U1 RNA antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis [^1171i6uW]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the prevalence and clinical significance of anti-U1 RNA antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis. The presence of anti-U1 RNA antibodies was determined using immunoprecipitation in systemic sclerosis patients with anti-U1 RNP antibodies (n = 36), antitopoisomerase I antibodies (n = 20), or anticentromere antibodies (n = 20), mixed connective tissue disease patients (n = 23), systemic lupus erythematosus patients with anti-U1 RNP antibodies (n = 26), and normal controls (n = 20). Moreover, antigen specificities for anti-U1 RNP antibodies were examined in patients with systemic sclerosis by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-U1 RNA antibodies was detected in 22 of 36 systemic sclerosis patients (61%) with anti-U1 RNP antibodies, 14 of 23 patients (61%) with mixed connective tissue disease, and eight of 26 systemic lupus erythematosus patients (31%) with anti-U1 RNP antibodies. Anti-U1 RNA antibodies were not detected in other groups. As for systemic sclerosis patients, the frequencies of pulmonary fibrosis and reduced percentage diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide were significantly greater in patients with anti-U1 RNA antibodies than in those without (76%vs 18%, p < 0.005; 82%vs 27%, p < 0.005, respectively). Moreover, patients with anti-U1 RNA antibodies had significantly lower percentage diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and percentage vital capacity values than those without (51.9 ± 16.8 vs 79.4 ± 16.4, p < 0.01; 83.8 ± 21.4 vs 101.4 ± 12.9, p < 0.05, respectively). Regarding the antigen specificities of anti-U1 RNP antibodies in systemic sclerosis patients, the frequency of anti-70 kDa antibodies determined by immunoblotting was significantly higher in patients with anti-U1 RNA antibodies than in those without (77%vs 43%, p < 0.05). This finding was also confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-70 kDa antibodies (86%vs 43%, p < 0.05). These results indicate that anti-U1 RNA antibodies may be a serologic indicator for pulmonary fibrosis in systemic sclerosis patients with anti-U1 RNP antibodies.

### Anti-RNP immunity: implications for tissue injury and the pathogenesis of connective tissue disease [^117MVRKm]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Certain autoantibodies are characteristic of autoimmune disease manifestations and contribute to organ pathology. The presence of high-titer antibodies to U1-RNP are associated with mixed connective tissue disease, although these antibodies may also be present in systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. However, the role of antibodies to U1-RNP in the pathogenesis of connective tissue disease remains unclear. Data from recent experimental studies promote the hypothesis that U1-RNP antibodies participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses, implicating them in the pathogenesis of connective tissue disease.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults [^115e7DXm]. Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, BSR 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that anti-Ro/La and anti-RNP antibodies are less-specific markers of SLE as they are also found in other autoimmune rheumatic disorders.

### Appropriateness in anti-nuclear antibody testing: from clinical request to strategic laboratory practice [^115SqYa4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

As a result of rapid changes in laboratory technology, clinical behaviour and patients' expectations, along with limited economic resources, there is a greater requirement for an appropriate use of autoantibody testing. We examine the various aspects and the most controversial points of the diagnostic procedure in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and make recommendations for the most efficient approach to autoantibody testing, based on selected publications and the relevant literature. Appropriateness is a complex task that can be achieved only by combining the efforts from the laboratory and the clinic, thereby using scientific knowledge, inter-disciplinary consultation and expert clinical investigation.

Anti-U11/12 RNP (RNPC-3) Antibodies

Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (RNP) are well-known targets of the autoimmune response in a number of connective tissue diseases, including SSc. The primary target of these autoantibodies is the protein component of the complex. They are directed towards both discontinuous and linear epitopes which are either contained in the protein sequence or are post-translationally modified. Some recognize individual RNPs (i.e. U1, U3) while others act directly against a complex of RNPs.

The minor spliceosome complex consists of several small nuclear RNAs and multiple protein structures. U11/U12 RNPs, a component of spliceosome found in low abundance in eukaryotic cells, catalyze pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA introns. Formation of the U12-type pre-spliceosome is initiated by association of the U11 and U12 snRNPs, which, in contrast to U1 and U2, bind as a stable preformed di-snRNP. U11 and U12 recognize the splice site and the branch site, respectively, in a cooperative manner.

Anti-U11/U12 RNP (namely anti-RNPC3) antibodies were first described in 1993 by Gilliam and Steitz. A study conducted at the University of Pittsburg in 2009 was the first to investigate the implication of these autoantibodies in clinical presentation of SSc. They reported the overall prevalence of anti-U11/U12 RNP autoantibodies at 3.2% and no association with other SSc-associated antibodies. The most significant difference encountered between U11/U12 RNP positive and negative patients was the prevalence of pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, and gastrointestinal (GI) involvement.

Furthermore, a recent North American study evaluated the association between anti-U11/U12 RNP antibodies and GI dysmotility and its severity. The data show a clear association between these autoantibodies and the presence of moderate to severe GI disease as well as esophageal dysmotility, alongside a high rate of ILD. This discovery indicates that anti-U11/U12 RNP antibody is a marker of great clinical importance in SSc.

### Anti-RNP positivity in primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with a more active disease and a more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement [^117WE5FD]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite having positive anti-RNP antibodies, all patients fulfilled criteria for pSS with authentic typical Sjögren's symptoms associated with typical features and no diagnosis of another CTD with a median follow-up of 5 years (IQR 1–15 years). A minority of patients fulfilled criteria for MCTD (n = 3, 14.3%), but none presented enough clinical and biological features to suggest an overlap with another CTD with a median follow-up of 5 years.

Overall, our results confirm that the presence of anti-RNP antibodies is associated with certain clinical associations. In patients with pSS, these results support the need for a specific monitoring of muscular and pulmonary involvement in case of anti-RNP positivity in patients with pSS.

### Clinical significance of serum levels of anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 antibodies in patients with dermatomyositis [^111BWebr]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Antinuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP-2) antibodies are dermatomyositis-specific antibodies that target NXP-2 involved in transcriptional regulation. However, their clinical significance and relationship with disease activity remain unclear. We performed a longitudinal examination on serum samples from three patients with dermatomyositis who tested positive for anti-NXP-2 antibodies. These serum samples were analyzed alongside clinical parameters, including disease activity, muscle enzyme levels, and treatment response. The levels of anti-NXP-2 antibodies and serum creatine kinase decreased with symptom improvement in all the cases. Anti-NXP-2 antibody levels showed a correlation with disease activity, suggesting their potential role as a marker of disease activity.

### Antibody predictors of mortality and lung function trends in myositis spectrum interstitial lung disease [^1155D5p6]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the rarity of individual ARS antibodies, most observational studies reporting outcomes by antibody have grouped anti-synthetases together. However, the findings are not necessarily generalizable across the anti-synthetase antibodies. In a previous study by Shi et al. a non-significant trend towards higher early mortality in anti-PL7 was observed, and an increased risk of pulmonary function deterioration was observed by Fujisawa et al. By contrast, Marie et al. grouped anti-PL7/PL12 together and found no difference in mortality compared with anti-Jo1. However, they did find ILD was more prevalent in anti-PL7/PL12- than in anti-Jo1–positive patients, was more likely to be symptomatic at diagnosis, had higher median HRCT (High-resolution computed tomography) fibrosis scores at diagnosis, and was less likely to undergo radiological resolution. Hervier et al. 's cluster analysis of clinical features of a group of 233 ASS patients in France, identified three phenotypic patterns: one highly specific to anti-Jo1 with diffuse anti-synthetase manifestations, a second cluster containing 96% of their anti-PL7/PL12 patients, with largely isolated ILD, and a third cluster comprising patients with anti-RNP or SLE overlap antibodies, with high frequencies of RP and cutaneous manifestations. This suggests anti-PL7+ and anti-PL12+ patients are similar to each other, yet distinct from anti-Jo1 patients. Overall, they found survival to be significantly lower in patients with anti-PL7/PL12 than with anti-Jo1 antibodies, on bivariate analysis, although statistical significance was lost on multivariate modelling. Our study did not detect any differences in primary or secondary outcomes or lung function trends over time in patients with anti-PL12+. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this could be related to insufficient sample size, anti-PL12 was our third-most-frequent antibody, and significant differences were detected in antibodies occurring at lower frequencies (i.e. antibodies to RNP, PL7 and Ku). Our results suggest that PL-7 and PL-12 may not be as similar as previously thought. There may be a phenotypic difference between them, with PL-7 potentially having a greater propensity towards fibrotic progression. However, our results are based on moderate numbers, and the findings would need to be confirmed in a separate set, ideally with larger numbers.

### ISHLT consensus document on lung transplantation in patients with connective tissue disease: part I: epidemiology, assessment of extrapulmonary conditions, candidate evaluation, selection criteria, and pathology statements [^11189yn8]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Mixed connective tissue disease — diagnostic features and transplant relevance: The definitive diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is often complicated because the characteristic overlapping features of SLE, SSc, RA, and IM, found in association with high titers of anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibody, tend to occur sequentially. The extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in patients with CTD relevant for LTx evaluation and selection are primarily associated with the dominant disease of the overlapping CTD.

### Clinical significance of antibodies to TS1-RNA in patients with mixed connective tissue disease [^115CKejr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the clinical significance of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies in patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).

Methods

Anti-TS1-RNA antibodies were detected by immunoprecipitation using 32P-UTP labeled TS1-RNA as the antigen source. In total, 104 patients with MCTD, 30 with Sjögren's syndrome, 30 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 25 with systemic sclerosis, 23 with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, and 10 with rheumatoid arthritis were examined. Specificity of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using HeLa cell extracts.

Results

The frequency of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies was 31.7% in patients with MCTD, significantly higher than in SLE (p < 0.05). In anti-TS1-RNA positive patients, the incidence of hypertension and proteinuria and the frequency of anti-Sm and anti-dsDNA antibodies associated with SLE were higher than those of anti-TS1-RNA negative patients. Clinical features of SS such as sicca complex, the serum level of IgA, and anti-SSA antibodies were also elevated. The frequency of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies was significantly higher in SLE patients with anti-U1-RNP antibodies (p < 0.01); however, anti-TS1-RNA positive sera did not precipitate the specific RNA including U1 RNA in immunoprecipitation using HeLa cell extracts. In longitudinal studies, the level of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies changed in parallel with disease activity.

Conclusion

We found that the level of anti-TS1-RNA antibodies was possibly correlated with the disease activity of lupus-like clinical features in patients with MCTD.

### Is It still "Idiopathic"? Features of autoimmunity in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113ta44i]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although Jones and colleagues found that the major subclasses remained unchanged compared with healthy control subjects, IgG3 concentrations (q = 0.0392) were elevated in subjects with IPAH. This is an interesting finding, as IgG3 concentrations and proportions of IgG3 in serum are identified as potential prognostic markers of B-cell dysfunction in people with a clinically isolated syndrome with immunopathogenesis that rapidly converts to multiple sclerosis. IgG3 is often one of the earliest subclasses to be elicited against protein antigens upon infection, so IgG3 concentrations might indicate an active antibody response, for example, IgG3 concentration elevation in response to a viral pathogen that triggers an immune response. Although infectious disease features and/or lymphopenia are not reported in this IPAH cohort, autoantibodies of ribonucleic protein (RNP) complex are found to be elevated. Anti-RNP antibodies bind and penetrate lymphocytes, which can cause impairment in lymphocyte function and may interfere with cellular immunity.

Autoantibodies are recognized as a component of classification criteria for CTD. By definition, IPAH does not meet criteria for CTD. The clinical differentiation of CTD-related PAH in patients with systemic sclerosis, mixed CTD and systemic lupus erythematosus and IPAH is important because of possible endpoint differences in treatment response, exercise capacity, oxygen requirements, dyspnea, quality of life, and, most important, survival. Jones and colleagues found that multiplexed autoantibodies were significantly raised in subjects with IPAH, and clustering demonstrated three distinct clusters: "high autoantibody", "low autoantibody", and a small "intermediate" cluster exhibiting high concentrations of RNP complex. The high-autoantibody cluster had worse hemodynamics for pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output but improved survival despite no significant differences in treatment. This is particularly interesting in the context of mixed CTD regardless of PAH, in which the presence of high titers of antibodies to U1RNP is believed to modify the expression of the CTD relevant to prognosis and treatment, but U1RNP can disappear during the course of the disease.

### Autoantibody status according to multiparametric assay accurately estimates connective tissue disease classification and identifies clinically relevant disease clusters [^114HFFss]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the constant increase in technologically advanced research, the diagnosis of systemic connective tissue diseases (CTDs) still represents an undeniable challenge, mainly due to their protean and overlapping clinical manifestations, especially at disease onset. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of patients with CTDs relies on the identification of compatible clinical features in the context of autoimmunity (ie, at least positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA)). In contrast, the identification of a specific CTD is guided by classification criteria that have been developed for research purposes and, although not directly applicable as diagnostic criteria, they include the most significant features of specific CTDs. This approach does not consider some peculiar aspects of CTDs, such as the wide overlap of multiple clinical features (eg, arthritis, skin rashes, Raynaud's phenomenon, etc). Additionally, the presence of non-specific features, in the absence of other peculiar clinical or serological elements, leads to the definition of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD), which is a very heterogeneous condition, including patients with virtually any feature attributable to CTDs.

Nonetheless, although these classification aspects are essential in clinical trials to achieve a minimum level of homogeneity, real-life approach mostly relies on the clinical features of patients, independent of the nosological classification of the CTD. For example, the treatment and follow-up of patients with cytopenia is overall equivalent in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome (SjS) or UCTD. The same applies to other common clinical aspects of multiple CTDs.

Assessment of circulating autoantibodies represents one of the earliest diagnostic procedures in patients with suspected CTD. It helps in the definition of the diagnosis, as some autoantibodies are rather specific for distinct CTDs, but can also provide very important information in terms of identification of subclinical features or prediction of future disease manifestations, especially for a subset of autoantibodies for which a strong association with clinical features is known (eg, anti-MDA5 and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease). The identification of specific autoantibodies can guide further diagnostic workup and tailored follow-up.

### New insights into the role of antinuclear antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112DeUmt]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) that form immune complexes that mediate pathogenesis by tissue deposition or cytokine induction. Some ANAs bind DNA or associated nucleosome proteins, whereas other ANAs bind protein components of complexes of RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Levels of anti-DNA antibodies can fluctuate widely, unlike those of anti-RBP antibodies, which tend to be stable. Because anti-DNA antibody levels can reflect disease activity, repeat testing is common; by contrast, a single anti-RBP antibody determination is thought to suffice for clinical purposes. Experience from clinical trials of novel therapies has provided a new perspective on ANA expression during disease, as many patients with SLE are ANA negative at screening despite previously testing positive. Because trial results suggest that patients who are ANA negative might not respond to certain agents, screening strategies now involve ANA and anti-DNA antibody testing to identify patients with so-called 'active, autoantibody-positive SLE'. Evidence suggests that ANA responses can decrease over time because of the natural history of disease or the effects of therapy. Together, these findings suggest that, during established disease, more regular serological testing could illuminate changes relevant to pathogenesis and disease status.

### Systemic sclerosis-specific antibodies: novel and classical biomarkers [^1137kSrV]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Given that the patients with SSc present an elevated risk of cancer when compared to the general population, Shah et al. recently sought to verify the existence of any correlation between anti-RNPC3 and cancer. The study determined that the presence of anti-U11/U12 RNP autoantibodies in a subset of patients with an increased risk of cancer at the time of the first clinical manifestations of SSc. These antibodies are specific to SSc and are not found in cancer patients without SSc. Consequently, a hypothesis of cancer-induced autoimmunity can be made as well as suggest a targeted malignancy screening at SSc onset.

Compared with other known autoantibodies such as anti-RNAP3 and ACA, it emerged that both patients with anti-RNAP3 and anti-U11/U12 RNP present a mean age of SSc onset above 50 years and a shorter time to presentation for clinical evaluation than other antibody subgroups. It is likely due to the aggressive phenotype associated with these two autoantibodies. Anti-U11/U12 RNP positive patients typically present with moderate cutaneous disease, are prone to severe restrictive lung disease at baseline (lower FVC and DLCO) and PAH, important GI involvement as well as severe Raynaud's phenomenon and history of myopathy.

In conclusion, search for anti-RNPC3 antibodies is important to consider, especially in ANA-positive patients with speckled pattern and negative for other SSc-specific antibodies, in order to improve the serological diagnosis and be proactive in regards of treatment.

### Clinically relevant cutoffs for anti-extractable nuclear antigen line immunoassays [^116HmgBj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) are a form of antinuclear antibody test in the diagnostic laboratory that plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases. The line immunoassay (LIA) is one of the most popular assays used to measure these autoantibodies. However, LIAs suffer from limited diagnostic specificity, and numerous attempts have been made to improve the cutoffs.

Objective —

To readjust LIA autoantibody cutoffs, using the clinical diagnoses of a large and heterogeneous group of patients.

Design —

During a 12-month period, 667 discrete patients received an LIA test that had adequate clinical records to determine a diagnosis. Autoantibodies on the Euroimmun LIA (anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, anti-dsDNA, anti-La, anti-mitochondrial antibodies, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-histone, anti-nucleosome, anti-ribosomal P, anti-centromere protein B, and anti-Scl70) were evaluated. Two laboratory physicians independently rated whether the LIA density for each autoantibody was consistent or not consistent with the diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each autoantibody and cutoffs were reestablished to maximize diagnostic specificities of 85% to 90%.

Results —

New cutoffs were proposed at the diagnostic specificities of 85% and 90%. Overall, there were similar rates of autoantibody detections, using the new cutoffs, compared to the manufacturer's defined cutoff of 10 units for each autoantibody.

Conclusions —

We have used a novel approach to redefining anti-ENA LIA cutoffs by using clinical diagnoses across a range of pathologic conditions. This ensures that results are clinically relevant to a general laboratory cohort and, when used as a characterizing assay after an initial anti-ENA screen, maximizes diagnostic specificity. Longitudinal evaluation of the new cutoffs is required after implementation to examine clinical impact.

### Speckled antinuclear antibodies in keratinocytes – what does it mean? [^1177TVLu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Epidermal in vivo nuclear staining is occasionally noted in the lupus band test (LBT) in patients with connective tissue diseases (CTD). The exact clinical significance of this finding remains unelucidated, especially in association with a positive LBT We have reviewed the clinical and serological characteristics of patients with in vivo-bound antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in keratinocytes.

Methods

Between 1990–1999 speckled IgG staining in keratinocyte nuclei was observed in 31 LBT specimens. We had detailed clinical and laboratory data for 22/31 patients. The present study comprises 22 patients with in vivo-bound ANA (8 cases with mixed CTD (MCTD), 10 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), one with undefined CTD and one clinically healthy mother of a child with neonatal lupus erythematosus), and 22 consecutive CTD patients (2 MCTD, 15 SLE, 5 SS) without in vivo-bound ANA. Antinuclear, anti-dsDNA and anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) antibodies were determined using indirect immunofluorescence and ELISA methods.

Results

A significant difference (p < 0.01) in anti-RNP antibodies between patients with and without in vivo-bound ANA was observed. Consequently, there was a strong association of in vivo-bound ANA and anti-RNP antibodies (p < 0.01). In SLE patients with in vivo-bound ANA the incidence of nephropathy was significantly lower (p < 0.01), regardless of LBT positivity. In SLE patients there were no differences in LBT positivity, anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement consumption between groups.

Conclusion

Our study implies that the presence of speckled ANA in keratinocytes in LBT may be useful in the diagnosis of MCTD and in the prognosis of renal involvement, especially in SLE patients.

### Characteristics and survival of anti-U1 RNP antibody-positive patients with connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114gja3E]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). This study aimed to investigate the clinical and hemodynamic characteristics and survival of anti-U1 RNP-positive patients with CTD-associated PAH, with a focus on systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated PAH.

Methods

We implemented a prospective database that included patients with CTD-associated PAH for whom there were clinical, autoantibody, and mortality data. We compared clinical and hemodynamic characteristics to anti-U1 RNP antibody status. We then assessed whether anti-U1 RNP antibodies could be a prognostic factor in CTD-associated PAH with a focus on SSc-associated PAH.

Results

We studied a total of 342 patients with CTD-associated PAH, of whom 36 (11%) were anti-U1 RNP antibody positive. Anti-U1 RNP-positive patients were younger and less functionally impaired than were anti-U1 RNP-negative patients in CTD- and SSc-associated PAH. Hemodynamic parameters were similar in anti-U1 RNP-positive and anti-U1 RNP-negative patients. In CTD-associated PAH, anti-U1 RNP positivity was associated with decreased mortality in univariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.18–0.65], P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, anti-U1 RNP positivity was also associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio 0.44 [95% confidence interval 0.20–0.97], P = 0.043) independently of age, sex, functional parameters, lung involvement, and hemodynamic parameters. Results were similar in SSc-associated PAH, although the association between anti-U1 RNP positivity and survival did not reach significance in univariable (hazard ratio 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.22–1.02], P = 0.055) and multivariable (hazard ratio 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.20–1.11], P = 0.085) analyses.

Conclusion

Anti-U1 RNP positivity was associated with distinct clinical characteristics and survival in CTD- and SSc-associated PAH. While hemodynamic parameters were similar in anti-U1 RNP-positive and anti-U1 RNP-negative patients, our results suggest that anti-U1 RNP positivity could be a factor protecting against mortality in CTD- and SSc-associated PAH.

### Serological intermolecular epitope spreading in a patient with primary Sjögren's syndrome [^11465jWp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

These observations support the accurate serological phenotyping of patients with SS. Whether there is clinical benefit to periodic monitoring of autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP remains to be decided in longitudinal studies. Although autoantibody titres may fluctuate longitudinally, it is rare for there to be the acquisition or loss of a particular autoantibody. It may not be unreasonable, however, to consider rechecking these Ro/La autoantibodies if there has been a clinical change; for example, if the patient has developed features of a secondary autoimmune disorder. In our department, rechecking of autoantibodies are variable, are clinician-dependent and may occur every 6–12 months at their regular follow-up, or only once at baseline.

In brief, we describe an interesting case of clinically stable SS despite molecular evolution. Given that serological manifestations including autoantibodies may precede the onset of clinical features and SS diagnosis by many years and appear in otherwise healthy individuals, it is reasonable for us to continue periodically monitoring the patient to check for the development of severe extraglandular manifestations. However, SS is a disease that generally sees clinical stability in longitudinal studies, providing some reassurance. Autoantibody profiles tend to also remain very stable and to our knowledge, we provide the first described instance of an SS patient longitudinally developing new autoantibodies to the Ro/La RNP complex. It is possible that we have captured the early stages of our patient's disease. Future studies are required to unearth the origins and mechanisms of autoantibodies and epitope spreading, as this will likely lead to insights into the immunopathogenesis of autoimmunity and possible targeted therapeutics.

Learning points

Autoantibodies are key by-products of failed immune tolerance in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
The serostatus (detected/not detected) of autoantibodies to ribonucleoproteins tend to remain stable longitudinally and yield prognostic clinical information.
Further research to unearth the origins and mechanisms of failed humoral tolerance and hence, the development of autoantibodies, will be instrumental in developing appropriate, targeted therapies in SS.

### Induction of autoantibodies during prolonged treatment with infliximab [^114en3t1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency and correlates of autoantibody formation in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with infliximab in a routine clinical setting.

Methods

All patients receiving at least 5 infusions of infliximab, and with anticipated continuation, were prospectively evaluated for the development of the following antibodies: antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Correlates with pharmacologic treatments, response to infliximab, and adverse events were assessed.

Results

Seventy-six percent of 42 patients receiving prolonged treatment with infliximab developed new autoantibodies, and these persisted in 57%. The most common new autoantibody was ANA in 45%, followed by anti-DNA in 33%, anti-Sm in 31%, and anti-RNP in 29%. New autoantibody formation was associated with both a greater number of infusions (p = 0.015) and a higher total dose of infliximab infused (p = 0.047). No other treatment, disease characteristic, or loss of efficacy to infliximab discriminated between those developing antibodies compared to those without new antibody formation. No patient developed clinical signs of a new connective tissue disease.

Conclusion

Autoantibody formation is seen commonly in patients receiving prolonged treatment with infliximab. Concomitant immunosuppressive treatments did not preclude the formation of antibodies. The clinical significance of antibody formation remains to be determined.

### Antibodies to histone in the pediatric population: a retrospective chart review [^11797W7n]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anti-histone antibodies were observed in a variety of diagnoses in the pediatric population, many of which are considered benign or not rheumatologic. Most frequently, anti-histone antibodies were present in patients without underlying autoimmunity, especially at weak titers. DILE was uncommon in this study with only two cases. Not surprisingly, the positive predictive value of the anti-histone antibody test for SLE did improve in the subpopulation that demonstrated other autoantibody production(antibodies to SSA, SSB, Sm, RNP, Chromatin, and dsDNA). Similar to the ANA test, positive results were present in significant numbers of patients without underlying autoimmunity and testing should be reserved for cases in which there is a high underlying clinical suspicion of autoimmune disease such as SLE. This further exemplifies that the diagnosis of rheumatologic disease requires more than abnormal auto-antibody testing.

Further research is still needed to investigate if there is any significance to the presence of anti-histone antibodies and clinical phenotype in JIA. Association with uveitis has been proposed previously, but other factors may also exist. The increasing availability and sharing of patient data within pediatric rheumatology might make this possible.

The overall results of this study show that the presence of anti-histone antibodies in the pediatric population alone are a poor predictor of any specific condition, especially at weakly positive titers.

### Measurement of antinuclear antibodies and their fine specificities: time for a change in strategy? [^112LDGJf]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The current strategy for antinuclear antibody (ANA) analysis involves screening for presence with a subsequent detailed analysis of their specificity. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and financial efficacy of this strategy between different commercial tests in a large cohort of unselected patients.

Methods

In all consecutive 1030 patients associations were defined between results from different ANA test systems and the pre-test probability for connective tissue disease (CTDs). Test systems were used for screening (ANA-IIF vs. CTD screen) and definition of their fine specificity (profile 3 line blot vs. CTD single analytes).

Results

Positive ANA-IIF and/or CTD screen results were found in 304 sera. Further analysis for ANA-specificity by profile 3 line blot and CTD single analytes showed 86 discrepant results of which more than a third are clinically relevant, with the CTD single analyte assay performing better than the line blot in supporting or confirming the presence of a CTD. Autoantigens present in one test but absent in the other were of minor practical use. The ANA screening and identification strategies currently employed are not cost-effective as 83% of tests were performed in order to find specific autoantibodies in patients without the fitting clinical signs or symptoms. This causes many unexpected positive results and subsequent confusion with regard to interpretation.

Conclusions

We advocate that some autoantigens should be excluded from the line blot and CTD assays and propose the use of a cost-effective and selective ANA specificity testing purely based on clinical guidance.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^114hpoEV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

What should be done?

So what should be done with a positive ANA test? Our answer would be exemplified by the answer a local inhabitant gave when asked directions from place A to B by a foreign tourist: "I wouldn't be leaving from here!" In other words, it would be best if the ANA test had not been done in the first place! We would suggest that a positive ANA test can safely be ignored unless there are other suggestive clinical signs, and simple laboratory tests (such as a raised ESR or cytopenias) that point towards a diagnosis of lupus or similar connective tissue disease, particularly if the ANA titer is less than 1:640. Given the high false positive rate of ANA tests, a positive test cannot be used as confirmatory evidence that the child with a swollen joint has JIA, rather than some other serious condition such as septic arthritis, leukemia, or hemophilia. Similarly, symptoms such as fatigue and aches and pains in a child should not be ascribed to SLE simply because of a positive ANA test. It is much more likely that such a child has an idiopathic pain syndrome such as fibromyalgia or hypermobility. A negative ANA test is more useful than a positive one, as it does, for all practical purposes, exclude the diagnosis of SLE in a child.

What is needed is a cost-effectiveness study to evaluate whether the ANA test should be replaced by testing initially for anti-dsDNA and anti-ENA (anti-Sm, RNP, SSA and SSB) antibodies. Until that study is done, we would recommend that non-rheumatologists only do an ANA test if there is a fairly high probability (perhaps a 10+% chance) that a child's symptoms could be due to SLE or MCTD. If the test is positive at a titer of > 1:160 then it would be appropriate to order antibodies to dsDNA and ENA, with lower titers being ignored as well as complement levels.

We would strongly recommend that the ANA test is not ordered indiscriminately as part of "a rheumatologic work-up". This is not a new message. Other pediatric rheumatologists have pointed out in the literature that the ANA is a poor screening test and is being used inappropriately. It is our hope that a continued demonstration of these facts will gradually decrease its inappropriate use. The cost of inappropriate referrals, extra venipuncture, unnecessary expense, and increased parental and child anxiety is a considerable problem that pediatric rheumatologists see every day.

### Mixed connective tissue disease: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^113jTM4L]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Unmet needs

This is the first review providing an overview of currently available CPGs for MCTD. We did not identify specific CPGs addressing important issues in MCTD. Efficient and effective guidelines improve patient care and help medical practice and decision-making. Therefore, the ERN-ReCONNET MCTD group agrees on the general need for specific recommendations for MCTD. To prioritise what should be done in the matter of MCTD, three major objectives were proposed for CPGs future development:

CPGs on MCTD diagnosis (diagnostic criteria): Although different sets of clinical criteria have been proposed, there is no consensus about the most accurate one.MCTD often resembles several conditions and yet can easily be misdiagnosed by numerous rheumatic conditions including systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or so-called overlap syndromes. Without a standardised and acknowledged set of criteria, an agreement regarding MCTD existence and disease CPGs is not possible. Moreover, such classification criteria would facilitate the establishment of registers to collect a meaningful number of patients with MCTD to evaluate the course and prognosis. The classification criteria would also enable to evaluate the role of biomarkers, specifically the potential diagnostic/prognostic role of antibodies targeting U1 snRNP and/or in combination with the detection of autoantibodies that could earlier characterise more defined CTDs such as anti-SCL70, anti-CCP, anti-Jo1, antiSm, anti-ds-DNA-associated entities for defining early progression.
CPGs on MCTD initial and follow-up evaluations: At present, the initial approach, the type and the frequency of follow-up assessments of patients with MCTD are often handled very differently or performed according to the management of other rheumatic diseases. On one hand, MCTD is described as a potentially mild and often treatable condition. On the other hand, the disease is incurable and can be deleterious or even life-threatening with development of pulmonary, kidney, gastrointestinal and central nervous system involvement. Here, early and targeted intervention will definitively be associated with a better outcome. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. To improve management, it would certainly be helpful to develop and validate a (composite) disease activity score for MCTD that takes into account all relevant signs and symptoms. Agreement on the frequency of follow-up assessments during the course of disease on the basis of guidelines would facilitate the management of patients for clinicians.
CPGs on MCTD treatment: There is no agreement about the initial or long-term treatment of MCTD, especially on the usefulness of low-dose glucocorticoids, antimalaria and immunosuppressive therapies in various clinical situations. To date, there has been no randomised controlled trial in MCTD. Usually, patients with MCTD are treated based on similarities with other CTDs or based on organ-based management. Classification criteria would therefore also enable to perform clinical trials on therapeutic interventions. In addition, the management of comorbidities (such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, etc) and specific situations (such as pregnancy, family planning, etc) should be addressed. Overall, the ERN-ReCONNET MCTD group agrees on the need for evidence-based CPGs on MCTD treatment. Such guidelines undoubtedly require careful data collection from a larger number of patients and collaboration between experts and registers from different countries.

### Differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies according to titers and patterns in children [^113nzsFy]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in the clinical significance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) according to their titers and patterns in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases (AiD) in pediatric patients. Of the 2442 children who had undergone an ANA test, 473 (19.4%) were positive for ANA, of whom 33 (7.0%) were diagnosed with significant AiD. The positive predictive value (PPV) for significant AiD was considerably high on application of an ANA titer of ≥ 1:640, and the PPV of a dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern was significantly lower compared with those of speckled and homogenous patterns. The diagnostic value of ANA positivity for AiD is limited, and the clinical significance of the DFS pattern is relatively lower compared with that of other patterns, such as homogenous and speckled patterns, in children. It is necessary to approach the significance of ANA in children individually depending on titers and patterns.

### Anti-SSA Ro52 and anti-Ro60 autoantibodies: association with clinical phenotypes [^114FXA22]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Anti-SSA autoantibodies can be differentiated according to their antigenic target proteins as anti-Ro60 (60 kDa) or anti-Ro52 (52 kDa). Anti-SSA(Ro60) antibodies are clearly associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), but the clinical significance of anti-SSA(Ro52) antibodies remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the disease phenotype of patients with anti-Ro52 and/or anti-Ro60 antibodies.

Methods

A multicentre, cross-sectional study was carried out of positive anti-Ro52 and/or Ro60 antibodies patients followed at 10 Rheumatology centres from January 2018 until December 2021. Patients were categorised into 3 groups: group 1 (Ro52+/Ro60-); group 2 (Ro52-/Ro60+); group 3 (Ro52+/Ro60+). Antinuclear antibodies were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay and further screened for anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies. Demographicsand clinical data were compared between the 3 groups, by patients' medical chart review. Univariate analysis was performed and subsequently logistic regression was used to identify intergroup differences and calculate the odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

Results

We included 776 patients [female: 83.1%; median age: 59 (46–71) years]. Groups 1, 2, and 3 comprised 31.1%, 32.6%, and 36.3% of the patients, respectively. Anti-Ro52 antibody alone was more frequently associated with non-rheumatic diseases, older age, and men (p < 0.05). Among patients with CTD, the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is 3 and 2 times more prevalent in groups 2 and 3, respectively, than in group 1 [OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.60, 4.97), p < 0.001; OR 2.2 (95% CI 1.28, 3.86), p < 0.01]. In group 2, the diagnosis of undifferentiated CTD is more frequent than in the other groups. Group 1 was more frequently associated with inflammatory myositis than group 2 [OR 0.09 (95% CI 0.01, 0.33), p < 0.001] or group 3 [OR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01, 0.29), p < 0.001]. Group 1 was also more frequently associated with arthritis (p < 0.01), interstitial lung disease (p < 0.01), and myositis (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Anti-Ro52+ antibody alone is frequently found in patients with non-rheumatic diseases. In addition, anti-Ro52+ antibody is also prevalent in patients with CTD and associated with clinical phenotypes that are different from anti-Ro60+ antibody.

### Guidelines for the laboratory use of autoantibody tests in the diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune rheumatic diseases [^113RQWTQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The Italian Society of Laboratory Medicine Study Group on the Diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases has generated a series of guidelines for the laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases intendedfor the use of clinical pathologists and laboratory physicians. These guidelines are based on a systematic review of published works and expert panel discussion and consist of 13 recommendations for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded native DNA, and antinuclear specific antibodies. To improve analytic performances and help select the most appropriate test for specific autoantibodies, as well as provide education and guidance in the use of these tests, special emphasis is placed on laboratory methods.

### Autoantibodies in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE): can they Be used as biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of this disease? [^111iEgrG]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex immunological disease where both environmental factors and genetic predisposition lead to the dysregulation of important immune mechanisms, such as cytokine production, apoptotic debris clearance, and aberrant immune cell activation. The hallmark of this disease is the production of self-reactive antibodies that may target any organ or tissue of the human body and eventually form immune complexes (ICs) which may accumulate in any organ of the body. The accumulation of ICs is responsible for the organ failure observed in patients affected by this disease. SLE affects people worldwide, although each country exhibits its own incidence and prevalence. Moreover, the incidence and prevalence vary widely with sex, age, and ethnicity. Overall, both the incidence and prevalence of SLE are higher among women than men, with the former developing the disease earlier in life. Epidemiological studies showed that Afro-American people are at higher risk to develop this disease compared to Caucasian people, whereas the risk for Asian and Hispanic people is estimated to be in between. The etiology of SLE is complicated and both environmental and hereditary factors contribute to the development of the clinical manifestations. Genetic variants alone cannot explain the clinical phenotype of patients affected by this disease. Twins studies showed that the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is about 25%, but only 2% in dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are associated with many autoimmune diseases. It is not surprising that these genes represent a well-known risk factor to patients with SLE polymorphisms. Moreover, HLA polymorphisms are also associated with increased risk of autoantibody production. Almost all patients with SLE at some point in life develop antibodies to self-antigens. HLA haplotypes consisting of DRB1✱1501/DQB1✱0602 (DR2) are associated with the presence of anti-Sm antibodies, while HLA DRB1✱0301/DQB1✱0201 (DR3) haplotypes are associated with anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies. Individuals with a mixture of DR2/DR3 haplotypes have an increased prevalence of anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and anti-Sm antibodies. It was observed that among SLE patients with East-Asian ancestry, the production of antibodies such as anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and anti-cardiolipins (aCL) is associated with variants on the HLA-DRB1 locus, while the production of anti-Sm antibodies is associated with variant on the HLA-DPB1 locus. A common feature observed among patients with this disease consists in the aberrant activation of the immune response, leading to the loss of both the adaptive immune tolerance and to the dysregulation of the innate immune response. The fact that autoantibodies, in particular anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), can be detected years before the appearance of clinical symptoms has brought scientists to believe that the loss of tolerance to self is an important step in the development of SLE. Anti-double-strand DNA (dsDNA), anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, and anti-phospholipid antibodies can be found years before the clinical onset of the disease, whereas anti-Sm or anti-RNP antibodies can be found only few months before the appearance of the disease. The fact that many of these autoantibodies are found among individuals who will not develop this disease highly suggests for the presence of defects in the mechanisms controlling the peripheral expansion of autoreactive B cells. Additionally, the majority of pathogenic autoantibodies are both class-switched and somatically hypermutated immunoglobulin G (IgG), which are two phenomena that occur inside the germinal centers (GCs). In patients with SLE, B cell activation in ectopic GCs gives rise to autoreactive plasmablasts and plasma cells secreting high levels of autoantibodies.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^116WjkLc]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and other novel antigen testing?

Studies (see Table 1) estimate the sensitivity of ANA as 58–85% and specificity as 50–97%. ANA is commonly used as a screening antibody but because of its frequency and low specificity, should not be measured in the absence of clinical indicators.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in SD and various CTDs

Studies (see Table 2) estimate the sensitivity of ENA as 89–92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) in SD

None of the 'novel' autoantibodies out-perform anti-Ro antibody and are not recommended outside a research setting.

Recommendation

Do not measure ANA in the absence of clinical indicators of SD or other CTD (1, C) SOA 94.6%.

Use ANA as a screening antibody where there is a clinical suspicion of CTD (1, C) SOA 93.9%.

Measure ENA even if the ANA is negative if there is a high index of suspicion of SD (1, C) SOA 96.7%.

2a. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland (SG) ultrasound scanning (USS)?

Multiple studies have confirmed the utility of SG USS in the diagnosis of SD in both adults and children, although it may not differentiate between SS and sarcoid or other connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and does not form part of the classification criteria.

Recommendation

USS of the salivary glands can provide useful additional information to support either the presence of or lack of evidence for SD (1, A) SOA 95.2%.

USS does not currently replace either antibody testing or histological analysis in adult SD classification criteria (1, A) SOA 96.4%.

2b. In people suspected of SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of other imaging modalities?

Reviews of imaging modalities in SD have concluded that further studies are needed to establish the role of PET, CT and MRI. None of the imaging modalities are included in the most recent classification criteria.

### Review for the generalist: the antinuclear antibody test in children-when to use it and what to do with a positive titer [^1164ge1K]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of the indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by Friou in 1957, ordering an ANA appears to have become a reflexive response to the question "could this patient have a rheumatic disease?" What is the evidence that ordering such tests is of any value, and what should be done with a positive test?

### Can we predict if patients with SLE will require more than one cycle of rituximab? [^1161baaG]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Serological markers and overlapping diseases

Among the whole group of 131 patients at diagnosis, 80.2% had raised anti-dsDNA antibodies and 67.2% low C3 levels; 55.7% of patients had positive anti-Ro, 52.7% anti-RNP, 36.6% anti-Smith and 21.4% anti-La antibodies; 43.5% of patients had at least one overlapping disease, the most frequent being Sjögren's syndrome (n = 17, 13%), APS (n = 16, 12.2%), RA (n = 11, 8.4%) and hypothyroidism (n = 13, 9.9%).

No statistical differences were found between the two groups of patients in terms of their clinical and serological baseline markers or overlapping diseases (Table 3).

European Heart Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Blood tests and immunology — laboratory evaluation in pulmonary hypertension (PH): Blood tests are not useful in diagnosing PH but are required to identify the aetiology of some forms of PH and organ damage; routine biochemistry, haematology and thyroid function tests are required in all patients. Liver function tests may be abnormal because of high hepatic venous pressure, liver disease and/or endothelin receptor antagonist therapy, and hepatitis serology should be performed if clinical abnormalities are noted. Thyroid disease is common in PAH and may develop during the course of the disease and should always be considered in cases of abrupt deterioration. Serological testing is required to detect underlying connective tissue disease (CTD), hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Up to 40% of patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) have elevated antinuclear antibodies, usually in a low titer (1:80). It is important to look for evidence of systemic sclerosis (SSc); limited scleroderma typically has antinuclear antibodies including anti-centromere, dsDNA, anti-Ro, U3-RNP, B23, Th/To and U1-RNP.

### Mixed connective tissue disease: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^112CfW2k]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a complex overlap disease with features of different autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs) namely systemic sclerosis, poly/dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematous in patients with antibodies targeting the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle. In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research which was performed as part of the European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases project, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) or recommendations. Since no specific CPGs on MCTD were found, other CPGs developed for other CTDs were taken into consideration in order to discuss what can be applied to MCTD even if designed for other diseases. Three major objectives were proposed for the future development of CPGs: MCTD diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), MCTD initial and follow-up evaluations, MCTD treatment. Early diagnosis, epidemiological data, assessment of burden of disease and QOL aspects are among the unmet needs identified by patients.

### Mixed connective tissue disease: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^116M1Qb3]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) was initially described by Sharp et al.MCTD was first reported as a mild overlap disease with features of different autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs) namely systemic sclerosis, poly/dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematous in patients with antibodies targeting the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP).

Since the initial description, the definition as an independent clinical entity has been discussed, especially since patients with U1 snRNP may meet the classification criteria of other 'defined' CTDs in the course of time. Also, the initial description by Sharp of MCTD as benign disease without organ involvement and with prompt response to low-dose glucocorticoidshas not been confirmed in all studies. In addition, there are no generally accepted classification criteria. Nevertheless, some particularities, for example, pulmonary disease, point to an independent disease pattern.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are defined as 'systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about healthcare for specific clinical circumstances'and are made to optimise patient care. With regard to CTDs, CPGs should be based on medical high-level evidence and integrate as many themes as possible of each CTD, that is, diagnosis, patients management, treatment, prognosis and complications. In that matter, the European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ERN ReCONNET) launched a cooperative effort to review the existing CPGs on CTDs.

The objective of this review is to identify and evaluate the available CPGs providing specific evidencebased medicine (EBM) recommendations for MCTD.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^117PUFUZ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key questions identified in the scope

1. In people suspected of having SD, what is the diagnostic accuracy of ANA, ENA and other novel antigen testing?

A total of 518 publications were identified in the initial clinical evidence review for this section. Following initial screening 417 records were removed. This left 101 full-text articles of which a further 81 were excluded for a variety of reasons. The remaining 20 studies were included in the meta-analysis for this section.

Given the evolution of the classification criteria over time direct comparisons between publications can be difficult.

Six studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD, all but one included a wider population than suspected SD. See Table 1 for details. Five of these studies were retrospective cohort studies. The quality of the studies were graded from very low to moderate. Overall, these studies estimated the sensitivity of ANA as between 58% and 85% and the specificity as between 50% and 97%. The only study that confined itself to people with suspected SD (all had sicca) and scored moderate on GRADE found a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 50%. Median ages for subjects in these studies ranged from 39 to 60 years. No correlation was reported between age and ANA positivity.

Table 1.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ANA in SD and various CTDs

Three studies were identified exploring the diagnostic accuracy of ENA — although none was specific for SD. See Table 2 for details. The studies were graded as low quality due to risk of bias. Results showed that the estimated sensitivity for ENA ranged between 89% and 92%; with a specificity of 71–77%. In a very small number of cases individuals can be ANA negative but Ro positive.

Table 2.
Summary of evidence on diagnostic accuracy of ENA in SD

All three studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of ENA in patients with a variety of underlying CTD including SD. The ENA panels used varied between 6-, 7-, 9- and 14-test ENA panels, and also included one multiplex bead–based immunoassay (MPBI). One study used two different tests which between them included testing for dsDNA, U1RNP, Sm, Ro/SSA60 and 52, La/SSB, Scl-70, Pm-scl, Jo-1, CENP, PCNA, nucleosomes, histones, ribosomal-P and AMA-M2. Only 19 of the patients had clinical SD.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116uBpoV]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory biomarkers in arthritis: predictive and prognostic values

Rheumatoid factor occurs in 60 to 80% of established and 50 to 60% of early RA and, until now, is one of the most widely used biomarkers in RA diagnostics. RF is a relatively good biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of RA, although it does not correlate with disease activity, and is present in other systemic autoimmune as well as infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions.

Anti-RA 33, an IgG antibody directed against a nuclear protein antigen, seems to be identical to the A2 protein of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), was detected in approximately 30% of RA and in 27 to 45% of seronegative RA patients. Autoantibodies against the hnRNP A2 protein occurs in about 35% of RA patients and can be found also in other systemic autoimmune diseases, and in less than 5% of healthy individuals.

State of the art on CPGs

Absence of specific recommendations/guidelines for MCTD

The state of the art on CPGs in MCTD is presented in figure 1. A systematic Embase/MEDLINE search identifies 124 references to be screened and analysed by the ERN ReCONNET MCTD group. After screening and full-text analysis, five references were selected. After final evaluation, no reference was selected as specific CPG for MCTD.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the systematic literature search on mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) clinical practice guidelines.

Combined recommendations

Although there was no specific CPG on MCTD, the ERN-ReCONNET MCTD group selected five references that could be used in the context of MCTD. These references were common to other CTD such as systemic sclerosis or vasculitis and included recommendations for the testing of anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies, for screening pulmonary arterial hypertension, for the assessment of autoantibodies to cellular antigens referred to as antinuclear antibodies, for the management of skin ulcers, and for using cardiovascular MR.

### The clinical relevance of serum antinuclear antibodies in Japanese patients with systemic sclerosis [^111KPDeL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Anti-DNA topoisomerase I antibody (anti-topo I; formerly termed anti-Scl-70)and anticentromere antibody (ACA)are two representative ANA found in SSc. Other serum ANA associated with SSc include anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-RNA polymerases I, II and III (anti-RNAP), anti-Th/Toand anti-U3 RNP (fibrillarin)antibodies. It has been reported that there are several clinical associations with these ANA. ACA–and anti-Th/To, are associated with lSSc and with a low frequency of severe internal organ involvement, although some patients with these ANA develop isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In contrast, anti-topo I is generally associated with dSSc and a high frequency of pulmonary fibrosis. Anti-RNAP is frequently detected in patients with dSSc and is associated with a higher proportion of male patients, the onset of disease at a greater age and a high frequency of renal disease. Anti-U1 RNP is often found in overlap syndrome, especially mixed connective tissue disease, and is associated with isolated PAH and arthritis. Anti-U3 RNP is generally detected in patients with dSSc with a low frequency of joint and pulmonary involvement or with isolated PAH, skeletal muscle involvement and early disease onset. Approximately 5–10% of patients with SSc are likely to have no serum ANA. The detailed clinical presentation in this subgroup remains unclear.

It is well known that ethnic and genetic background affect frequencies of ANA and clinical features in patients with SSc. Most reports have described demographic and clinical features in Caucasian and/or black African patients with SSc and relatively small studies have been performed on Japanese patients with SSc. In this study, we attempted to identify a correlation between SSc-related ANA and clinical features and prognosis in 203 Japanese patients with SSc.

### Longitudinal fluctuation of antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens in systemic lupus erythematosus [^114LJKGn]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the appearance, persistence, and disappearance of anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA, Sm, U1-RNP, Ro/SSA, and La/SSB) and anti-native DNA (dsDNA) antibodies during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) followup.

Methods

One hundred and thirty patients who fulfilled American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE with at least 5 yearly anti-ENA and dsDNA tests between 1987–2002 were retrospectively selected. Four longitudinal antibody data patterns were considered for each antibody: always absent, always present, absent at diagnosis with positive seroconversion, and present at diagnosis with negative seroconversion.

Results

Antibodies to Ro/SSA were present in 47%, U1-RNP in 36%, DNA in 32%, Sm in 23%, and La/SSB in 7% of patients. Among patients ever positive for a given autoantibody, the frequency of the "always present" pattern was 52% for anti-Ro/SSA, 38% for U1-RNP, 17% for Sm, 11% for La/SSB, and 9% for DNA antibodies; the frequency of positive seroconversion was 56% for anti-La/SSB, 33% for DNA, 26% for Sm, 21% for U1-RNP, and 15% for Ro/SSA. Time to positive seroconversion varied from 1 to 8 years after diagnosis. Among patients with a positive test at diagnosis the frequency of those remaining positive between the 2nd and 4th year of followup decreased to 39–78%, depending upon autoantibody specificity; between the 5th and 10th years this rate was 20–75%. Antibody data pattern frequency differed significantly among autoantibody specificities except between anti-U1-RNP and Ro/SSA (p = 0.15) and between anti-DNA and Sm antibodies (p = 0.29).

Conclusion

The high frequency of longitudinal fluctuation in anti-ENA antibodies suggests that a periodic reappraisal may be appropriate in seronegative patients with a suspect diagnosis of SLE. The clinical significance of such fluctuation deserves future study.

### Anti-RNP positivity in primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with a more active disease and a more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement [^114AY1br]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe and compare the clinical and biological characteristics of subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) with and without anti-RNP antibodies.

Methods

Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR 2016 criteria for pSS and having anti-RNP antibodies, without other connective tissue disease diagnosed and no anti-dsDNA antibodies were retrieved from the database from our French National Reference Center. These patients were compared with all other patients with pSS with negative anti-Sm, anti-RNP and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

Results

Overall, 21 patients with pSS positive for anti-RNP antibodies and 446 negative for anti-RNP antibodies were retrieved. Anti-RNP-positive patients had a lower median age at onset of pSS symptoms (41.0 vs 50.0 years, p = 0.01), a higher median EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index at inclusion (8.0 vs 3.0, p < 0.01), more frequently constitutional symptoms (14.3% vs 0.01%, p < 0.01), myositis (19.0% vs 2.3%, p < 0.01) and pulmonary (19.0% vs 5.7%, p = 0.04) involvement. Moreover, anti-RNP-positive patients had higher median gammaglobulin levels (22.5 vs 13g/L, p < 0.01), more frequently anti-SSA antibodies (90.5% vs 67.1%, p = 0.03), but less frequent lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score ≥ 1 (66.7% vs 85.5%, p = 0.03). If the analysis is restricted to anti-SSA-positive patients, anti-RNP positivity is associated with the same clinicobiologic features except the pulmonary involvement.

Conclusion

Patients with pSS with anti-RNP antibodies displayed a more active systemic disease, with more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement, and increased gammaglobulin level, compared with anti-RNP-negative patients.

### Differences in dynamics of specific antinuclear antibodies and their susceptibility to B cell-targeting treatment in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^117RTs4n]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect virtually every organ system. SLE can be perceived as a prototypical autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies directed to nuclear antigens (antinuclear antibodies [ANAs]) are a preponderant feature. Among ANAs, anti–double‐stranded DNA (anti‐dsDNA) antibodies are highly associated with SLE. They are present in the majority of patients with SLE and can reflect disease activity. Anti‐Smith (anti‐Sm) is another ANA considered specific for SLE, although it is present less frequently than anti‐dsDNA. Other SLE‐associated antibodies are anti‐U1RNP, anti‐SS‐A (also called Ro), and anti‐SS‐B (also called La); these are also associated with other autoimmune diseases. Together with anti‐Sm, these are grouped as antibodies against RNA‐binding proteins (RBPs).

### Clinical phenotype associations with various types of anti-dsDNA antibodies in patients with recent onset of rheumatic symptoms. results from a multicentre observational study [^115CqAfj]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The current literature is mainly composed of investigations of patients with established SLE and other defined and classified diagnoses. Studies concerning the association of anti-dsDNA antibodies with clinical manifestations in unselected patients with early onset of rheumatic symptoms are scarce.

The main purpose of this study is to correlate the presence in serum of anti-dsDNA antibodies with individual clinical manifestations and laboratory variables. We intend to use an unbiased approach that mirrors an ordinary clinical setting, where the physician is challenged to make the right diagnosis in patients with newly developed rheumatic manifestations, based upon clinical signs and symptoms, with the support of various diagnostic procedures, including laboratory tests. This approach also allows us to perform a comparison between serum levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies obtained in different laboratories with different methods.

### Does mixed connective tissue disease exist? Yes [^114w791K]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

For patients who have combined features of rheumatoid arthritis, the limited cutaneous form of systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory myopathies, the concept of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) often helps to predict and diagnose organ problems and to educate the patient accordingly. With high titer IgG antibodies to U1 ribonucleoprotein (U1-snRNP), this concept is supported by a specific serologic marker, and autoantibodies to U1-snRNP and to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A2 display MCTD specificity with regard to the recognized epitopes. In addition, the association of MCTD with HLA-DR4 distinguishes it from systemic erythematosus lupus and systemic sclerosis, and speaks to its being a disease entity, rather than a mixture of yet undifferentiated collagen vascular diseases. The authors believe that the concept is useful in daily practice and accurate in the idea that MCTD constitutes a disease entity of its own.

### Anti-RNP positivity in primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with a more active disease and a more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement [^113NMwRr]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an auto-immune disease that causes lymphocytic infiltration and dysfunction of salivary and lacrimal glands resulting in dryness. In addition to dryness, fatigue and pain are the classical symptoms of the disease. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is characterised by a huge heterogeneity, besides patients suffering only from these invalidating but benign symptoms, at least one-third to two-third of the patients will develop systemic multiorgan involvement associated with an increased morbidity. Anti-SSA antibodies are the main antibodies in pSS. They are present in two-third of the patients, and among them, half have also anti-SSB antibodies. Patients with pSS may have number of other antibodies including rheumatoid factor (RF), anticyclic citrullinated proteins (CCP), anti-Ku, anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies. Associations between some of these antibodies and specific subsets of patients have been described. Anti-CCP antibodies have been shown to be associated with articular and pulmonary involvement and a risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-Ku antibodies are associated with muscular involvement.

Anti-RNP antibodies target proteins included in the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complex; their presence was described to be specific (specificity ranging from 84% to 100%) of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Among undifferentiated connective tissue diseases, Sharp et al first described MCTD as a connective tissue disease that combines anti-RNP antibodies with selective features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RA, polymyositis and systemic sclerosis. Other authors later described that anti-RNP antibodies may be present in defined CTD, and associated with particular clinical features, like scleroderma-like features in patients with SLE. In patients with pSS, whether these auto-antibodies are associated with a specific phenotype or outcome is unknown. In this study, we wanted to describe the clinical and biological characteristics of patients displaying pSS with anti-RNP antibodies.

### Anti-RNPC-3 antibody predicts poor prognosis in patients with interstitial lung disease associated to systemic sclerosis [^112K1dua]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyse the prevalence, the clinical characteristics, the overall survival and the event-free survival (EFS) of SSc patients who express anti-U11/U12 RNP (RNPC-3) antibodies.

Methods

A total of 447 SSc patients from Barcelona (n = 286) and Milan (n = 161) were selected. All samples were tested using a particle-based multi-analyte technology. We compared anti-RNPC-3 positive and negative patients. Epidemiological, clinical features and survival were analysed. End-stage lung disease (ESLD) was defined if the patient developed forced vital capacity < 50% of predicted, needed oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. EFS was defined as the period of time free of either ESLD or death.

Results

Nineteen of 447 (4.3%) patients had anti-RNPC-3 antibodies and interstitial lung disease (ILD) was more frequent (11, 57.9% vs 144, 33.6%, P = 0.030) in individuals with anti-RNPC-3 antibodies. More patients reached ESLD in the positive group (7, 36.8% vs 74, 17.3%, P = 0.006), and a higher use of non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive drugs was observed (11, 57.9% vs 130, 30.4%, P = 0.012). Anti-RNPC-3 positive patients had lower EFS, both in the total cohort (log-rank P = 0.001), as well as in patients with ILD (log-rank P = 0.002). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, diffuse cutaneous subtype, age at onset, the presence of ILD or pulmonary arterial hypertension and the expression of anti-RNPC-3 positivity or anti-topo I were independently associated with worse EFS.

Conclusion

The presence of anti-RNPC-3 was associated with higher frequency of ILD and either ESLD or death. These data suggest anti-RNPC-3 is an independent poor prognosis antibody in SSc, especially if ILD is also present.

Disease classification

When patients with SSc were classified into the two disease subsets, the frequency of dSSc was significantly higher in patients with anti-topo I (83%, P < 0·01) or anti-RNAP (100%, P < 0·01) compared with the total patients with SSc (45%, Table 1). In contrast, the percentage of patients with dSSc was significantly lower among the patients with ACA (5%) than in the total SSc patient group (P < 0·01). Patients with anti-U1 RNP and those with anti-Th/To tended to have lSSc (80% and 86%, respectively), while 80% of anti-U3 RNP-positive patients had dSSc. The frequency of dSSc was 30% in ANA-negative patients. Thus, in general, anti-topo I, anti-RNAP and anti-U3 RNP were associated with dSSc, while ACA-, anti-U1 RNP- and anti-Th/To-positive patients exhibited lSSc.

Modified Rodnan total skin thickness score

As skin thickening serves as an effective clinical tool for assessment of disease severity, direct correlation of each SSc-related ANA with the modified Rodnan TSS was assessed (Table 1). The modified Rodnan TSS of patients with anti-topo I (16·1 ± 10·1) or anti-RNAP (20·7 ± 10·6) was significantly higher than that of the total 203 patients with SSc (10·8 ± 9·4, P < 0·05 and P < 0·01, respectively). Patients with anti-U3 RNP had a tendency to have higher modified Rodnan TSS (16·6 ± 4·3). In contrast, the modified Rodnan TSS of ACA-positive patients (5·8 ± 5·7) was significantly lower than that of the total SSc population (P < 0·05). Patients with anti-U1 RNP, those with anti-Th/To and those without ANA showed lower TSS (5·4 ± 5·4, 7·1 ± 9·3 and 7·1 ± 6·7, respectively). These findings are generally in accordance with the findings that most of the patients with anti-topo I, anti-RNAP or anti-U3 RNP were classified as dSSc while patients with ACA, anti-U1 RNP or anti-Th/To were generally grouped into lSSc.

### IgA anti-β ₂ glycoprotein I antibodies: experience from a large center [^113a45oc]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

IgG and IgM antibodies directed at β2-glycoprotein I are included in the classification criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) while the IgA antibodies against β2-glycoprotein I (IgA aβ2GPI) are not. Conflicting data about the significance of IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestation can be found and more studies are necessary in order to define the diagnostic value of IgA aβ2GPI. In the present article, we investigated the possible role of IgA aβ2GPI as marker of APS.

Methods

A cohort of 314 patients with APS and systemic autoimmune disease was investigated for the presence of IgA aβ2GPI and its association with clinical manifestation of APS.

Results

Eighty-nine patients presented IgA aβ2GPI, 68 cases associated with others antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and in 21 cases being the only aPL present. In primary APS IgA aβ2GPI are highly coincidental with other aPL (92,2%) while most of the isolated IgA aβ2GPI were present in the SLE group (16/21). No association between IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestations: thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity was found, while a positive association between IgA aβ2GPI and the presence of anti-nDNA, anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, anti-SSB antibodies was encountered.

Conclusion

Our study does not show association between IgA aβ2GPI and APS manifestations and does not support the inclusion of IgA aβ2GPI as a classification criteria for APS.

### The clinical relevance of serum antinuclear antibodies in Japanese patients with systemic sclerosis [^112BVTyJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment

We compared the frequencies of SSc-related organ involvement in each SSc-related ANA-based subgroup (Table 1). Pitting scars were seen more frequently in patients with anti-topo I, anti-U1 RNP or anti-U3 RNP than in patients with ACA, anti-RNAP or anti-Th/To and those without ANA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Contracture of phalanges was seen frequently in all subgroups, although it was relatively higher in patients with anti-RNAP and lower in patients with ACA or anti-U1 RNP and those without ANA. Diffuse pigmentation was found more frequently in patients with anti-RNAP (92%) than in the total patients (43%, P < 0·05). Patients with anti-topo I or anti-U3 RNP tended to have this symptom, but it was infrequently found in ACA-positive, Th/To-positive and ANA-negative patients. These findings suggest that contracture of phalanges or diffuse pigmentation is generally related to the extent of skin sclerosis. However, the frequency of pitting scars was not necessarily associated with the severity of skin sclerosis, as the scars were infrequent in anti-RNAP-positive patients.

Most organ system involvement and laboratory findings are primarily associated with SSc-related ANA, rather than the disease subsets. Pulmonary fibrosis (84%, P < 0·01 vs. total patients) and decreased %VC (44%, P < 0·05 vs. total patients) were most common in patients with anti-topo I and most infrequent in patients with ACA (7%, P < 0·01 and 4%, P < 0·05 vs. total patients, respectively, Table 1), as previously shown. Decreased %DLco was commonly seen in patients with SSc, except for patients with anti-Th/To (29%) or anti-U3 RNP (20%). The frequency of isolated PAH was between 0 and 20% in all subgroups and no significant difference was found. Upper gastrointestinal involvement, which is generally represented by oesophageal dysfunction, occurred in more than 50% of patients in all subgroups, except for patients with anti-Th/To (29%). Severe heart and muscle involvement was infrequent and occurred in 20% or less in all subgroups without any significant association with specific ANA. Only three patients experienced renal crisis and all of them had anti-topo I.

Introduction: Anti-RNP antibodies are considered specific for mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Some authors described that anti-RNP antibodies may be present in defined rheumatic diseases (RD), and associated with particular clinical features, for example, like scleroderma-like features in patients (pts) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Objectives: According to a retrospective study, to describe clinical and immunological characteristics of children with RD with positive anti-RNP antibodies (antiRNP+), which were observed in our pediatric rheumatology center.

Methods: The study included all pts with RD, who had antiRNP+ during past 3 years. We tested pts with antiRNP+ on 4 different sets of criteria for MCTD: Kasukawa's, Alarcon-Segovia, Kahn and Sharp criteria.

### Specific antinuclear antibodies are associated with clinical features in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1127VPpK]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study associations between antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and signs/symptoms in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A consecutive cohort of 289 patients with SLE was included; 235 fulfilled ACR criteria for SLE and were further analysed. ANA profiles were determined by line immunoassay and by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae. An extensive list of signs/symptoms was evaluated.

Results

Five clusters of antibodies were defined by cluster analysis: 1-antibodies to SmB, SmD, RNP-A, RNP-C, and RNP-70k; 2-antibodies to Ro52, Ro60, and SSB; 3, 4, and 5-antibodies to ribosomal P, histones and dsDNA, respectively. Significant associations (p ≤ 0.01) were found between anti-RNP-70k, anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-C and Raynaud's phenomenon, between anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-70k and leucopenia, and between anti-RNP-A, anti-RNP-C and a lower prevalence of urine cellular casts. Anti-SSA, anti-SSB were associated with xerostomia, and anti-SSB with pericarditis. Antibodies to ribosomal P were associated with haemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, and alopecia. Patients with anti-dsDNA antibodies had a higher risk for cellular casts and a lower risk for photosensitivity. Antihistone antibodies were associated with arthritis.

Conclusions

In a large and consecutive cohort of patients with SLE, clusters of antibodies were identified. Previously reported associations of antibodies with symptoms were confirmed and new associations found.

### The implication of anti-Ro60 with or without anti-Ro52 antibody in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113Xq53H]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The presence of anti-Ro antibodies in SLE adds prognostic information for the clinicians. In addition to the possibility of an overlap syndrome, it is associated with higher disease activity in patients with SLE, with higher frequency of specific target organ associations such as cutaneous and haematological disease. Anti-Ro-positive SLE patients also have high frequency of proteinuria, which should prompt closer examination of renal histopathology. The study highlights the significance of examining autoantibody clustering, particularly in patients with overlap features, and to determine optimal treatment strategies.

### Anti-RNP positivity in primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with a more active disease and a more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement [^113G9XCw]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the first to focus on the specific characteristics of patients with defined pSS associated with anti-RNP antibodies. When comparing 21 patients with pSS with anti-RNP with 446 patients with pSS without anti-RNP antibodies, we found that the positivity of anti-RNP antibodies was associated with a more active systemic disease as assessed by ESSDAI, particularly with a higher prevalence of some specific organ involvements including myositis (10 times more) and pulmonary involvement (4 times more), and an increase in B cell biomarker levels

Of note, patients with anti-RNP antibodies were also more frequently anti-SSA positive, a feature that has previously been shown to be associated with a higher prevalence of systemic manifestations. However, in our study, when focusing only on patients with pSS with anti-SSA+ only, anti-RNP positivity was still associated with a more active disease and the same specific phenotype demonstrating that anti-RNP and not a higher frequency of anti-SSA was associated with this specific phenotype.

Whether the association between pSS with anti-RNP antibodies and a more active disease is supported by physiopathology or is linked to a differential response to treatments deserves further studies. Implication of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 has been suggested for patients with pSS, SLE and MCTD, suggesting that they could share a common pathway. Actually, nucleic acid contained in RNP can link to TLRs and stimulate their signalling. The involvement of TLR 8 and 9, which is observed in patients with MCTD, is still debated in patients with pSS.

Among our anti-RNP-positive patients, 28.6% had anti-Sm antibodies but none fulfilled criteria for SLE or developed an SLE with a median follow-up of 5 years. Anti-Sm antibodies target proteins that bind the small uridine-rich nuclear ribonucleic acids U1, U2, U4 and U5 in the cytoplasm to form snRNP in the nucleus, which explains why they are found in association with anti-RNP.

### Autoantibodies as putative biomarkers and triggers of cell dysfunctions in systemic sclerosis [^111ugTTE]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-U1 RNP antibodies target the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex and are not SSc-specific, as they are usually employed for the diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease. In a recent monocentric retrospective study, SSc patients positive for anti-U1 RNP were found to be more often of Afro-Caribbean origin and to frequently manifest overlaps with Sjögren's syndrome and/or systemic lupus erythematosus when compared with anti-U1 RNP negative SSc individuals. Moreover, these individuals not only commonly developed ILD, myopathy, and kidney involvement, but also had a worse overall survival. In another study on SSc patients with more than one disease-associated autoantibody type, Clark et al. demonstrated that double positivity significantly influences the clinical phenotype of patients. The authors found indeed that, when compared with single positive patients, those with anti-U1 RNP and ATA were younger, commonly showed the dcSSc subset, and had higher rates of overlap features, while those with anti-U1 RNP and ACA had a significantly higher prevalence of PAH and were more frequently affected by myositis. In two other studies, anti-U1 RNP+ SSc patients were also found to be characterized by a higher incidence of SRC or an increased risk of cancer within 2 years from diagnosis.

Anti-U3 RNP (antifibrillarin) antibodies are directed against a protein of the U3 snRNP complexes called fibrillarin and are detected in 5–14% of SSc patients, where their presence has been associated with the highest incidence of PAH and cardiac involvement. Anti-U3 RNP positivity also correlates with severe gastrointestinal involvement and poor prognosis. Although in early SSc, anti-U3 RNP+ patients are characterized by a higher hazard of death, their long-term survival was found to be better compared to anti-U3 RNP negative SSc patients.

Anti-U11/U12 RNP antibodies, which target the U11/U12 RNP complex consisting of several proteins involved in alternative mRNA splicing, have been recently demonstrated to associate with the presence of both gastrointestinal manifestations and ILD. Moreover, as these antibodies have been found to correlate with an augmented risk of cancer at SSc onset, the possibility of cancer-induced autoimmunity in this subset of patients has been suggested.

### Nailfold capillary scleroderma pattern may be associated with disease damage in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: important lessons from longitudinal follow-up [^116GxsFM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Anti-RNP antibodies were significantly more detected in patients with cSLE with a capillary scleroderma pattern, but Raynaud's phenomenon was not, also not during follow-up. A capillary scleroderma pattern has been linked to overlap disease or mixed CTD. In our study with up to 10 years of clinical follow-up after diagnosis, however, patients with cSLE with a capillary scleroderma pattern did not evolve into a scleroderma overlap disease. Clinical follow-up of these patients included routine medical history, physical examination, laboratory biomarkers and pulmonary function tests (minimal every 2–3 years), cardiac ultrasound (on indication) and pulmonary CT scan for signs of fibrosis (on indication). The mean follow-up was 7 years after diagnosis, one patient was lost to follow-up. Looking at the available anti-RNP titres (in only one-third) in our patients, these titres were quite low and this might subsequently mean that this subgroup of patients with cSLE is not at risk of overlap disease. Interestingly, our data do suggest that patients with cSLE with anti-RNP seem to be a more severe subgroup with more SLE-related disease damage, which was also stated by Dayal and Isenberg. On the other hand, a recent study in SSc showed that the presence of anti-RNP antibodies fits with a subgroup of SSc with a better prognostic outcome in terms of survival. Thus, the detection of anti-RNP antibodies might have a different prognostic meaning in these different systemic autoimmune diseases or scleroderma spectrum disorders. Most patients with anti-RNP antibodies in the scleroderma pattern group also had multiple, more SLE-specific, auto-antibodies detected, besides other clinical SLICC criteria. This shows that these patients are different than patients with UCTD with only anti-RNP and Raynaud symptoms.

### Antinuclear antibodies in systemic sclerosis: an update [^117C2uFN]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of skin and internal organs, vasculopathy, and dysregulation of immune system. A diagnostically important feature of immunological abnormalities in systemic sclerosis is the presence of circulating antinuclear antibodies, which may be detected in 90–95% of patients with either of the four main laboratory methods: immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunodiffusion, and immunoblotting. There are several antinuclear antibodies specific for systemic sclerosis. These include antibodies against topoisomerase (anti-TOPO I), kinetochore proteins (ACA), RNA polymerase enzyme (anti-RNAP III), ribonuclear proteins (anti-U11/U12 RNP, anti-U1 RNP, anti-U3 RNP) and nucleolar antigens (anti-Th/To, anti-NOR 90, anti-Ku, antiRuvBL1/2, and anti-PM/Scl). Autoantibodies specific for systemic sclerosis have been linked to distinct clinical features. Therefore, detecting a particular antibody type is important in predicting a possible organ involvement and prognosis and may have an impact on monitoring and treatment.

### Clinical utility of anti-signal recognition particle antibody in the differential diagnosis of myopathies [^114ZexNj]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Auto-antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP) are known to be specific to PM among rheumatic disorders, but the specificity in myopathic diseases remains unclear. The clinical utility of anti-SRP antibody in the differential diagnosis of myopathies has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether detection of anti-SRP antibody can discriminate of PM from muscular dystrophy (MD).

Methods

We report a patient with a childhood onset myopathy, in whom it was clinically difficult to make a differential diagnosis of PM or MD for 21 yrs, despite repeated muscle biopsies. Myositis-specific auto-antibodies to RNA-associated antigens were screened in this particular case as well as in 105 serum samples from various types of MD and 84 from PM patients using RNA immunoprecipitation. The MD and PM serum samples were obtained from different institutions. The presence of anti-SRP antibody was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation combined with immunodepletion of SRP from the antigen.

Results

Anti-SRP antibody was positive in the present patient, supporting the diagnosis of PM. Anti-SRP antibody was detected in seven (8.3%) patients with PM, but in none of the patients with MD. Myositis-specific auto-antibodies were not detected in any of the patients with MD.

Conclusion

Anti-SRP antibody is useful for discriminating PM from MD among patients with myopathies.

### An updated review of anti-Ro52 (TRIM21) antibodies impact in connective tissue diseases clinical management [^114bPqaB]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Anti-Ro52 (or anti-TRIM21) antibodies are part of the family of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, historically markers of Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Ro52 antibodies represent one the most frequently encountered autoantibodies in patients with connective tissue disease (primary Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies). Because of their lack of specificity and detection in patients with non-autoimmune disorders, the usefulness of anti-Ro52 testing in connective tissue diseases is still matter of debate among clinicians and immunologists. Autoantibodies are mainly diagnostic markers for autoimmune diseases but some of them can also be directly involved in the generation of tissue damage. Over the past decade several authors reported associations of anti-Ro52 antibodies with some clinical features - especially interstitial lung disease - and survival in patients with connective tissue diseases. There is also a growing evidence of the role of anti-Ro52 antibodies in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical associations of anti-Ro52 antibodies in the different connective tissue diseases and the recent advances on their potential role in the inflammatory response.

### Anti-ribosomal P protein IgG autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: diagnostic performance and clinical profile [^113XNdmp]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We found that Rib-P positivity was not associated with previous neuropsychiatric features classifiable by the ACR criteria, and the presence of these autoantibodies did not have a predictive value for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the subsequent 3 years. Thus, these autoantibodies seem to be very specific for SLE, but their value for diagnosis of neuropsychiatric lupus seems to be limited, possibly because both anti-Rib-P positivity and neuropsychiatric symptoms are relatively rare. However, given the high specificity, the inclusion of these autoantibodies as part of the SLE classification criteria might be useful. To confirm this, further studies encompassing a larger and multi-ethnic population are needed. Besides its possible use in established SLE, it will be important to assess the performance of such a test in patients with early-stage disease to confirm whether the inclusion of anti-Rib-P testing can improve diagnostic accuracy for SLE.

We performed a multivariate analysis for anti-Sm and anti-dsDNA levels, which revealed some associations of these antibodies with features of the disease. Serositis and CRP levels were positively associated with higher anti-Sm levels. High CRP levels are usually associated with an ongoing infection in patients with SLE, although they have been also associated with serositis, independently of the existence of an infection. This is in line with our results, as we found that CRP levels were increased in patients with serositis (P = 0.047). However, the association between serositis and anti-Sm antibodies contradicts the results of a previous report from Wang and co-workers.

The multivariate analysis also showed anti-RNP levels to be independently associated with anti-Sm levels. Both anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies recognize complexes that contain small nuclear RNA species, and the occurrence of anti-Sm antibodies along with anti-RNP antibodies has been reported previously.

### Chondrodysplasia punctata and neonatal lupus in an infant with positive anti-RNP and negative anti-Ro / SSA and-La / SSB antibodies, a case report [^112n9j6a]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is a rare, often fatal disease that shares many clinical dysmorphologic features with the rare often non-lethal chondrodysplasia punctata due to maternal autoimmune disease. Characteristic findings of both conditions include mid-face hypoplasia, stippled epiphyses of the vertebrae and long bones, and growth failure. A growing association with anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies is emerging amongst patients with chondrodysplasia punctata due to maternal autoimmune disease and also neonatal lupus that have potential important screening implications. We present a unique case of chondrodysplasia punctata with neonatal lupus in the setting of positive anti-RNP antibodies and negative anti-Ro/SSA and -La/SSB antibodies born to a mother with mixed connective tissue disease and Raynaud's syndrome.

### High prevalence of myositis in a southeastern United States pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus cohort [^1144Vbe6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Our patients were less likely to have hematological involvement, which is in contrast to the associated anemia demonstrated by Font et al. Other associations demonstrated by Dayal et al. were alopecia, oral ulcers, erosive joint disease, and Sjögren syndrome; these were not demonstrated in our pediatric cohort.

In summary, in the state of Alabama, pediatric SLE myositis is statistically more prevalent than previously published values of adult SLE myositis. The positive association of myositis with anti-RNP antibodies (as a feature of MCTD) is consistent with the medical literature. The presence of both anti-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies further highlights the significant overlap SLE has with other autoimmune diseases such as MCTD and the challenges that come with appropriately classifying and treating these overlap patients. Clinically, myositis can serve as a warning sign for a potential SLE flare and a marker of the effectiveness of treatment. Awareness of myositis in SLE is important for disease management, and based on the current study, myositis, particularly in subtle forms (e.g. low level inflammation as noted by serum enzymes), may be much more common in SLE than previously noted.

### Clinical and histological findings associated with autoantibodies detected by RNA immunoprecipitation in inflammatory myopathies [^111Pd2vk]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

Of 207 adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, detection of autoantibodies by RNA immunoprecipitation showed that 99 patients (48%) were antibody-positive. We divided these 99 into five subgroups: anti-signal recognition particle (SRP), anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase, anti-Ku, anti-U1RNP, and anti-SSA/B. Younger age at onset, severe weakness, muscle atrophy, elevated creatine kinase, and necrosis in muscle fibers without inflammatory cell infiltration were found significantly more frequently among the patients with anti-SRP antibodies (n = 41) compared to the antibody-negative patients (n = 108). Autoantibody detection by RNA immunoprecipitation can provide useful information associated with clinical and histological findings.

### Clinical significance of autoantibodies in dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis [^111RGLiR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases, including dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis, have a heterogeneous clinical presentation and prognosis; moreover, their clinical features are often incomplete and overlap with other rheumatic disorders, which can make diagnosis and prognostic stratification challenging. Specific autoantibodies have been associated with certain clinical findings as well as prognostic implications, and many new associations have been made over the last decade. Although patient populations manifest considerable heterogeneity, autoantibodies can be used to help predict clinical features, prognosis, and response to therapy. In this review, the clinical and prognostic implications associated with disease-specific autoantibodies in dermatomyositis and scleroderma are summarized with an emphasis on how the clinician can use this information for patient care.

### Clinical and pathologic implications of extending the spectrum of maternal autoantibodies reactive with ribonucleoproteins associated with cutaneous and now cardiac neonatal lupus from SSA / Ro and SSB / La to U1RNP [^11188zYb]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

While the relationship between maternal connective tissue diseases and neonatal rashes was described in the 1960s and congenital heart block in the 1970s, the "culprit" antibody reactivity to the SSA/Ro-SSB/La ribonucleoprotein complex was not identified until the 1980s. However, studies have shown that approximately 10–15% of cases of congenital heart block are not exposed to anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La. Whether those cases represent a different disease entity or whether another antibody is associated has yet to be determined. Moreover, the cutaneous manifestations of neonatal lupus have also been identified in infants exposed only to anti-U1RNP antibodies. In this review, we describe what we believe to be the first case of congenital heart block exposed to maternal anti-U1RNP antibodies absent anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La. The clinical and pathologic characteristics of this fetus are compared to those typically seen associated with SSA/Ro and SSB/La. Current guidelines for fetal surveillance are reviewed and the potential impact conferred by this case is evaluated.

### The clinical relevance of anti-DFS70 autoantibodies [^117QHf2V]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite all the progress in the establishment of specific autoantibody assays, screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells for quality-oriented laboratory diagnosis of ANA associated rheumatic diseases (AARD) remains indispensable but is not without limitations. Recent data on the relevance of the dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern and anti-DFS70 antibodies disclosed novel possibilities to optimize the serological stepwise diagnostics of AARD. The DFS pattern on HEp-2 cells is well differentiated from the classic "homogeneous" ANA pattern associated with dsDNA antibodies. This is the most frequent pattern in high titer ANA-positive healthy persons. The most characteristic ANA specificity associated with DFS pattern is the anti-DFS70 antibody (synonym LEDGF antibody). The prevalence of anti-DFS70 antibodies in AARD patients is significantly lower compared with the prevalence in ANA-positive healthy persons. There is a negative association between anti-DFS70 antibodies and AARD, especially if no concomitant AARD-specific autoantibodies are found. Isolated anti-DFS70 antibodies are detectable in less than 1% of AARD but are detectable in 2–22% of healthy persons. In the presence of an isolated anti-DFS70 antibody, the posttest probability for AARD is reduced significantly. The significance of anti-DFS70 antibodies as a criterion that helps to exclude AARD is also confirmed by follow-up studies on anti-DFS70 antibodies of positive, healthy individuals, who did not develop any AARD during a 4 year observation period. Consequently, anti-DFS70 antibodies are valuable novel biomarkers for better interpretation of positive ANA in cases of negative AARD-associated autoantibodies and should be integrated in modified test algorithms to avoid unnecessary referrals and examinations of ANA-positive persons.

### Anti-RNP positivity in primary Sjögren's syndrome is associated with a more active disease and a more frequent muscular and pulmonary involvement [^1144jNpJ]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient selection

Patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR 2016 criteria for pSS without other CTD diagnosis and having anti-RNP antibodies, without anti-DNA antibodies were searched in the database from the French National Reference Center for pSS in Paris-Sud University. Patients fulfilling Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria for SLE (positive if ≥ 4) were excluded. We compared these patients with all patients with pSS from the Paris-Sud cohort with negative anti-Sm, anti-RNP and anti-DNA antibodies. Paris-Sud cohort is a prospectively collected database of all patients participating in multidisciplinary sessions to assess a suspicion of pSS since 2000 in the Rheumatology Department of Paris-Sud University Hospital. All patients gave their informed consent to their data collection.

### Autoantibodies against small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes and their clinical associations [^111qEyT7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Sera from patients suffering from systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) have been shown to contain reactivities to nuclear components. Autoantibodies specifically targeting nucleolar antigens are found most frequently in patients suffering from SSc or SSc overlap syndromes. We determined the prevalence and clinical significance of autoantibodies directed to nucleolar RNA-protein complexes, the so-called small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs). A total of 172 patient sera with antinucleolar antibodies were analysed by immunoprecipitation. From 100 of these patients clinical information was obtained by chart review. Autoantibodies directed to snoRNPs were detected not only in patients suffering from SSc and primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), but also in patients suffering from SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and myositis (PM/DM). Antibodies against box C/D small snoRNPs can be subdivided in antifibrillarin positive and antifibrillarin negative reactivity. Antifibrillarin-positive patient sera were associated with a poor prognosis in comparison with antifibrillarin negative (reactivity with U3 or U8 snoRNP only) patient sera. Anti-Th/To autoantibodies were associated with SSc, primary RP and SLE and were found predominantly in patients suffering from decreased co-diffusion and oesophagus motility and xerophthalmia. For the first time autoantibodies that recognize box H/ACA snoRNPs are described, identifying this class of snoRNPs as a novel autoantigenic activity. Taken together, our data show that antinucleolar patient sera directed to small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes are found frequently in other diseases than SSc and that categorization of diagnoses and clinical manifestations based on autoantibody profiles seems particularly informative in patient sera recognizing box C/D snoRNPs.

### The clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody test result [^112xNQSS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This retrospective study investigated the clinical utility of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test performed outside of the rheumatology setting. Prior studies have investigated the frequency of ANA positivity within the general population. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical utility of a positive ANA test result in a real-world setting by reviewing the final diagnoses of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for evaluation of a positive ANA test result.

Methods

We reviewed the records of patients presenting to the authors between July 2007 and July 2009. Patients were included in the evaluation if they were referred for a positive ANA test result. All relevant descriptive and laboratory data were collated, as were the initial reasons for ordering ANA testing and the ultimate diagnoses reached. Positive predictive values for a "positive ANA test result" were calculated for all antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic diseases and for lupus specifically.

Results

A total of 232 patients were referred for a positive ANA test result. The positive predictive value of a positive ANA test result in this cohort was 2.1% for lupus and 9.1% for any antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease. No antinuclear antibody-associated rheumatic disease was identified in patients with an ANA < 1:160. The most common reason for ordering ANA testing was widespread pain (54/232, 23.2%).

Conclusions

In this retrospective study, more than 90% of patients who were referred to a tertiary rheumatology clinic for a positive ANA test result had no evidence for an ANA-associated rheumatic disease. The poor predictive value of a positive ANA in this cohort was largely attributable to unnecessary testing in patients with low pretest probabilities for ANA-associated rheumatic disease.

### Neonatal lupus erythematosus in association with anti-RNP antibody: a case report [^115H7hpg]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a syndrome with the manifestation of dermatological, cardiac, hepatic, or hematological abnormalities. Thrombocytopenia has been documented infrequently in association with congenital heart block or lupus dermatitis in NLE. However, isolated neonatal thrombocytopenia may be the only manifestation of NLE. The strong association with maternal anti-SSA/Ro antibodies suggests a role for these antibodies in the pathogenesis of NLE. There are some data to suggest that anti-SSB/La and, rarely, anti-RNP antibodies play an important pathological role in some cases of NLE. The manifestation of anti-RNP-positive NLE was somewhat atypical. We report a case of anti-RNP-positive NLE with the manifestation of thrombocytopenia. Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, which were negative based on the use of immunodiffusion, did exhibit low titer when later tested by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA).

### Scleroderma-like capillaroscopic pattern in SLE is not a sign of overlap syndrome in both adults and children [^115Aafua]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently published reports by et al also revealed the presence of a 'scleroderma-like' capillaroscopic pattern in patients with childhood-onset SLE without overlap with SSc and without anti-RNP antibody positivity. Out of 41 patients with SLE with disease onset < 18 years, a 'scleroderma-like' pattern was observed in 17.1% (7/41) of the cases without SSc-associated symptoms. Positivity of anti-RNP antibodies was not different in patients with and without a 'scleroderma-like' capillaroscopic pattern. In a longitudinal study of 53 patients with childhood-onset SLE, a similar frequency of 'scleroderma-like' pattern was reported (18.9%). However, there was no association of the capillary pattern with disease activity and RP, though anti-RNP antibodies were detected significantly more frequently in patients with 'scleroderma-like' changes. During a 5-year follow-up after disease onset, patients with a 'scleroderma-like' pattern did not develop SSc symptoms, but more than half of them presented with SLE-related irreversible disease damage that could not be predicted by SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) at diagnosis or during the follow-up. These observations indicate that scleroderma-like microangiopathy could be observed in both children and adults without the presence of overlap syndrome with SSc and without association with anti-RNP antibody.

To sum up, a 'scleroderma-like' pattern is a relatively non-specific morphological finding that could be found in different rheumatic diseases other than SSc and SSc-associated overlap syndromes (eg, SLE in adults and children, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis). Additionally, it could be observed in CLE as a local skin pathology without evidence of systemic vasculopathy. Interpretation of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of 'scleroderma-like' microangiopathy should consider the overall context. Further studies of the discriminating features of microangiopathy in SSc and SLE in terms of evolution of microvascular pathology and staging are warranted.

### Cluster analysis of autoantibodies in 852 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from a single center [^115xsQnV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Associations between autoantibodies and clinical features have been described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein, we aimed to define autoantibody clusters and their clinical correlations in a large cohort of patients with SLE.

Methods

We analyzed 852 patients with SLE who attended our clinic. Seven autoantibodies were selected for cluster analysis: anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anticardiolipin (aCL) immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM, lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anti-Ro, and anti-La. Two-step clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used.

Results

Five clusters were identified. A cluster consisted of patients with only anti-dsDNA antibodies, a cluster of anti-Sm and anti-RNP, a cluster of aCL IgG/M and LAC, and a cluster of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Analysis revealed 1 more cluster that consisted of patients who did not belong to any of the clusters formed by antibodies chosen for cluster analysis. Sm/RNP cluster had significantly higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension and Raynaud phenomenon. DsDNA cluster had the highest incidence of renal involvement. In the aCL/LAC cluster, there were significantly more patients with neuropsychiatric involvement, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. According to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics damage index, the highest frequency of damage was in the aCL/LAC cluster. Comparison of 10 and 20 years survival showed reduced survival in the aCL/LAC cluster.

Conclusion

This study supports the existence of autoantibody clusters with distinct clinical features in SLE and shows that forming clinical subsets according to autoantibody clusters may be useful in predicting the outcome of the disease. Autoantibody clusters in SLE may exhibit differences according to the clinical setting or population.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^116ZWAdL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) serological evaluation — Diagnosis of IPF mandates exclusion of other causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including CTD-ILD, and the guideline panel concluded that foregoing serological testing was not a reasonable alternative, leading to a motherhood statement to perform routine serological testing in all patients with newly identified ILD; although there was overwhelming agreement to perform serological testing, there was far less agreement about which serological tests to perform. The majority of panelists acknowledged routinely testing for CRP (C-reactive protein), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies (by immunofluorescence), rheumatoid factor, myositis panel, and anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide, while other detailed tests are performed on a case-by-case basis according to associated symptoms and signs, including muscle enzymes and antisynthetase antibodies with additional antibodies such as anti–MDA5, anti–Mi-2, anti–NXP2, anti–TIF1-γ, anti–SRP, anti–HMGCR, anti–SAE, anti–U1RNP, anti–PM/Scl75, anti–PM/Scl100, and anti–Ku. If systemic sclerosis is suspected, additional tests include anti–Scl-70/topoisomerase-1, anti–centromere, anti–RNA polymerase III, anti–U1RNP, anti–Th/To, anti–PMScl, U3 RNP (fibrillarin), and anti–Ku; if Sjögren syndrome is suspected, additional tests include anti–SSA/Ro and anti–SSB/La; and if vasculitis is suspected, an additional test includes anti– cytoplasmic antibodies, with a small minority of panelists including all detailed tests as an "ILD panel" at initial screening/baseline evaluation.

### Autoantibodies in biological agent naive patients with psoriatic arthritis [^113AzX4J]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) treatment may be associated with the production of autoantibodies, including lupus-specific autoantibodies.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence of autoantibodies in biological agent naive patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

Methods

94 consecutive, prospectively collected, biological agent naive patients with PsA at the University of Toronto PsA clinic underwent clinical and laboratory assessment. Disease activity was assessed by the number of actively inflamed joints, and the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) score. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), double stranded DNA (dsDNA), Ro, La, Smith, and RNP were tested. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to analyse the data.

Results

44/94 (47%) patients with PsA were ANA positive (≥ 1/40); 13/94 (14%) had a clinically significant titre of ≥ 1/80. Three per cent had dsDNA antibodies, 2% had RF and anti-Ro antibodies, 1% had anti-RNP antibodies, and none had anti-La or anti-Smith antibodies.

Conclusions

The background prevalence of ANA ≥ 1/80 in patients with PsA was 14%, with very few patients having specific lupus antibodies. This should serve as a baseline figure for the frequency of autoantibodies in biological agent naive patients with PsA for studies of the use of anti-TNFalpha agents.

### Mixed connective tissue disease-enigma variations? [^114LrzFt]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

In 1972, Sharp et al. described a new autoimmune rheumatic disease that they called MCTD, characterized by overlapping features of SSc, SLE, PM/DM, high levels of anti-U1snRNP and low steroid requirements with good prognosis. MCTD was proposed as a distinct disease. However, soon after the original description, questions about the existence of such a syndrome as well as disputes over the features initially described began to surface. The conundrum of whether MCTD is a distinct disease entity remains controversial. We undertook a literature review, focusing on the articles reporting new data about MCTD published in the last decade, to determine whether any new observations help to answer the conundrum of MCTD. After reviewing recent data, we question whether the term MCTD is appropriately retained, preferring to use the term undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic disease.

### Prediction of pulmonary complications and long-term survival in systemic sclerosis [^1149wpis]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess survival and incidence of organ-based complications in a large single-center cohort of unselected systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, and to explore predictors of survival and clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH).

Methods

The study cohort consisted of 398 consecutive SSc patients, followed up for up to 15 years. Cox proportional hazards analysis with demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics as predictor variables was used to develop prediction models for pulmonary complications and survival.

Results

The overall survival estimate at the end of followup was 57% among patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and 50% among patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) (P = 0.017). We found that greater age at disease onset, dcSSc, lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), lower hemoglobin levels, higher serum creatinine levels, and the presence of PH or cardiac involvement were independent predictors of worse survival. Over the entire followup period, 42% of dcSSc patients and 22% of lcSSc patients developed clinically significant PF (P < 0.001). The variables that predicted clinically significant PF development were dcSSc, greater age at onset, lower forced vital capacity and DLco, and the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibody, while the presence of anticentromere antibody was protective. There was no difference in cumulative incidence of PH between the 2 subsets-24% in lcSSc and 18% in dcSSc (P = 0.558). Incidence rates were 1–2% per year. The PH prediction model demonstrated that greater age at onset, increase in serum creatinine levels, lower DLco, and the presence of anti-RNA polymerase III or anti-U3 RNP antibodies were associated with increased risk of PH, while anti-topoisomerase I antibody positivity reduced the hazard.

Conclusion

Our study provides data on long-term outcome of SSc and the timing and frequency of major organ complications. The predictive models we present could be used as clinical tools for patient risk stratification and could facilitate cohort enrichment for event-driven studies.

### The registry of the German network for systemic scleroderma: frequency of disease subsets and patterns of organ involvement [^116u6gHj]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

SSc is characterized by a remarkable disease heterogeneity in organ involvement, severity and prognosis. The 1980 ACR criteria were established to classify patients with definite disease. In clinical practice, the classification of lcSSc vs dcSSc is nowadays widely used. However, a significant number of patients belongs to subgroups, which do not fit into this classification, e.g. who are presenting with symptoms of SSc occurring simultaneously with symptoms of other CTDs such as myositis, SS or lupus erythematodes. These patients have been classified as scleroderma overlap syndrome being characterized by typical autoantibodies, e.g. detectable anti-U1-RNP- or anti-PmScl-antibodies, although the usefulness of this category is controversial. Also, due to improved health care, patients present early in the disease course with symptoms suggestive but not yet sufficient to diagnose definite SSc (e.g. RP and scleroderma-specific ANA).

### Classifying and diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century [^111t2CMQ]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The same is true for anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. However, for anti-dsDNA there are also significant test issues. As compared with the traditional Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test and Farr assay or RIA, which are highly specific, many of the other test systems lack this specificity. For the EULAR/ACR classification criteria, this led to the definition that anti-dsDNA antibodies count only if from a test system with a demonstrated specificity of at least 90% against relevant disease controls.

For classification purposes, anti-Ro, anti-La and anti-U1RNP were not specific enough for SLE to include them, but they are useful for diagnostic purposes and routine tests give reliable results. For anti-histone and anti-nucleosome/anti-chromatin antibodies, the proven specificities for SLE were likewise not high enough for classification, but these antibodies still support an SLE diagnosis, as do anti-C1q antibodies, which are more closely associated with LN. In contrast, antibodies to ribosomal P are relatively specific, but often associated with anti-dsDNA. The presence of multiple, non-related autoantibodies is an argument for the diagnosis of SLE. This concept was also evaluated for the EULAR/ACR criteria but could not be transformed to a single criterion that would not have been redundant with individual autoantibodies already included (i.e. anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA and aPL antibodies.

As false-positive syphilis serology, aPL antibodies have already been depicted in the 1982 ACR criteria, when the aPL concept had not yet been established. The 1997 revision already contained aCL antibodies and the lupus anticoagulant, and the SLICC criteria added anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. The latter three were retained for the EULAR/ACR criteria, but have a relatively low weight of 2, since they are the hallmark of APS, which in about half of the cases is a distinct entity (primary APS) independent of SLE. Importantly, there are two distinctions between the definitions for APS and SLE. In APS, two tests with a minimum time lapsed of 12 weeks are necessary in order to exclude short-term (IgM) antibodies following a vascular event or an infection. For the SLE classification, aPL antibodies, like all other criteria, need only be present once. On the other hand, IgA aPL antibodies, which as isolated antibodies play a minor role in APS and are therefore not an APS criterion, are common in SLE and therefore count for the SLE classification criteria.

### Systemic sclerosis-specific antibodies: novel and classical biomarkers [^117YRiYo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-Ro52 Antibodies

Antibodies to Ro52 are the most common autoantibodies in different systemic autoimmune diseases: they are originally described as directed towards one protein of the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex including Ro60 and HYRNAs, but recently, Ro52 has been identified as the E3 ubiquity ligase, member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins known as TRIM21.

Anti-Ro52/TRIM21 antibodies were found in 20–27% of SSc in different multicenter cohorts, representing the second most common autoantibody in SSc, overlapping with SSc-specific autoantibodies. Anti-Ro52 is known to be associated with anti-synthetase antibodies and frequently found in patients with IIM and ILD. However, the clinical associations of anti-Ro52 in SSc have not yet been elucidated. Various authors report a significant association between anti-Ro52 and ILD in different SSc cohorts. In an Australian study, anti-Ro52 antibodies are considered an independent prognostic factor for mortality in SSc (OR: 1.6), and a risk factor for PAH, independently from the occurrence of ILD.

Anti-PM/Scl Antibodies

The PM/Scl autoantigen is a macromolecular complex, recognized as the human exosome, involved in RNA degradation and processing. The main autoantigenic proteins were named PM/Scl-75 and PM/Scl-100, based on their apparent molecular weights, but other exosome proteins were also proven to be target of autoantigens. Antibodies against the PM/Scl complex are found in patients with SSc, PM, DM, and SSc/PM overlap syndrome.

Anti-PM/Scl antibodies show a nucleolar staining in IIF, but they can be identified by different immunoassays: the main clinical associations of anti-PM/Scl antibodies in SSc were observed irrespectively of the immunoassay used.

In a recent analysis of more than 7000 SSc patients from the international EUSTAR dataset, confirming previous studies, anti-PM/Scl were found in 4% of cases, but associated SSc-specific autoantibodies were also observed in half of them.

### Overlap syndrome in a 12-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus and anti-oj antibody-positive polymyositis: a case report [^117UL4Zd]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Overlap syndrome is defined as the coexistence of signs, symptoms, and immunological features of two or more connective tissue diseases that occur simultaneously, sequentially, or at different times in the same patient. Although this concept appears uncomplicated, this rare disease is difficult to diagnose because its genetics and pathogenesis are not completely understood. In the overlap syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is now treated as a well-defined entity with clearer diagnostic criteria.

Our case fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MCTD according to the Kasukawa diagnostic criteria. However, we still do not think the patient is a case of MCTD. The main reason is that, nowadays, MCTD is recognized as a distinct entity with unique clinical features, therapeutic response, and prognosis. MCTD is characterized by the concomitant occurrence of clinical symptoms of different rheumatic disorders without meeting the clear diagnostic criteria for these diseases. Our patient met the diagnostic criteria for both SLE and polymyositis. Besides the low positive anti-RNP titer (two-fold ratio related to negative values), the patient had strong anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, and myositis-specific antibodies, which are rare in MCTD. These results convinced us that the patient had overlap syndrome rather than MCTD.

### Autoantibodies in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE): can they Be used as biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of this disease? [^114tFkD3]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoantibodies to Systemic Components

The production of autoantibodies is a hallmark of SLE, and their production is directly linked to the tissue damage and organ failure observed in patients with this disease. The human adaptive immune system is able to produce antibodies to a nearly unrestricted number of antigens; therefore, every patient with this disease displays a unique signature of (auto)antibodies. Nonetheless, there are specific autoantibodies that recurrently found the serum and CSF of patients with this disease. The main autoantibodies found among patients with NPSLE are listed in the Table 3. Autoantibodies that specifically bind antigens inside the nucleus of the cells are the distinctive characteristic of SLE, although cytoplasmatic components can be also be targeted as well. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are a helpful biomarker for the detection of many autoimmune disorders, such as SLE and Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The ANAs are a heterogenic group of antibodies that recognize self-antigens within the nucleus of cells, such as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), histone proteins, dsDNA, DNA/histone complexes, various nuclear enzymes, and other proteins. It is well established that high ANAs are found healthy subjects, in a range between 20 and 30%; however, in autoimmune conditions, their titer is often found increased. High levels of ANAs are often observed among patients with NPSLE. The role of ANAs for the diagnosis of NPSLE was evaluated by several studies. Unfortunately, the detection of ANAs among patients during their first psychiatric episode was revealed to be unspecific for the diagnosis of this disease, mostly because of the false positive results among patients under certain pharmacological treatment. Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies are a subgroup of ANAs so called because they are acid non-histone macromolecules obtained from the saline soluble fraction of cell nuclei. Anti-ENA antibodies are a heterogenous group of antibodies that can target many different antigens, such as anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA/Ro, and anti-SSB/La. Anti-ENA antibodies are considered to be more sensitive than ANAs; indeed, anti-RNP antibodies can be detected at the dilution 1:10 6, whereas ANAs in the same sample are detected only at the dilution of 1:40. In addition, some anti-ENA antibodies can be detected outside the nucleus, making the term nuclear antigen a kind of misnomer. Around 50 to 60% of patients with NPSLE are positive for these antibodies. Since many patients with NPSLE are positive to anti-ENA antibodies, some researchers and physicians believe that these autoantibodies play a role in the immune dysregulation of this disease. Anti-Sm antibodies are directed against the protein core of snRNPs, while anti-RNP antibodies target the protein A and the protein C of the U1 snRNPs. Anti-Sm antibodies are detected among SLE patients in a percentage between 5 and 30% while anti-RNPs a detected in 25 and 47% of SLE patients. Whereas among patients with NPSLE anti-Sm and anti-RNP are detected in a range between 18 and 48% and 18 and 60%, respectively. The presence of Anti-Sm antibodies is associated with the breakdown of the BBB and acute confusional states, among patients with NPSLE. These two types of antibodies are almost always found together in patients with SLE, and in those few cases in which anti-Sm alone was initially detected, anti-RNP developed later during the course of the disease. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies recognize respectively the protein Ro and La. Ro and La proteins associate together and bind to Y RNA, which are small non-coding RNAs involved in the chromosomal DNA replication. Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are widely found among many autoimmune diseases, such as SLE and SS. In contrast, anti-SSB/La are typically found only in patients affected by SS, and if they are detected among patients with other autoimmune disorders, anti-SSB/La antibodies are always accompanied by anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Some studies associate the presence of anti-SSA/Ro, but not anti-SSB/La, antibodies with the development of NPSLE. It was showed that anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies are found between 36 and 64% and 8 and 34% of patients with SLE, respectively. Whereas among patients with NPSLE, anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies can be observed in a range between 36 and 86% and 14 and 32%, respectively. Autoantibodies to histones target the five major classes of histone proteins: H1, H2a, H2b, H3, and H4. They can be found in around 60% of patients with NPSLE. Although they do not associate with any neurological manifestation, these autoantibodies correlate with the activity of the disease. However, in some studies, it is reported that the presence of autoantibodies that specifically bind to H1 and H3 fractions correlates with the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Antibodies that specifically bind to dsDNA molecules are those that carry the most relevant diagnostic power and clinical application. These autoantibodies can be both IgM or IgG class; however, IgG class antibodies have a higher clinical relevance because they are more likely to include high-affinity subgroups with narrow cross reactivity. It was observed that high levels of arginine, lysine, and asparagine residues in complementarity-determining regions of IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies facilitate the binding with the negatively charged DNA molecules. A recent study confirmed that anti‐dsDNA antibodies of patients with SLE have a specific immunoglobulin variable region signature; thus, the proteomic sequencing of these regions could be a valid tool for the diagnosis and clinical follow-up of patients with SLE. The number of patients with SLE positive for of these antibodies ranges between 60 and 90%, while among patients with NPSLE, they can be observed in 81% of patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies' presence in patient's serum fluctuates with the course of the disease, and they are usually detected in more than 60% of patients with active disease, while they are regularly found in only 10–15% of patients with inactive disease. Furthermore, anti-dsDNA antibodies can be detected several years before the clinical onset of the disease. Interestingly, among patients with NPSLE, the presence of anti-dsDNA associates with poor performance of visuospatial skills, attention, and executive function. The term Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) indicates a heterogenous class of immunoglobulins that specifically target the epitopes of the negatively charged phospholipid binding proteins, cardiolipins, prothrombin, and β2-glycoprotein I. These antibodies are not specific for SLE, since they are found in other disorders of the immune system with the impairment of the coagulation process. The presence of LAC is strongly associated with stroke, transient ischemic attack, transverse myelitis, epilepsy, chorea, and dementia. These autoantibodies can be found in one quarter of patients with SLE. Among patients with NPSLE, aCL antibodies are commonly found in a range between 10 and 14.5% and are associated with development of headache, acute psychosis, cognitive impairment, high cortical dysfunction, and altered consciousness. High levels of aCL antibodies can be found both in the serum and CSF of patients affected by NPSLE. To understand whether aCL antibodies were generated in the CNS or they were entering in the CSF from the systemic circulation, Cordero and colleagues measured the Q-albumin index of patients with NPSLE with high levels of aCL antibodies. It was observed that in some patients, the Q-albumin index was abnormal, which is suggestive for the disruption of the BBB; therefore, the aCL antibodies were generated outside the CNS. However, in other patients, this index was normal, which suggested for the intrathecal production of these autoantibodies. This data suggests that both mechanisms can be responsible to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients affected by SLE. Autoantibodies that recognize the C-terminal sequence shared between the three acid ribosomal phosphoproteins P0, P1, and P2 can be found among patients with SLE. Anti-ribP antibodies can be found at high frequency among patients with SLE. Among patients with NPSLE, anti-ribP antibodies can be found in a range from 10 to 47% and strongly correlate with neuropsychiatric manifestation. Interestingly, Bonfa and colleagues have observed that 90% of SLE patients with psychosis possess these antibodies. Anti-ribP antibodies strongly associate with neuropsychiatric, skin manifestations and the juvenile onset of SLE. These autoantibodies have been found also in the CFS of patients affected by NPSLE, and the levels of these antibodies were significantly higher among patients with diffuse symptoms rather than patients with focal symptoms. In another study, it was observed an association between the presence of anti-ribP and anti-dsDNA antibodies in patients affected by lupus nephritis. Sun and colleagues have shown that anti-ribP antibodies concentration fluctuates according with disease activity. Other studies associate the presence of anti-ribP antibodies with psychosis and depression; however, it must be reported that there are other studies refuting this association. Nevertheless, to date, the anti-ribP antibodies are considered as the best biomarkers for the diagnosis of NPSLE.

### Antinuclear antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus in an international inception cohort [^1159nru1]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The spectrum of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) is changing to include both nuclear staining as well as cytoplasmic and mitotic cell patterns (CMPs) and accordingly a change is occurring in terminology to anticellular antibodies. This study examined the prevalence of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) anticellular antibody staining using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics inception cohort.

Methods

Anticellular antibodies were detected by IIF on HEp-2000 substrate using the baseline serum. Three serologic subsets were examined: ANA positive (presence of either nuclear or mixed nuclear/CMP staining), anticellular antibody negative (absence of any intracellular staining), and isolated CMP staining. The odds of being anticellular antibody negative versus ANA or isolated CMP positive was assessed by multivariable analysis.

Results

A total of 1,137 patients were included; 1,049 (92.3%) were ANA positive, 71 (6.2%) were anticellular antibody negative, and 17 (1.5%) had an isolated CMP. The isolated CMP-positive group did not differ from the ANA-positive or anticellular antibody-negative groups in clinical, demographic, or serologic features. Patients who were older (odds ratio [OR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.00, 1.04]), of white race/ethnicity (OR 3.53 [95% CI 1.77, 7.03]), or receiving high-dose glucocorticoids at or prior to enrollment (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.39, 4.12]) were more likely to be anticellular antibody negative. Patients on immunosuppressants (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.19, 0.64]) or with anti-SSA/Ro 60 (OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.23, 0.74]) or anti-U1 RNP (OR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20, 0.93]) were less likely to be anticellular antibody negative.

Conclusion

In newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus, 6.2% of patients were anticellular antibody negative, and 1.5% had an isolated CMP. The prevalence of anticellular antibody-negative systemic lupus erythematosus will likely decrease as emerging nomenclature guidelines recommend that non-nuclear patterns should also be reported as a positive ANA.

Anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies in pregnancy — Prospective studies show that ~10% of infants develop an NLE rash, 20% transient cytopenias, and 30% mild transient transaminitis, and these complications are short-lived and spontaneously resolve as maternal antibodies disappear. Complete (third-degree) heart block (CHB) occurs in ~2% of pregnancies of women with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies who have not had a prior infant with NLE, and in 13–18% of pregnancies of women with a prior affected infant. CHB rarely occurs after week 26, is irreversible, and approximately 20% of children with CHB die in utero or in the first year of life; more than half will need a pacemaker.

### Historical perspective on antinuclear antibody testing [^1144ZAj9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serum factors binding to cell nuclei were first described in the 1940s, and the antibodies responsible for the binding to self (autoantibodies) were discovered in the late 1950s. Routine standardized testing using a cell line (HEp-2) started in the 1980s and continues to evolve. In addition to the classic immunofluorescence assay (IFA), various immunochemical techniques have been developed for the measurement of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The complexity of ANA IFA pattern reading and the varying sensitivities, specificities, and overall clinical performance of the alternative methods have often generated controversies and sometimes even confusion among healthcare providers and laboratorians. A better understanding of the historical roots of ANA testing can aid in understanding these controversies and assist with selecting the best-performing methods. In this review, we present historic and contemporary ANA testing methods, highlighting the pros and cons of each. We also provide an overview of the current practice of ANA testing based on several recent large laboratory surveys. For optimal patient care, it is critical that clinicians and laboratorians using ANA testing understand the performance and limitations of the methods used by their institutions, as well as the meaning of the test results. Recently published surveys and standardization efforts initiated by several stakeholder scientific organizations will likely lead to new ANA diagnostic guidelines, to be followed by an improvement in testing practices, management, and outcomes for patients with autoimmune disorders.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to anti-Ro/La antibodies, CRA 2018 guidelines recommend to measure anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies prior to pregnancy or during the first trimester in women with SLE.

### Antibodies to components of extractable nuclear antigen… [^113sNRh1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Forty-four patients with antibodies to ribonuclease-sensitive extractable nuclear antigen, ribonuclease-resistant ENA, or both, are described. Most patients with antiribonucleoprotein antibodies have overlapping features of systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis, and have a low incidence of nephritis. Most patients with antibody solely to ribonuclease-insensitive ENA have SLE; these patients with SLE are typical of the general SLE population, except that they demonstrate an increased incidence of Raynaud phenomenon. Furthermore, it is shown that antibody to ENA may occur in other rheumatic and nonrheumatic diseases, and that not all patients who have a clinical overlap of SLE and PSS that is suggestive of mixed connective tissue disease have anti-RNP antibody.

### Don't test antinuclear antibodies (ANA) subserologies… [^117WDZbc]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Tests for ANA subserologies are usually negative if the ANA is negative. Exceptions include anti-Jo1, which can be positive in some forms of myositis, or occasionally, anti-SSA, in the setting of lupus or Sjögren syndrome. Broad testing of autoantibodies should be avoided; instead, the choice of autoantibodies should be guided by the specific disease under consideration.

### Mixed connective tissue disease… [^114naErH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — A controversy seems to have arisen over the nature of mixed connective tissue disease of Sharp. Some consider this to be a true entity that is characterized by a variable but yet defined clinical picture, speckled-pattern fluorescent antinuclear antibody, and the presence, in a high titer, of antibodies to a ribonucleoprotein that is saline extractable from nuclei. 1 Others point out that the individual clinical characteristics, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis and myositis, may all occur in systemic lupus erythematosus. This has led to the current controversy, and a recent editorial in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine has questioned whether MCTD is simply a subclass of SLE, with the milder clinical picture related to the presence of RNP-RNP antibodies, rather than a distinct entity. 2Most articles published on this subject have been written by internists and rheumatologists. As dermatologists, we have. Minkin W, Rabhan N.
