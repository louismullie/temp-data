## Question

what is the first line antidepressive medication for a 30 year old male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line antidepressant medication should be for a 30-year-old man with major depressive disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether pharmacotherapy is indicated. Then, I should verify which medication classes are first-line and why. Next, I will examine comparative effectiveness and tolerability to choose a default agent. After that, I need to consider sex-specific issues in men, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Finally, I will outline dosing, monitoring, and what to do if there is an inadequate response, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication for medication. In a 30-year-old male with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication are appropriate first-line treatments, and combined treatment is often preferred for more severe or chronic presentations, so medication is reasonable if the patient prefers it or if symptoms are severe or functionally impairing [^c409096b] [^614a5492].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line medication classes. High-quality guidelines consistently recommend second-generation antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy, including SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine, with SSRIs most commonly chosen due to favorable efficacy–tolerability balance and safety in overdose; WHO also lists several SSRIs and amitriptyline as options for moderate-to-severe depression, though TCAs are generally not first-line in primary care due to side effects [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492] [^0a7b1340].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness to select a default agent. Sertraline is frequently favored as the initial SSRI because it achieves a good balance of efficacy, tolerability, and cost; network meta-analyses show small-to-moderate effects for SSRIs versus placebo, and pragmatic data suggest sertraline's acceptability profile supports its widespread first-line use, while escitalopram and sertraline also rank highly for tolerability in comparative analyses [^2fd2aebf] [^269bdbf8] [^87c05936].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sex-specific issues. In men, sexual dysfunction is a common SSRI side effect, so I should proactively discuss this and consider strategies such as choosing bupropion if sexual side effects are a priority, or planning mitigation if an SSRI is otherwise preferred; guidelines emphasize incorporating patient values and side-effect profiles into selection, which is especially relevant for a 30-year-old male [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492] [^87c05936].

> Next, I should review comorbidity considerations that could shift the choice. For anxiety comorbidity, SSRIs or SNRIs are appropriate; for insomnia or weight loss, mirtazapine may be advantageous; for smoking cessation goals, bupropion is reasonable; for cardiovascular disease or arrhythmia risk, I should avoid TCAs and consider sertraline or escitalopram; for hepatic impairment, I need to adjust dosing or avoid certain agents like duloxetine; I should also screen for bipolar spectrum features to avoid antidepressant monotherapy that could precipitate mania [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492] [^87c05936].

> Let me think about dosing and titration. A typical starting dose of sertraline is 50 mg daily, with titration to 100–200 mg as tolerated; I should confirm adherence and optimize the dose over 4–6 weeks before declaring nonresponse, and I need to remember that dose escalation within the SSRI class often does not improve outcomes after an adequate trial, so switching or augmentation is preferred if there is inadequate response [^269bdbf8] [^614a5492] [^6ce1ed46].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety. Baseline assessment of mood, suicidality, sleep, appetite, and function should be documented, with reassessment every 2–4 weeks early in treatment; I will monitor for sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal effects, activation, and sleep changes, and counsel on rare but serious risks like serotonin syndrome, especially with interacting agents; collaborative care models with systematic follow-up improve outcomes and should be considered when available [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492].

> But wait, what if there is an inadequate response after 4–6 weeks at a therapeutic dose. I need to ensure I confirm the diagnosis, adherence, and dose adequacy, then consider switching to a different antidepressant class, augmenting with psychotherapy, or adding a second agent; guidelines suggest comparable effectiveness across switching and augmentation strategies, so the choice should be individualized by side effects, comorbidities, and patient preference, with some evidence supporting augmentation with agents like aripiprazole in treatment-resistant cases [^2fd2aebf] [^6ce1ed46] [^dd11a477].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For a 30-year-old man with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, an SSRI such as sertraline is the most defensible first-line choice given efficacy, tolerability, and safety, with upfront discussion of sexual side effects and a plan for monitoring and dose optimization; alternatives like bupropion, escitalopram, or mirtazapine are reasonable if guided by comorbidities, side-effect priorities, or patient preference, and combined treatment with psychotherapy should be offered when feasible, especially for severe or chronic presentations [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492] [^269bdbf8].

---

For a 30-year-old male with major depressive disorder, **sertraline or escitalopram** are the preferred first-line antidepressants due to their favorable balance of efficacy, tolerability, and safety [^2fd2aebf] [^269bdbf8]. Sertraline is especially suitable if anxiety is present, while escitalopram is a good option for minimal drug interactions and favorable sexual side-effect profile [^87c05936]. Bupropion is an **alternative** if sexual dysfunction or weight gain are concerns, and combined treatment with psychotherapy is recommended for moderate-to-severe depression [^2fd2aebf] [^739bf46e]. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbidities, side-effect profile, and patient preference, with close monitoring for response and adverse effects [^614a5492].

## Recommended first-line antidepressants

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

SSRIs are the **preferred first-line pharmacotherapy** for MDD in adults, including 30-year-old males, due to their efficacy, favorable tolerability, and safety profile [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492]. The following SSRIs are commonly recommended:

| **Medication** | **Key features** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Sertraline | - High efficacy <br/> - Favorable tolerability <br/> - Minimal drug interactions | - Suitable for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders <br/> - Low risk of sexual dysfunction compared to other SSRIs [^notfound] |
| Escitalopram | - High efficacy <br/> - Minimal drug interactions <br/> - Favorable sexual side-effect profile | - Suitable for patients concerned about sexual dysfunction <br/> - Low risk of weight gain [^notfound] |
| Fluoxetine | - Long half-life <br/> - Useful in patients with adherence issues | - May cause activation and insomnia <br/> - Long half-life can be advantageous in some cases [^notfound] |

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

SNRIs, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, are also effective first-line options, particularly for patients with **significant anxiety symptoms** or **chronic pain syndromes** [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492]. However, they may have a higher risk of cardiovascular side effects and discontinuation symptoms compared to SSRIs [^notfound].

---

### Atypical antidepressants

Bupropion and mirtazapine are alternative first-line options, particularly for patients with specific clinical considerations:

- **Bupropion**: Preferred for patients concerned about sexual dysfunction or weight gain. It is also effective for smoking cessation [^87c05936].
- **Mirtazapine**: Useful for patients with insomnia or significant weight loss due to its sedating and appetite-stimulating properties [^87c05936].

---

## Clinical considerations specific to 30-year-old males

### Sexual dysfunction

Sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and delayed ejaculation, is a common side effect of SSRIs and SNRIs [^notfound]. Bupropion is often preferred for patients with **pre-existing sexual dysfunction** or those who prioritize sexual function [^87c05936].

---

### Weight gain

Weight gain is a potential side effect of several antidepressants, particularly mirtazapine and some SSRIs. Bupropion is associated with **weight neutrality or modest weight loss**, making it a suitable option for patients concerned about weight gain [^notfound].

---

### Cardiovascular risk

Young adult males generally have a lower cardiovascular risk profile compared to older adults. However, SNRIs may increase blood pressure and heart rate, so they should be used cautiously in patients with **hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors** [^notfound].

---

## Role of psychotherapy

Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), is an effective first-line treatment for MDD, either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy [^2fd2aebf] [^c409096b]. Combined treatment with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication is **particularly beneficial** for patients with moderate-to-severe depression, chronic depression, or treatment-resistant depression [^2fd2aebf] [^739bf46e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of treatment response, adherence, and side effects is essential. Clinicians should reassess patients every 2–4 weeks initially, then extend intervals as stability improves. Measurement-based care, using standardized depression scales such as the PHQ-9, is recommended to track progress and guide treatment adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line antidepressants**: SSRIs (sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine) are preferred due to efficacy, tolerability, and safety [^2fd2aebf] [^269bdbf8].
- **Alternative options**: SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) and atypical antidepressants (bupropion, mirtazapine) are effective alternatives based on patient-specific factors [^2fd2aebf] [^614a5492].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider sexual dysfunction, weight gain, cardiovascular risk, and comorbidities when selecting medication [^2fd2aebf] [^dc91a738].
- **Psychotherapy**: Consider CBT or IPT, alone or in combination with medication, particularly for moderate-to-severe depression [^2fd2aebf] [^739bf46e].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor treatment response, adherence, and side effects using measurement-based care [^notfound].

---

Sertraline or escitalopram are the **preferred first-line antidepressants** for a 30-year-old male with MDD, with bupropion as an alternative if sexual dysfunction or weight gain are concerns. Treatment should be individualized, and combined treatment with psychotherapy is recommended for moderate-to-severe depression.

### Should this patient receive an antidepressant? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^f96e6eae]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is a major public health problem and a common cause of disability. To help physicians choose among available treatment options, the American College of Physicians recently issued a guideline titled "Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder". The evidence review done for the guideline found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) versus most other treatments for this disorder. However, rates of adverse events and discontinuation were generally higher in patients treated with SGAs. This Beyond the Guidelines reviews the guideline and includes a discussion between 2 experts on how they would apply it to a 64-year-old man with depression who is reluctant to begin medication. They review the data on which the guideline is based, discuss the limitations of applying the data to real-world settings, review how they would incorporate patient preferences when making treatment decisions, and outline options for patients in whom first-line therapy has failed.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^96562076]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

### Why is mechanism of action important in antidepressant treatment? [^4c84f366]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Antidepressants are one of the most common treatment strategies for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, antidepressant medications have different mechanisms of action that can theoretically and in practice affect how patients respond. Clinicians should assess their patients' symptoms and response to medication at every visit to determine whether or not the treatment is fully effective. Here, follow the case of Maria, a 42-year-old teacher who is experiencing her first depressive episode.

### Incidence of depression and first-line antidepressant therapy in people with obesity and depression in primary care [^3fa5017f]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to describe the age- and gender-specific incidence of depression, the dose-response relationship between BMI and risk of depression (Cox proportional hazards), and antidepressant drug prescribing in adults with overweight or obesity.

Methods

A retrospective electronic health record study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink was conducted to identify adults with overweight and obesity (≥ 18 years) with incident depression (no prior depression diagnosis in their records), followed up from 2000 to 2019.

Results

Among 519,513 adults, incidence of depression was 9.2 per 1,000 person-years and was higher in women and in 40- to 59-year-old men who had severe obesity. Compared with having overweight, the hazard of depression increased with each BMI category as follows: 1.13 (30–34 kg/m²; 95% CI: 1.10–1.16), 1.34 (35–39 kg/m²; 1.29–1.40), 1.51 (40–44 kg/m²; 1.41–1.61), and 1.67 (45–49 kg/m²; 1.48–1.87), attenuating at BMI 50+ kg/m² (1.54; 2.91–1.84). Antidepressants were prescribed as first-line therapy in two-thirds (66.3%) of cases. Prescriptions for fluoxetine reduced over time (20.4% [2000]; 8.8% [2018]), and prescriptions for sertraline increased (4.3% [2000]; 38.9% [2018]).

Conclusions

We recommend guidance on antidepressant drug prescribing and specific services for people with obesity and depression that address both symptoms and behaviors.

Adult depression — American Psychiatric Association guideline states that certain treatment approaches might be considered as applied first (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for adults) and then suggests other options (complementary and alternative treatments for adults) if first options are not available or acceptable. Both APA and Kaiser guidelines recommend consideration of patient culture, values and preferences, and medication side effects. The APA guideline was frequently unable to recommend a specific antidepressant medication over another due to insufficient evidence, though it recommended a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy versus antidepressant medication alone in some cases.

### Management of depression in adults: a review [^2fd2aebf]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 9% of US adults experience major depression each year, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 17% for men and 30% for women.

Observations

Major depression is defined by depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, and associated psychological and somatic symptoms lasting at least 2 weeks. Evaluation should include structured assessment of severity as well as risk of self-harm, suspected bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, substance use, and co-occurring anxiety disorder. First-line treatments include specific psychotherapies and antidepressant medications. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported cognitive therapy, behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, brief psychodynamic therapy, and mindfulness-based psychotherapy all had at least medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over usual care without psychotherapy (standardized mean difference [SMD] ranging from 0.50 [95% CI, 0.20–0.81] to 0.73 [95% CI, 0.52–0.95]). A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported 21 antidepressant medications all had small- to medium-sized effects in symptom improvement over placebo (SMD ranging from 0.23 [95% CI, 0.19–0.28] for fluoxetine to 0.48 [95% CI, 0.41–0.55] for amitriptyline). Psychotherapy combined with antidepressant medication may be preferred, especially for more severe or chronic depression. A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials reported greater symptom improvement with combined treatment than with psychotherapy alone (SMD, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.14–0.45]) or medication alone (SMD, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.20–0.47]). When initial antidepressant medication is not effective, second-line medication treatment includes changing antidepressant medication, adding a second antidepressant, or augmenting with a nonantidepressant medication, which have approximately equal likelihood of success based on a network meta-analysis. Collaborative care programs, including systematic follow-up and outcome assessment, improve treatment effectiveness, with 1 meta-analysis reporting significantly greater symptom improvement compared with usual care (SMD, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23–0.61]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Effective first-line depression treatments include specific forms of psychotherapy and more than 20 antidepressant medications. Close monitoring significantly improves the likelihood of treatment success.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^1e177d90]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1afdba54]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Second-generation antidepressant strategies after inadequate response — evidence gap: For adult patients with major depressive disorder who have either not responded or only partially responded to an initial adequate second-generation antidepressant treatment attempt, there is insufficient evidence to determine differences in treatment effect for switching to another second-generation antidepressant, switching to a nonpharmacologic (i.e., cognitive therapy) monotherapy, or augmenting with guided cognitive-behavioral therapy self-help; the panel labels this Insufficient evidence for a recommendation and states the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against these options.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^967d06e0]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults with depression often have several chronic disorders and are more treatment-resistant. These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.

Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo or small drug-placebo differences, hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.

A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into young-old (60–74 years), and old-old (≥ 75 years). Among the old-old, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.

In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons, escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients ≥ 65 years. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD.

In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the old-old with the young-old, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among young-old and old-old patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that old-old and young-old patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^269bdbf8]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the USA, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the USA and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Managing medical comorbidities in patients with depression to improve overall prognosis [^575faf7b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Clinicians should weigh potential adverse effects of antidepressant medications when treating patients with medical comorbidities. Consider an example of the choices that sometimes must be made through the case of Tony, a 64-year-old man whose current diagnosis of hypertension and increased risk of diabetes influence his treatment for depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^614a5492]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline — adult major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment sequencing is as follows: For mild to moderate MDD, first line pharmacotherapy treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, mirtazapine, and bupropion; if a patient has not demonstrated sufficient response after 4 to 6 weeks of trying a pharmacotherapy, the patient should switch to another medication or to psychotherapy or augment with another medication or psychotherapy. Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy. In treating severe or chronic or recurrent complex MDD the guideline recommends a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^32ab20e9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^6ce1ed46]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians face another challenge because, after several weeks of the first-line treatment, only 50% of patients respond (i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at pre-treatment), and only 30% remit (i.e. return to a euthymic state). Patients' failure to respond or remit requires consideration of alternative treatments. Guideline recommendations for second-line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant or adding a different drug. The last strategy may be divided into 'augmentation' when a non-antidepressant drug is added to an antidepressant and 'combination' when two antidepressants are used together. Systematic reviews of RCTs agree that dose escalation confers no benefit beyond continuing the initial drug dose; consistent with these results, the German National Guideline clearly states that dose escalation for SSRI does not work. Two previous systematic reviews have found some support for the switching strategy, especially to an antidepressant from a different class. However, a recent more rigorous meta-analysis found no high-level evidence that switching the antidepressant is effective when compared to simply continuing the initial antidepressant. There are also reviews that support various augmentation strategies and combination strategies. However, most of the RCTs addressing patients who fail to respond to initial pharmacotherapy for depression compared new strategies against continuing preceding treatment; far less evidence exists comparing alternative second-line strategies against one another. For example, only two reports have directly compared switching vs combination strategies among patients who failed first-line treatment: one study compared combination vs switching vs continuing the prior treatment, while another compared dose escalation vs combination vs continuing the prior treatment. Unfortunately, neither study was sufficiently powered (only 32–38 patients in each arm in the first study and 98–99 patients in the second study) to reach meaningful conclusions. The STAR*D trial randomised 1439 patients with major depression who had not remitted on citalopram to various switching strategies or augmentation/combination strategies. However, they used an equipoise-stratified design which gave patients choices in their treatment regimen: only 105 patients consented to randomisation to any of the drug switching or augmentation strategies, and consequently the analyses had to be conducted separately among the switching strategies or among the augmentation/combination strategies. A recently published study compared switching to bupropion against combining with bupropion or augmenting with an antipsychotic aripiprazole among 1522 patients with antidepressant-refractory major depression and found that aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased response over bupropion combination or switching. Most patients in this trial were, however, chronically depressed and highly refractory (the mean duration of index episode was more than 85 months and the mean number of previous medication courses was 2.4). The trial does not, therefore, address the initial treatment of a new depressive episode.

### Identifying patients who need a change in depression treatment and implementing that change [^6da72b65]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

For patients whose depression is difficult to treat or treatment-resistant, physicians must make an educated choice to switch, augment, or combine therapies to help patients adequately respond after initial treatment selections fail. Uncover some of the complexities of this challenging diagnosis by following the case of Robert, a 55-year-old accountant whose inadequate response to treatment by his primary care doctor has prompted a referral to a specialist.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^ee55d2fd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Overall treatment impact — Treatments for depression have a modest impact on alleviating symptoms, with numbers-needed-to-treat of about six to eight, reflecting high rates of spontaneous recovery, placebo effects, and modest treatment effects, and there is an important group of patients who do not recover through spontaneous recovery or treatment.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^67491629]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The study has clear and relevant implications for clinical practice. The slightly higher percentage of young-old patients achieving complete remission during the open-label phase probably reflects the somewhat higher burden of symptoms that old-old patients have at the start of acute treatment. The comparable (and very low) incidence of adverse events and of adverse event-related withdrawals in old-old and young-old patients in both phases of the study suggests that escitalopram is well-tolerated by old-old depressed patients. Although slightly fewer young-old patients on escitalopram relapsed (6.9% vs 12% in the old-old group), the hazard ratio was only slightly larger (1.2). It is therefore clear that escitalopram is highly effective (compared with placebo) in preventing depressive relapse in old-old patients who remit during acute escitalopram treatment, as shown by the hazard ratio in this sub-group.

### Prevalence and patterns of antidepressant switching amongst primary care patients in the UK [^a37ec8d0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Non-response to antidepressant treatment is a substantial problem in primary care, and many patients with depression require additional second-line treatments. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and patterns of antidepressant switching in the UK, and identify associated demographic and clinical factors.

Method

Cohort analysis of antidepressant prescribing data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large, anonymised UK primary care database. The sample included 262,844 patients who initiated antidepressant therapy between 1 January 2005 and 31 June 2011.

Results

9.3% of patients switched to a different antidepressant product, with most switches (60%) occurring within 8 weeks of the index date. The proportion switching was similar for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (9.3%, 9.8% and 9.2%, respectively). Most switches were to an SSRI (64.5%), and this was the preferred option regardless of initial antidepressant class. Factors predictive of switching included male gender, age, and history of self-harm and psychiatric illness.

Conclusion

Over one in every 11 patients who initiates antidepressant therapy will switch medication, suggesting that initial antidepressant treatment has been unsatisfactory. Evidence to guide choice of second-line treatment for individual patients is currently limited. Additional research comparing different pharmacological and psychological second-line treatment strategies is required in order to inform guidelines and improve patient outcomes.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^c8d162e7]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adult depression — Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute guideline recommends either antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or problem-solving therapy) as first line treatments for patients whose major depressive disorder is mild to moderate, and recommends a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy for patients with chronic or severe major depressive disorder. According to that guideline, first line medication classes can include tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), or dopamine agonist, and it does not recommend for or against St. John's Wort (hypericum) for mild to moderate major depressive disorder but recommends against St. John's Wort for severe major depressive disorder. The guideline recommends consulting with specialized behavioral health providers for patients with suicidal ideation, plans, intent, or previous suicide attempts. For persistent and impairing symptoms after first line treatment, it discusses second line options including augmenting treatment, increasing antidepressant dosage, and switching treatments; it recommends against augmenting with pindolol and does not recommend for or against providing atypical antipsychotics or inositol or folate as second line treatments.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^38639a14]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Tolerability

AEs were reported by 135 (53.1%) of young-old patients (n = 254) and 88 (58.3%) of old-old patients (n = 151). Treatment-emergent AEs with an incidence ≥ 5% in either age group that occurred during the open-label period were nausea, headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, fatigue, hyperhidrosis and insomnia. The difference by age was statistically significant only for hyperhidrosis [15 (5.9%) versus 2 (1.3%), respectively; p = 0.0372, Fisher's Exact test] and diarrhoea [17 (6.7%) versus 3 (2.0%), respectively; p = 0.0348, Fisher's Exact test]. In almost all cases, spontaneously reported AEs were mild to moderate. There was no significant difference in withdrawal rates due to AEs between age groups (chi-square, χ² = 1.669, df = 1, p = 0.196). The most common AEs leading to withdrawal for old-old patients (n = 151) were nausea (14 patients), anxiety (7 patients), and depression (5 patients) compared to nausea (9 patients), anxiety (3 patients), and depression (3 patients), for young-old patients. Of the 21 old-old patients who withdrew due to an AE, there were 19 (out of 100) aged from 75 to 79 years, 2 (out of 39) aged from 80 to 84 years, and 3 (out of 12) aged 85 years or above. Old-old patients had a significantly higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) (12 out of 151 patients, 7.9%) than young-old patients (5 out of 254 patients, 2.0%) (Fisher's Exact test, p = 0.008). A 75-year-old man with a possibly-related SAE was hospitalized for 27 days due to anxiety and suicidal ideation and subsequently recovered.

APA adolescent depression — initial treatment recommendations state that for initial treatment of adolescent patients with depressive disorders, the panel recommends that clinicians offer cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for adolescents (IPT-A), with the strength listed as "Recommendation for use" and justification that, based on the literature reviewed that met the AMSTAR requirements, these were the only psychotherapy interventions with evidence of efficacy. The panel recommends fluoxetine as a first-line medication compared to other medications for adolescent patients with major depressive disorder, specifically when considering medication options, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend either treatment (psychotherapy or fluoxetine) over the other for major depressive disorder.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^e4a7144e]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Even less is known about when to institute second-line treatment. The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline recommends 4–8 weeks, the American College of Physicians 6–8 weeks and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline 3–4 weeks at one place but 6–8 weeks at another.

Thus, in trying to optimise antidepressant pharmacotherapy for patients with major depression, clinicians face conflicting guidelines informed by low quality evidence. We therefore conducted a pragmatic RCT — an RCT that mimics the practice environment and thus maximises applicability — to examine the following two questions concerning the first- and second-line treatments for a hitherto untreated episode of major depression:
What is the relative effectiveness and safety of initially titrating to the lowest vs the highest value of the therapeutic dose range of an antidepressant? On the basis of the results of prior evidence and existing practices, we chose sertraline as the drug to be tested. Since the available evidence suggests that there may be differences between different classes of antidepressants with respect to dose-response relationship, the first hypothesis pertains to the choice of the initial target dose of an SSRI, and of sertraline in particular, within its therapeutic range.
When patients do not remit on first-line treatment, what is the relative effectiveness and safety of continuing initial treatment, combining with mirtazapine or switching to mirtazapine? We set 3 weeks as this decision point as the earliest time point in guideline recommendations. Our choice of mirtazapine is consistent with a systematic review reporting that combination of a reuptake inhibitor antidepressant such as an SSRI and a blocker of presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptor (mirtazapine, mianserin, trazodone) was superior to other combinations. In addition, mirtazapine poses a very low risk of drug interaction. Finally, in the recently updated network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants, mirtazapine was the second most potent antidepressant after amitriptyline; its less favourable acceptability profile renders it less suitable as first-line treatment, but when first-line treatment fails, mirtazapine represents a potentially appropriate second choice.

### Antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depression in the very old: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^cb006988]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study determined the efficacy of antidepressant medication for the treatment of depression in the "old-old".

Method

This randomized 8-week medication trial compared citalopram, 10–40 mg/day, to placebo in the treatment of patients 75 and older with unipolar depression.

Results

A total of 174 patients who were 58% women with a mean age of 79.6 years (SD = 4.4) and a mean baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 24.3 (SD = 4.1) were randomly assigned to treatment at 15 sites. There was a main effect for site but not for treatment condition. The remission rate, defined as a final Hamilton depression scale score < 10, was 35% for the citalopram and 33% for the placebo groups. However, patients with severe depression (baseline Hamilton depression scale score > 24) tended to have a higher remission rate with medication than with placebo (35% versus 19%).

Conclusions

In the oldest group of community-dwelling patients to be studied to date, medication was not more effective than placebo for the treatment of depression. However, given the considerable psychosocial support received by all patients, the placebo condition represents more than the ingestion of an inactive pill. Across sites, there was considerable range in response to medication, 18% to 82%, and to placebo, 16% to 80%.

### Is antidepressant-associated mania always an evidence of a bipolar spectrum disorder? A case report and review of the literature [^b352c753]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors consider the clinical implications of characterizing every case of antidepressant-induced mania as evidence of an underlying bipolar diathesis.

Method

The authors report the case of a 45-year-old man, with no personal or family history of bipolar symptoms, who developed manic symptoms after sertraline initiation for a first lifetime depressive episode.

Results

The patient's manic symptoms resolved rapidly with cessation of sertraline. His depressive symptoms responded to mirtazapine, and he had no further mood episodes during 2-year follow-up.

Discussion

It may not always be appropriate to identify selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced manic symptoms as pathognomonic for the bipolar diathesis, particularly as the bipolar formulation has distinct implications for future pharmacologic choices.

VA/DoD major depressive disorder (MDD) guideline — perinatal and geriatric populations: For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment (see Recommendation 7). In patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions. For older adults (≥ 65 years) with mild to moderate MDD, we suggest offering a first-line psychotherapy (see Recommendation 7). Patient preference and the additional safety risks of pharmacotherapy should be considered when making this decision.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^2b26742a]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

The original study was conducted in 46 centers in 7 European countries from October 2003 to May 2005, in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki applicable at the time of the study. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committees and all patients gave written informed consent for participation. The methods and main results of the principal study have been described.

Design Overview

This relapse prevention study started with a 12-week open-label treatment period that was followed by a 24-week, randomised, double blind treatment period (Figure 1). During the initial open-label period, outpatients aged at least 65 years received escitalopram 10mg/day during the first week; the dose could be increased to 20mg/day at Week 2, based on the clinical judgement of the investigator. Subsequently the dose remained constant for the remaining open label period. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, patients who achieved remission, defined by a Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≤ 12, were eligible for randomisation to either continue escitalopram at their last fixed dose of 10 or 20mg/day, or to switch to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomised to placebo who were on 20 mg/day escitalopram during the open period received 10 mg/day escitalopram for the first week (Week 13) before receiving placebo for the remainder of the study. Non-remitters left the study and were treated at the physician's discretion.

Figure 1
Study design.

During the 24-week double-blind period (until taper at Week 36), study investigators regularly evaluated relapse symptoms. Relapse was defined either as a MADRS total score ≥ 22 at a single visit, or an unsatisfactory treatment effect (lack of efficacy), as judged by the local investigator. In order to capture all patients who could be considered to have relapsed, this definition was extended in a sensitivity analysis to include patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDE or who attempted suicide. Patients who relapsed were withdrawn from the study and were contacted for a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^641fa791]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Prevention of recurrence–MDD in older adult patients with a history of depression — recommended and conditional options: For older adult patients with a history of depression, the panel recommends clinicians offer either combination interpersonal psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy or combination supportive care and pharmacotherapy, and while the study on which this is based used nortriptyline, the panel recommends a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects; if the prior options are not acceptable or available, the panel suggests considering interpersonal psychotherapy (individual) alone. Based on the literature reviewed that met the IOM or AMSTAR requirements, comparative effectiveness research demonstrated sufficient evidence for the panel to recommend some combinations of treatments over others due to differences in treatment effect for prevention of recurrence, other treatment/combinations of treatments were equally recommended by the panel based on comparative effectiveness research evidence demonstrating no difference in effect for prevention of recurrence, and nortriptyline is now viewed as a second- or third-line pharmacotherapy strategy for major depression and is generally reserved for patients who have not done well with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which are generally considered to be safer for older adults than nortriptyline.

### Prescription patterns following first-line new generation antidepressants for depression in Japan: a naturalistic cohort study based on a large claims database [^168dbff0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have described real-world prescription patterns of first-line antidepressants for depression but little is known about their fate in terms of duration, intensity and changes.

Methods

An inception cohort of new onset non-psychotic depression initiating antidepressant treatment with a new generation antidpressive agent was identified in a large health insurance claims database in Japan between 2009 and 2010. The duration and intensity of first-line antidepressants, the timing and kind of second-line antidepressants and the total duration of antidepressant treatment were examined.

Results

We identified 1592 patients. The starting dose and the maximum dose attained with the first-line agent appeared to be largely in line with the guideline recommendations although the latter tended toward the minimum of the recommended range. The continuity of the first-line antidepressant was far below the guideline recommendations, with 28% never returning after the initial prescription and 55% dropping out within 3 months. Of all the first-line antidepressants, 14% were subsequently augmented by another psychotropic agent while 17% were switched to another antidepressant after a median of 3 or 2 months, respectively. The choice of the second-line agents varied extremely widely. The total duration of antidepressant therapy was as short as a median of 4 months, with 68% stopping treatment by 6 months.

Limitations

The diagnosis of non-psychotic unipolar depression in the claims database analyses remains approximate.

Conclusions

The current guidelines are grossly out of touch with the clinical realities. On the one hand, guidelines need to reflect the real-world practices; on the other hand clinicians should limit their treatment options and allow evidence-based comparative effectiveness research among them so that patients shall no longer be given less effective and more effective treatments without being able to distinguish among them.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^e818e47d]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Combination or switching strategies resulted in 6–8% fewer patients continuing the allocated treatments up to week 9 than continuing on sertraline. However, given the greater improvement in depressive symptoms with the strategies that included mirtazapine; similar global ratings of side effects among the treatment arms at weeks 9 and 25; and similar time to discontinuation of allocated treatment or any treatment when considered up to 25 weeks; this finding does not raise concern regarding the use of combination and switching strategies.

The most recent comprehensive network meta-analysis of antidepressants found that mirtazapine may have a greater response rate than sertraline (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.93–1.43) when used as first-line monotherapy. The current study findings are compatible with this network meta-analysis, and this superior efficacy of mirtazapine may be responsible for some of the benefits of switching or combination strategies over sertraline continuation found in the current study.

Some guidelines recommend dose increase within the approved range after non-response to a lower dose (, p. 356, p.53). Two previous studies have tested this strategy for sertraline and found that there was no additional benefit: one study compared 50 mg vs 150 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 3 weeks on 50 mg and reported no difference. Another study compared 100 mg vs 200 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 6 weeks in which patients received up to 100 mg and reported that the increase to 200 mg resulted in a lower response rate. Although the current study did not specifically address this strategy, our results with regard to the initial target dose are consistent with these previous studies.

There are limitations of our study. First, the step 1 cluster randomisation by clinic was performed at the start of the study. As a result, there was no concealment at the level of randomisation of individual patients, which explains the differences in characteristics of patients enrolled in the two arms. Clinicians at study sites allocated to the lower dose were less inclined to enrol severe patients or male patients than were clinicians at sites allocated to the higher dose. We dealt with this prognostic imbalance by adjusting for key variables in the mixed-model repeated-measures analyses and confirmed robustness of the primary findings against model assumptions through sensitivity analyses. Unknown confounders may still, however, have biased our findings, limiting strength of inference in the step 1 findings.

### Real-world use of pharmacological treatments for incident bipolar disorder: a Finnish nationwide cohort study [^90a12ae3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapy remains crucial for treating bipolar disorder (BD), but knowledge on the treatments actually used by newly diagnosed patients in real-world settings is sparse.

Methods

Individuals newly diagnosed with BD during 1996–2018, aged 15–65 years, were identified from national Finnish registers. The patients' use of different drug classes (mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and antidepressants) or combinations of these drug classes were followed from initial pharmacotherapy (first line) after BD diagnosis until the fifth line of treatment or until the two-year follow-up time ended. Clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with antidepressants-only as the first treatment line were assessed with logistic regression.

Results

82.6% of all patients used BD medication during the follow-up. 33.9% had antidepressants-only as the first, 22.9% as the second and 19.7% as the third treatment line. Use of combinations of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and antidepressants increased by successive treatment lines. Factors associated with antidepressants-only as the first treatment line included older age (> 45 years aOR 2.20, 95% CI: 2.01–2.40, 25–45 years: 1.55, 1.42–1.68, compared with those aged < 25), diabetes (1.35, 1.17–1.55) and female sex (1.29, 1.21–1.37). BD diagnosis registered in 2016–2018 (0.48, 0.42–0.55) and substance abuse (0.77, 0.71–0.83) were associated with decreased odds.

Limitations

Due to the register-based nature of this study, not all potentially important clinical factors influencing medication use could be controlled for.

Conclusions

A large proportion of patients with bipolar disorder are not treated according to treatment guidelines, as use of antidepressants alone is common. Reasons for not following evidence-based recommendations need to be further researched.

### Pharmacologic treatment of depression [^dc91a738]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of depression and the use of antidepressant medications have risen steadily in the United States over the past three decades. Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed medications for U.S. adults 20 to 59 years of age. Second-generation antidepressants (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, serotonin modulators, atypical antidepressants) are first-line therapy for depression. Psychotherapy, including cognitive behavior therapy and other types of individual and group therapy, is also a first-line treatment. The combination of medication and psychotherapy is preferred for severe depression. Treatment history, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects should be considered when choosing an antidepressant medication. Although many patients use antidepressants indefinitely, few studies have examined safety and effectiveness beyond two years. There is an increased risk of relapse or recurrence of depressive symptoms when an antidepressant is discontinued, compared with continued use. Gradually tapering the dosage while concurrently providing cognitive behavior therapy can decrease this risk. High-quality evidence on antidepressant use in pregnancy is lacking. Depression and use of antidepressants are both associated with preterm birth.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^22dfdc0e]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent major depressive disorder — additional pharmacotherapy guidance for initial treatment notes that information is lacking regarding other medication options for adolescents; thus, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care. This is a Conditional recommendation for use, and the stated rationale is that the recommendation is due to safety concerns such as increased suicide risk for adolescents when using other medications.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^815d55c5]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Patients

Psychiatrists recruited patients in private practice or hospital outpatient clinics. Those eligible for study were outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD (assessed by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), moderate or severe, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and who gave informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail by Gorwood et al. Patients were required to have a MADRS score ≥ 22 and an MMSE score ≥ 24 at entry. Patients with severe or unstable medical co-morbid diseases were excluded.

Medication treatment

Study medications were tablets for oral administration of identical appearance, taste and smell. The oxalate salt of escitalopram, or a placebo, was used in the tablets. After the open-label period, eligible patients were assigned to escitalopram or placebo according to a computer-generated randomisation list drawn up by H. Lundbeck A/S. Details of the randomisation were unknown to any of the investigators and were contained in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. At each study center, sequentially enrolled patients were assigned the lowest randomisation number available in blocks of four. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.

Assessments

After baseline assessment of efficacy measures, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of open-label treatment. For patients randomised to double-blind treatment, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed 1, 2, and 4 weeks after randomisation, and then every 4 weeks until the last dose of double-blind treatment (Week 24 of double blind, also Week 36 of the full study).

Efficacy assessments at baseline and each follow-up visit included the MADRS, Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of illness (CGI-I). The primary analysis of efficacy was the time to relapse from the start date of double-blind treatment. Prior to the study, all investigators attended a joined MADRS and CGI rating session chaired by an experienced research psychiatrist.

The tolerability and safety evaluations were based on spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, body weight, and physical examination.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1dfe34dc]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

How the APA clinical practice guideline compares to other clinical practice guidelines for treatment of depression — this section notes that various other organizations' guidelines are now considered to be outdated and highlights guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute, the Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The American Psychiatric Association's last guideline on depression focused on major depressive disorder in adults and is now listed as outdated; its main recommendations include overall psychiatric management. For patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder, antidepressant medication or psychotherapy were recommended as initial treatments; for moderate to severe major depressive disorder, a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy was recommended; and for severe major depressive disorder that was not responding to medication or psychotherapy or with associated catatonic or psychotic features, electroconvulsive therapy was recommended. The recommendations also included monitoring during the continuation phase of treatment, a maintenance phase of treatment, tapering of medication during the discontinuation phase, and consideration of psychiatric factors, psychosocial and demographic factors, and other co-occurring medical conditions. Like the American Psychiatric Association's guideline, the present American Psychological Association's guideline also includes recommendations for psychotherapy and for antidepressant medication; however, it more commonly recommends combinations of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication versus antidepressant medication alone and does not detail recommendations for the various stages of treatment.

### Clinical management following self-harm in a UK-wide primary care cohort [^2a639ab0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

In Table A3 (in the online Supplemental material), we present the frequencies and percentage values for the following three measures:
1 Ever prescribed an SSRI and/or other ADD at any time before first tricyclic prescription during follow-up.
2 Prescribed an SSRI and/or other ADD within a year prior to first tricyclic prescription during follow-up.
3 Prescribed an SSRI and/or other ADD between index self-harm episode and first tricyclic prescription during follow-up.

The purpose of these analyses was to assess the degree to which tricyclic antidepressant medication was used as first-line treatment in the study cohort, as opposed to being a therapeutic approach that was taken only after SSRIs and/or other antidepressants had been prescribed. Among those prescribed tricyclics, 22.3% (95% CI 21.0–23.6%) had never been prescribed an SSRI and/or any other type of antidepressant, 39.2% (CI 37.7–40.7%) had not been prescribed these alternative antidepressant therapies within a year of first being prescribed tricyclics, and 64.5% (63.0–65.9%) had not been prescribed them between index self-harm episode and subsequent first tricyclic prescription. Among the subset of cohort members prescribed tricyclics, prior prescribing of an SSRI and/or another type of antidepressant medication was more common in female than in male patients.

3.3 Consultation patterns

The median consultation frequency during the year after the index episode was 7 visits (interquartile range: 3–12). Male patients consulted less frequently, with a median of 5 visits (interquartile range: 2–10), compared with a median among females of 8 visits (interquartile range: 4–13). Overall, 2961 (7.1%, CI 6.9–7.4) cohort members did not consult once during the follow-up year, with males being more likely to be non-attenders (1954; 11.4%, CI 10.9–11.9) than females (1007; 4.1%, CI 3.9–4.4).

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^3b78cc50]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Withdrawals

Of the patients continuing into the double-blind period of the study, 74 (40 escitalopram-treated and 34 placebo-treated patients) completed the study, corresponding to completion rates of 80% (escitalopram) and 59% (placebo). The overall withdrawal rate excluding relapses, was comparable for both age groups (7.6% for young-old versus 7.4% for old-old): 5.9% for young-old patients treated with escitalopram (total of 102 patients, 6 withdrawals not due to relapse), and 9.5% for young-old patients treated with placebo (total of 95 patients, 9 withdrawals not due to relapse). For old-old patients, the overall withdrawal rate excluding relapses, was 8.0% for patients treated with escitalopram (total of 50 patients, 4 withdrawals not due to relapse), and 6.9% for patients treated with placebo (total of 58 patients, 4 withdrawals not due to relapse).

Relapse prevention

Old-old patients randomised to double-blind treatment had mean MADRS total scores of 5.8 (both treatment groups) at week 12, compared to 5.0 for young-old patients. For old-old patients, the proportion of patients who relapsed within 24 weeks was significantly higher on placebo (34.5%; 20 out of 58 patients) than on escitalopram (12.0%; 6 out of 50 patients) (chi-square test, χ² = 7.426, df = 1, p = 0.006). For young-old patients, the proportion of patients who relapsed within 24 weeks was also significantly higher on placebo (31.6%; 30 out of 95 patients) than on escitalopram (6.9%; 7 out of 102 patients) (chi-square test, χ² = 19.698, df = 1, p < 0.001).

American College of Physicians guideline — Recommendation 3 for patients not responding to a second-generation antidepressant states: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence); Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant (conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence); Switching to a second-generation antidepressant from a different pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^a6e70cef]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) medications — in patients with CSCP, clinicians may prescribe pharmacologic pain management agents such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, and non-opioid options after counseling patients on the risks and benefits; multimodal therapy to pain management is recommended (Clinical Principle). Pharmacological pain management principles for CSCP should be similar to those for management of other chronic pain conditions, and a multimodal approach is recommended. NSAIDs can be a first-line option, low-dose anxiolytics/tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline) can also be used and may offer up to 50% pain reduction, and gabapentinoids (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin) can also be considered and may provide a significant pain reduction.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^87c05936]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category.
- Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.
- Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss.
- Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

### Amitriptyline at low-dose and titrated for irritable bowel syndrome as second-line treatment in primary care (ATLANTIS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^40f9851c]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are managed in primary care. When first-line therapies for IBS are ineffective, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline suggests considering low- dose tricyclic antidepressants as second-line treatment, but their effectiveness in primary care is unknown, and they are infrequently prescribed in this setting.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Amitriptyline at Low-Dose and Titrated for Irritable Bowel Syndrome as Second-Line Treatment [ATLANTIS]) was conducted at 55 general practices in England. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with Rome IV IBS of any subtype, and ongoing symptoms (IBS Severity Scoring System [IBS-SSS] score ≥ 75 points) despite dietary changes and first-line therapies, a normal full blood count and C-reactive protein, negative coeliac serology, and no evidence of suicidal ideation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to low-dose oral amitriptyline (10 mg once daily) or placebo for 6 months, with dose titration over 3 weeks (up to 30 mg once daily), according to symptoms and tolerability. Participants, their general practitioners, investigators, and the analysis team were all masked to allocation throughout the trial. The primary outcome was the IBS-SSS score at 6 months. Effectiveness analyses were according to intention-to-treat; safety analyses were on all participants who took at least one dose of the trial medication. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN48075063) and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Oct 18, 2019, and April 11, 2022, 463 participants (mean age 48.5 years [SD 16.1], 315 [68%] female to 148 [32%] male) were randomly allocated to receive low-dose amitriptyline (232) or placebo (231). Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome showed a significant difference in favour of low-dose amitriptyline in IBS-SSS score between groups at 6 months (-27.0, 95% CI -46.9 to -7.10; p = 0.0079). 46 (20%) participants discontinued low-dose amitriptyline (30 [13%] due to adverse events), and 59 (26%) discontinued placebo (20 [9%] due to adverse events) before 6 months. There were five serious adverse reactions (two in the amitriptyline group and three in the placebo group), and five serious adverse events unrelated to trial medication.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest trial of a tricyclic antidepressant in IBS ever conducted. Titrated low-dose amitriptyline was superior to placebo as a second-line treatment for IBS in primary care across multiple outcomes, and was safe and well tolerated. General practitioners should offer low-dose amitriptyline to patients with IBS whose symptoms do not improve with first-line therapies, with appropriate support to guide patient-led dose titration, such as the self-titration document developed for this trial.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^379047e8]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — treatment recommendation decisions are based on ratings of four factors (strength of evidence, balance of benefits versus harms/burdens, patient values and preferences, and applicability), with benefits–harms comparisons made via decision tables and grids; on decision tables, benefits were rated as "clearly outweigh" or "slightly outweigh" harms, while grids allowed the balance to strongly or slightly favor Treatment 1 over Treatment 2, be the same, or be unable to determine. Recommendation strength ranges from strong ("the panel recommends") to conditional ("the panel suggests"), and applicability was organized using the PICOTS framework. For information on patient values and preferences, the strength of evidence was very low.

Figure 3
Kaplan Meier survival analysis of relapse over 24 weeks. Time to relapse (Cox model, with treatment and age group as covariates) showed significant advantage for treatment with escitalopram compared to placebo, with an estimated hazard ratio of 4.4 (chi-square test, df = 1, χ² = 22.5, p < 0.001), whereas the effect of age group was not significant, with an estimated hazard ratio of 1.2 for old-old versus young-old (chi-square test, χ² = 0.41, df = 1, p = 0.520).

Tolerability

During this period, AEs led to the withdrawal of 5 young-old patients and 4 old-old patients. The most commonly reported AEs in young-old patients were headache (8.1%), dizziness (5.6%), and diarrhoea (5.1%), and in old-old patients, headache (3.7%), dizziness (6.5%), hypertension (4.6%) and nasopharyngitis (4.6%). SAEs were reported by 7 young-old and 6 old-old patients. A 74-year-old man had a probably-related SAE during treatment with placebo was hospitalised for 27 days due to relapse of depression and was withdrawn. An 85-year-old woman with a possibly-related SAE during treatment with escitalopram was hospitalised with anaemia due to a gastric mucosal ulcer and subsequently recovered.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants: a revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines [^38322179]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

A revision of the 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology evidence-based guidelines for treating depressive disorders with antidepressants was undertaken in order to incorporate new evidence and to update the recommendations where appropriate. A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing. Suggestions for future research priorities are also made.

### Individualized prediction of psychiatric readmissions for patients with major depressive disorder: a 10-year retrospective cohort study [^f40077b5]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Feature interactions

We further detail the importance of 24 top features in each model and provide a visual example of how they interact for the 30-day prediction (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Information 2.4). Varying trend of the SHAP value of each feature was also shown in the figures. In each figure, the X-axis shows the feature values, and the Y axis shows the SHAP value of the specific feature on the X axis. The color represents the value of the feature that interacts with the specific feature on the X axis. When considering the los, the SHAP value (relative risk of 30-day readmission prediction) first decreases with increasing values of los and then increases at the median value of readmitted patients. The varying curve of los for patients treated with different total number of prescribed orders of antidepressants can be differentiable, and the range of relative risks of los is quite wide and can be either positive or negative effect. Due to feature interactions, the relative risk of los on the readmission predictions decreases with the increasing of the total number of prescribed orders of antidepressants. When considering the total number of prescribed orders of anxiolytics, using more anxiolytics is associated with a higher relative risk of readmission. Moreover, gender interacts with the combination of all therapy types. Female patients have higher risk of 30-day psychiatric readmission than male patients. For female patients, using the combination of antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and other drugs would achieve lower risk of 30-day psychiatric readmission than using other treatment regimens. The opposite is true for male patients. Age interacts with the number of treated antipsychotic types. Younger patients (under 35 years old) have higher risk of 30-day psychiatric readmission than older patients (over 35 years old). For younger patients, more total number of treated antipsychotic types achieved higher risk, while less total number of treated antipsychotic types achieved higher risk for older patients.

### Switching antidepressants in the treatment of major depression: when, how and what to switch to? [^d8dc5b9d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching antidepressant medications is recommended when an initial antidepressant is not effective, when it is unable to be tolerated or when there are significant drug interactions. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence regarding when to switch antidepressants and the optimal approach to switching.

Methods

Clinical and academic experts in mood disorders from Australia and New Zealand (Treatment Algorithm Group, TAG) met to discuss the key considerations regarding switching antidepressants in the treatment of depression and formulate recommendations about switching strategies.

Results

While switching is recommended, there is limited data to guide on how best to approach switching antidepressants (e.g. whether to switch within class or out of class), and how to define the best time to consider switching. Broadly, switching within class after non-response is recommended for mild-moderate depression and out-of-class for patients with a more severe depression or melancholia.

Limitations

There is a limited evidence-base to draw on to make definitive recommendations on switching approaches.

Conclusions

Switching antidepressants is an appropriate strategy to use if there is a minimal response to an initial antidepressant. Further research is required to determine the optimal switching approach.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^36515b61]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

Escitalopram has shown efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of relapse in elderly patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This post-hoc analysis compared time to relapse for young-old patients (n = 197) to that for old-old patients (n = 108).

Relapse prevention: after 12-weeks open-label treatment, remitters (MADRS ≤ 12) were randomised to double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo and followed over 24-weeks. Patients were outpatients with MDD from 46 European centers aged ≥ 75 years (old-old) or 65–74 years of age (young-old), treated with escitalopram 10–20 mg/day. Efficacy was assessed using the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

Results

After open-label escitalopram treatment, a similar proportion of young-old patients (78%) and old-old patients (72%) achieved remission. In the analysis of time to relapse based on the Cox model (proportional hazards regression), with treatment and age group as covariates, the hazard ratio was 4.4 for placebo versus escitalopram (χ²-test, df = 1, χ² = 22.5, p < 0.001), whereas the effect of age was not significant, with a hazard ratio of 1.2 for old-old versus young-old (χ²-test, df = 1, χ² = 0.41, p = 0.520). Escitalopram was well tolerated in both age groups with adverse events reported by 53.1% of young-old patients and 58.3% of old-old patients. There was no significant difference in withdrawal rates due to AEs between age groups (χ²-test, χ² = 1.669, df = 1, p = 0.196).

Conclusions

Young-old and old-old patients with MDD had comparable rates of remission after open-label escitalopram, and both age groups had much lower rates of relapse on escitalopram than on placebo.

### Agomelatine as adjunctive therapy with SSRIs or SNRIs for major depressive disorder: a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^38d70f48]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The inclusion criteria included (1) female or male patients aged between 18 and 60 years; (2) meeting the diagnostic criteria of MDD as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder fifth edition (DSM-5); (3) currently in a depressive episode, and the course of the current episode is less than a year; (4) score greater 4 or higher on the Clinical Global Impression-Disease Severity (CGI-S) scale; and (5) having been treated with monotherapy using an SSRI (except fluvoxamine and paroxetine) or SNRI for more than 2 weeks in the current depressive episode, with a dosage greater or equal to the minimum effective dose. Minimum effective doses for the commonly used classes of antidepressants include sertraline: ≥ 50 mg; fluoxetine: ≥ 20 mg; citalopram: ≥ 20 mg; escitalopram: ≥ 10 mg; venlafaxine: ≥ 75 mg; duloxetine: ≥ 60 mg; (6) demonstrating an inadequate response to antidepressant treatment lasting at least 2 weeks. Inadequate response is defined as a less than 20% improvement in the scores on the 17 items of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) after a 2-week period of antidepressant treatment, while participants scored ≥ 17 in HAMD-17 before 2 weeks ago; or it could be defined as patient's self-report that their depressive symptom improved by less than 20% after more than a 2-week period of antidepressant treatment, with their current HAMD-17 score ≥ 17; (7) a minimum of 6 years of education, with the ability to provide informed consent and to independently complete all scales and assessments; (8) agreement from primary healthcare providers and patients to maintain current antidepressant treatment during the 8-week follow-up period.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^e8d281dd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants for depression in dementia — because as many as one-half of such persons do develop dementia within 5 years, caution is urged in ruling out an underlying early dementia in patients with both affective and cognitive symptoms, particularly when the first episode of depression is in old age. When treatment for depression is being considered, patients should be evaluated for conditions that may be causing or contributing to the depression, and clinical consensus supports a trial of an antidepressant in acutely clinically significant, persistent depressed mood in patients with dementia. SSRIs may be preferred because they appear to be better tolerated than other antidepressants, and when a rapid response is not critical a very gradual dosage increase may increase the likelihood that a therapeutic dosage will be reached and tolerated; after prolonged use, medications should be withdrawn gradually whenever possible, in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Treatment of depression may also reduce other neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with depression such as aggression, anxiety, apathy, and psychosis.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacogenomic-guided versus unguided antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder: new insights from subgroup and cumulative meta-analyses [^cd4a50a3]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder marked by persistent sadness, loss of interest and emotional and physical symptoms that severely impact daily functioning, affecting one out of five individuals in their lifetime. The standard of care for MDD involves a combination of evidence-based interventions, primarily pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy, are effective in treating mild-to-moderate depression and in preventing relapse. Pharmacotherapy is essential for moderate-to-severe cases, offering rapid symptom relief and neurochemical balance. It typically begins with first-line antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, due to their broad efficacy and favourable side-effect profiles. For patients who do not respond to initial therapy or who have specific clinical indications, alternatives such as tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and atypical antidepressants may be considered. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants, substantial variability in treatment response remains, with 30%–40% of patients failing to achieve adequate response or remission, partly due to genetic differences impacting drug efficacy and side effects. This variability, coupled with a trial-and-error approach to prescribing, can result in delayed relief, prolonged suffering and an elevated suicide risk. These challenges highlight the urgent need for more precise, personalised treatment strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with MDD.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^cea842dc]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate response, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to determine the difference in treatment effect for the following options in adult patients with MDD not responding or only partially responding to initial adequate second-generation antidepressant therapy:

- switching to another second-generation antidepressant

- switching to a nonpharmacologic monotherapy (cognitive therapy)

- augmenting with guided CBT self-help.

### Early antidepressant therapy for elderly patients [^92c431eb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied factors affecting the management of depression in older patients, especially the use of early antidepressant therapy.

Methods

We recruited 128 primary care physicians to view one version of a 5-minute videotape of an elderly patient with somatic symptoms that were suggestive of depression, and to complete an interview that assessed decision making. Using an experimental factorial design, 16 versions of the videotape were produced, holding constant the clinical features of the case, while varying the patient's age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. Dependent variables were the physicians' probability assessment of depression and the recommendation of antidepressant medication after the first visit.

Results

Depression was considered a possible diagnosis by 121 physicians (95%) and the most likely diagnosis by 69 (54%). Sixteen physicians (13%) recommended antidepressant therapy after the first visit, and they were less likely than other physicians to order initial laboratory tests to assess the possibility of other conditions. Recommendations for antidepressant therapy was not associated with patient age, sex, race, or socioeconomic status, or with physician sex, race, or experience. Family physicians were more likely than internists to recommend an antidepressant (19% [12/64] vs. 6% [4/64], P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Based on a 5-minute vignette, physicians were likely to recognize depression, independent of patient characteristics. Those recommending early antidepressant therapy were more likely to be in family medicine and less likely to investigate other diagnoses initially.

Neuropathic medications — conditional recommendation, evidence, and dosing in CP/CPPS: Clinicians may prescribe medications for neuropathic pain including the classes of tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in men with CP/CPPS, there was no significant difference at the primary endpoint of a response of 6-point drop in NIH-CPSI total scores (p = 0.07), but secondary outcomes showed improvements on NIH-CPSI subscores with 3.3 (pregabalin) versus 2.2 (placebo) of 21 points for pain (p = 0.04), 1.2 versus 0.6 of 10 points for urinary symptoms (p = 0.01), and 2.1 versus 1.4 of 12 points for QOL (p = 0.02), a higher Global Response Assessment response rate (31.2% versus 18.9%; p = 0.02), and improvement in total McGill Pain Questionnaire score (p = 0.01). This indicates that pregabalin may be effective in some patients; however, it should be noted that improvement of the NIH-CPSI subscores may be statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. There are no trials of gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitors in men with CP/CPPS; of the tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline is typically recommended over amitriptyline in elderly patients as it has fewer side effects and similar efficacy. Tricyclic antidepressants are usually started at a low dose, typically 10 mg orally nightly, with doses titrated for effect up to 75 to 100 mg per day as tolerated, and caution is advised in older patients due to the anticholinergic risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. For gabapentin, treatment can be started at 900 mg/day (300 mg/day on day 1, 600 mg/day on day 2, and 900 mg/day on day 3), titrated to 1,800 mg/day for greater efficacy with doses up to 3,600 mg/day in some patients, with an even lower starting dose in younger CP/CPPS patients of 100–300 mg orally at night. Pregabalin is approved at 300 mg/day for post herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, a lower starting dose can be considered given response to 150 mg per day in the NIH trial, and it is approved at 450 mg/day for fibromyalgia; doses for both gabapentin and pregabalin need to be reduced in patients with a GFR below 60 mL/min.
