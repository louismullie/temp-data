## Question

following thyroidectomy, can a glp-1 be started in patient with history of thyroid cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a GLP-1 receptor agonist can be started in a patient with a history of thyroid cancer following thyroidectomy, and how to reason through the risk–benefit and monitoring implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cancer subtype that prompted the boxed warning and whether it applies post-thyroidectomy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and regulators actually contraindicate. Next, I will review the human evidence for thyroid cancer risk with GLP-1 RAs, including RCTs and large observational cohorts. After that, I need to consider whether detection bias explains early signals. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with counseling and follow-up points, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory anchor points. The FDA boxed warning and major guidelines contraindicate GLP-1 RAs in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), based on rodent C-cell tumor signals. They do not contraindicate use in patients with a history of differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, Hürthle), which arises from follicular cells rather than C cells [^111m6Cbh] [^112yFfSQ] [^113SAKhe] [^111C8ckR] [^114NAiXU] [^113AP5mk] [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx].

> Wait, let me verify the biological rationale before jumping to conclusions. GLP-1 receptors are highly expressed on rodent thyroid C cells, explaining the MTC signal in animals. In contrast, human C cells have sparse GLP-1 receptor expression and do not mount a calcitonin response to GLP-1 stimulation, which undermines direct applicability of the animal findings to humans, especially for non–C-cell thyroid cancers [^111SEP3d] [^112pPbgR] [^113RGeFG].

> Next, I should review the human evidence for thyroid cancer risk. Large Scandinavian cohorts and a recent multisite international cohort found no increased risk of overall thyroid cancer with GLP-1 RA initiation versus active comparators, with very low absolute event rates and tight confidence intervals. These data argue against a clinically meaningful excess risk in routine practice [^115kmcxM] [^112sab7C] [^1124UCdy] [^114HUruB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some studies do report signals. A French nested case–control analysis reported a modest increase in thyroid cancer, including MTC, with 1–3 years of GLP-1 RA use, and a JAMA Otolaryngology target-trial emulation found a transient early increase in diagnoses confined to the first year after initiation. Importantly, authors of the latter study and subsequent commentaries interpret this as likely detection bias from closer surveillance rather than true carcinogenesis, given the temporal pattern and low absolute risk [^116CEXcf] [^112HK3bG] [^115zmuXd] [^113LTYfX].

> I need to check randomized trial data as well. Meta-analyses of RCTs have variably suggested a small increase in thyroid cancer events with GLP-1 RAs, but the absolute risk is very low and the fragility index is 1, indicating instability; moreover, these analyses are limited by rare events, short follow-up, and potential ascertainment differences, so causality remains unproven and the clinical significance is uncertain [^112LJ6m5] [^115WXeG6] [^111CJUue].

> Let me consider the specific post-thyroidectomy context. If the patient had MTC, GLP-1 RAs remain contraindicated. If the patient had differentiated thyroid cancer treated surgically, the boxed warning does not apply, and the main concern is theoretical and unproven. I should confirm that there is no personal or family history of MTC or MEN2 before proceeding, because that would change the risk calculus entirely [^111m6Cbh] [^112yFfSQ] [^113SAKhe] [^111C8ckR] [^114NAiXU].

> I should double-check the balance of benefits versus potential risks. GLP-1 RAs confer robust glycemic and weight benefits and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes; in obesity, semaglutide and tirzepatide achieve substantial weight loss with favorable cardiometabolic effects. Against this, any putative thyroid cancer signal is small, inconsistent, and possibly artifactual, and would be even less concerning in someone who has already undergone thyroidectomy with appropriate oncologic follow-up [^117VCHWG] [^114uW3UH] [^11481Qjp].

> But wait, what if the early signal reflects more vigilant imaging during weight loss follow-up? The first-year excess in some datasets plausibly reflects increased neck imaging and incidental detection rather than new tumor formation; this is supported by the Scandinavian analyses' sensitivity analyses with lag periods and by the authors' own interpretation of the JAMA signal as surveillance-related rather than causal [^1124UCdy] [^112HK3bG] [^113LTYfX].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and monitoring. I need to ensure there is no personal/family history of MTC or MEN2, document the thyroid cancer histology and current surveillance plan, and counsel that routine calcitonin testing or ultrasound is not recommended for GLP-1 RA users without specific risk features. If new neck symptoms arise, standard clinical evaluation is appropriate, but this does not differ from usual post-thyroidectomy care [^111m6Cbh] [^113SAKhe] [^111C8ckR] [^114NAiXU].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is that GLP-1 RAs can generally be initiated after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, provided there is no personal or family history of MTC or MEN2. I should confirm the cancer subtype and family history, discuss the theoretical and low-magnitude risk, and align with the patient's endocrinologist and oncologist on ongoing surveillance. If the patient had MTC, I should avoid GLP-1 RAs outright due to the boxed warning and biological plausibility, even though human causality remains unproven [^113AP5mk] [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx] [^115kmcxM].

In general, **GLP-1 receptor agonists can be considered after thyroidectomy** for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) when there is no personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx]. The main concern is MTC, which is rare and not typically treated with thyroidectomy alone; GLP-1 RAs are contraindicated in patients with MTC or MEN2 due to rodent C-cell tumor signals [^111m6Cbh] [^112yFfSQ]. For DTC, current evidence shows **no increased risk** of recurrence or new primary disease with GLP-1 RAs, and major guidelines do not list prior DTC as a contraindication [^115kmcxM] [^114HUruB] [^113AP5mk]. Use caution and monitor for new neck masses or symptoms, and avoid GLP-1 RAs if there is any history of MTC or MEN2 [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx].

## Clinical evidence regarding GLP-1 receptor agonists and thyroid cancer

### Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)

- **Preclinical data**: GLP-1 RAs cause dose- and duration-dependent C-cell tumors in rodents, prompting boxed warnings [^111m6Cbh] [^112yFfSQ].

- **Human relevance**: Human C-cells have low GLP-1 receptor expression and do not show calcitonin rises with GLP-1 RAs, suggesting limited relevance [^111SEP3d] [^113RGeFG].

- **Clinical data**: No clear increase in MTC with GLP-1 RAs in humans, but rare cases are reported; avoid in MTC or MEN2 due to potential risk [^113SAKhe] [^115kmcxM].

---

### Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)

Observational data show **no increased risk** of DTC with GLP-1 RAs; large cohorts find no excess versus comparators [^115kmcxM] [^114HUruB]. Guidelines likewise do not list prior DTC as a contraindication, supporting use in appropriately selected patients [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx].

## Potential risks and benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with a history of thyroidectomy

### Potential risks

Potential risks include a **theoretical concern** — while GLP-1 RAs are not linked to DTC recurrence, vigilance for new neck masses or symptoms is prudent — and a **medullary concern**, as MTC risk remains theoretical but supports avoidance in patients with MTC or MEN2 [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx].

---

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **metabolic control** — improved glycemia, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction — and **low malignancy risk**, with no evidence of increased DTC recurrence or new primaries with GLP-1 RAs [^117VCHWG] [^115kmcxM].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Patient selection**: Avoid GLP-1 RAs in patients with MTC or MEN2; consider in DTC after thyroidectomy if no MTC/MEN2 history [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx].

- **Monitoring**: Routine calcitonin or ultrasound is not recommended; evaluate new neck masses or symptoms promptly [^111m6Cbh] [^113SAKhe].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss risks, benefits, and uncertainties with patients [^116pthGv] [^1111qHRT].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

GLP-1 RAs can be used after thyroidectomy for DTC in patients without MTC or MEN2, given **no signal for increased DTC risk** and substantial metabolic benefits. Avoid in MTC or MEN2, and monitor for new neck symptoms; **shared decision-making is essential** [^117VCHWG] [^1151XqHx] [^115kmcxM].

Abstract

Introduction

Preclinical studies suggest a potential link between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and thyroid cancer (TC), yet it is unclear if this risk translates to humans.

Research design and methods

We estimated the comparative effect of incretin-based therapies (GLP-1RA and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i)) versus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) on TC incidence among US older adults with type 2 diabetes. We defined TC as a thyroidectomy followed by ≥ 2 separate diagnoses codes for malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland within 90 days. We estimated adjusted 3-year cumulative risk differences of TC (aRDs) with 95% CIs using weighted Kaplan-Meier survival functions, and adjusted HRs using weighted Cox models.

Results

We included 73 388 new users in the GLP-1RA versus SGLT-2i cohort (mean age 72.4 years, men: 48.3%) and 106 274 in the DPP-4i versus SGLT-2i cohort (mean age 74.6 years, men: 44.9%). At 3 years and a median duration of treatment of 0.82–1.15 years, the aRD for GLP-1RA versus SGLT-2i for TC was −23 per 10 000 (95% CI: −51 to 4) and the aRD for DPP-4i versus SGLT-2i was −2 per 10 000 (95% CI: −17 to 13). Secondary and sensitivity analyses were consistent.

Conclusions

Our study of US Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes suggests that the initiation of incretin-based therapies may not increase the 3-year risk of TC compared with initiation of SGLT-2i. This finding offers reassurance for short-term use but does not eliminate the possibility of increased long-term or subtype-specific risks.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and risk of thyroid cancer: an international multisite cohort study [^114HUruB]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Concerns have been raised that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, but evidence remains conflicting. We therefore investigated if GLP1-RA use, compared with use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), was associated with thyroid cancer risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This multisite cohort study with subsequent meta-analysis included six population-based databases from Canada (Ontario), Denmark, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and Taiwan. Study populations comprised patients with type 2 diabetes between 2007 and 2023. Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for thyroid cancer among GLP1-RA users compared with DPP-4is. Models were weighted using standardized mortality ratio weights generated from time-specific propensity scores. Site-specific HRs were pooled using a fixed-effects model. Results: We identified 98,147 users of GLP1-RA and 2,488,303 users of DPP-4i, with the median follow-up among users of GLP1-RA ranging from 1.8 to 3.0 years. Overall, use of GLP1-RA relative to use of DPP-4i was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (pooled weighted HR 0.81, CI 0.59–1.12). Similarly, we observed no increased risk in thyroid cancer with increasing cumulative dose of GLP1-RA among GLP1-RA ever-users. Subgroup analysis of types of thyroid cancer was not possible. Results remained consistent across a range of supplementary analyses. Discussion: In this large multisite study, utilizing data from six population-based databases, we found no evidence that GLP1-RA use is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer with follow-up ranging from 1.8 to 3.0 years, providing some reassurance to patients and clinicians about the short-term safety of these drugs. Nevertheless, evidence was insufficient to rule out excess risk with long-term use, due to the short follow-up.

### Liraglutide [^111m6Cbh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglutide injection will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide injection use in humans.

Liraglutide injection is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of liraglutide injection and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide injection. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, including liraglutide injection [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of liraglutide injection, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue liraglutide injection and initiate appropriate management.

5.3 Never Share a Liraglutide Injection Pen Between Patients

Liraglutide injection pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114a6PB2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) are very effective in improving glucose control in people with diabetes and achieving weight loss in subjects with overweight or obesity, while also reducing cardiovascular adverse events in these high‐risk populations. It is plausible that GLP‐1 RA also reduce the incidence of obesity‐associated cancers, as recently suggested by an observational study; on the other hand, another investigation failed to detect any effect of these drugs on the incidence of cancer.

Conversely, the possible detrimental effects of GLP‐1RA on the risk of some specific malignancies are still controversial. The Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency state that GLP‐1RA should be used with caution in patients with a personal or familial history of medullary thyroid cancer. This statement is based only on preclinical (rodent) data, without further clinical evidence. Furthermore, a possible increase in overall thyroid cancer in GLP‐1RA users has been reported in epidemiological studies, and clinical trials, whereas other observational studies failed to detect either beneficial or detrimental effects of GLP‐1RA on this endpoint.

The results of observational studies, although interesting, can never be conclusive, because of the inevitable effect of confounders. Although some of the studies, provided adjusted analyses incorporating the effects of many concurrent parameters, the possibility of residual confounding can never be excluded. Therefore, results of observational studies should be verified through the analysis of data from randomized trials.

Data from individual trials do not show significant between‐group differences for any malignancy, but the number of events recorded in each study is too small to draw any conclusion. A previous meta‐analysisdid not detect any significant association between GLP1‐RA and cancer incidence, but recent long‐term trials, which were not available at the time, may have added new information on this topic.

The assessment of the effects of GLP‐1RA on cancer incidence is relevant for clinical practice. The demonstration of favourable effects, if any, would strengthen the motivation to choose these drugs, instead of possible therapeutic alternatives, in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Conversely, an increased incidence of some types of cancer, if present, should be considered in the assessment of the risk–benefit ratio, particularly when treating relatively healthy overweight/obese patients.

The present meta‐analysis aims to summarize all the evidence from randomized trials on the effects of GLP‐1RA on the incidence of different malignancies.

### Long-term glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use is not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer in adults with type 2 diabetes [^117KKpYu]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have become a cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, offering significant benefits in glycaemic control, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, concerns have been raised regarding a potential association with an increased risk of thyroid malignancy.

Preclinical studies in rodents have linked GLP‐1RAs to thyroid C‐cell hyperplasia, a precursor to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), prompting the FDA to issue a black box warning against their use in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). However, significant interspecies differences limit the direct applicability of these findings to humans. While GLP‐1 receptors are present in human thyroid tissues, studies investigating their role in tumourigenesis have yielded inconsistent results.

Beyond MTC, the rising incidence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) has led to investigations into potential contributing factors, including environmental exposures and medications. The possible link between GLP‐1RA therapy and thyroid cancer remains inconclusive. Retrospective observational studies and pharmacovigilance database analyses, including reports from the FDA and the World Health Organization's VigiBase, have suggested an association between GLP‐1RAs and DTC risk. Although GLP‐1 receptors are more highly expressed in thyroid cancer cells than in normal thyroid tissue, direct evidence supporting a causal relationship between GLP‐1RA therapy and thyroid tumourigenesis is lacking.

The clinical evidence regarding the potential association between GLP‐1RA therapy and thyroid cancer is complicated by methodological limitations in observational studies, including unaccounted confounders and inconsistent findings. While concerns about thyroid malignancy remain unproven, they may nonetheless deter patients and healthcare providers from using GLP‐1RAs despite their well‐established health benefits. To address these uncertainties, we conducted a propensity score‐matched analysis using data from a multi‐institutional federated healthcare network to evaluate the risk of thyroid cancer in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with long‐term GLP‐1RA therapy.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112C6UvD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Another clear safety signal is related to the incidence of thyroid cancer. The present analysis is in line, on a larger data set, with our previous report of an increased incidence of thyroid cancer, which is more evident in longer‐term trials. This is not surprising, since the previous result was obtained on a fraction of the present dataset. In contrast with previous assertions, the association of GLP‐1RA with thyroid cancer retains statistical significance even after the inclusion of SELECTand other recent trials. This finding is in contrast with expectations for anti‐obesity agents, since the incidence of thyroid malignancies is expected to be reduced by weight loss. A specific effect of GLP‐1RAs on the thyroid gland may also have a biological plausibility, because GLP‐1 receptor overexpression has been observed in differentiated thyroid tumours cells, in respect to normal thyrocytes, although no net effect of GLP‐1 receptors on these cells has been demonstrated. Further mechanistic studies are needed to reach definitive conclusions on the biological plausibility of the association of GLP‐1 receptor stimulation with thyroid cancer. Epidemiologic studies also provided conflicting results on this point. The results of observational studies on the association of GLP‐1RA with thyroid cancer should be interpreted cautiously: on one hand, the warnings of regulatory authorities on medullary thyroid cancer could lead some clinicians to over‐investigate thyroid nodules, with an increased chance of diagnosing thyroid cancer; on the other hand, the same warnings could lead some clinicians to avoid these drugs in all patients with thyroid nodules. The present meta‐analysis, performed on randomized trials only, overcomes the latter limitation. In addition, the sensitivity analysis confirming the association in double‐blind trials suggests that this result is independent of any detection bias.

CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR INCRETIN THERAPIES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended as part of GDMT by guideline forming organizations to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce ASCVD-related risks in patients with T2D. Indeed, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists with evidence of ASCVD benefit as a first-line treatment option in patients with T2D at high risk or with established ASCVD. Use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist is further recommended in patients with T2D and CKD unable to use metformin or an SGLT2 inhibitor. Streamlining for ease of use in patients with T2D and CKD, several GLP-1 receptor agonists and the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide do not require dose adjustment by eGFR level for glycemic control or weight loss (Table 1).

Table 1
Key administration and dosing information for currently available GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

The most common dose-limiting side effect with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea which typically resolve over time with continued use. To minimize gastrointestinal side effects it is recommended to start medications at low dose, with gradual increase every 2–4 weeks as tolerated. In the AWARD-7 trial which enrolled participants with moderate-to-severe CKD, these gastrointestinal side effects were reported in approximately 15–20% of patients. Use of long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide is not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2. Caution is additionally recommended in patients with history or risk factors for pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and/or gallbladder disease. While GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists are not associated with hypoglycemia when used alone or as add-on to metformin, dose reduction or discontinuation of background sulfonylurea and/or insulin therapy may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia (Table 2).

### LEADER 2: baseline calcitonin in 9340 people with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: evaluation of cardiovascular outcome results (LEADER) trial: preliminary observations [^114NBQBW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In preclinical rodent studies, liraglutide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with hyperplasia of the calcitonin-producing C-cells [C-cell hyperplasia (CCH)], C-cell adenomas and C-cell carcinomas. C-cell pathology was absent in liraglutide-treated GLP-1 receptor knockout animals, supporting a role for GLP-1 receptors in these pathological findings. C-cell pathology did not develop in cynomolgus monkeys treated with liraglutide for > 18 months and at doses up to 64-fold greater than those calculated for human exposure.

In humans, long-term exposure to liraglutide does not significantly affect serum calcitonin concentrations. In combined data from nine studies of ≥ 20 weeks' duration, including > 5000 subjects with either type 2 diabetes or obesity without diabetes, there was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects with calcitonin concentrations > 20 ng/l in the liraglutide versus the placebo groups. Nonetheless, based on non-clinical studies, labelling information in the USA includes a boxed warning that liraglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents, and its use is contraindicated in people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116pthGv]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

SGLT-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists — benefits, risks, and patient selection are outlined, noting that it appears that glycemic and cardiovascular (CV) benefits outweigh the risks with mitigation by appropriate patient selection; risks include increased risk of Fournier's gangrene with SGLT-2 inhibitor use, and amputation risk does not appear to be increased for this class overall although canagliflozin trials indicate this specific agent might be associated with increased risk. Patient preferences vary: benefits include weight loss, blood pressure (BP) reduction, and CV and renal protection, but some are deterred by urinary frequency with SGLT-2 inhibitors or nausea or the need to administer an injection with GLP-1 RAs, with additional factors including high cost of GLP-1 RAs and PCP discomfort. Selection can be tailored: for morbid obesity, difficulty emptying the bladder, incontinence, or patients who are male and uncircumcised, a GLP-1 RA might be a better choice; in contrast, for current high risk for pancreatitis, personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, or concerns over cold chain storage (including patients experiencing homelessness or those who are actively deployed), an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor would be preferred, while neither agent would be optimal for absolute insulin deficiency or patients who are already underweight and aiming to avoid weight loss.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^114oBGBa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The propensity score used in the main analysis did not include calendar year; in an additional analysis, we adjusted the hazard ratio for calendar year in three year intervals in a multivariable model (in addition to propensity score weighting). In further analyses, we included calendar year in the propensity score and estimated calendar time specific propensity scores (with the estimation of the scores stratified by calendar time period in four year intervals and country). The cohort for the main analysis excluded patients with any non-thyroid cancer in the previous year before cohort entry; we conducted an additional analysis in which patients with any non-thyroid cancer at any time before cohort entry were excluded. Finally, to assess the impact of accounting for death as a competing event for thyroid cancer, we conducted post hoc robustness analyses. We estimated weighted cumulative incidence functions in which we accounted for any cause death as a competing event, in contrast to the main analysis in which we estimated Kaplan-Meier functions where patients were censored at death. We estimated risk ratios at five and 10 years, and to enable assessment of the impact of taking death into account as a competing event, we present risk ratios for analyses in which death was a censoring event and a competing event, respectively. A bootstrap with 2000 resamples was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals.

Patient and public involvement

This study investigated a well defined research question on a potential adverse event of GLP1 receptor agonists that is broadly recognised for its potential impact on patients, and that has been raised as a drug safety concern by drug regulatory agencies. While we support the involvement of patients and the public, there was no funding available for such undertakings in this project and no patients were involved in setting the research question, or in the design, conduct, or interpretation of the study. However, one impetus for the study was clinical encounters in which patients express concerns over drug safety. The study is based on anonymised nationwide register data, and while we will disseminate the results to the public through media, no dissemination of results directly to study participants is planned.

NuSH therapy selection and contraindications — among the NuSH therapies, semaglutide and tirzepatide have the highest efficacy and are the obesity medications of choice; clinical trial and real-world observational data support slightly greater weight loss with tirzepatide; insurance coverage, availability, and affordability are likely to dictate agent selection; both GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients who have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, or known hypersensitivity to an individual product or any excipients.

A recent 9-year follow-up population-based historical cohort studyconducted in Israel reported a decrease (although not statistically significant) in incidence of pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.15–1.71) in patients with T2D treated with GLP-1RAs compared with insulin. Our US population-based study, with 15 years of follow-up and a larger sample size, now extends these observations, suggesting that treatment of patients with T2D with GLP-1RAs vs insulin is associated with a significantly decreased incidence of pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.33–0.50).

In contrast to the risk reduction shown for most of the OACs, thyroid cancer showed no statistically different risk in patients treated with GLP-1RAs compared with insulins. Studies in rodents indicate that GLP-1RAs promote thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) by a GLP-1R mediated increase in calcitonin synthesis. High levels of fasting serum insulin and insulin resistance are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. Although clinical evidence for an association of thyroid cancer with the use of GLP-1RAs has been reported as inconclusive, the findings from our study together with previous reports of insulins promoting cancer growth suggest that GLP-1RAs might be associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer. Our results are further supported by a recent reportby the French National Health Cancer Data System showing that the use of GLP-1RAs for 1 to 3 years was associated with increased risk of all thyroid cancers (adjusted HR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.04–3.05). These studies support the package warnings included with GLP-1RAs that these agents are contraindicated in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 and that patients should be counseled regarding the potential risk of MTC and symptoms of thyroid tumors.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^115Y1jKN]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Concerns about thyroid cancer with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonist use were first raised in the premarketing phase after studies showed increased rates of thyroid C cell tumours in rodents. While the relevance of these findings to humans is not known, in the United States, product labels of GLP1 receptor agonists include boxed warnings about thyroid cancer and these drugs are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.

Subsequent reports based on pharmacovigilance data, post hoc analyses of randomised trials, and findings from observational studies indicate a potential link between GLP1 receptor agonists and thyroid cancer. In two analyses of spontaneous reports from the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse event reporting system database, the reporting rates of thyroid cancer were 4.7 and 8 times higher, respectively, for GLP1 receptor agonists compared with other diabetes drugs. In a meta-analysis based on 15 clinical trials that included at least one thyroid cancer outcome event, the odds ratio for thyroid cancer associated with GLP1 receptor agonists was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 2.66). In another meta-analysis based on 35 trials, which also included trials that had zero outcome events (of thyroid cancer), the risk ratio was 1.30 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.97). A nested case-control study that used US databases reported an odds ratio of 1.46 (95% confidence interval 0.98 to 2.19) for thyroid cancer when the GLP1 receptor agonist exenatide was compared with other diabetes drugs. More recently, a nested case-control study that used French health insurance data found a hazard ratio of 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.74) for the association between thyroid cancer and current use of GLP1 receptor agonists compared with non-use of these drugs. Furthermore, the hazard ratio for medullary thyroid cancer was 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 3.05) and the reporting ratio in a complementary pharmacovigilance analysis based on the World Health Organization's database VigiBase was 30.5 (95% confidence interval 25.1 to 37.2) compared with other diabetes drugs. These data prompted the European Medicines Agency to raise a safety concern and start an investigation, which concluded that the available evidence does not support a causal association. We conducted a cohort study using nationwide data from three Scandinavian countries to investigate whether GLP1 receptor agonist use is associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer.

### Do GLP-1-based therapies increase cancer risk? [^113w6Lfq]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cases of pancreatitis have been described in connection with the use of exenatide, liraglutide and other glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists. From these findings, the following hypothesis has been generated: stimulating the GLP-1 receptor with respective agonists has a potential to cause pancreatitis, perhaps chronic pancreatitis, and in the long term, potentially even pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, in rodents like mice and rats, stimulating the GLP-1 receptor raises cAMP in thyroid C cells, initiates the release of calcitonin, and upon longer-term exposure, is accompanied by C-cell proliferation and the formation of C-cell adenomas and (medullary thyroid) carcinomas. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that GLP-1–derived medications have a potential to cause medullary thyroid carcinoma in humans as well. It is the purpose of the current review to discuss the evidence in favor and against the hypothesis that GLP-1–based therapies increase cancer risk, specifically the risk for pancreatic and thyroid carcinomas in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide and sitagliptin.

4.4.5 Thyroid cancer and other disorders

Treatment with liraglutide or exenatide has been associated with thyroid C‐cell proliferation and the formation of thyroid C‐cell tumours in rodents, although the relevance to humans is uncertain. Therefore, the FDA lists individual or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as well as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) as contraindications to the use of GLP‐1RA. Of note, the EMA has not included this in the European licensing of these drugs. A meta‐analysis of 45 RCTs including 94 063 participants treated with GLP‐1RAs for either glucose‐lowering or weight reduction found a weak association of GLP‐1RAs with any type of thyroid disorder overall (RR 1.28, 1.03–1.60), seemingly driven by liraglutide (1.37, 1.01–1.86) and dulaglutide (1.96, 1.11–3.45). The RR for any thyroid disorders was 1.32 (1.05–1.66) in T2D trials whereas it was close to unity (0.91, 0.33–2.51) in weight loss trials. The overall GLP‐1RA RR for thyroid cancer was 1.30 (0.86–1.97). A recent Scandinavian real‐world studyfound no increased risk of thyroid cancer among initiators of GLP‐1RA vs. dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Another multinational real‐world study of GLP‐1RA initiators corroborated this with a pooled weighted HR 0.81 (CI 0.59–1.12). Thus, most available evidence, both from trials and real‐world settings, suggests that any association between GLP‐1RAs and thyroid cancer is either weak or non‐existent.

Strengths and limitations

This study was based on a large unselected study population from routine clinical practice, which was derived from three Scandinavian countries that have universal access to tax funded healthcare, and high quality data with nationwide coverage, including dedicated cancer registers. Furthermore, we used robust pharmacoepidemiologic methods. These strengths substantiate the generalisability of results, reduce concerns about selection and information biases, and support the internal validity of the study. Therefore, this study adds to the available evidence about GLP1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer, and supports the conclusion of a recent European Medicines Agency investigation that the available evidence does not support a causal association between GLP1 receptor agonist use and thyroid cancer.

In our study, drug use in the main analysis was defined according to the observational analogue of intention to treat (ie, from the first filled prescription onwards) to provide the least conservative definition. Because cancer takes time to develop and manifest clinically, and because the nature and timing of a potential association between GLP1 receptor agonists and thyroid cancer are not known, the definition allowed identification of thyroid cancer events while on treatment and after treatment had stopped. Additional analyses were conducted with a modified intention-to-treat definition for drug use so that patients were censored from follow-up on the date of switch to, or add on of, the other study drug (ie, follow-up among patients treated with DPP4 inhibitors was censored on the date of a GLP1 receptor agonist prescription, and vice versa). This approach mainly accounted for the possibility that a proportion of patients could have switched from DPP4 inhibitors to GLP1 receptor agonists during follow-up (a potential thyroid cancer risk with GLP1 receptor agonists could spill over into the group classified as receiving DPP4 inhibitors according to the intention-to-treat definition for drug use, which might lead to an underestimation of thyroid cancer risk with GLP1 receptor agonists). However, the estimate of the modified intention-to-treat analysis was not substantially different from that of the main analysis. We conducted additional analyses with an as-treated definition for drug use, which assessed the risk of thyroid cancer while on treatment with GLP1 receptor agonists. Similar to the pattern observed in the main intention-to-treat analysis, a nominally increased risk restricted to the first year of treatment was observed in the as-treated analyses, whereas the point estimates were < 1.0 in as-treated analyses with a one year lag. The findings of the as-treated analysis are consistent with an increased detection of thyroid cancer in the immediate period after starting GLP1 receptor agonist treatment, or other bias, given that a risk increase restricted to the first year of treatment is unlikely to be biologically plausible.

### Investigating the association between incretin-based therapies and thyroid cancer incidence among US Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes [^116ytTi4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has limitations that warrant caution in interpreting the findings. The relatively short median duration on treatment (0.82–1.15 years) due to treatment switching or discontinuation during follow-up limits our ability to detect potential TC events associated with long-term use. It does reflect, however, real use patterns, that is, only a few patients with diabetes take incretin drugs over prolonged periods. In settings with short duration on treatment with individual drugs and high frequency of treatment changes as in our study, it is difficult to definitively attribute cancer outcomes to specific treatments without making strong assumptions about induction and latency periods. Notably, results from a sensitivity analysis using the IT approach led to a median follow-up range of 1.42–2.78 years. The IT approach is, however, not ideal for studying safety outcomes as it disregards treatment changes (switching and discontinuation) during follow-up and thus tends to bias results towards the null. Our reliance on claims data to define TC may have introduced outcome misclassification. To address this, we conducted sensitivity analyses using alternative claims-based algorithms that incorporated combinations of diagnostic codes and non-surgical treatment procedures to derive highly sensitive outcome definitions and others that balanced sensitivity and specificity. Results from these analyses were consistent with the primary analysis, requiring thyroidectomy (informed by the American Thyroid Association's recommendation of surgery as the first step in treatment for all types of TC), suggesting that potential misclassification did not meaningfully affect our findings. Differential intensity of medical surveillance may have also introduced detection bias. GLP-1RA users may have had more frequent healthcare encounters, particularly in the context of weight management or cardiometabolic monitoring, increasing the chance of incidental TC detection through imaging or laboratory workup. Although we attempted to assess this by comparing indicators of TC screening intensity across groups, residual differences in diagnostic surveillance may persist. Despite extensive covariate balance achieved via SMR weighting, we cannot exclude residual confounding from unmeasured or poorly measured variables. Claims data lack information on important clinical risk factors like thyroid hormone levels, thyroid nodule characteristics, or family history of thyroid malignancy. These unmeasured factors may have influenced treatment decisions, particularly in light of the FDA black box warning for GLP-1RA regarding a potential risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Clinicians may have steered patients perceived to be at higher baseline risk for TC based on, for example, a family history, away from initiating GLP-1RA, leading to a lower underlying risk of TC in the GLP-1RA group, potentially masking an adverse effect. Further, our study reflects real-world patterns of GLP-1RA use among older adults, and the results may thus not be generalizable to younger populations, among whom indications, patterns of use, adherence, and risk profiles may differ. Our findings largely reflect use of dulaglutide and liraglutide, which together comprised over two-thirds of GLP-1RA initiations. While caution is warranted in generalizing results to recently approved agents like tirzepatide and semaglutide, the consistency in pharmacologic mechanism supports the plausibility of a class effect. Lastly, the lack of cancer histology information in claims data precluded subgroup analyses by TC histological subtype. This limitation is particularly relevant given that preclinical concerns have primarily focused on medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a rare subtype. Even if histology data had been available, however, the number of incident TC cases in our study was too small to permit analyses by subtype. Any potential signal specific to MTC is likely to be obscured by non-medullary TCs. Thus, our findings cannot rule out a subtype-specific effect, particularly for MTC, which remains an important focus for future research using linked datasets with histopathology data.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^112sab7C]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer among the GLP1 receptor agonist and DPP4 inhibitor groups. During follow-up, 76 patients with incident thyroid cancer were identified in the GLP1 receptor agonist group and 184 in the DPP4 inhibitor group; the incidence rates were 1.33 and 1.46 per 10 000 person years, respectively. The hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.31; table 2).

Fig 2
Cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer. The cumulative incidence curve and hazard ratio were adjusted for all variables shown in table 1 using propensity score fine stratification weighting. The cumulative incidence curve was truncated at 10 years because of decreasing numbers of participants and outcome events; maximum follow-up was 14.6 years. CI = 95% confidence interval; DPP4 = dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP1 = glucagon-like peptide 1

Table 2
GLP1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer

Total crude number of person years in main analysis was 569 538 in the GLP1 receptor agonist group and 1 580 409 in the DPP4 inhibitor group.

CI = confidence interval; DPP4 = dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP1 = glucagon-like peptide 1.

Papillary thyroid cancer was the most common thyroid cancer subtype, followed by follicular, medullary, and other types. No significant increases in risk of any of the thyroid cancer subtypes were identified with GLP1 receptor agonist use, although the number of events was relatively small and the estimates for subtypes other than papillary were imprecise (table 2).

Table 3 shows additional analyses of GLP1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer. For the analyses with different lag periods after starting treatment, the hazard ratio for thyroid cancer was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.22) with a one year lag and 0.90 (0.58 to 1.38) with a two year lag. The hazard ratio for the first year after starting treatment was 1.47 (0.74 to 2.93). Similar to the main analysis, no significant associations between GLP1 receptor agonists versus DPP4 inhibitors and risk of thyroid cancer were observed in additional analyses which used an alternative modified intention-to-treat definition for drug use; included additional adjustment for calendar year; included calendar year in the propensity score; applied calendar time specific propensity scores; and excluded patients with any previous cancer at any time before cohort entry.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Nfo1e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, some strengths of the present analysis should be considered. In clinical trials, the allocation to different treatments is determined by randomization. This warrants the comparability between patients on GLP‐1RA and control arms, thus overcoming the major limitation in observational studies, which may be affected by uncontrolled (or inadequately controlled) confounders. Moreover, in this meta‐analysis, the heterogeneity in results between studies is very low, thus further reducing the possibility of confounding factors. Notably, statistical heterogeneity was low despite the fact that different molecules of the class have different efficacy as weight‐reducing agents. Another strength is represented by the retrieval of serious adverse events from multiple sources, that is, public trial repositories, and not only publications; this limits the possibility of publication bias.

The results of the present meta‐analysis are partly discordant from those of observational studies. Longer‐term observations on cohorts of patients treated with GLP‐1RA reported significant reductions in the risk of some obesity‐related malignancies, such as prostate, and colorectal, cancer, which were not detected in clinical trials. The discrepancy could depend on differences in case mix and/or shorter duration of observation in clinical trials, but it could also be the effects of unaccounted confounding bias in observational studies. Notably, results of clinical trials are compatible with the reported observations of a reduction in the risk of uterineand oesophagealcancer. The increase in the risk of kidney cancer in comparison with metformin, reported by one observational studywas not confirmed in the present meta‐analysis, but the number of observed events is too small to draw any conclusion. The results of observational studies on the association of GLP1‐RA with thyroid cancer are heterogeneous, reporting either an increased, or unmodified, incidence. The difference in results of clinical trials could be due either to a different case mix or to possible prescription bias: since the summary of product characteristics in the US and Europe, on the basis of preclinical studies only, warns of possible risks in patients with a personal or familial history of medullary carcinoma, physicians could be less prone to prescribe a GLP‐1RA in patients with thyroid nodules, which are often not reported in large databases used for retrospective observational studies.

### Long-term glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use is not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer in adults with type 2 diabetes [^111NvPDt]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Other studies have suggested potential concerns. A case‐control analysis by Bezin et al. reported a modestly elevated hazard ratio for thyroid cancer with a cumulative use of GLP‐1RA of 1–3 years compared to other second‐line diabetes medications. However, this study had notable limitations, including its non‐randomised design, reliance on medical claims data with unusually high rates of MTC, a short exposure lag, and an inability to adequately control for detection bias. Additionally, the GLP‐1RA group had a higher prevalence of obesity and thyroid disease, which are known risk factors for thyroid cancer. Pharmacovigilance data have also suggested a higher frequency of thyroid cancer in GLP‐1RA users, though these findings are limited by the voluntary nature of reporting systems and lack of robust comparator groups. A recent study by Brito et al. supports the notion that the observed increase in thyroid cancer among GLP‐1RA users may be due to enhanced detection and surveillance rather than a true increase in cancer risk, as the increase was limited to the first year after GLP‐1RA initiation.

The present study overcomes many of the limitations of existing literature. We conducted robust matching to address factors such as healthcare use, cancer screening, and biases related to psychosocial or preventative medicine, which are particularly relevant for these cancers. We also matched for obesity and a history of nodular thyroid disease, both of which can influence outcomes. Furthermore, as patient medication adherence information is unavailable in EHRs, we required an additional prescription of GLP‐1 RA within 1–3 years of the initial prescription to suggest long‐term adherence to therapy. Though a case of initial discontinuation followed by a later prescription of the medication is theoretically possible, the lower mean HbA1c observed over follow‐up with GLP‐1RA compared to other anti‐diabetic medications provides additional support for long‐term adherence to the medication. A key strength of this study is the large cohort with a long‐term follow‐up period of up‐to 10 years in the main analysis and up to‐20 years in the sensitivity analysis, which provides valuable insights into the prolonged effects of GLP‐1RA therapy.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^113zcsxb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether WEGOVY causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans, as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

WEGOVY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of WEGOVY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with WEGOVY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of WEGOVY, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, which may include persistent or severe abdominal pain (sometimes radiating to the back), and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. If acute pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue WEGOVY and initiate appropriate management.

Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether XULTOPHY 100/3.6 will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Adverse Events (ADEs)

Pancreatitis is the most feared ADE associated with the use of GLP-1 RAs, with increased odds of pancreatitis for GLP-1 RA users compared with other classes of glucose-lowering agents. While mild gastrointestinal (GI) side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort are reported and tend to improve over time, there is also potential for other severe ADEs, such as gastroparesis and GI obstruction, which often require hospitalization, particularly in the context of surgical interventions.

GLP-1 RA preclinical rodent studies demonstrate an increase in thyroid C-cell neoplasm occurrence which has led to a Food and Drug Administration black box warning. Consequently, these agents are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or those diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Another noteworthy side effect is renal dysfunction, particularly with liraglutide and exenatide. These agents are associated with instances of acute renal failure and exacerbation of chronic renal failure.

Considerations that may prompt use of an alternative class for SGLT2 inhibitors include severely reduced kidney function, history of prior amputation, severe peripheral arterial disease, active diabetic foot ulcers (caution with canagliflozin), recurrent genital candidiasis, diabetic ketoacidosis, fracture (caution with canagliflozin), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding; for GLP-1RAs, considerations include persistent nausea despite appropriate dietary education and low doses, gastroparesis, active gallbladder disease, history of MEN2 or medullary thyroid cancer, history of proliferative retinopathy (caution with semaglutide or dulaglutide), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding. Renal function notes specify that eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² is a caution for glycemic efficacy, the FDA label for canagliflozin allows use to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² in DKD, and to use clinical judgement when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if an ACE inhibitor or ARB is being started or up-titrated and renal function is impaired.

Precautions for the Use of GLP-1 RAs in Special Populations

According to EU prescribing information, GLP-1 RAs should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Based on EU labels, there is no contraindication of the use of GLP-1 RAs in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. However, based on prescribing information issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the use of dulaglutide, liraglutide, semaglutide and exenatide once weekly is contraindicated in these patients.

Gender and ethnicity have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of GLP-1 RAs; therefore, dose adjustment based on these characteristics is not required. GLP-1 RAs do not require dose adjustments based on the body weight or the body mass index.

Most GLP-1 RAs do not require dose adjustment in elderly patients. However, a lower starting dose (0.75 mg once weekly) of dulaglutide can be considered in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Also, immediate-release exenatide should be used with caution, and dose escalation from 5 to 10 mcg should proceed conservatively in patients aged > 70 years.

With the exception of exenatide, all GLP-1 RAs can be used without dose adjustments in patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 50–80 mL/min) or moderate (eGFR 30–50 mL/min) renal impairment (Fig. 1). In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min), immediate-release exenatide requires dose escalation, and exenatide once-weekly is not recommended. Liraglutide, dulaglutide and semaglutide can be used in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 to < 30 mL/min) without dose adjustment; however, the remaining GLP-1 RAs are not recommended in this population. GLP-1 RAs are not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min).

Potential safety issues

Pancreatic and thyroid risk

Beyond gastrointestinal adverse events, which are widely accepted as a class effect of GLP-1 RAs, several other safety concerns have been raised over the past decade. Initial observational signals from 2011 suggested an increased risk of acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in patients using GLP-based therapies compared to non-users (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.24, 95% CI 1.36, 3.68), leading the FDA to issue a warning on the pancreatic safety of GLP-1 RAs. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent large-scale RCTs. A meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trials found no increased risk of either acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 RA treatment (Peto OR: 1.05, 95% CI 0.78, 1.40), providing reassurance evidence against this concern in high-risk populations.

Similarly, while murine studies initially raised concerns about thyroid C-cell tumors, current human data do not suggest an increased risk. A large international cohort study across six population-based databases compared nearly 100,000 GLP-1 RA users to over 2.4 million dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor users and found no evidence of increased thyroid cancer risk (pooled weighted HR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.59, 1.12). These findings are reassuring in the short term, though long-term risk cannot be excluded due to the relatively limited follow-up duration (median 1.8–3.0 years). As such, clinical guidelines continue to recommend against prescribing GLP-1 RAs to individuals with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists in orthopaedic surgery: implications for perioperative care and outcomes: an orthopaedic surgeon's perspective [^116s91UZ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically relevant contraindications to GLP-1 RA administration for orthopaedic surgeons are worth discussing briefly. Liraglutide has a black box warning for patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a or 2b. The rapid weight loss associated with GLP-1 RAs has been linked to gall bladder-related issues such as cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. However, these events have been seen only rarely in clinical trials. Additionally, post-marketing reports have noted very rare cases of acute pancreatitis associated with liraglutide, which has prompted recommendations for providers to use caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis and to discontinue the medication at the discretion of the provider.

Finally, perioperative concerns are important to consider due to the impact of GLP-1 RAs on delayed gastric emptying and thus the increased risk of aspiration pneumonia during anesthesia. Perioperative management will be discussed in detail later in this review.

### Medullary thyroid carcinoma surveillance study: a case-series registry [^114tBbwR]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

The objectives of the MTC registry are to (a) systematically monitor the annual incidence of MTC in the United States to identify any possible increase related to the introduction of long-acting GLP-1 RAs into the U.S. market and (b) establish a registry of incident cases of MTC in adults in the United States to characterize their medical histories and possible risk factors, including history of treatment with long-acting GLP-1 RAs. The annual incidence of MTC will be documented for 15 years after each long-acting GLP-1 RA approval, or a period agreed upon with the FDA and each sponsor. Given the very low incidence of MTC in the general population, the expected rate of exposure to long-acting GLP-1 RAs, the anticipated long latency of the potential outcome, and limited data on underlying risk factors for MTC, an active surveillance program based on NAACCR data was deemed to be effective. These data obtained from NAACCR represent nationwide aggregate data on the incidence of MTC in the United States. The timeframe before the introduction of long-acting GLP-1 RAs into the U.S. marketplace (January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2009) forms the baseline data for MTC incidence.

Twenty-eight State Cancer Registries (SCRs; with an average of at least 10 reported cases of MTC per year) were invited to participate in the surveillance program. The participating SCRs represent ∼84% of the U.S. population and 85% of the annual incident MTC cases.

The incident MTC cases reported by a participating SCR are enrolled after appropriate consent. Additional information to what is provided directly from the SCR is collected by trained representatives from UBC through telephone interviews with patients. Using a standard interview questionnaire, this information includes presence of risk factors, comorbid conditions, history of diabetes, and history of exposure to long-acting GLP-1 RAs. If a patient reports treatment with a long-acting GLP-1 RA or a diagnosis of diabetes, the treating physician is requested to complete a physician verification form to confirm the information collected during the interview. Patients and physicians may receive a small honorarium compensating them for their participation in MTC registry, based on fair market value.

### The safety and tolerability of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a review [^114e6eoT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Although several classes of pharmacotherapy are available for type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control is often hampered by medication-related adverse effects and contraindications such as renal impairment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists provide a new pharmacotherapeutic option based on the multiple glucose-lowering effects of the human hormone GLP-1. This mechanism of action not only provides therapeutic efficacy but also suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists have distinct safety and tolerability concerns compared with other diabetes therapies. Stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion by GLP-1 receptor agonists is glucose dependent, conferring a lesser risk of hypoglycaemia than that seen with sulfonylureas. Individual GLP-1 receptor agonists differ in their metabolism and excretion profiles, affecting the choice of agent for patients with renal impairment. As with other protein-based therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists may induce the formation of antibodies that may attenuate therapeutic efficacy and affect safety. Conclusions on cardiovascular safety must await outcomes studies, but at present no signal of harm has been reported, and preclinical data and effects on risk markers suggest a potential for benefit. Current data on thyroid medullary cancer in humans and pancreatic malignancy in rodents do not suggest that there is any reason to restrict the clinical use of GLP-1 analogues in most people with diabetes. It is currently difficult to ascertain the possible contributory role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in increasing the risk of pancreatitis, and vigilance for signs and symptoms is prudent. Primary tolerability issues include transient gastrointestinal symptoms, common with GLP-1 receptor agonists, which can be reduced through dose titration.

### GLP-1 and calcitonin concentration in humans: lack of evidence of calcitonin release from sequential screening in over 5000 subjects with type 2 diabetes or nondiabetic obese subjects treated with the human GLP-1 analog, liraglutide [^113RGeFG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serum calcitonin (CT) is a well-accepted marker of C-cell proliferation, particularly in medullary thyroid carcinoma. Chronic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist administration in rodents has been associated with increased serum CT levels and C-cell tumor formation. There are no longitudinal studies measuring CT in humans without medullary thyroid carcinoma or a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and no published studies on the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on human serum CT concentrations.

Aim

The aim of the study was to determine serum CT response over time to the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus or nondiabetic obese subjects.

Methods

Unstimulated serum CT concentrations were measured at 3-month intervals for no more than 2 yr in a series of trials in over 5000 subjects receiving liraglutide or control therapy.

Results

Basal mean CT concentrations were at the low end of normal range in all treatment groups and remained low throughout the trials. At 2 yr, estimated geometric mean values were no greater than 1.0 ng/liter, well below upper normal ranges for males and females. Proportions of subjects whose CT levels increased above a clinically relevant cutoff of 20 ng/liter were very low in all groups. There was no consistent dose or time-dependent relationship and no consistent difference between treatment groups.

Conclusions

These data do not support an effect of GLP-1 receptor activation on serum CT levels in humans and suggest that findings previously reported in rodents may not apply to humans. However, the long-term consequences of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment are a subject of further studies.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111CJUue]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding preclinical studies, a clearer insight into the possible direct effect of GLP1‐RA on thyroid and colon tumorigenesis may be provided by recent machine learning‐enabled computational methods, which may enhance the prediction of possible expression patterns and signalling pathways of GLP‐1 receptor in thyroid and colon normal and cancer tissues.

Considering the relatively low incidence of thyroid cancer, even an increase of relative risk would determine a limited increase in absolute risk, with a number needed to harm over 1300. This possible detrimental effect of GLP‐1RA on the incidence of thyroid cancer, if confirmed, should therefore be considered in the wider context of proven benefits of therapy, such as prevention of cardiovascular disease, preventionor improvement, of type 2 diabetes and possibly other obesity‐related complications.

We already highlighted some limitations of the present study, that is, the limited sample size and study duration. In fact, the small number of recorded events for many malignancies could have prevented the observation of either beneficial or detrimental effects. Furthermore, the small number of recorded events prevented subgroup analyses for individual molecules of the class for each specific malignancy, and separate analyses for different doses for each available drug; this could be relevant, as different drugs have different effects on body weight, and weight reduction is dose‐dependent. In addition, the length of exposure to GLP‐1RA could have been insufficient to detect some longer‐term effects, increasing the chance of falsely negative results. Notably, many observational studies could have the advantage of a greater sample size, but they also usually suffer from a relatively short length of drug exposure. The fact that incident malignancies were not pre‐specified endpoints, and that cases were not formally adjudicated, is another major limitation, leading to the possibility of undetected cases and/or misdiagnosis, as already stated before. Unfortunately, a randomized trial on diabetes or obesity with cancer as a primary endpoint would be scarcely feasible, and observational studies suffer from the very same issues of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. Some further limitations of the present meta‐analysis should be considered for a correct interpretation of its results. The analysis was performed considering the overall number of incident cases, without any information on the date of onset; therefore, it was not possible to exclude early‐onset (and probably pre‐existing) malignancies, reported soon after the beginning of treatment. The subgroup analysis of shorter‐and longer‐term trials only partly surrogates the actual analysis based on time to event in individual patients. A further limitation is the specificity of the case mix: the population enrolled in clinical trials does not fully represent those receiving treatment in routine clinical practice. In particular, study protocols of most trials exclude patients at higher risk of medullary thyroid cancer. In addition, although most large‐scale trials included were performed versus placebo, the meta‐analysis also collected trials in which GLP‐1RA were compared with other active drugs; such comparators could theoretically be associated with either an increase or a reduction in the risk of certain cancers, possibly affecting results. Furthermore, it was not possible to retrieve data on the incidence of cancer from one large trial with liraglutide, although the analysis of funnel plots did not suggest selective reporting. Interestingly, analysis from this trial showed that the 5‐year cancer mortality in those with liraglutide is not different from comparators.

### Long-term glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use is not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer in adults with type 2 diabetes [^113WpBsz]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Conclusions

The clinical implications of our findings are significant. GLP‐1RAs are now integral to T2DM and obesity management, providing substantial benefits in glycaemic control, weight loss, and cardiovascular risk reduction. Misplaced concerns about thyroid cancer may deter their use, depriving patients of these well‐established benefits. Our findings, based on a decade of follow‐up, provide reassurance that long‐term GLP‐1RA use is not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. These results should support evidence‐based decision‐making, emphasising that the benefits of GLP‐1RA therapy outweigh unsubstantiated concerns about thyroid cancer risk.

### Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide in incretin physiology: role in health and disease [^1156fJkY]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

GLP-1 therapy does increase basal insulin secretion, during which levels are generally low. Moreover, GLP-1 has been shown to activate MAPK activity in both Chinese hamster ovary and rat insulinoma cells in an additive manner with insulin, and GLP-1 receptors have been identified in thyroid medullary carcinoma cells lines. Two recent population-based cohort studies detected no increase in rates of thyroid cancer in individuals using GLP-1 agonist therapy. Bea et al used claims data from the Korean National Health Insurance Database, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors were chosen as an active comparator because of their previous nonassociation with thyroid cancer. They found that GLP-1 agonists were not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer in individuals with T2DM. Pasternak et al similarly reported that GLP-1 agonist use was not associated with a substantially increased risk of thyroid cancer in a Scandinavian cohort over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, although they detected a "nominally increased risk" restricted to the first year after starting treatment. In contrast, Bezin et al performed a nested case-control analysis using the French national health care insurance system database. They reported an increased risk of all thyroid cancer, including medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, with use of GLP-1 analogues, in particular after 1 to 3 years of treatment. Thus, the performance of additional post-marketing surveillance appears to be prudent in individuals who are treated with long-acting incretin analogues for the treatment of obesity, T2DM, and other obesity-related metabolic disorders.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and risk of thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112LJ6m5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate whether there is an association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment and thyroid cancer.

Materials and Methods

In this meta-analysis of RCTs, we included studies comparing a GLP-1RA with any comparator, lasting at least 52weeks, and reporting the incidence of adverse events independently of the principal endpoint and population. All cases of thyroid cancer were collected.

Results

We retrieved 64 trials, 26 of which reported at least one incident case of thyroid cancer. GLP-1RA treatment was associated with a significant increase in the risk of overall thyroid cancer (Mantel-Haenzel odds ratio [MH-OR] 1.52 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.01, 2.29]; P = 0.04, I² = 0%), with a fragility index of 1, and a 5-year number needed to harm of 1349. The association remained significant when including only trials lasting at least 104weeks (MH-OR 1.76 [95% CI 1.00, 3.12]; P = 0.05). No significant association was found for papillary thyroid cancer (MH-OR 1.54 [95% CI 0.77, 3.06]; P = 0.22) or medullary thyroid cancer (MH-OR 1.44 [95% CI 0.23, 9.16]; P = 0.55).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis showed that GLP-1RA treatment could be associated with a moderate increase in relative risk for thyroid cancer in clinical trials, with a small increase in absolute risk. Studies of longer duration are required to assess the clinical implications of this finding.

### Exploring connections between weight-loss medications and thyroid cancer: a look at the FDA adverse event reporting system database [^115tXws5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite their effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, concerns remain about the potential link between GLP‐1RAs and thyroid cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that GLP‐1 receptor activation promotes C‐cell proliferation and increases the risk of thyroid cancer, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in rodents, likely due to higher GLP‐1 receptor expression in thyroid cells. However, human data remain inconclusive, as GLP‐1 receptors are minimally expressed in human thyroid cells. Clinical findings vary, with some studies reporting no significant changes in serum calcitonin or thyroid malignancies after long‐term liraglutide use. Others suggest an increased risk of thyroid cancer, particularly MTC, with 1–3 years of GLP‐1RA use. Pharmacovigilance data also point to a potential association with thyroid cancer, particularly with liraglutide and exenatide, emphasising the need for further research to assess the effects of chronic GLP‐1RA exposure on thyroid health, especially in individuals with premalignant lesions or occult nodules.

These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive risk assessment and regular surveillance when prescribing weight loss medications, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate their safety profiles and optimise their clinical utility in combating the global epidemic of obesity.

### Dulaglutide (Trulicity) [^113SAKhe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

In male and female rats, dulaglutide causes a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether TRULICITY will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

One case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY in a clinical trial. This patient had pretreatment calcitonin levels approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). An additional case of C-cell hyperplasia with elevated calcitonin levels following treatment was reported in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (REWIND). Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

TRULICITY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TRULICITY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TRULICITY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

### Risk of thyroid tumors with GLP-1 receptor agonists: a retrospective cohort study [^115r7wt2]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) use and risk of incident thyroid tumors.

Research Design and Methods

The retrospective, active-comparator new-user cohort study used international administrative claims and electronic health record databases. Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with prior metformin therapy initiating a GLP-1RA versus new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), and sulfonylureas (SUs). The outcome was incident thyroid tumor and thyroid malignancy. Propensity score matching and stratification were used to adjust for confounders with an intention-to-treat and on-treatment strategy. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Unmeasured confounding was evaluated using negative outcomes, with calibration of the HR.

Results

A total of 460,032 users of GLP-1RAs, 717,792 users of SGLT2is, 2,055,583 users of DPP-4is, and 1,119,868 users of SUs were included. Only U.S. cohorts passed study diagnostics. Thyroid tumor incidence ranged from 0.88 to 1.03 per 1,000 person-years in GLP-1RA cohorts. GLP-1RA exposure was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid tumors compared with SGLT2is, DPP-4is, or SUs (meta-analysis: GLP-1RA vs. SGLT2i HR range from 0.83 [95% CI 0.57–1.27] to 0.95 [0.85–1.06]; GLP-1RA vs. SU HR range from 0.95 [0.75–1.20] to 1.03 [0.87–1.23]; GLP-1RA vs. DPP-4i HR range from 0.78 [0.60–1.01] to 0.93 [0.83–1.04]). Analysis using thyroid malignancy and including a 1-year lag period produced similar conclusions.

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM initiating second-line treatments, we observed no increased risk of thyroid tumors with GLP-1RA exposure.

### Changing the approach to type 2 diabetes treatment: a comparison of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sulphonylureas across the continuum of care [^11227Ueu]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerns have been expressed regarding the effects of GLP‐1 RAs on pancreatic and thyroid tissue, since animal studies and analyses of drug databases seem to indicate an association with pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and thyroid cancer. Prescribing information in the United States for long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs contains warnings about the risk of medullary thyroid cancer, and these products are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of thyroid tumours. However, meta‐analyses, as well as information collected from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) involving the long‐term follow‐up of thousands of patients, have found insufficient evidence to support an increased risk of acute pancreatitis or cancer associated with GLP‐1 RAs. One recent meta‐analysis did, however, report increased risk of cholelithiasis with these drugs.

3.1.2 Sulphonylureas

Data from randomised controlled trials have established that although treatment with sulphonylureas can be effective in achieving glycaemic control initially; this lacks durability. Other well‐documented drawbacks of sulphonylurea use in clinical practice include the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.

Network meta‐analyses have shown that gliclazide is associated with the lowest risk of hypoglycaemia among the newer‐generation sulphonylureas, including glibenclamide, glimepiride and glipizide. In a recent population‐based, propensity‐matched cohort study, glimepride was found to be associated with a non‐significant trend towards a higher incidence of severe hypoglycaemia compared with other second‐generation sulphonylureas (glibenclamide, gliclazide, glipizide, gliquidone, glibornuride and glymidine).

The relative cardiovascular safety of GLP‐1 RAs and sulphonylureas is described in more detail in a later section of the manuscript.

### Incretin-based therapy: a powerful and promising weapon in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111jiSjP]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Safety Issues and Overall Concerns Associated With Incretin-based Therapy

In early preclinical studies in rodents, long-term exposure to the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide was associated with upregulation of calcitonin gene expression and thyroid C-cell hyperplasia, adenomas, or even carcinomas at the highest doses. Although in-vitro rodent experiments have suggested involvement of GLP-1R in C-cell neoplasia, it is important to acknowledge the species-specific differences between rodents and humans in GLP-1R expression and activity at the level of thyroid tissue, which need to be seriously considered, while trying to interpret the preclinical observations. In rodents, there is high expression and activity of GLP-1R on thyroid C-cells, while humans have low thyroid expression of GLP-1R, and GLP-1R agonists do not appear to stimulate calcitonin release to a clinically relevant degree. In the clinical setting, LEAD trials with up to 2 years duration and over 2700 enrolled patients suggested no direct carcinogenic or growth-promoting effects of liraglutide, as no patient developed medullary thyroid carcinoma.–

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^116h6kVk]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Key factors that contribute to the decision-making process

A patient with class 1 obesity may require a smaller percentage of weight loss compared to a patient with class 2/class 3 obesity. In clinical trials, patients treated with tirzepatide demonstrated greater weight loss at 3, 6 and 12 months compared with semaglutide and liraglutide.

Adverse side effects should be considered, including risks of pancreatitis, medullary thyroid cancer and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. While some clinical trial participants did develop acute pancreatitis, the cause appears to be multifactorial. Subsequent large meta-analyses following these trials have shown no increased risk of pancreatitis in patients using GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Regarding medullary thyroid cancer, studies in rodent models indicated a potential risk, but this has not been observed in human subjects. The risk was found to be dose dependent, and the doses that induced this rare form of thyroid cancer (which accounts for less than 3%–4% of all thyroid cancers) were significantly higher than the maximum human dose used in clinical practice. These findings suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer in humans is minimal and not a major concern at standard therapeutic doses.

While up to 80% of study participants reported experiencing GI side effects, the majority experienced only mild-to-moderate symptoms often managed by dietary adjustments, and relatively few discontinued treatment due to these effects during clinical trials.

Finally, a key benefit of these medications is that they can be discontinued suddenly without the need for tapering or risk of withdrawal symptoms or adverse effects. However, as demonstrated in clinical studies, discontinuation often leads to worsening glycaemia and weight regain, which can further increase the risk of poor diabetes management.

### No calcitonin change in a person taking dulaglutide diagnosed with pre-existing medullary thyroid cancer [^111iwzzA]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

The participant was a 56‐year‐old white woman with no personal or family history of endocrine neoplasms. Relevant medical history included Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, oesophageal reflux, and obesity (BMI 30.6 kg/m²); she was a non‐smoker with no reported alcohol use.

She received once‐weekly dulaglutide 2.0 mg for Type 2 diabetes. Regular calcitonin monitoring was initiated after reports during the AWARD‐5 study of the potential effect of long‐acting GLP‐1RAs in animals 17. Table 1 shows a timeline noting calcitonin measurements and other events. At the 6‐month discontinuation visit, the woman's fasting calcitonin level was elevated [61.7 pg/ml (18.05 pmol/l); reference range 0.0–11.5 pg/ml (0.0–3.36 pmol/l); Table 1].

Table 1
Serum calcitonin by weeks following randomization into the AWARD‐5 study

The woman's baseline calcitonin level was measured using stored serum and was elevated [91.5 pg/ml (26.77 pmol/l); Table 1]. She was not taking GLP‐1RA or dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors at baseline. She was taking omeprazole, which may increase serum calcitonin, although not typically above 20 pg/ml (5.85 pmol/l) 18. Thyroid ultrasonography showed multiple small bilateral nodules, the largest 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.8 cm in the left lobe. Twelve weeks after dulaglutide was discontinued (week 23), serum calcitonin remained elevated and unchanged (Table 1). A fineneedle aspiration of the large left lobe nodule was consistent with a follicular neoplasm.

### The ascending GLP-1 road from clinical safety to reduction of cardiovascular complications [^115J3zLw]. Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) was originally identified as a gut-derived incretin hormone that lowered glycemia through potentiation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Subsequent studies expanded the actions of GLP-1 to include inhibition of glucagon secretion, gastric emptying, and appetite, collectively useful attributes for a glucose-lowering agent. The introduction of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of diabetes was associated with questions surrounding their safety, principally with regard to medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, yet cardiovascular outcome trials subsequently revealed reductions in rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death with a paucity of major safety signals. We discuss the controversies, unanswered questions, and established use of GLP-1R agonists from a mechanistic and clinical perspective. We highlight methods for detection and cellular sites of GLP-1R expression, key uncertainties, recent insights, and experimental caveats surrounding the use of GLP-1R agonists for the treatment of diabetes and the reduction of diabetes-related complications.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists: differentiating the new medications [^111kSbCe]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) should not use liraglutide.MTC is an extremely rare form of thyroid cancer, with a prevalence rate of less than 600 new cases per year in the United States. In preclinical studies, liraglutide given to rodents in doses many times greater than the maximal doses anticipated in humans increased the incidence of C-cell tumors. Similar increases in clinical markers and the development of C-cell tumors have been seen in rodent studies involving other GLP-1 agonists, including exenatide, taspoglutide, and lixsenatide. In human volunteer studies, no link between liraglutide and C-cell tumors has ever been identified, and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that the risk of thyroid cancer among humans treated with liraglutide was low.GLP-1 receptor activation and expression appears to be species-specific;20 months of liraglutide treatment at 60 times the normal human exposure levels failed to induce C-cell pathology in monkeys. Mean calcitonin levels in patients exposed to liraglutide for 2 years also remained at the lower end of normal, when compared with placebo and comparator drugs in the clinical trials. Elevated levels of calcitonin (> 20 pg/mL) can be indicative of C-cell pathology in humans. However, the FDA has indicated that monitoring calcitonin levels in liraglutide-treated patients is not recommended.

3 Results

3.1 Population Characteristics

From 2004 to 2024, a total of 14,370 adverse events (AEs) related to drug‐induced thyroid cancer were reported. The year 2021 recorded the highest number of reported cases, exceeding 4000, as illustrated in Figure 1. The clinical characteristics of these reports are summarised in Table 1. The majority of patients were adults aged 18 to 64, with a predominance of female cases. The reported outcomes were mostly generic (e.g. "cancer" or "neoplasm") and less frequently specified by pathology. Among classified cases, papillary thyroid cancer accounted for 9.1%, followed by medullary thyroid cancer at 1.5%. Geographically, most reports originated from the United States (44.85%), with additional reports from Canada (3.4%), Japan (1.1%) and Germany (0.81%).

### Liraglutide (Victoza) [^117UEu8Y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether VICTOZA will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with VICTOZA have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and VICTOZA use in humans.

VICTOZA is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of VICTOZA and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with VICTOZA. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in

patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, including VICTOZA [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of VICTOZA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue VICTOZA and initiate appropriate management.

5.3 Never Share a VICTOZA Pen Between Patients

VICTOZA pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

Liraglutide 3.0 mg is contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of thyroid C cell tumors due to a suspected risk based on preclinical data. However, in a phase 3 trial, no case of medullary thyroid carcinoma or C cell hyperplasia was observed in patients after 3 years of treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg. Breast cancer was reported more often in patients receiving liraglutide 3.0 mg than those receiving placebo (0.7% and 0.2%, respectively); however, the cases were too few to determine whether liraglutide has an effect on pre-existing breast neoplasia.

An increase in heart rate of 2–3 bpm was observed with liraglutide 3.0 mg; however, in a large cardiovascular outcomes trial (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER]), liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with cardiovascular benefits. Regulatory authorities have accepted that findings from liraglutide 1.8 mg are relevant to the cardiovascular safety profile of liraglutide 3.0 mg, and this is reflected by the inclusion of LEADER data in the European and U.S. labels.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (exenatide, dulaglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide; note: liraglutide 3 mg dose FDA-approved for long-term weight management) demonstrate weight-loss effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with a Cochrane review reporting weight loss of 2.87 kg for exenatide and 3.24 kg for liraglutide across 17 randomized controlled trials (6,899 participants; 26 weeks), and an open-label T2DM trial noting a mean baseline BMI approximately 34 kg/m2 with weight loss of 5.6 kg with semaglutide and 1.9 kg with exenatide; in a Phase 2 trial in patients with obesity (without DM), weight loss was significantly higher in all semaglutide groups versus placebo and compared to 3.0 mg liraglutide at semaglutide doses of 0.2 mg per day or more. Nausea is common and tends to subside with continuation of therapy, and dose escalation may be done more slowly if GI intolerance occurs. Although pancreatitis risk is a concern, in LEADER (n = 9,340 T2DM) acute pancreatitis numbers were higher with placebo (23, 0.5%, 1.7 events/1,000 patient-years of observation [PYO]) than with liraglutide (18, 0.4%, 1.1 events/1,000 PYO). Due to rat and mice data with increased C-cell tumors, there is a boxed warning of thyroid C-cell (medullary) tumor risk and GLP-1 agonists are contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).

### GLP-1RA use and thyroid cancer risk [^112HK3bG]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The increasing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) demands a better understanding of their association with thyroid cancer.

Objective

To estimate the risk of incident thyroid cancer among adults with type 2 diabetes being treated with GLP-1RA vs other common glucose-lowering medications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study using claims data for enrollees in commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare fee-for-service plans across the US. Eligible participants were adults with type 2 diabetes at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease and without history of thyroid cancer who had newly filled prescriptions for GLP-1RA, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), or sulfonylurea from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed February 1 to October 31, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall and piecewise (< 1, 1–2, and ≥ 2 years since treatment initiation) hazard ratios (HRs) for thyroid cancer with use of GLP-1RA vs the other 3 drug classes were estimated using inverse propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Modified intention-to-treat (mITT) (primary) and as-treated (sensitivity) analyses were performed.

Results

Of 351 913 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [8.5] years; 173 391 [49.3%] females and 178 522 [50.7%] males), 41 112 started treatment with GLP-1RA; 76 093, with DPP4i; 43 499, with SGLT2i; and 191 209, with sulfonylurea therapy. The numbers of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer were 69 (0.17%) in the GLP-1RA group, 172 (0.23%) in the DPP4i group, 72 (0.17%) in the SGLT2i group, and 381 (0.20%) in the sulfonylurea group. In the mITT analysis, GLP-1RA initiation was not significantly associated with increased overall risk for thyroid cancer compared to the other 3 diabetes drugs (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.88–1.76). However, the risk for thyroid cancer was significantly higher within the first year after GLP-1RA initiation (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11–3.08) and was amplified in the overall as-treated analysis that censored patients when therapy was discontinued or another medication was added (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10–3.95).

Conclusions and Relevance

This secondary analysis of a target trial emulation of a comparative effectiveness study found that despite the low absolute risk of thyroid cancer among patients receiving GLP-1RA therapy, there was an increased risk of new thyroid cancer diagnoses within the first year of GLP-1RA initiation compared to 3 other diabetes drugs. This finding may have been due to enhanced early detection; therefore, further research is necessary to understand the underlying causes of this association.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^114ttjQK]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

While there is no definitive evidence of a causal association between semaglutide and acute pancreatitis, we would advocate the use of oral semaglutide with caution in patients with prior history of pancreatitis, be that idiopathic or precipitated by a specific aetiological factor, such as, for example, gallstone pancreatitis.

Patients with T2D and with prior bariatric surgery may be considered as appealing candidates for a GLP-1 RA. A study assessing the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in people with persistent or recurrent T2D after bariatric surgery demonstrated that liraglutide treatment was associated with a difference of − 1.22% (95% confidence interval − 19.7 to − 7.0; p = 0·0001) in HbA1c change from baseline to 26 weeks and no difference in the frequency of adverse events, compared with placebo. The effects of bariatric surgery and in particular the different surgical modalities on the absorption, and thus clinical efficacy, of oral semaglutide have not been studied, as such we would recommend the use of oral semaglutide with caution in patients with T2D and prior bariatric surgery.

Oral semaglutide increases the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours in certain settings. A meta-analysis of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs in people with T2D showed no increased risk in comparison with other treatments; however, there are documented cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma in people with T2D treated with the GLP-1 RA liraglutide, although a causal relationship is not established. We therefore recommend caution in the use of oral semaglutide in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, we do not recommend prescribing oral semaglutide in people with T2D with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, guidance which is in accordance with the licence.

Oral semaglutide is not indicated as a treatment in people with type 1 diabetes, for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), or in those with a history of DKA. DKA has been documented in insulin-dependent people with T2D that initiate GLP-1 RAs, who rapidly discontinue insulin therapy ahead of initiation.

### Approach to the patient with thyroid nodules: considering GLP-1 receptor agonists [^1145Td19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) have rapidly changed the landscape of diabetes and obesity treatment. Enthusiasm for their use is tempered with concerns regarding their risk for inducing C-cell tumors based on preclinical studies in rodents. A black-box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration recommends against using GLP1RA in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A or 2B (MEN2), providing clear guidance regarding this cohort of patients. However, emerging data also suggest an increased incidence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in patients treated with these agents. Other studies, though, have not confirmed an association between GLP1RAs and DTC. With conflicting results concerning thyroid cancer risk, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal approach to screening patients prior to initiating the medications and/or evaluating for thyroid cancer during GLP1RA treatment. Within the context of patient cases, this review will summarize the existing data, describe ongoing controversies, and outline future areas for research regarding thyroid cancer risk with GLP1RA use.

3.3.3 Thyroid cancer

We retrieved 94 cases of thyroid cancer in 28 studies enrolling 46 412 and 41 053 patients in GLP‐1RA and comparator groups, respectively, with a mean duration of treatment of 90.3 weeks (125 235 and 117 303 patient*years in treatment and comparator groups, respectively), without any suspected publication bias (Figure S8). In another 22 studies, enrolling 10 336 and 6904 patients in GLP‐1RA and comparator groups, respectively, with a mean duration of treatment of 77 weeks (18351and 14 023 patient*years in treatment and comparator groups, respectively), no cases of thyroid cancer were reported. A significant increase in the incidence of thyroid cancers was observed in GLP‐1 RA arms (MH‐OR 1.55, 95% CI [1.05, 2.27], p = 0.03, I² = 0%, Figures 4 and S9), without any significant difference between different drugs (p = 0.79 for subgroup differences, Figure S10). We performed a sensitivity analysis excluding open‐label trials, obtaining similar results (MH‐OR 1.52, 95% CI [1.02, 2.27], p = 0.04, I² = 0). Notably, the effect of GLP‐1RA on thyroid cancer was significant only in trials with longer durations. However, the difference across groups of trials with different durations did not reach statistical significance (Figure S9).

3.3.4 Colorectal cancer

Fifteen studies reported at least one case of colorectal cancer, without any sign of publication bias (Figure S11). The incidence of colorectal cancer was higher in the GLP‐1RA arm (MH‐OR 1.27 [1.03, 1.57], p = 0.03, I² = 0%, Figures 4 and S12); notably, the difference between treatment arms was statistically significant in shorter (up to 104 weeks) trials (MH‐OR 2.28 [1.04, 4.98]; p = 0.04), but not in those longer than 104 weeks (MH‐OR 1.20 [0.96, 1.50]), although the difference between groups of trials did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12, Figure S12); the difference between different molecules was not significant as well (p = 0.98, Figure S13).

### Investigating the association between incretin-based therapies and thyroid cancer incidence among US Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes [^116qgnFE]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Preclinical studies suggest a potential link between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and thyroid cancer (TC), yet it is unclear if this risk translates to humans.

Research Design and Methods

We estimated the comparative effect of incretin-based therapies (GLP-1RA and dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i)) versus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) on TC incidence among US older adults with type 2 diabetes. We defined TC as a thyroidectomy followed by ≥ 2 separate diagnoses codes for malignant neoplasm of thyroid gland within 90 days. We estimated adjusted 3-year cumulative risk differences of TC (aRDs) with 95% CIs using weighted Kaplan-Meier survival functions, and adjusted HRs using weighted Cox models.

Results

We included 73388 new users in the GLP-1RA versus SGLT-2i cohort (mean age 72.4 years, men: 48.3%) and 106274 in the DPP-4i versus SGLT-2i cohort (mean age 74.6 years, men: 44.9%). At 3 years and a median duration of treatment of 0.82–1.15 years, the aRD for GLP-1RA versus SGLT-2i for TC was -23 per 10000 (95% CI: -51 to 4) and the aRD for DPP-4i versus SGLT-2i was -2 per 10000 (95% CI: -17 to 13). Secondary and sensitivity analyses were consistent.

Conclusions

Our study of US Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes suggests that the initiation of incretin-based therapies may not increase the 3-year risk of TC compared with initiation of SGLT-2i. This finding offers reassurance for short-term use but does not eliminate the possibility of increased long-term or subtype-specific risks.

### Long-term glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use is not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer in adults with type 2 diabetes [^111HLbfX]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity, but their potential association with thyroid cancer remains a concern. This study assessed thyroid cancer risk with long-term GLP-1RA use in a large real-world cohort.

Methods

We conducted a propensity score matched cohort study using electronic health records from TriNetX, including 89,646 adults with T2DM who initiated GLP-1RA therapy between 2014 and 2020, and demonstrated continued use for at least 1 year. Active comparator controls included users of insulin, metformin, sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. The primary outcome was the incidence of thyroid cancer.

Results

During a median follow-up of 4.5 ± 2.3 years, GLP-1RA use was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer compared with any of the other antidiabetic medications. As expected, GLP-1RA use was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c levels, while the negative control outcome remained unaffected. Findings remained consistent across subgroups stratified by sex, age, obesity-status, glycaemic-control, and GLP-1RA type and in multiple sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

In this large real-world cohort study, long-term GLP-1RA use was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer. These findings provide reassurance for the safety of GLP-1RAs and support their continued evidence-based use in clinical practice.

### Incretin therapies: highlighting common features and differences in the modes of action of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [^112pPbgR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Preclinical studies indicated liraglutide could increase the risk of C‐cell proliferation and medullary thyroid adenomas and carcinomas (MTCs) in rodents via GLP‐1R activation and calcitonin release 36; however, compared with rodents, human and non‐human primates have far fewer C‐cells that express lower levels of GLP‐1Rs and do not release calcitonin (a biomarker for human MTC) in response to GLP‐1 36. In accordance with these observations, a 2‐year clinical study could not demonstrate plasma calcitonin increases in patients treated with liraglutide 36, even in high doses used to treat obesity 75. Despite the FDA concluding that there is a low risk of carcinoma development in humans, liraglutide remains contraindicated in patients with a history of MTC. Epidemiological and animal studies are currently underway to explore possible associations between liraglutide and MTC and liraglutide clinical trials [NCT01179048 (LEADER)] are monitoring calcitonin levels and analysing the incidence of MTC. Patients at elevated risk of MTC (familial MTC, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2) should not be treated with incretin‐based drugs. The same reasoning applies to other GLP‐1RAs 76.

### GLP-1RA use and thyroid cancer risk… [^115zmuXd]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the association between initiation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and incident thyroid cancer. Findings This secondary analysis of a retrospective emulation of an idealized target trial involving 351 913 adults with type 2 diabetes at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease and without prior thyroid cancer found an increased risk of thyroid cancer diagnosis in those starting GLP-1RA therapy compared to other diabetes medications that was apparent only in the first year after GLP-1RA initiation. Meaning These findings indicate that GLP-1RA initiation was associated with new diagnosis of thyroid cancer only in the short term, likely due to increased vigilance and case detection rather than de novo pathogenesis. Importance The increasing use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists demands a better understanding of their association with thyroid cancer.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^115kmcxM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate whether use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists is associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer.

Design

Scandinavian cohort study.

Setting

Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 2007–21.

Participants

Patients who started GLP1 receptor agonist treatment were compared with patients who started dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor treatment, and in an additional analysis, patients who started sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor treatment.

Main outcome measures

Thyroid cancer identified from nationwide cancer registers. An active-comparator new user study design was used to minimise risks of confounding and time related biases from using real world studies of drug effects. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios, controlling for potential confounders with propensity score weighting.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 3.9 years (standard deviation 3.5 years) in the GLP1 receptor agonist group and 5.4 years (standard deviation 3.5 years) in the DPP4 inhibitor group. 76 of 145 410 patients (incidence rate 1.33 events per 10 000 person years) treated with GLP1 receptor agonists and 184 of 291 667 patients (incidence rate 1.46 events per 10 000 person years) treated with DPP4 inhibitors developed thyroid cancer. GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.31; rate difference −0.13, 95% confidence interval −0.61 to 0.36 events per 10 000 person years). The hazard ratio for medullary thyroid cancer was 1.19 (0.37 to 3.86). In the additional analysis comparing the GLP1 receptor agonist group with the SGLT2 inhibitor group, the hazard ratio for thyroid cancer was 1.16 (0.65 to 2.05).

Conclusions

In this large cohort study using nationwide data from three countries, GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with a substantially increased risk of thyroid cancer over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years. In the main analysis comparing GLP1 receptor agonists with DPP4 inhibitors, the upper limit of the confidence interval was consistent with no more than a 31% increase in relative risk.

Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer

Amongst those with T2DM, findings from meta-analyses of the CVOTs suggest no increased risk of either disorder with use of individual GLP-1 RAs or the medications as a class. However, in a population using GLP-1 RAs for obesity management without history of diabetes, increased risk of pancreatitis associated with the GLP-1 RAs was found compared to bupropion-naltrexone (HR 9.1, 95%CI 1.25–66.0) suggesting the risk benefit ratio of these medications is influenced by underlying disease state. Studies evaluating the potential risk from dual and triple agonists are needed.

The relationship between risk of thyroid cancer and use of GLP-1 RAs is not well understood and the mechanisms promoting potential unfavorable effects of the drug on the thyroid is not well defined. When specific GLP-1 RAs were evaluated compared to placebo and other antidiabetic drugs, liraglutide was found to increase risk of thyroid disorders by 37% and dulaglutide in similar comparisons increased risk by 96%. No effects on risk were noted for semaglutide, lixisenatide, exenatide, nor albiglutide in which relative risks were not significant. During its meeting in October 2023, The European Medical Association (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluded that the available evidence does not support a causal association between the GLP-1RA)–exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, and lixisenatide–and cancer of the thyroid.

### Diabetes and cancer: two diseases with obesity as a common risk factor [^112YW8s3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Owing to the conflicting results from different trials, the risk of pancreatitis at present can be neither proposed nor excluded. Prospective long-term studies are needed to properly quantify these risks.

Similar concerns have been raised for the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide and the risk for thyroid cancer. Liraglutide has been shown to be associated with the development of malignant C-cell carcinoma and thyroid C-cell focal hyperplasia in rats and mice, and as a result, it is recommended that it be prescribed only in cases where the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the risks. Liraglutide is currently included in a cancer registry which will monitor its long-term effects over 15 years. To date, there is no evidence suggesting that use of liraglutide in humans might be associated with any thyroid pathology.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^114hakhq]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this cohort study using nationwide data from three countries, GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with a substantially increased risk of thyroid cancer over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years. The study was based on more than 145 000 patients who started GLP1 receptor agonist treatment and had high statistical precision; given the upper limit of the confidence interval, the findings are incompatible with an increased relative risk of thyroid cancer of more than 31%. In absolute terms, this translates to no more than 0.36 excess events per 10 000 person years, which should be interpreted against the background incidence of 1.46 per 10 000 person years in the comparator group in the study population. Findings were neutral, but less precise for specific subtypes of thyroid cancer, including medullary thyroid cancer, and robust in several additional analyses, including when an alternative comparator group was used. However, the study cannot exclude a small increase in risk.

### Semaglutide (Ozempic) [^111C8ckR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether OZEMPIC causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of semaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

OZEMPIC is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of OZEMPIC and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with OZEMPIC. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low-test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of OZEMPIC, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue OZEMPIC and initiate appropriate management.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115WXeG6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess if there is a difference in the oncogenic risk between GLP-1 RA and comparators in randomized controlled trials.

Materials and Methods

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing GLP-1RA to any comparators for diabetes and/or obesity, lasting at least 52weeks. The endpoints included the incidence of overall cancers and single malignancies.

Results

Fifty trials were included. GLP-1RA treatment was not associated with a significant difference in risk for overall cancer (MH-OR 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.98, 1.13]). Uterine cancer was significantly reduced in the GLP-1RA arm in trials performed in subjects with obesity (MH-OR 0.24, 95% CI [0.06, 0.94]), but not in those aimed at diabetes treatment (MH-OR 0.92, [0.58, 1.47]). We detected an increase in the risk for thyroid cancer (MH-OR 1.55, [1.05, 2.27]), more evident in longer-term trials, and in the risk for colorectal cancer (MH-OR 1.27 [1.03, 1.57]), which, conversely, was significant only in shorter-term trials. No significant difference in the risk was detected for any other cancer.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RA do not appear to produce an effect on most malignancies in clinical trials. A reduction of very close obesity-associated cancers seems possible, whereas a risk signal for thyroid cancer was observed, prompting the need for further specific studies. On the other hand, the small increase observed in colorectal cancer in shorter-term trials may be the effect of a disproportionate increase in diagnostic procedures in the GLP-1 RA arm, because of the suspicion raised by common side effects of GLP-1 RA.

Overview of Prescribing Information/Package Insert of GLP-1 RAs in South Asia

An overview of the prescribing information/package insert of GLP-1 RAs pertaining to all GLP-1 RAs approved in South Asia as well as the ones to be launched in the near future is provided in Table 8 with a brief summary as follows.

Table 8
Overview of the prescribing information/package insert of GLP-1 RAs in South Asia

CV cardiovascular, CVD cardiovascular disease, GI gastrointestinal, GLP - 1 RA glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, MEN2 multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, MTC medullary thyroid carcinoma, T1DM type 1 diabetes mellitus, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus

GLP-1 RAs including dulaglutide, exenatide BID, liraglutide, lixisenatide and semaglutide are indicated in adults with T2DM as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control. Dulaglutide is even recommended as monotherapy in India. In addition to glycaemic control, liraglutide has been indicated in adults with established CVD to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. GLP-1 RAs are contraindicated in patients with prior hypersensitivity to the respective drug or any product components, personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). These GLP-1 RAs are not to be used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetes ketoacidosis. In case of suspected pancreatitis, GLP-1 RAs are to be discontinued and should not be restarted if pancreatitis is confirmed.

A detailed description on the use of GLP-1 RA in special populations and AEs common for GLP-1 RAs is given in the following sections.

JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2025; 151: 641–642. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2025.0602 In Reply We appreciate the thoughtful comments from Gamarra et al and Yalamanchi et al regarding our study on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and thyroid cancer risk. 1 Gamarra et al advised caution in interpreting the findings, as GLP-1RA use showed no overall association with thyroid cancer and the observed first-year association was small. However, the observed risk doubled during the first year of treatment, which supports our hypothesis that increased diagnoses likely reflected short-term surveillance effects rather than sustained risk or carcinogenicity.

Furthermore, the wide confidence interval and lower precision stemmed from low event rates, underscoring the need for large observational studies as a complement to clinical trials to assess such rare events.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^1123BArJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

### Do GLP-1-based therapies increase cancer risk? [^1171LXMX]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Regarding the controversy of whether GLP-1–based therapy can increase the risk for specific malignant disease like pancreatic carcinoma and thyroid cancer, our conclusion is that apparently there is neither firm evidence in favor of this hypothesis nor evidence strong enough to rule out any such increased risk based on results available at present. We may learn answers to some of the questions from ongoing randomized controlled trials (e.g. cardiovascular safety trials underway for most approved compounds within the classes of GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors) by analyzing databases or registries better suited for an unbiased postmarketing surveillance of adverse events associated with novel antidiabetes drugs. However, as of today the evidence in favor of the hypothesis that incretin-based medications cause specific types of malignant disease (e.g. pancreatic or [medullary] thyroid cancer) or increase the risk for cancer in a more general sense is not convincing enough to be seriously considered when making treatment decisions regarding the choice of antidiabetes medications.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer: scandinavian cohort study [^116AnYJ3]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists is associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer.

Design

Scandinavian cohort study.

Setting

Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 2007–21.

Participants

Patients who started GLP1 receptor agonist treatment were compared with patients who started dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor treatment, and in an additional analysis, patients who started sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Thyroid cancer identified from nationwide cancer registers. An active-comparator new user study design was used to minimise risks of confounding and time related biases from using real world studies of drug effects. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios, controlling for potential confounders with propensity score weighting.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 3.9 years (standard deviation 3.5 years) in the GLP1 receptor agonist group and 5.4 years (standard deviation 3.5 years) in the DPP4 inhibitor group. 76 of 145410 patients (incidence rate 1.33 events per 10000 person years) treated with GLP1 receptor agonists and 184 of 291667 patients (incidence rate 1.46 events per 10000 person years) treated with DPP4 inhibitors developed thyroid cancer. GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.31; rate difference -0.13, 95% confidence interval -0.61 to 0.36 events per 10000 person years). The hazard ratio for medullary thyroid cancer was 1.19 (0.37 to 3.86). In the additional analysis comparing the GLP1 receptor agonist group with the SGLT2 inhibitor group, the hazard ratio for thyroid cancer was 1.16 (0.65 to 2.05).

Conclusions

In this large cohort study using nationwide data from three countries, GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with a substantially increased risk of thyroid cancer over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years. In the main analysis comparing GLP1 receptor agonists with DPP4 inhibitors, the upper limit of the confidence interval was consistent with no more than a 31% increase in relative risk.

### Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) [^114NAiXU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Liraglutide (Saxenda) [^111RxiP3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether SAXENDA will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans.

Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of SAXENDA and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with SAXENDA. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease.

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of SAXENDA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue SAXENDA and initiate appropriate management.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk of thyroid cancer [^116CEXcf]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA) is associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer.

Research Design and Methods

A nested case-control analysis was performed with use of the French national health care insurance system (SNDS) database. Individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with second-line antidiabetes drugs between 2006 and 2018 were included in the cohort. All thyroid cancers were identified through hospital discharge diagnoses and medical procedures between 2014 and 2018. Exposure to GLP-1 RA was measured within the 6 years preceding a 6-month lag-time period and considered as current use and cumulative duration of use based on defined daily dose (≤ 1, 1 to 3, > 3 years). Case subjects were matched with up to 20 control subjects on age, sex, and length of diabetes with the risk-set sampling procedure. Risk of thyroid cancer related to use of GLP-1 RA was estimated with a conditional logistic regression with adjustment for goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, other antidiabetes drugs, and social deprivation index.

Results

A total of 2,562 case subjects with thyroid cancers were included in the study and matched with 45,184 control subjects. Use of GLP-1 RA for 1–3 years was associated with increased risk of all thyroid cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.27–1.95) and medullary thyroid cancer (adjusted HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.04–3.05).

Conclusions

In the current study we found increased risk of all thyroid cancer and medullary thyroid cancer with use of GLP-1 RA, in particular after 1–3 years of treatment.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: nonglycemic clinical effects in weight loss and beyond [^1174Gr23]. Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Thus, it appears that prescribers of GLP-1 receptor agonists should be aware of the association of this class with pancreatitis, and should have a high degree of suspicion should the patient develop severe abdominal pain, with or without nausea and vomiting.

All drugs in this class carry a boxed warning on their package inserts regarding thyroid C-cell tumors. Such tumors have been observed in rodent studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists at clinically relevant exposures, although there has been no association of human C-cell tumors with these drugs. Nevertheless, the labels are required to specify a contraindication, in the case of patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, or with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

Table 3
Additional analyses of GLP1 receptor agonist use and risk of thyroid cancer

CI = confidence interval; DPP4 = dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP1 = glucagon-like peptide 1; SGLT2 = sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.

In additional analyses that used an alternative as-treated definition for drug use, the mean follow-up time among patients who started GLP1 receptor agonists was 1.8 years in the analysis with 90 day gap and tail periods, 2.6 years in the analysis with one year gap and tail periods, and 2.9 years in the analysis with two year gap and tail periods. The hazard ratios for the full follow-up period in these analyses was 1.37 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 2.23), 1.04 (0.69 to 1.57), and 0.99 (0.67 to 1.46), respectively. The pattern of association reflected that of the main intention-to-treat analysis, with point estimates less than 1.0 in the as-treated analyses with a one year lag and with increased hazard ratios in the as-treated analyses restricted to the first year after starting treatment. In post hoc robustness analyses assessing the impact of competing risk of death, the risk ratios for thyroid cancer at five years of follow-up were 0.80 (0.58 to 1.14) with death as a censoring event and 0.82 (0.59 to 1.16) with death as a competing event. At 10 years of follow-up, the risk ratios for thyroid cancer were 1.00 (0.72 to 1.37) with death as a censoring event and 1.01 (0.74 to 1.39) with death as a competing event.

For the additional analysis that compared GLP1 receptor agonists with SGLT2 inhibitors, the flowchart for inclusion and the baseline characteristics are shown in efigure 1 and etable 4, respectively. This analysis included a cohort of 111 744 patients who started GLP1 receptor agonist treatment and 148 179 patients who started SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. GLP1 receptor agonist use was not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer compared with SGLT2 inhibitor use (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 2.05; table 3, efigure 2).

### Exploring connections between weight-loss medications and thyroid cancer: a look at the FDA adverse event reporting system database [^113NryQc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Some studies, on the other hand, found an increased risk of cancer in these patients with long‐term use. Namely, the study by Bezin et al. found an increased risk for developing medullary thyroid cancer in patients using GLP‐1 agonists for 1–3 years, with an adjusted HR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.04–3.05) and an adjusted HR of 1.58 (95% CI 1.27–1.95) for all thyroid cancers.

A meta‐analysis by Silverii et al. also found a significant increased risk of thyroid cancer in these patients with an odds ratio of 1.52 ([95% CI 1.01, 2.29]; p = 0.04, I2 = 0%), with a 5‐year number needed to harm of 1349. The results were not significant when then stratified by cancer type (papillary or medullary).

A recent study utilising the French National Health Cancer Data System found that using GLP‐1RAs for 1 to 3 years was associated with an increased risk of all thyroid cancers (adjusted HR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.04–3.05). These findings align with current package warnings for GLP‐1RAs, which highlight their contraindication in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2) and emphasise counselling patients about the potential risk of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and symptoms of thyroid tumors.

However, definitive evidence linking GLP‐1RAs to increased cancer incidence remains elusive, primarily due to methodological challenges. Lag‐time bias and the relatively short duration of clinical trials limit their ability to capture long‐term cancer outcomes. Extended follow‐up periods and larger‐scale observational studies are needed to clarify this potential association further.

AACE 2022 diabetes — glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 2 diabetes: GLP-1 RAs are associated with weight loss and with modest decreases in blood pressure accompanied by a small increase in pulse rate, and currently approved agents (dulaglutide, exenatide, exenatide-ER, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide) can be administered by injection on a twice daily, daily, or once weekly basis, with an orally administered form of semaglutide also available. These agents are often used as add-on therapies for persons with inadequately controlled diabetes despite metformin therapy, and studies show equivalent or slightly better A1C lowering with the advantage of 2- to 3-kg weight loss and little or no additional hypoglycemia. Liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide have demonstrated reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in cardiovascular outcomes trials, and guidelines recommend use of GLP-1 RAs before initiation of insulin for most individuals with type 2 diabetes. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. All GLP-1 RAs except twice-daily exenatide and lixisenatide are contraindicated in persons with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, and the FDA states that ongoing monitoring for medullary thyroid carcinoma (e.g., calcitonin levels) is not needed.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and thyroid cancer: a narrative review [^113R2VwB]. Thyroid (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are highly effective medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Pharmacological studies in rodents support an association between the use of GLP-1 RAs and the development of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) resulting in a black box warning for these agents in patients at risk for this condition. Yet, the association between GLP-1 RAs and non-MTC remains controversial. Excessive worry about unproven thyroid cancer risk might lead to underutilizing GLP-1 RAs in patients who could otherwise experience substantial benefits. Unwarranted concerns about thyroid cancer could lead to unnecessary thyroid cancer screening and harms from overdiagnosis. Summary: The body of evidence assessing the association between GLP-1 RA use and thyroid cancer spans a wide range of methodologies, including basic and translational research investigating biological plausibility; randomized trials assessing clinical efficacy and providing the strongest evidence for causality; observational studies providing real-life outcome evaluation in larger populations but with limited evaluation of covariates or dependable outcome definitions; and pharmacovigilance studies that provide postmarketing assessments of a safety signal but do not address causality. There is biological plausibility supporting an association between GLP-1 RA and MTC in rodents, which is less clear for non-MTC in humans. Clinical evidence from randomized trials and associated meta-analysis suggest thyroid cancer as a rare event making effect estimates imprecise but without conclusive and consistent evidence of increase risk in those receiving GLP-1 RA. Observational studies at higher risk of bias also show low event rates for thyroid cancer, with effect estimates that are inconsistent among different studies. Pharmacovigilance studies consistently show a signal of increased reporting of thyroid cancer in patients treated with GLP-1 RA. Conclusions: Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates occurrence of thyroid cancer is infrequent in individuals exposed to GLP-1 RA. Observational studies at higher risk of bias yield inconsistent results. Overall there is no conclusive evidence of elevated thyroid cancer risk. These findings can help clinicians when addressing patient's concerns about a potential yet unproven link between GLP-1 RA therapy and thyroid cancer.

### The safety of incretin-based therapies – review of the scientific evidence [^111ofQHL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Antidiabetic therapies based on potentiation of incretin action are now widely used; however, understanding of their long-term safety remains incomplete.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched articles in PubMed for data assessing the safety of incretin-based therapies.

Evidence Synthesis

Three major areas of interest are reviewed: incretin action in the cardiovascular system, pancreatitis, and cancer. Incretin therapies reduce weight gain, minimize hypoglycemia, decrease inflammation, and are cardioprotective in preclinical studies. However, data permitting conclusions about whether incretin therapies modify the development of cardiovascular events in humans are not available. Case reports link incretin therapies to pancreatitis, but retrospective case control studies do not associate pancreatitis with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Preclinical studies of pancreatitis have yielded conflicting results, and mechanisms linking incretin receptor activation to pancreatic inflammation have not yet been forthcoming. GLP-1R activation promotes C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer in rodents; however, long-term clinical studies of sufficient size and duration to permit conclusions regarding cancer and incretin therapeutics have not yet been completed.

Conclusions

The available data on incretin action and incidence of cardiovascular events, pancreatitis, or cancer are not yet sufficient or robust enough to permit firm conclusions regarding associations with incretin-based therapies in humans with diabetes. The forthcoming results of long-term cardiovascular safety studies should provide more conclusive information about the safety of GLP-1R agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in diabetic patients.

Introduction

Thyroid nodules are common and require vigilant monitoring due to malignancy potential. They become particularly concerning in patients using glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs, which are associated with a proposed increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer. This study aims to evaluate the incidence of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules treated with GLP-1 analogues.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database looking at pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with thyroid nodules (ICD-10-CM E04) and treated with GLP-1 analogues (ATC A10BJ) from 1995 to 2024. In addition, we compared the GLP-1 cohort to a cohort of patients who developed thyroid nodules after starting metformin. Demographic data and biochemical markers were assessed. The primary outcome was the incidence of thyroid cancer, identified by the first occurrence of ICD-10-CM C73 following the diagnosis of thyroid nodules and the start of GLP-1 analogues. Descriptive statistics summarized baseline characteristics, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated the cumulative incidence of thyroid cancer. Analyses were performed using the TriNetX Analytics platform, with statistical significance defined as P < 0.05.

Results

We identified 1,401,568 patients using GLP-1 analogues and 2,779,340 patients with thyroid nodules in our database. Among these, 171,460 patients had both conditions, with 98,142 (57%) developing thyroid nodules after starting GLP-1 analogues. The average age of the GLP-1 cohort was 60 ± 13 years, with 72% (n = 66,195) being female and 66% (n = 60,855) identifying as White. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the survival probability, or the likelihood of not developing thyroid cancer by the end of the study, was 91.042% for the GLP-1 cohort, with 4687 cases of thyroid cancer observed. In comparison, the metformin cohort (n = 306,114) had a higher survival probability of 94%, with 11,898 cases of thyroid cancer observed. The risk ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval: 0.96–1.03) between the cohorts indicates no significant difference in the risk of developing thyroid cancer for patients on GLP-1 analogues compared to those on metformin.

Conclusions

Our study indicates a relatively low incidence of thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules treated with GLP-1 analogues.

2.2 Subjects

The study cohort consisted of adults (≥ 18 years old) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (ICD‐10 E11) who initiated long‐term treatment with a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA; ATC A10BJ) between January 2015 and January 2020. As GLP‐1RA treatment has a very high discontinuation rate during the first year, we defined long‐term GLP‐1RA users as patients with at least one additional report of a GLP‐1RA prescription during the subsequent 1–3 years following GLP‐1RA initiation.

Active comparator control cohorts included adults (≥ 18 years old) with T2DM who have no history of GLP‐1RA use and initiated long‐term anti‐diabetic medications during the same period, including insulin (ATC A10A, VA HS501, CPT 1011517), metformin (RxNorm 6809), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i; ATC A10BH), sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i; ATC A10BK), sulfonylureas (SU; ATC A10BB) or thiazolidinediones (TZD; ATC A10BG). Similar to GLP‐1RA, the control cohorts were similarly required to show evidence of at least one prescription of the same medication category during the subsequent 1–3 years following initiation of treatment.

Exclusion criteria for both the study and control cohorts included preexisting diagnoses of neoplasms (C00‐D49), prior oncology treatments, or a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (E31.22–23). Participants in the active comparator groups who initiated GLP‐1RA during follow‐up were excluded from the primary analysis but were included in a separate sensitivity analysis.

### GLP1 and cancer: friend or foe? [^1136HKJW]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The new incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of their glucose-lowering capacity with low risk of hypoglycemia. As they are weight neutral or induce weight loss in this mostly overweight population, they are popular among clinicians and patients alike. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised about GLP1's trophic effects. While increased β cell mass observed in rodents sounds appealing for treatment of diabetes, there was also an increased incidence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in some species. We reviewed literature available in the Medline database until March 2012. Safety signals have emerged for MTC and pancreatic carcinoma from adverse event databases in the United States and Europe. Considering the relatively short duration of these studies, it is more likely that premalignant lesions are stimulated in presence of GLP1, rather than new neoplasms induced. Moreover, interpreting results of animal studies is difficult because of species-specific differences in presence and density of GLP1 receptors. Furthermore, data are emerging suggesting beneficial effects of GLP1 on colon and breast cancer. In conclusion, presently, the benefits of using DPP4 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists for treatment of type 2 diabetes outweigh the risks. Nonetheless, their safety profile should be monitored and their indications should be widened cautiously. At present they remain contra-indicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.

Thyroid Malignancy

In a filing to the FDA, thyroid tumors were reported to be increased in rodents treated with liraglutide and other long-acting GLP-1 RAs. As a result of this preclinical evidence, the use of liraglutide, exenatide extended-release, dulaglutide, and semaglutide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of thyroid carcinoma, and the prescribing information for these long-acting GLP-1 RAs includes a black-box warning in the USA for risk of thyroid C cell tumors. However, as is the case for pancreatic cancer, the evidence supporting the hypothesis that GLP-1 RAs cause (medullary) thyroid cancer is insufficient. To date, no cases of thyroid carcinoma have been identified from clinical trials or through post-marketing surveillance for patients treated with iGlarLixi. Additionally, there were no clinically significant changes in mean calcitonin levels related to treatment with iGlarLixi during the clinical trial program.

### Do GLP-1-based therapies increase cancer risk? [^116VtkNz]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In principle, there could be weak or strong evidence, either in favor of or against, the hypothesis that incretin-based medications can increase the risk for pancreatic, (medullary) thyroid, or other carcinomas. For the purpose of this review, GLP-1–based therapies are GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide, and others or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin. However, almost all available data and quoted studies have specifically examined exenatide and sitagliptin, which have been available for the longest time.

The questions of whether certain drugs can cause pancreatitis and whether certain drugs can cause pancreatic carcinoma are interrelated, since chronic pancreatitis increases the risk for pancreatic carcinoma approximately 26-fold compared with subjects not suffering from chronic pancreatitis. There is an etiological sequence leading from a healthy pancreas to chronic pancreatitis, with the main drivers being genetic susceptibility, alcohol abuse, and certain drugs. Once chronic pancreatitis has been established, chronic inflammation and enhanced intraductal pressure due to stenosis of the pancreatic duct(s) may lead to the development of pancreatic carcinoma. While this sequence is established in the case of chronic pancreatitis, it is not as certain whether an episode of acute pancreatitis will have the same consequences. This is of importance because most of the episodes of pancreatitis associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment seem to be episodes of acute pancreatitis. In the course of development of chronic pancreatitis, there is an exocrine pancreatic infiltrate of T cells and macrophages, a fibrotic reaction, and a reduction in acinar cells. The histological hallmarks of developing pancreatic carcinoma after chronic pancreatitis are pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and so-called pancreatic duct glands. These phenomena are characteristic lesions that occur during the transition from chronic pancreatitis to pancreatic cancer. Recent estimations, based on known mutation rates and the accumulation of somatic mutations at different stages of the development of pancreatic cancer, indicate that it is a chronic process. It takes ~12 years for a normal duct cell to get initiated as a tumor cell and to give life to a parental clone, from which a pancreatic carcinoma can grow. It takes another 7 years (approximately) for such cells to develop subclones with metastatic capacity and another 3 years (approximately) before the disease will be diagnosed due to clinical symptoms and a clinically apparent primary tumor accompanied by metastases. This time frame is important relative to the duration of exposure to antidiabetes drugs that might have a potential to accelerate the progression of malignant disease. Thus, any database that does not cover at least 5–6 years of observation with any drug cannot contribute reliable information on the risks for malignant disease, since the development of cancer can most likely only be influenced over long periods of time.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists and the risk for cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113kur3s]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, in randomized clinical trials available to date, GLP‐1RA do not appear to produce major effects on most malignancies, either beneficial or detrimental; however, the results of this meta‐analysis should be considered hypothesis‐generating rather than conclusive. A reduction of the risk of those malignancies that are more closely related to obesity, such as uterine and oesophageal cancers, seems possible; however, further data are needed to draw clear conclusions on this point. In this respect, observational studies, which are inevitably hampered by confounding bias, can be confirmatory of evidence from randomized trials. Conversely, very long‐term trials with malignancies as the principal outcome are hardly feasible. Results of ongoing large‐scale trials on GLP‐1RA and other molecules that also act as GLP‐1R agonists (e.g. dual GLP‐1/GIP and GLP‐1/glucagon agonists) will add further data, which will need to be incorporated in future meta‐analyses on this issue. On the other hand, a moderate increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer, which is more evident in shorter‐term trials, could be the effect of over‐diagnosis induced by the side effects of GLP‐1RA; however, this issue deserves further investigation through specific mechanistic studies and long‐term observational studies. Finally, the possibility of a moderate increase in the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in longer‐term trials, cannot be ruled out, and it needs to be clarified because of its relevance in the assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of GLP‐1RA treatment in individual patients.
