## Question

Would high ammonia increase BUN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high ammonia increases BUN. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal physiology of ammonia handling and urea synthesis. Then, I should verify what happens when the urea cycle is impaired. Next, I will examine clinical scenarios where both ammonia and BUN are abnormal. After that, I need to check for exceptions where BUN might rise despite or alongside hyperammonemia. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note practical implications for interpretation and testing pitfalls.

> Let me first confirm the baseline physiology. Ammonia is produced from protein catabolism and gut bacterial metabolism, and under normal conditions the liver efficiently converts ammonia to urea via the urea cycle, so BUN reflects the nitrogen end-product of that process and is typically present at much higher concentrations than free ammonia, which is tightly regulated at low levels [^8f11e3c0] [^2e9715cc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify what happens when the urea cycle is impaired. In urea cycle disorders or significant hepatocellular dysfunction, the capacity to convert ammonia to urea is reduced, so ammonia accumulates while BUN may be low or inappropriately normal despite ongoing protein catabolism, reflecting impaired ureagenesis rather than increased urea production [^c9530191] [^2e9715cc].

> Wait, let me verify this with clinical examples. In cirrhosis, portal hypertension and shunting reduce hepatic ammonia clearance and ureagenesis, producing elevated ammonia with disproportionately low BUN; case-based and physiologic reviews emphasize that the ammonia-to-urea ratio can be a marker of impaired urea-cycle efficiency in this setting, reinforcing that high ammonia does not equate to high BUN [^c9530191] [^2e9715cc].

> I should double-check for exceptions where BUN might rise even when ammonia is high. Gastrointestinal bleeding delivers a large protein load that increases ammonia generation and, if hepatic function is preserved enough, can transiently increase urea synthesis and BUN; similarly, catabolic states, high protein intake, or prerenal azotemia can raise BUN independent of ammonia handling, so a high BUN in these contexts reflects increased substrate or enhanced tubular reabsorption rather than improved ureagenesis in the face of hyperammonemia [^2bc75b3b] [^0b27be66].

> But wait, what if both are high due to different mechanisms. In acute liver failure, both ammonia and BUN can be deranged: ammonia rises from impaired ureagenesis, while BUN may be affected by hemodynamic instability, AKI, and catabolism; importantly, guidelines prioritize early CRRT to control hyperammonemia regardless of BUN, underscoring that BUN is not a reliable index of ammonia control in this setting [^ed20ef26] [^f43ffde4].

> I need to ensure I address testing pitfalls. Ammonia is labile and sensitive to collection and processing; protein intake acutely increases ammonia, and inter-site variability is substantial, so a high ammonia must be interpreted in clinical context and with attention to pre-analytics, whereas BUN is more stable but influenced by extrarenal factors like protein load, GI bleeding, and neurohormonal activation, which can obscure relationships with ammonia [^9df4da22] [^b645ac1d] [^0b27be66].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. High ammonia generally reflects impaired conversion of ammonia to urea, so it does not increase BUN; in fact, BUN may be low or inappropriately normal when the urea cycle is compromised, while BUN elevations are typically driven by increased protein substrate, catabolism, or renal handling rather than enhanced ureagenesis in hyperammonemia [^c9530191] [^8f11e3c0].

> Final answer: No, high ammonia does not increase BUN; it usually signals impaired ureagenesis and may coexist with low or normal BUN, whereas BUN rises when protein load, catabolism, or prerenal factors predominate, independent of ammonia clearance capacity [^c9530191] [^0b27be66].

---

High ammonia does not directly increase BUN; in fact, **impaired urea cycle function** (from liver disease or urea cycle disorders) causes ammonia to rise while BUN falls or remains normal because the liver cannot convert ammonia to urea [^c9530191] [^2e9715cc]. BUN rises when **urea production increases** (high protein intake, GI bleeding, catabolism) or when **renal excretion falls** (prerenal azotemia, CKD) [^0b27be66] [^2bc75b3b]. Thus, high ammonia and high BUN can coexist only when separate processes are at play, not because ammonia drives BUN up [^c9530191].

---

## Physiological relationship between ammonia and BUN

- **Ammonia metabolism**: Ammonia is produced from protein catabolism and gut bacterial metabolism; the liver detoxifies ammonia to urea via the urea cycle, and urea is excreted by the kidneys [^2e9715cc] [^8f11e3c0].

- **BUN as a marker**: BUN reflects hepatic urea synthesis and renal excretion; it rises with increased protein catabolism or decreased renal clearance, not with increased ammonia per se [^0b27be66] [^8f11e3c0].

- **Normal balance**: Under normal conditions, the liver efficiently converts ammonia to urea, keeping ammonia low and BUN stable; impaired ureagenesis raises ammonia and lowers or normalizes BUN [^c9530191] [^2e9715cc].

---

## Clinical scenarios of high ammonia and BUN levels

High ammonia and high BUN can coexist, but **via distinct mechanisms**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mechanism for high ammonia** | **Mechanism for high bun** |
|-|-|-|
| Liver cirrhosis with GI bleeding | Impaired urea cycle from hepatocellular dysfunction; portal shunting reduces hepatic ammonia clearance [^c9530191] | Protein load from GI bleeding increases urea synthesis; prerenal azotemia from hypovolemia reduces urea excretion [^2bc75b3b] |
| Acute liver failure with AKI | Severe hepatocellular dysfunction impairs ureagenesis [^2e9715cc] | AKI reduces urea excretion, increasing BUN [^0b27be66] |
| Urea cycle disorder with dehydration | Enzyme defect limits ammonia-to-urea conversion [^2e9715cc] | Dehydration increases proximal tubular urea reabsorption, raising BUN [^0b27be66] |

---

## Clinical scenarios of high ammonia with normal or low BUN

More commonly, **high ammonia coexists with normal or low BUN** when ureagenesis is impaired:

- **Liver cirrhosis**: Portal shunting and hepatocellular dysfunction reduce ammonia clearance and urea synthesis, yielding high ammonia with low or normal BUN [^c9530191].

- **Urea cycle disorders**: Enzyme defects limit urea synthesis, so ammonia rises while BUN stays low or normal [^2e9715cc].

- **Acute liver failure**: Marked hepatocellular injury impairs ureagenesis, producing high ammonia with low or normal BUN [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing BUN levels independent of ammonia

BUN is shaped by **factors unrelated to ammonia**:

- **Protein intake**: High protein intake or GI bleeding increases urea production and BUN [^2bc75b3b].

- **Catabolic states**: Increased protein breakdown raises BUN [^f92ca0d9].

- **Renal function**: Prerenal azotemia and CKD reduce urea excretion, increasing BUN [^0b27be66].

- **Medications**: Corticosteroids and tetracyclines can raise BUN [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Interpretation**: High ammonia with low/normal BUN suggests impaired ureagenesis; high ammonia with high BUN suggests concurrent increased urea load or reduced excretion [^c9530191] [^0b27be66].

- **Management**: Treat the cause of hyperammonemia (e.g. lactulose, rifaximin, dialysis) and address BUN drivers separately (e.g. volume repletion, protein modulation, renal support) [^38b6cfde] [^05098c40].

- **Monitoring**: Track ammonia and BUN to guide therapy, but interpret BUN in the context of protein intake, catabolism, and renal function [^0b27be66].

---

High ammonia does not increase BUN; BUN rises only when **urea production increases** or **renal excretion falls**, independent of ammonia levels. High ammonia with high BUN reflects separate, concurrent processes, not a causal relationship [^c9530191] [^0b27be66].

The measurement of ammonia, now known to be a normal constituent of all body fluids, is fraught with problems. An elevated ammonia level in blood (100 micromol/L or higher) is an indicator of an abnormality in nitrogen homeostasis. The collection, handling, storage, and analysis of blood samples, their limitations, and potential sources of error are discussed. New techniques that permit continuous or real-time estimates of systemic ammonia levels over a broad range are also discussed. The aim should always be to minimize the release of ammonia from the collected sample before analysis.

### Urea and ammonia metabolism and the control of renal nitrogen excretion [^8f11e3c0]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal nitrogen metabolism primarily involves urea and ammonia metabolism, and is essential to normal health. Urea is the largest circulating pool of nitrogen, excluding nitrogen in circulating proteins, and its production changes in parallel to the degradation of dietary and endogenous proteins. In addition to serving as a way to excrete nitrogen, urea transport, mediated through specific urea transport proteins, mediates a central role in the urine concentrating mechanism. Renal ammonia excretion, although often considered only in the context of acid-base homeostasis, accounts for approximately 10% of total renal nitrogen excretion under basal conditions, but can increase substantially in a variety of clinical conditions. Because renal ammonia metabolism requires intrarenal ammoniagenesis from glutamine, changes in factors regulating renal ammonia metabolism can have important effects on glutamine in addition to nitrogen balance. This review covers aspects of protein metabolism and the control of the two major molecules involved in renal nitrogen excretion: urea and ammonia. Both urea and ammonia transport can be altered by glucocorticoids and hypokalemia, two conditions that also affect protein metabolism. Clinical conditions associated with altered urine concentrating ability or water homeostasis can result in changes in urea excretion and urea transporters. Clinical conditions associated with altered ammonia excretion can have important effects on nitrogen balance.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^71ce38d4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently there is no well-established upper-limit of serum urea that serves as an indication for initiation of RRT in AKI. Using urea in isolation is difficult and potentially flawed given the variation in base level and production rates amongst different populations as well as it's negligibility as an accurate measure of metabolite toxicity. Furthermore, AKI is a multifactorial condition and it is likely to present earlier with other concerning metabolic or fluid overload abnormalities requiring dialysis rather than isolated elevated blood urea levels. Studies have considered the appropriate timing of initial RRT including early and delayed/late commencement of therapy, with a recent meta-analysis concluding there is no added benefit. Most studies initiated RRT once blood urea level exceeded 40 mmol/L, which is reflected in clinical practice despite evidence to suggest it does not correlate well with onset of uraemic symptoms.

Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT therapy, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^ef98780c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

WARNINGS

Intravenous infusion of amino acids may induce a rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), especially in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Appropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically and infusion discontinued if BUN levels exceed normal postprandial limits and continue to rise. It should be noted that a modest rise in BUN normally occurs as a result of increased protein intake.

Administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with hepatic insufficiency may result in serum amino acid imbalances, metabolic alkalosis, prerenal azotemia, hyperammonemia, stupor and coma.

Administration of amino acid solutions in the presence of impaired renal function may augment an increasing BUN, as does any protein dietary component.

Solutions containing sodium ion should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.

Solutions which contain potassium ion should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.

Solutions containing acetate ion should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Acetate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.

Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants, as it can result in mental retardation. Therefore, it is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants.

Instances of asymptomatic hyperammonemia have been reported in patients without overt liver dysfunction. The mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined, but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically impaired liver function.

WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur even at lower rates of administration.

### Association between the blood urea nitrogen-albumin ratio and mortality in critically ill patients with gastrointestinal bleeding: a retrospective cohort study [^2bc75b3b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The BAR has recently been recognized as a valuable prognostic marker across various clinical conditions. Among ICU patients with acute pancreatitis, retrospective evidence indicated that a BAR value greater than 16.92 was strongly linked to higher rates of all-cause mortality (ACM). The AUC for BAR on day 14 was 73.23%, notably higher than that of BUN (69.73%) or albumin alone (64.29%). In 137 patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), Asano et al. found a positive correlation between BAR and 28-day in-hospital mortality, with an AUC of 0.83. Similarly, Cao et al. identified BAR as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis (HR = 1.032 95% CI: 1.010–1.055). Collectively, these findings across infectious, pancreatitis, and pneumonia highlight BAR as a robust and broadly applicable biochemical marker. Its integrative nature and consistent predictive performance continue to attract increasing clinical attention.

In patients with GIB, an elevated BAR arises from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to increased intestinal absorption of protein degradation products, such as amino acids. Within the liver, these amino acids undergo transamination, generating ammonia that is further metabolized into urea, contributing to elevated BUN levels. Additionally, upper GIB frequently induces hemorrhagic hypovolemia, predisposing patients to prerenal azotemia. Elevated BUN levels have been strongly associated with mortality in GIB. Under hypovolemic conditions, diminished renal perfusion triggers neurohormonal activation — including sympathetic nervous system stimulation and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system upregulation — enhancing proximal tubular urea reabsorption and further increasing BUN levels. Consequently, in hemodynamically unstable patients, BUN not only reflects renal perfusion but also serves as a proxy for neuroendocrine activation.

A decreased serum albumin level is a well-recognized marker of physiological stress, malnutrition, or chronic inflammation. In acute hemorrhage, sympathetic nervous system activation and the release of inflammatory mediators markedly increase capillary permeability, facilitating albumin extravasation and a consequent rapid decline in circulating albumin levels. Furthermore, systemic inflammation — driven by cytokines such as interleukin-6 — suppresses hepatic albumin synthesis.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^0b27be66]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urea is the primary metabolite derived from dietary protein and tissue protein turnover. It is freely filtered at the glomerulus but not secreted, and it is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. In addition, as urine flow rates decrease, more urea is reabsorbed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) measures the nitrogen component of serum urea. BUN levels are inversely correlated with the decline of kidney function and are also affected by extrarenal factors such as protein intake, gastrointestinal bleeding, catabolic states, malnutrition, heart failure, dehydration, use of glucocorticoids, and hepatic urea synthesis.

Under physiologic conditions urea slowly dissociates into cyanate, which is rapidly converted to isocyanate. Isocyanate is a reactive electrophile with high affinity for nucleophilic groups such as primary amines. Carbamylation has been recognized to be a spontaneous post-translational modification of amino acids and proteins mediated by cyanate, leading to biochemical alterations. It has also been demonstrated that urea can exert direct toxicity on various tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, vascular walls, pancreatic β-cells and adipocytes, and indirect toxicity via carbamylation. Notably, BUN levels are associated with mortality among patients with heart failure.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that the release of vasopressin and the activation of the aldose reductase-fructokinase pathway caused by the elevated serum osmolality might be associated with kidney injury. BUN is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm) levels. Therefore, in patients in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is a concomitant rise in cSosm and BUN levels. Furthermore, a recent study showed that higher BUN and cSosm levels were independently associated with the development of CKD, which was defined as a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in patients with preserved kidney function (average eGFR of 86.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2). However, it remains unclear whether high BUN or cSosm levels are an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with adverse renal outcomes in patients with CKD (stages 3–5) independent of the eGFR. Additionally, a previous study demonstrated that eGFR and serum creatinine were associated with kidney disease progression in CKD patients. Thus, we also evaluated whether BUN levels were related to CKD progression, independent of an alternative kidney function marker, serum creatinine.

### Reconsidering the urea-to-creatinine ratio as a signal of muscle catabolism in patients with cirrhosis [^c9530191]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

On the urea side, portal hypertension and hepatocellular dysfunction alter nitrogen metabolism by reducing the efficiency of ureagenesis. Ammonia disposal primarily occurs in the liver, where the urea cycle converts ammonia derived from the intestines into urea, a water-soluble compound that is excreted in the urine. Within this substrate-to-product framework, ammonia and urea are complementary biochemical indicators of the same pathway; the ammonia-to-urea (A-to-U) ratio, analogous to a simplified enzymatic system, reflects urea-cycle efficiency. Cirrhosis perturbs this system in two coordinated ways. First, increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and the formation of portosystemic shunts reduce the delivery of portal ammonia to hepatocytes, thereby impairing hepatic clearance and leading to elevated systemic ammonia levels. Second, impaired hepatocellular function reduces urea-cycle throughput, resulting in lower circulating urea levels for a given nitrogen load. The combined effect produces a biochemical profile characterized by elevated ammonia and disproportionately low urea levels. Clinically, this explains why patients with cirrhosis may exhibit a low or "normal" UCR, not because protein catabolism is minimal, but because the hepatic capacity to convert ammonia into urea is limited. The A-to-U ratio reflects this physiology, and values greater than 1.53 mg/g have been independently associated with clinically significant portal hypertension. Specific complications, however, can modify this pattern. Gastrointestinal bleeding related to portal hypertension, such as variceal hemorrhage, delivers a substantial nitrogen load to the portal circulation through the digestion and intestinal reabsorption of hemoglobin. This nitrogen input functions as an exogenous source from the perspective of hepatic metabolism, increasing ureagenesis and raising plasma urea independently of muscle catabolism. Under these conditions, an elevated UCR signals exogenous nitrogen influx and prerenal dynamics rather than impaired amino acid utilization or enhanced protein breakdown (Fig 1)

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^2b830c09]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing — high blood-ammonia levels alone do not add diagnostic, staging, or prognostic value in HE with chronic liver disease (CLD); if a patient with overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) has a normal ammonia level, the diagnosis of HE is in question. For ammonia-lowering drugs, repeated ammonia measurements may be helpful to test efficacy, but logistical challenges, specimen type differences, and method variability should be considered when interpreting results.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^538f3774]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders

Valproic acid is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).

Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of valproate therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Hyperammonemia, bane of the brain [^8c237043]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Ammonia, normally produced from catabolism of amino acids, is a deadly neurotoxin. As such, the concentration of free ammonia in the blood is very tightly regulated and is exceeded by two orders of magnitude by its physiologic derivative, urea. The normal capacity for urea production far exceeds the rate of free ammonia production by protein catabolism under normal circumstances, such that any increase in free blood ammonia concentration is a reflection of either biochemical or pharmacologic impairment of urea cycle function or fairly extensive hepatic damage. Clinical signs of hyperammonemia occur at concentrations > 60 micromol/L and include anorexia, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, somnolence, disorientation, asterixis, cerebral edema, coma, and death; appearance of these findings is generally proportional to free ammonia concentration, is progressive, and is independent of the primary etiology. Causes of hyperammonemia include genetic defects in the urea cycle ("primary") or organic acidemias ("secondary"), as well as genetic or acquired disorders resulting in significant hepatic dysfunction. Thus, because of the neurotoxic implications of hyperammonemia and the typical absence of other specific laboratory abnormalities, appearance of the clinical signs should trigger an emergent search for elevated blood ammonia concentration.

### A prospective, blinded assessment of ammonia testing demonstrates low utility among front-line clinicians [^5f43aa55]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although ammonia is essential to the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), its levels cannot diagnose HE, do not correlate with the grade of HE, and are plagued by technical challenges. 1 Nevertheless, ammonia levels are routinely obtained in the evaluation of hospitalized patients. 2 We have advocated for quality improvement to limit testing. 3 However, data are lacking regarding the reasons for, context, and perceived value of ammonia testing among ordering clinicians. Additional data are needed to optimize a quality improvement intervention aiming to curb overuse.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^adad567d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Is there any role of ammonia measurements in HE diagnosis?

It is a common practice to order ammonia levels when patients with a known history of HE get admitted. However, as per the current evidence, there seems to be no role for such practice and should best be avoided. The diagnosis of HE is entertained on the basis of clinical grounds and blood‐ammonia levels offer limited useful information in terms of diagnosis or staging. Elevated ammonia levels have been found in as many as 69% of patients with no signs or symptoms of encephalopathy, making it a nonspecific diagnostic tool. Hence, trending the ammonia to "normal levels" is of limited utility in patients with overt HE (OHE) as the efficacy of treatment is primarily based on clinical improvement alone. This becomes pertinent as the normalization of ammonia levels may lag behind the clinical improvement in HE patients. However, in cases of normal ammonia levels in patients being treated for possible OHE, alternative diagnoses should be explored. Hospitalists should be aware of the fact that some medications can also cause elevations in ammonia levels, for example, sodium valproate, which is independent of HE and can be a source of confusion. In addition, blood sample collection (e.g. using a tourniquet) and processing techniques may as well cause inaccuracies with the ammonia measurements.

### Serum ammonia levels Do not correlate with overt hepatic encephalopathy severity in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis [^0c9ce87a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although ammonia is involved in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), the use of ammonia levels in clinical practice is problematic. 1–3 For example, in a study of 551 patients with overt HE (OHE) receiving lactulose who had ammonia levels tested, only 60% had an increased ammonia level (defined as > 72 μmol/L). 2 Overall, there was no correlation observed between lactulose dose and whether ammonia levels were obtained (ie, presence/absence of increased ammonia level did not guide therapy), or between time to OHE resolution and ammonia levels. 2 Additionally, there is substantial interlaboratory variability in sample handling and processing, which may affect ammonia measurements. 4.

### Adult nonhepatic hyperammonemia: a case report and differential diagnosis [^9148b96e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This article presents a case report of nonhepatic hyperammonemia, i.e., elevated serum ammonia secondary to a nonhepatic etiology. It then discusses the importance of broadening one's differential diagnosis to include such nonhepatic causes of elevated ammonia levels, and provides a short review of rarer causes of hyperammonemia in the adult population. Treating the underlying condition is the best way to prevent recurrence of hyperammonemia. However, symptomatic treatment should not be delayed while investigating the underlying source.

### Emergence of blood urea nitrogen as a biomarker of neurohormonal activation in heart failure [^defc8266]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin, concurrent with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, is thought to represent the maladaptive response that is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). The degree of neurohormonal activation correlates with the severity of the disease and can predict the outcomes. However, quantification of components of neurohormonal axis (e.g., serum arginine vasopressin level) is mainly reserved for research purposes rather than routine practice. The results of several recent HF trials have shed light on the differential role of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine in predicting the outcomes in this setting. These studies suggest that BUN could indeed represent a surrogate marker for "renal response" to neurohormonal activation in this setting, above and beyond its role in the estimation of renal function. In this report, the relevant physiologic mechanisms underlying urea and water transport in the kidney are first reviewed. Then, the activation of the neurohormonal axis and the impact of its components on renal urea transport, independent of changes in renal function, are explained. Finally, the unique role of BUN as a biomarker of neurohormonal activation in the setting of HF is discussed, and the potential clinical implication of this novel concept is emphasized. In conclusion, this review explains the pathophysiologic basis for the emerging role of BUN as a biomarker in HF.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^611ed7d0]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Box 2 Recommendations from the consensus panel for NKRT management

Consensus recommendation 1: immediately conduct further investigations, without delaying treatment, when elevated ammonia levels are detected (evidence level 4D)
Consensus recommendation 2: discontinue all oral feeds and provide adequate calories (≥ 100 kcal/kg daily) as intravenous glucose and lipids (evidence level 4B)
Consensus recommendation 3: maintain a glucose infusion rate of 8–10 mg/kg/min and provide lipids (0.5 g/kg daily, up to 3 g/kg daily) (evidence level 4B)
Consensus recommendation 4: gradually reintroduce protein (by 0.25 g/kg daily, up to 1.5 g/kg daily) within 48 h (evidence level 4 C); if stabilization of serum ammonia levels takes longer than 48 h and protein is not supplied, protein catabolism will drive further ammonia production
Consensus recommendation 5: use nitrogen-scavenging agents (such as sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate) and urea cycle intermediates (such as-arginine and-citrulline) at the recommended dosage (evidence level 4 C) Intravenous sodium benzoate (maximum dose 12 g daily; high-dose benzoate can be toxic and lethal within 1 h): body weight < 20 kg, 250 mg/kg; body weight > 20 kg, 5.5 g/m 2; given over 90 min as bolus then as maintenance over 24 h Intravenous sodium phenylacetate: body weight < 20 kg, 250 mg/kg; body weight > 20 kg, 5.5 g/m 2; given over 90 min as bolus then as maintenance over 24 h Intravenous sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate: body weight < 20 kg, 250 mg/kg; body weight > 20 kg, 5.5 g/m 2; given over 90–120 min as bolus then as maintenance over 24 h Intravenous-arginine hydrochloride: body weight < 20 kg, 200 mg/kg for OTC and CPS deficiencies and 600 mg/kg for ASS and ASL deficiencies; weight > 20 kg, 4 g/m 2 for OTC and CPS deficiencies and 12 g/m 2 for ASS and ASL deficiencies; given over 90 min as bolus then as maintenance over 24 h Intravenous-carnitine: 50 mg/kg loading dose given over 90 min, then 100–300 mg/kg daily (not needed for UCD but needed for organic aciduria)

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^bfcf23ef]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Consensus panel recommendations

Prompt identification and treatment of hyperammonaemia are imperative to optimize the outcome of a hyperammonaemic crisis and to avoid irreversible brain damage.

Initial medical management guidelines

In the initial medical management of acute hyperammonaemia, the patient should be immediately stabilized (circulation, airway and breathing), vital signs should be addressed, blood glucose levels monitored, intravenous access should be established, airways should be maintained by intubation and ventilation if necessary, and adequate rehydration should be started, typically using a dextrose-containing fluid at a high infusion rate. In patients in hyperammonaemic crisis, laboratory testing is required to establish the cause of hyperammonaemia. Accurate measurement of plasma levels of ammonia is also important and should be performed on a free-flowing venous or arterial blood sample collected into a lithium heparin or EDTA tube and transported on ice to the laboratory. The sample must be processed within 15 min of draw and analysed immediately.

Once hyperammonaemia is identified, protein intake must be temporarily stopped and plasma ammonia levels monitored every 3 h. In a patient with an ammonia level at the upper limit of normal for their age — that is, 110 μmol/l (154 μg/dl) at age 1–7 days, < 90 μmol/l (126 μg/dl) at age 8–14 days and 16–53 µmol/l (22–74 μg/dl) at age 15 days to adult — stopping protein intake and initiating intravenous glucose and lipids to prevent catabolism is generally adequate. Crucially, protein intake must be reintroduced within a maximum of 48 h following the return of ammonia levels to 80–100 μmol/l (136–170 μg/dl) in order to avoid catabolism. Two factors determine the prognosis of neurological damage: the duration of hyperammonaemic coma and plasma ammonia levels. Adverse prognostic factors include hyperammonaemic coma lasting > 3 days, increased intracranial pressure and/or a plasma ammonia level > 1,000 μmol/l (1,703 μg/dl). In a study of 22 children with UCDs who survived a hyperammonaemic coma, the duration of coma was inversely correlated with the children's IQ at 12 months after recovery from the hyperammonaemic coma. The severity of abnormalities on brain CT also correlated with the duration of coma. Early management and reduced duration of hyperammonaemic coma may prevent adverse neurological outcomes. The initial medical and nutritional management of hyperammonaemia is summarized in Box 1.

### Segatella copri and gut microbial ammonia metabolism contribute to chronic kidney disease pathogenesis [^4f6b7b7b]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD), but large-scale studies and mechanistic insights are limited. Here we analysed gut metagenome data from 1,550 older individuals (aged 65-93years) with comprehensive kidney function measurements. Segatella copri was positively associated with kidney function through microbial ammonia metabolism-related pathways and the asnA gene, which encodes an ammonia-assimilating enzyme. These associations were replicated in two external studies. In mice, ammonia supplementation increased serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, accelerating CKD progression. In vitro cultures of S. copri or asnA-overexpressing Escherichia coli reduced ammonia concentrations, which was markedly attenuated in asnA-knockout S. copri. Gavage of either S. copri or asnA-overexpressing E. coli, but not asnA-knockout S. copri, mitigated ammonia-induced CKD progression in mice. These findings highlight the role of gut microbial ammonia metabolism in CKD pathogenesis and underscore the therapeutic potential of microbial-based interventions.

### Suggested guidelines for the diagnosis and management of urea cycle disorders: first revision [^370f99a4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to follow-up, TEWG-UCD 2019 guidelines recommend to set the following target concentrations for long-term management:

- ammonia < 80 mcmol/L

- glutamine < 1,000 mcmol/L

- arginine in the high normal range

- essential amino acids and branched chain amino acids in the normal range.

### Zonisamide (Zonegran) [^702141cf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests:

In several clinical studies, zonisamide was associated with a mean increase in the concentration of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of approximately 8% over the baseline measurement. Consideration should be given to monitoring renal function periodically (see PRECAUTIONS, Effect on Renal Function subsection).

Zonisamide increases serum chloride and alkaline phosphatase and decreases serum bicarbonate (see WARNINGS, Metabolic Acidosis subsection), phosphorus, calcium, and albumin.

Drug Interactions with CNS Depressants: Concomitant administration of ZONEGRAN and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of zonisamide to cause CNS depression, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse events, zonisamide should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants.

Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Concomitant use of ZONEGRAN, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., topiramate, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation or the risk of hyperammonemia. Therefore, if ZONEGRAN is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Interactions of Zonisamide with Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors subsection and WARNINGS, Metabolic Acidosis subsection and Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy subsection).

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^2216193e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Urea Cycle Disorders

Depakote is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).

Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of Depakote therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD. Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^05098c40]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal detoxification, hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration, NRN 2020 guidelines recommend to perform continuous RRT in patients with hyperammonemia in the following situations:

- rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral edema with blood ammonia level > 150 mcmol/L

- presence of moderate or severe encephalopathy (moderate encephalopathy is defined as lethargy, distal flexion, decreased activity, complete extension, hypotonia, weak suck or incomplete Moro reflex, constricted pupils, or bradycardia; severe encephalopathy is defined as stupor or coma, no activity, decerebrate posture, flaccid tone, absent suck, absent Moro reflex, pupils non-reactive to light, variable HR or sleep apnea)

- persistently high blood ammonia levels > 400 mcmol/L refractory to non-RRT

- rapid rise in blood ammonia levels to > 300 mcmol/L within a few hours that cannot be controlled via non-RRT.

### Association of hepatorenal function biomarkers with depression risk in geriatric psychiatry inpatient: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^a1dea82d]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The observed association may reflect intertwined organ-brain communication mechanisms underlying depression pathogenesis. Clinical studies have documented elevated cerebral ammonia levels in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Impaired hepatic ammonia clearance precipitates hyperammonemia, which facilitates neuropsychiatric manifestations through ammonia accumulation in the central nervous system. Hyperammonemia impair glutamate processing in the hippocampus by disrupting astrocyte function — specifically reducing glutamate clearance and glutamine production. This coincides with decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein vital for brain health, ultimately contributing to cognitive issues and depressive symptoms in liver disease patients. Notably, as the primary substrate initiating the urea cycle and a key regulator of nitrogen homeostasis, impaired hepatic processing of ammonia directly disrupts systemic BUN metabolism. This pathophysiological cascade underlies the association between reduced BUN levels and depressive vulnerability identified in our study. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the liver-brain axis constitutes a critical pathological substrate underlying the development of depressive behaviors. The BUN/Cr ratio serves as a validated biomarker for renal function assessment, reflecting hydration status, protein catabolism, and renal parenchymal injury patterns. Experimental evidence from murine CKD models demonstrates that cerebral oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with depressive-like phenotypes. In CKD patients, uremic toxin accumulation, particularly tryptophan-derived indoxyl sulfate, exacerbates neuroinflammation and apoptosis through astrocytic dysfunction and blood–brain barrier disruption, thereby elevating the risk of depression. Chronic neuroinflammation coupled with serotonin depletion, both driven by uremic toxin retention, may constitute a central mechanism underlying depression onset and therapeutic resistance in CKD. Beyond classical toxin pathways, recent evidence suggests that glymphatic dysfunction may be a key pathway linking hepatic/renal impairment to mood disorders. This intracranial clearance system, reliant on cerebrospinal-interstitial fluid exchange via perivascular spaces, eliminates neurotoxic proteins (e.g. β-amyloid, tau). In hepatic encephalopathy models, portal hypertension triggers systemic inflammation and cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction, suppressing AQP4 polarization in astrocytic endfeet and disrupting glymphatic flow. Concurrently, uremic milieu in renal failure impairs AQP4 function, exacerbating toxic protein accumulation. The elevated prevalence of depression in patients with hepatic-renal impairment observed in this study may be closely linked to neuroinflammatory cascades secondary to compromised glymphatic clearance efficiency.

### Urea cycle disorders: quick reference guide [^5dd36c09]. E-IMD (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to high-dose glucose and lipids, E-IMD 2014 guidelines recommend to administer high-dose glucose and, if a fatty acid oxidation disorder has been excluded, lipids to promote and maintain anabolism for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia. Restart protein after an acute hyperammonemic decompensation when ammonia levels fall to < 100 mcmol/L. Aim for the period of protein-free nutrition not to exceed 24–48 hours.

### Standardised neonatal parenteral nutrition formulations-an australasian group consensus 2012 [^5fef8b96]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Trials assessing the efficacy of higher maximal rates of amino acid administration have assessed the effects of up to 3.5–4 g/kg/day. Higher rates of maximal amino acid administration were associated with higher blood urea nitrogen levels and increased nitrogen/protein accretion. No significant difference in growth has been reported although this may reflect enteral nutrition practices. Blanco et al. studied the effect of a high parenteral amino acid intake 2 g/kg/d at birth to a max 4 g/kg/d by day 3 in 30 infants born < 1000 g and reported biochemical intolerance resulting in discontinuation of intervention in 6 extremely premature infants with peak blood urea nitrogen > 21 mmol/L (60 mg/dl) and plasma ammonia level > 97 μmol/L. The peak blood urea nitrogen levels were well above normative data although metabolic acidosis was not observed and plasma ammonia levels up to 123 μmol/L may be normal in extremely low birth weight infants. The Consensus Group agreed to incrementally increase amino acid infusions to a maximum 4 g/kg/day over 3–5 days (LOE II, GOR C).

### Metabolic responses to early and high protein supplementation in a randomized trial evaluating the prevention of hyperkalemia in extremely low birth weight infants [^b3312148]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early and higher intravenous amino acid (EHAA) supplementation decreases hyperkalemia in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (< 1000 g).

Study Design

Infants were enrolled at birth in a randomized, double-masked, prospective fashion and treated for 7 days. The standard group (SAA) infants received intravenous amino acid (AA) starting at 0.5 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) and increased by 0.5 g x kg(-1) every day to a maximum of 3 g x kg(-1) x d(-1). EHAA group infants received 2 g x kg(-1) x d(-1) of AA soon after birth and advanced by 1 g x kg(-1) every day to 4 g x kg(-1) x d(-1). Data analysis was by SPSS 11.5, with statistical significance at alpha = 0.05 and 90% power to determine a difference in mean K(+) level of 2.

Results

Sixty-two patients, mean gestational age of 26.0 ± 2.0 weeks and birth weight of 775 ± 136 g, were enrolled. Hyperkalemia (K(+) ≥ 6.5 mEq/L) occurred in 13% of the studied population; no difference in incidence of hyperkalemia was found between the SAA and EHAA groups (16% vs 10%, respectively, P = 0.70). Serum blood urea nitrogen was higher in the EHAA group. AA infusion was stopped early in 6 patients for high blood urea nitrogen or elevated ammonia level.

Conclusions

During the study period, hyperkalemia decreased significantly and was not affected by EHAA supplementation in the first week of life.

### Hyperammonemia in urea cycle disorders: role of the nephrologist [^b55e8de4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia associated with inherited disorders of amino acid and organic acid metabolism is usually manifested by irritability, somnolence, vomiting, seizures, and coma. Although the majority of these patients present in the newborn period, they may also present in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood with failure to thrive, persistent vomiting, developmental delay, or behavioral changes. Persistent hyperammonemia, if not treated rapidly, may cause irreversible neuronal damage. After the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is established in an acutely ill patient, certain diagnostic tests should be performed to differentiate between urea cycle defects and other causes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. In a patient with a presumed inherited metabolic disorder, the aim of therapy should be to normalize blood ammonia levels. Recent experience has provided treatment guidelines that include minimizing endogenous ammonia production and protein catabolism, restricting nitrogen intake, administering substrates of the urea cycle, administering compounds that facilitate the removal of ammonia through alternative pathways, and, in severe cases, dialysis therapy. Initiation of dialysis in the encephalopathic patient with hyperammonemia is indicated if the ammonia blood level is greater than three to four times the upper limit of normal. Hemodialysis is the most effective treatment for rapidly reducing blood ammonia levels. Continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis are also effective modalities for reducing blood ammonia levels. An improved understanding of the metabolism of ammonia and neurological consequences of hyperammonemia will assist the nephrologist in providing optimal care for this high-risk patient population.

### Serum urea concentration and risk of 16 site-specific cancers, overall cancer, and cancer mortality in individuals with metabolic syndrome: a cohort study [^8ab12b92]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of 108,284 participants with MetS revealed intriguing patterns in the impact of serum urea concentration on cancers. Higher serum urea levels appeared to exhibit a protective effect against overall cancer incidence and the incidence of oesophageal and lung cancers. Conversely, elevated serum urea levels were linked to a higher prostate cancer risk. An "L-shaped" nonlinear dose–response relationship was identified between urea concentration and cancer mortality. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between serum urea levels and cancer, emphasising the importance of further investigation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these relationships and their potential impact for cancer prevention and management in patients with MetS.

Research regarding the relationship between serum urea concentration and cancer risk, particularly in patients with MetS, remains scarce. To our knowledge, no prior large cohort studies have investigated the relationship between serum urea concentration and the risk of different cancers in this population. A recent study revealed a inverse relationship between urea and colorectal cancer risk, which was also present in individuals with diabetes and obesity. Similarly, a survey conducted in Israel found that plasma urea in children with cancer were notably lower compared to age-matched healthy controls. In this study, we found that higher urea levels may have a protective effect against stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Although no significant differences were observed after applying the Benjamini–Hochberg correction, there may be a potential association between urea levels and these cancers that warrants further investigation. The protective effect of high serum urea levels against gastrointestinal cancer may be attributed to the ability of certain gastrointestinal bacteria to convert urea into ammonia via urease secretion. The released ammonia can be utilised as a source of nitrogen to drive microbial growth, which is beneficial to both the host and the gastrointestinal microbiota. This process may enhance gastrointestinal health, reducing inflammation, and potentially prevent the occurrence and development of gastrointestinal cancers. Clinical trials performed in the UK identified elevated serum urea levels as a predictive indicator of early death in individuals with small cell lung cancer, increasing the risk of death 13-fold. However, an observational study in China found no association between blood urea nitrogen levels and survival in those with lung cancer. These may be due to variations in genetic backgrounds, environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, treatment regimens, disease stages, or patient characteristics. Future research endeavours should strive to address the biomarker variation by incorporating diverse populations, robust study designs, and comprehensive analyses.

### Low-value levels: ammonia testing does not improve the outcomes of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^e0c0b1c9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a clinical diagnosis. However, many clinicians measure ammonia levels in hospitalized patients presenting with hepatic encephalopathy. In this editorial, we review the results of an important study by Haj and Rockey. The authors examined the management decisions effected affected by and outcomes associated with (i) ordering an ammonia level and (ii) knowing the ammonia level. They found that ammonia level determination did not impact affect clinical decision-making or patient outcomes. These persuasive data demonstrate the limited clinical utility of ammonia levels and highlight the need for testing stewardship to dissuade unnecessary use through educational efforts and decision supports.

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^8d90de5c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blood urea nitrogen(BUN) is the nitrogen component in urea, the final product of metabolism, which originates from the liver and is excreted by the kidney. Based on previous research findings, and compared with survivors, a higher BUN level was found in those who died in hospital. In this study, our results also showed that the non-survivor group had a higher BUN level than the survivor group during hospitalization. Thus, we suggest that elevated BUN levels reflect the severity of the disease. In addition, BUN was shown to have a predictive effect on the prognosis of the disease. One retrospective cohort study from China performed by Chen et al. found that an elevated BUN level was related to hospital mortality in COPD patients with exacerbations for those who presented at the emergency department. Figure 2 shows that BUN levels could predict hospitalization outcomes of the hospitalized patients with AECOPD (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.92, P < 0.001). This was similar to previous findings that indicated elevated BUN levels were associated with increased mortality.

### Ammonia levels and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with known chronic liver disease [^982146a5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Ammonia is predominantly generated in the gut by intestinal bacteria and enzymes and detoxified primarily in the liver. Since the 1930s, ammonia has been identified as the principal culprit in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Many physicians utilize serum ammonia to diagnose, assess severity, and determine the resolution of HE in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) despite research showing that ammonia levels are unhelpful in all of these clinical circumstances. HE in patients with CLD is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion that should not be based on ammonia levels.

### Nitrogen scavengers: history, clinical considerations and future prospects [^f31dfcd7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

9 Alternative Ammonia Scavengers and Other Future Routes

Are there alternatives to traditional nitrogen scavenging therapies in the treatment of hyperammonemia? This question opens the door to exploring novel approaches that go beyond the conventional nitrogen‐scavenging drugs. While these therapies have proven effective in managing ammonia levels, they are indirect in that they do not directly capture ammonia and may not address the full spectrum of the disorder's toxic effects, particularly the neurotoxic impact of elevated ammonia levels on the central nervous system. Given that ammonia is the primary neurotoxic culprit in most of the ureagenesis defects, a more targeted therapeutic approach could potentially offer improved outcomes.

One possibility is the design and development of substances that specifically target ammonia itself rather than glycine or glutamine. For example, compounds could be developed that target ammonia to efficiently neutralize or convert it into less toxic forms before it even has a chance to affect the brain. This can also include approaches like peritoneal dialysis via injected stable liposomes capturing ammonia by ionizing the molecule on the inside, preventing its release. These liposomes are then removed from the peritoneal space. Similarly, compounds or other solutions to decrease glutamate accumulation in the brain, causing neurotransmitter imbalance, can be explored as a more upstream target for therapy.

Additionally, research could explore the development of compounds that protect the nervous system from the harmful effects of ammonia. These might include neuroprotective agents that reduce the ability of ammonia and glutamate to interfere with neurotransmission or prevent its accumulation in the brain. As well, targeting ammonia production in the intestine and its microbiome (especially urease expressing microbes, converting urea to ammonia and carbonic acid) and uptake therefrom could serve as an alternative to address ammonia toxicity, and this approach was already tested preclinically. Finally, genetic therapies aimed at restoring or compensating for deficient enzymes in the urea cycle could represent a promising long‐term solution, potentially eliminating the need for continuous nitrogen scavenging altogether.

In summary, while nitrogen scavenging remains a cornerstone of UCD management, in addition to low‐protein diets and supplementation of arginine and citrulline, there is significant potential for developing more targeted approaches that address ammonia as the primary neurotoxic agent. By developing new substances that either neutralize ammonia or protect the nervous system from its harmful effects, more effective and specialized therapies for patients at risk for hyperammonemia will hopefully become available.

### Lethal hyperammonemia in a CAR-T cell recipient due topneumonia: a case report of a unique severe complication [^24261243]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Our patient suffered lethal complications of hyperammonemia with ammonia levels remaining elevated despite multiple therapies. Exploring the possible explanations, along with mechanisms for hyperammonemia in similar patients, may inform treatment for future incidents. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated for hyperammonemia in transplant patients. One hypothesis is a lack of glutamine synthase or urea cycle enzymes. This has been shown in some lung transplant patients, but not consistently among all cases. Other hypotheses implicate calcineurin inhibitors and steroids as inhibitors of ammonia metabolism in skeletal muscle. Our patient was on neither of these medications.

Urease-producing organisms have now been shown to play a major role in raising ammonia levels in susceptible populations. Our patient may have had a particularly high infectious burden evidenced by bilateral lung consolidations, with BAL samples returning positive only for Ureaplasma. The patient was immunosuppressed throughout her last year of life, since the BMT, and likely acquired the Ureaplasma infection during this period of time. Ureaplasma itself creates a dangerous cycle of self-proliferation. The organism uses urea for energy, thus producing ammonia. The ammonia is then a substrate for further ureagenesis. This cycle results in a growing burden of infection. Our patient may have also had mild hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by mild bilirubin and INR elevations. The lack of BUN elevation, despite the severe ammonia levels, is further suggestive of a disruption in the urea cycle. This may be due to CRS or liver dysfunction from sepsis. The patient additionally had severe neurotoxicity, evidenced by status epilepticus that was very difficult to suppress, as well as cerebral oedema. This degree of neurological severity seen in our patient was potentially linked to CAR-T's impact on astrocytes. Gust et al reviewed 19 cases of neurotoxicity in CAR-T patients. They found multiple biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid indicating astrocyte damage. Ammonia is taken up by astrocytes in the brain and converted to glutamine, with elevated levels of glutamine then causing cerebral oedema. Impairment of astrocytes, possibly due to CAR-T therapy, triggers excessive astrocyte activity in adjacent regions. This leads to increased glutamate concentrations in these nearby synapses. The overall impact of this physiology is increased excitotoxicity leading to encephalopathy and seizures. Brain herniation can also occur. Thus, CAR-T therapy may directly impact astrocytes, further potentiating the severity of hyperammonemia in our patient.

### The ongoing debate of serum ammonia levels in cirrhosis: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^6a6dbffc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Serum ammonia testing in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been long debated in the field of hepatology. Although central to the pathophysiology of HE, serum ammonia testing is fraught with complexities that can lead to challenges in laboratory collection and interpretation. Although there is some disagreement across guideline organizations regarding routine testing of ammonia in HE, all acknowledge that normal values, although possible in HE, may warrant reconsideration of the diagnosis. In this study, we propose a nuanced approach to ammonia testing in HE. Serum ammonia testing provides little additional benefit in clinical scenarios with a high or low pretest probability for HE. However, if the pretest probability for HE is uncertain, a low ammonia level may reduce the posttest probability of HE. In this scenario, other etiologies of altered mental status should be explored. Future research should focus on developing a standardized approach to serum ammonia collection, processing, and interpretation.

### Reconsidering the lack of urea toxicity in dialysis patients [^4d739911]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Urea is an old uremic toxin which has been used for many years as a global biomarker of CKD severity and dialysis adequacy. Old studies were not in favor of its role as a causal factor in the pathogenesis of complications associated with the uremic state. However, recent experimental and clinical evidence is compatible with both direct and indirect toxicity of urea, particularly via the deleterious actions of urea-derived carbamylated molecules. Further studies are clearly needed to explore the potential relevance of urea-related CKD complications for patient management, in particular the place of new therapeutic strategies to prevent urea toxicity.

### Hepatic glutamine synthetase augmentation enhances ammonia detoxification [^66e3c71b]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

The urea cycle and glutamine synthetase (GS) are the two main pathways for waste nitrogen removal and their deficiency results in hyperammonemia. Here, we investigated the efficacy of liver-specific GS overexpression for therapy of hyperammonemia. To achieve hepatic GS overexpression, we generated a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector expressing the murine GS under the control of a liver-specific expression cassette (HDAd-GS). Compared to mice injected with a control vector expressing an unrelated reporter gene (HDAd-alpha-fetoprotein), wild-type mice with increased hepatic GS showed reduced blood ammonia levels and a concomitant increase of blood glutamine after intraperitoneal injections of ammonium chloride, whereas blood urea was unaffected. Moreover, injection of HDAd-GS reduced blood ammonia levels at baseline and protected against acute hyperammonemia following ammonia challenge in a mouse model with conditional hepatic deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (Cps1), the initial and rate-limiting step of ureagenesis. In summary, we found that upregulation of hepatic GS reduced hyperammonemia in wild-type and Cps1-deficient mice, thus confirming a key role of GS in ammonia detoxification. These results suggest that hepatic GS augmentation therapy has potential for treatment of both primary and secondary forms of hyperammonemia.

### Hyperammonemia in the ICU [^212bf7d1]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing acute elevations of ammonia present to the ICU with encephalopathy, which may progress quickly to cerebral herniation. Patient survival requires immediate treatment of intracerebral hypertension and the reduction of ammonia levels. When hyperammonemia is not thought to be the result of liver failure, treatment for an occult disorder of metabolism must begin prior to the confirmation of an etiology. This article reviews ammonia metabolism, the effects of ammonia on the brain, the causes of hyperammonemia, and the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in adult patients.

### Lysine acetate, leucine, phenylalanine, valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, alanine, arginine, glycine, histidine, proline, glutamic acid, serine, aspartic acid, and tyrosine (plenamine) [^792c3bfa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

A. General

It is essential to provide adequate calories concurrently if parenterally administered amino acids are to be retained by the body and utilized for protein synthesis.

The administration of Plenamine™ 15% Amino Acids Injection as part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with large volumes of hyperosmotic fluids requires periodic monitoring of the patient for signs of hyperosmolarity, hyperglycemia, glycosuria and hypertriglyceridemia.

During parenteral nutrition with concentrated dextrose and amino acids solutions, essential fatty acid deficiency syndrome may develop but may not be clinically apparent. Early demonstration of this condition can only be accomplished by gas liquid chromatographic analysis of plasma lipids. The syndrome may be prevented or corrected by appropriate treatment with intravenous fat emulsions.

For complete nutritional support, TPN regimens must also include multiple vitamins and trace elements. Potentially incompatible ions such as calcium and phosphate may be added to alternate infusate bottles to avoid precipitation. Although the metabolizable acetate ion in Plenamine™ 15% diminishes the risk of acidosis, the physician must be alert to the potential appearance of this disorder.

Initiation and termination of infusions of TPN fluids must be gradual to permit adjustment of endogenous insulin release.

Undiluted Plenamine™ 15% should not be administered peripherally. When administered centrally, it should be diluted with appropriate diluents, e.g., dextrose, electrolytes and other nutrient components, to at least half strength. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

Caution against volume overload should be exercised.

Drug product contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum.

B. Laboratory Tests

Infusion of Plenamine™ 15% without concomitant infusion of an adequate number of non-protein calories may result in elevated BUN. Monitoring of BUN is required and the balance between Plenamine™ 15% and the calorie source may require adjustment. Frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory determinations are required to prevent the complications which may occur during the administration of solutions used in TPN. Laboratory tests should include blood glucose, serum electrolytes, liver and kidney function, serum osmolarity, blood ammonia, serum protein, pH, hematocrit, WBC and urinary glucose. When Plenamine™ 15% is combined with electrolytes, care should be used in administering this solution to patients with congestive heart failure, renal failure, edema, adrenal hyperactivity, acid-base imbalance and those receiving diuretics or antihypertensive therapy. Total volume infused should be closely monitored. Serum electrolytes should be monitored daily in these patients.

### Fasting blood ammonia predicts risk and frequency of hepatic encephalopathy episodes in patients with cirrhosis [^2d347d31]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

There is controversy over the use of measuring blood levels of ammonia (NH3) in the management of patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind study of 178 patients with cirrhosis given glycerol phenylbutyrate (an NH3-lowering agent) or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline and on study days 7 and 14 and NH3 levels were measured. The probabilities of having an HE episode, based on ammonia values, were modeled using binary logistic regression. A Cox proportional model was used to determine the risk of HE episodes in patients with baseline fasting NH3 levels ≤ 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus patients with fasting NH3 levels > 1.5-fold the ULN.

Results

The risk and frequency of HE episodes and HE-related hospitalizations correlated with baseline (mean, 51 ± 6 μmol/L; ULN, 35 μmol/L) and on-study fasting levels of NH3, and increased sharply at levels > 1.5-fold the ULN. Regardless of baseline level, NH3 exposure and the relative risk of HE episodes were decreased by glycerol phenylbutyrate.

Conclusions

In analysis of data from a phase 2 study of the effects of glycerol phenylbutyrate in patients with cirrhosis, we found that fasting levels of NH3 in blood can identify patients at risk for HE-related morbidity. Patients with HE might benefit from NH3-lowering therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT 00999167.

### Using machine learning methods to predict 28-day mortality in patients with hepatic encephalopathy [^266d1de1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a recent research, researchers also identified SOFA and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as factors associated with 30-day mortality in patients with HE. Patients with HE are functionally immuno-suppressed and susceptible to infection, which is a frequent precipitant for organ dysfunction. Likewise, the resultant organ failures as indicated by high SOFA and APSIII means significant mortality. Changes in TBIL and albumin often reflect liver function in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is closely associated with a poor prognosis. Peng Y et al. in their study concluded that TBIL was independently correlated with in-hospital death in cirrhotic patients with HE. Bai Z et al. reported that albumin level was an independent risk factor for HE-associated mortality during hospitalizations in cirrhosis (OR = 0.864, 95% CI = 0.771–0.967). Other studies have also validated this finding. By conducting a preliminary observation, Udayakumar N et al. found that high serum bilirubin values in chronic liver disease were simple parameters that would predict a poor outcome in patients with HE. Moreover, serum bilirubin levels as prognostic biochemical markers have been reported elsewhere and are similar to our observations. One previous investigation identified elevated levels of TBIL, BUN, and decreased albumin as factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute HE. In addition, Hung TH et al. in their study also identified that AKI increased the 3-year mortality of cirrhotic patients with HE. Other study also found that AKI was the main independent predictor of ICU death and 1-year mortality. Possible mechanisms may be that the increased ammonia from blood stream exacerbates cerebral edema in cirrhotic patients with HE. Additionally, according to Cui Y et al. hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) was independent factor associated with 3-month death. Notably, decreased kidney function usually accompanies end-stage liver disease, including HRS. Renal dysfunction can increase BUN, and in turn, resultant diffusion of BUN into the intestine can cause enhanced ammonia uptake accompanied by worsening of HE. Previous studies explored the prognostic factors correlated with 180 cirrhotic patients presenting with HE who were admitted to ICU. And researchers also found that the use of mechanical ventilation was a significant risk factor for mortality. The study by Saffo S et al. has demonstrated that mechanical ventilation was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality in their primary analysis (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.14–4.20; P < 0.001) and in all sensitivity analyses. Studies by Benhaddouch Z et al. came to similar conclusion. This may be due to the fact that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are at a greater risk for the complications of mechanical ventilation because of possible underlying circulatory, neurologic, and immunologic disturbance. Mechanical ventilation itself may aggravate the existing condition, manifested as impairment in cardiovascular and cognitive function and immune defense, consequently, patients with hepatic encephalopathy may particularly be susceptible to developing such complications as shock, progressive delirium, and infection. Although MELD and MELD-Na are accurate, highly specific scores that are commonly used to reveal liver disease severity and quantify mortality risk, the predicative performance for 28-day mortality of these scores in patients with HE remains unclear. Hence, we performed the ROC curves in this study, and found that the AUCs of the MELD and MELD-Na scores for 28-day mortality was lower than that of NNET. which suggested our model was superior to other models in terms of diagnostic discrimination. The reason for this may be, that only simple indicators (creatinine, bilirubin, and INR) cannot precisely assess the degree of cirrhosis. Moreover, a frequently reported drawback of the MELD score was that it has the disadvantage of lacking objective parameters reflecting the patient 's physical and nutritional status, including albumin.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^baa37a16]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Hyperammonaemia is defined as > 100 µmol/l (170 µg/dl) in neonates or50 µmol/l (85 µg/dl) in term infants, children and adolescents. Individual laboratory reference intervals vary and some age dependency of ammonia levels is evident (that is, levels are higher in premature neonates). Early onset hyperammonaemia presents in neonates within the first few days of life after they start to feed and can no longer rely on maternal (placental) transport to appropriately eliminate the accumulating ammonia. Symptoms in preterm neonates typically result from transient hyperammonaemia of the newborn, which is characterized by the absence of organic acidurias and normal activity of urea cycle enzymes. This subtype is usually associated with complete recovery, usually without needing treatment.

In hyperammonaemia, the acute rise in ammonia levels in the brain leads to increased levels of extracellular potassium and metabolism of ammonia to glutamine by astrocytes. These changes result in increased intracellular osmolality, cerebral oedema and the release of inflammatory cytokines. High levels of extracellular potassium and glutamate released by astrocytes lead to neuronal damage. Elevated levels of glutamine, which is the end product of ammonia detoxification, is a key factor in both hepatic encephalopathy and ammonia-related neurotoxicity. Apart from hyperammonaemia, adverse effects on the nitric oxide pathway are also thought to lead to brain damage in patients with UCDs. The clinical abnormalities observed vary for each specific UCD, but most patients tend to have similar symptoms. The clinical features of an acute hyperammonaemic episode depend on the age of the patient and the cause of the elevation in plasma ammonia levels. Early symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite and vomiting. As ammonia levels rise, symptoms can progress to hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alkalosis, hypotonia, ataxia, disorientation, seizures and, if untreated, coma and death. Late-onset hyperammonaemia in children, adolescents or adults can result from a partial or mild deficiency in a urea cycle enzyme that is exacerbated by certain stressors. Such children or adolescents present with failure to thrive, irritability, seizures, vomiting, ataxia and intellectual disabilities. Management of hyperammonaemia is challenging in paediatric populations given the non-specific clinical symptoms, the age-specific aetiologies and the lack of consensus in the treatment plan. Historically, the prognosis in neonates with hyperammonaemia was poor, but current treatments, along with prompt identification of hyperammonaemia, have considerably improved the survival of affected neonates(Fig. 2), although updated survival data are not available.

### Sodium benzoate for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in humans and animals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^38b6cfde]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with an impaired liver function caused by end-stage liver disease or liver failure can develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Brain function is impaired in HE. Even though the precise underlying pathophysiology of HE is unclear, it is widely accepted that increased amounts of ammonia in the systemic circulation is a key factor. Ammonia is produced during the metabolism of amino acids and other compounds that contain nitrogen and in the intestine by intestinal bacterial flora. Physiologically ammonia is cleared in the liver where it is converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea is water-soluble and is subsequently excreted via the urine. If this system is somehow compromised, systemic ammonia levels rise, with the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier and cause brain damage. When ammonia levels rise acutely, astrocytes increase the conversion of ammonia into glutamine via glutamine synthase, which causes brain edema. Second, due to the increased glutamine production, there is an increase of reactive oxygen species, which triggers inflammatory cascades. It is hypothesized that, in chronically elevated ammonia, the enzyme glutamine synthase is downregulated, resulting in lower glutamine and higher brain ammonia levels. Ammonia is also directly neurotoxic, enhancing inhibitory signaling through multiple mechanisms, including GABA and glutamate. In patients with liver disease, HE is a predictor of poor outcome, and it is associated with a 1-year mortality of up to 54% and, therefore, a serious complication. Currently, treatment for HE in hepatic failure or portosystemic shunting is directed at reducing ammonia concentrations by reducing production and absorption in the intestines, mainly through the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol, and antibiotics such as rifaximin. However, no universally accepted guidelines for the treatment of HE exist.

### Prolonged continuous intravenous infusion of the dipeptide L-alanine-L-glutamine significantly increases plasma glutamine and alanine without elevating brain glutamate in patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^18a15418]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Side effects of prolonged infusion of a higher glutamine and alanine dose

In line with amino acid-induced ammoniagenesis and ureagenesis the presently investigated patients showed increased ammonia and urea levels during L-alanine-L-glutamine infusion compared to baseline values, as they received an average total nitrogen load of 19.7 g/d (median enteral nitrogen load 9.7 g/d, median parenteral nitrogen load from L-alanine-L-glutamine infusion 10 g/d). The elevated urea and ammonia levels did not reach worrisome levels and were not associated with signs of neurologic and metabolic deterioration as ICP remained unchanged, and glutamate was significantly decreased in the face of stable brain metabolism reflected by unchanged cerebral lactate and lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. Apparently, critically ill patients, even with normal hepatic function according to laboratory values and medical history, respond differently to protein load compared to healthy individuals who can tolerate a glutamine load of 0.65 g glutamine/kg/d without increased plasma ammonia levels. As the increased blood ammonia and urea levels were well within the normal range this metabolic response is not considered a safety concern. The currently investigated patients did not show any signs of hepatic or renal dysfunction. Thus, the investigated dose and duration cannot be extrapolated to all patients. The primary aim of these investigations was to determine pharmacodynamic changes. In this context, the missing control group does not allow us to differentiate influences on ammoniagenesis and ureagenesis attributable to nutrition or alanyl-glutamine infusion.

Limitations of the present study

The low number of patients and the chosen study design without having included a control group does not allow us to recommend the investigated dose and duration in all patients. The presently investigated patients comprise a well-defined subpopulation, which does not allow us to generalize as these patients did not suffer from any additional organ dysfunction apart from brain injury, did not require dialysis or hemofiltration, and had a well-functioning gastrointestinal tract receiving enteral nutrition according to the individually determined caloric requirement.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^5c39e949]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation — observational cohorts link higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at start and later initiation from intensive care unit (ICU) admission with higher mortality. In PICARD, initiation at higher BUN (> 76 mg/dl [blood urea ≥ 27.1 mmol/l]) had increased risk of death (RR 1.85; 95% CI 1.16–2.96) among 243 patients at five sites. In a multicenter cohort across 54 ICUs in 23 countries, timing by serum urea (median 24.2 mmol/l [BUN 67.8 mg/dl]) showed no mortality difference, but late RRT by time from ICU admission (more than 5 days) had greater crude mortality (72.8% late vs. 62.3% delayed vs. 59% early, P = 0.001) and higher covariate-adjusted mortality (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.30–2.92; P = 0.001), with late RRT also associated with longer RRT duration, longer hospital stay, and greater dialysis dependence. In surgical ICU acute kidney injury, late initiation defined as RIFLE-I or -F was an independent predictor of mortality (HR 1.846; CI 1.07–3.18).

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^9df4da22]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We conclude that sample handling, processing, and protein intake have a major impact on ammonia levels and are important to account for in multicenter studies, which highlight the unreliability of ammonia measures for clinical practice.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^bcfe0fa7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current multicenter experience demonstrates that wide variability and lability of serum ammonia levels can confound interpretation, which highlights the unreliability of ammonia as a clinical measure. These results are consistent with American Association for Study of Liver Disease/European Association for the Study of Liver guidelines recommending against using ammonia levels alone for managing HE. This is relevant when ammonia levels are used as the major determinant of trial entry or success/failure. Variation in ammonia levels between sites additionally confounds ammonia level interpretation, particularly because it biases uniformity of the ULN. Correlation with MELD likely reflects hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Interestingly, this variation was reduced but not eliminated even with a detailed protocol for blood draw and analysis, rarely followed in routine clinical practice. Moreover, norms generated using ULN from healthy controls were largely different from those that were followed locally. This further demonstrates the need to restandardize ammonia measurements (as has been encouraged for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and international normalized ratio) for research.

We also found a major discordance between frozen-thawed and freshly drawn ammonia samples. This poses a challenge to multicenter trials using central laboratories to analyze flash-frozen samples. These results further suggest that if ammonia levels are to be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials, local analytic parameters must likely be standardized.

Previous single-center HV studies have demonstrated an increase in ammonia with high protein loads (30 and 60 g), as have single-center studies with glutamine and other amino acids. Our study extends this experience of ammonia lability using a shake with only 20 g of protein, which better replicates a "real-world" experience. This result could inform studies that rely on multiple inpatient and outpatient blood draws to time ammonia sampling with respect to meals.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^f43ffde4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — acute kidney injury (AKI) burden and renal replacement therapy (RRT): AKI is common, with reports that up to 70% of US ALFSG patients experienced AKI and 30% required RRT; another center reported 63.4% AKI in ICU admissions. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data noted renal dysfunction in 56% of 2,820 ALF transplant-listed patients (2002–2012). Indications for RRT include acid–base disturbances, oliguria, and volume overload. CRRT is described as the preferred modality due to lower risk of cardiovascular instability and CE compared with intermittent hemodialysis, effectively lowering ammonia and serving as an increasing indication independent of AKI; early CRRT improves survival by preventing severe hyperammonemia.

Table 3
Summary of included articles assessing the relation between UCR and protein intake in critically Ill patients

Overview of studies that have examined the effect of a protein intervention on UCR (urea-to-creatinine ratio) responses during critical illness. The table focuses on UCR and the most important inclusion and exclusion criteria; other possible study outcomes unrelated to UCR are not described. The table reports whether the studies used blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratios or urea-to-creatinine ratios, both of which are encompassed under the term UCR. Furthermore, in the event of a reported value, the unit of measurement utilised in the UCR is explicitly stated (mg/dL: mg/dL or mmol/L:mmol/L). For details regarding unit conversion, see Fig. 4. F female, HR hazard ratio, ICU intensive care unit, M male, RCT randomized controlled trial, REDOXS trial REducing deaths due to oxidative stress trial, Urea/Cr/UCR urea-to-creatinine ratio

In this review, the term UCR is used to refer to both the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine ratio and the urea-to-creatinine ratio due to both measurements being reported as UCR in the studies under review. If values are referenced in the review, they pertain to the BUN-to-creatinine ratio in mg/dL:mg/dL, unless otherwise indicated. In instances where five or more studies employed the same outcome measure and sufficient event data were available to calculate risk ratios, post-hoc meta-analyses were conducted with a random effects model using R Studio version 2023.06.1 and R version 4.4.1 and presented in forest plots. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 measure, and a P -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The established cut-off values for UCR were maintained, as presented in the original studies, with the UCR cut-off value illustrated in the meta-analysis. In cases where multiple cut-off values were reported, the one most consistent with the other studies was used.

### Fatal hyperammonemia after repeat renal transplantation [^59cb66d9]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old man had symptomatic hyperammonemia and normal liver function after repeat kidney transplantation. He presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, which quickly progressed to altered mental status. Therapy was instituted to clear the ammonia, but the ammonia level continued to rise. Eventually, the patient became unresponsive, and an emergent computed tomographic scan showed cerebral herniation. Urine acids and serum organic acids were not diagnostic of any urea cycle disorder. Histology did not reveal a clear etiology for the hyperammonemia.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) [^0f00c9f6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Who should not take BUPHENYL?

BUPHENYL is prescribed only for patients with urea cycle disorders. It is not to be used for any other reason. Keep the medication in a safe place where children ­cannot reach it.

What other medical conditions may also be present that could increase the risk of taking BUPHENYL?

Heart failure or decreased kidney function may lead to retention of the sodium content of BUPHENYL with potentially serious consequences such as worsening heart failure, high blood pressure, and swelling. If these medical conditions are present, the doctor will determine if your child should take BUPHENYL.

How should I or my child take BUPHENYL?

The dose of BUPHENYL prescribed for adults and children is based upon the patient's weight or size. It is very important that the full amount prescribed for any 24-hour period be taken. If a dose is missed it should be administered as soon as possible that same day. The total daily dose should be administered in equally divided amounts with meals.

What medications should I or my child avoid or be cautious of taking while on BUPHENYL?

Patients with urea cycle disorders usually should not take Depakene®(valproic acid), a drug sometimes prescribed for seizure disorders, or Haldol®(haloperidol), a drug used to treat certain types of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Both of these drugs have been reported to increase blood ammonia levels. Steroids may break down body protein, thereby increasing blood ammonia levels. The doctor should be consulted before administering medications containing steroids.

Attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or a high protein meal — vomiting induced by metabolic disorders often follows a catabolic state induced by acute illness, fasting, or a high protein meal. A symptomatic metabolic disorder constitutes a medical emergency with substantial risks for morbidity and mortality if appropriate treatment is not instituted promptly. If a metabolic disorder is suspected, then blood and urine for testing should be obtained immediately, followed by delivery of 10% dextrose-containing intravenous fluid at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance, and consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. In partial urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, ammonia accumulation may present following the ingestion of a high protein meal or with fasting, and a urea cycle disorder is suggested by a plasma ammonia level of ≥ 150 μmol/L when symptomatic.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to extracorporeal detoxification (hybrid therapy), NRN 2020 guidelines recommend to consider performing hemodialysis or continuous RRT combined with ECMO for the treatment of hyperammonemia in the following situations:

- hemodynamic instability in a small neonatal patient with poor vascular access for standard continuous RRT

- rapidly deteriorating neurological status, coma, or cerebral edema

- presence of moderate or severe encephalopathy (moderate encephalopathy is defined as lethargy, distal flexion, decreased activity, complete extension, hypotonia, weak suck or incomplete Moro reflex, constricted pupils, or bradycardia; severe encephalopathy is defined as stupor or coma, no activity, decerebrate posture, flaccid tone, absent suck, absent Moro reflex, pupils non-reactive to light, variable HR or sleep apnea)

- persistently high blood ammonia levels > 400 mcmol/L refractory to non-RRT

- a rapid rise in ammonia levels to > 300 mcmol/L within a few hours that cannot be controlled via non-RRT.

WARNINGS

Safe, effective use of parenteral nutrition requires a knowledge of nutrition as well as clinical expertise in recognition and treatment of the complications which can occur. Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring of parenteral nutrition. Studies should include blood sugar, serum proteins, kidney and liver function tests, electrolytes, hemogram, carbon dioxide content, serum osmolalities, blood cultures, and blood ammonia levels.

WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

Administration of amino acids in the presence of impaired renal function or gastrointestinal bleeding may augment an already elevated blood urea nitrogen. Patients with azotemia from any cause should not be infused with amino acids without regard to total nitrogen intake.

Administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the solutions. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the solutions.

Administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with hepatic insufficiency may result in plasma amino acid imbalances, hyperammonemia, prerenal azotemia, stupor and coma.

Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants as its occurrence in the syndrome caused by genetic metabolic defects is sometimes associated, although not necessarily in a causal relationship, with mental retardation. This reaction appears to be dose related and is more likely to develop during prolonged therapy. It is essential that blood ammonia be measured frequently in infants. The mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically impaired liver function.

Conservative doses of amino acids should be given, dictated by the nutritional status of the patient. Should symptoms of hyperammonemia develop, amino acid administration should be discontinued and the patient's clinical status reevaluated.

### Development and validation of a model for predicting the early occurrence of RF in ICU-admitted AECOPD patients: a retrospective analysis based on the MIMIC-IV database [^e991987b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

BUN is an end product of protein metabolism, during which proteins in the body break down into amino acids, and after deamination of amino acids, ammonia is produced and detoxified in the liver, forming BUN. Previous studies have shown that BUN, in addition to reflecting kidney function, also to some extent indicated muscle mass. Our study revealed that BUN was an effective predictive indicator for the occurrence of RF in AECOPD patients. A higher BUN level had a higher nomogram score, indicating a higher probability of RF occurrence. This phenomenon may be attributed to the increased energy consumption and muscle protein breakdown in the acute phase of COPD, leading to an elevation in BUN. The increased energy consumption and muscle breakdown can cause intense inflammatory reactions and malnutrition, further resulting in skeletal muscle dysfunction. Additionally, other studies suggest that muscle wasting can impact diaphragmatic fatigue, reduce respiratory muscle strength, and contribute to RF in AECOPD patients. The number of research on the correlation between decreased kidney function and RF is limited. A study reported that positive fluid balance was a risk factor for the inability of chronic critically ill patients to wean off mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we speculate that declining kidney function may cause disturbances in fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing pulmonary edema, and subsequently resulting in the occurrence of RF.

### Chemotactic Zn micromotor for treatment of high blood ammonia-associated hepatic encephalopathy [^22aab97a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ammonia is a natural endogenous molecule. In vivo, blood ammonia primarily originates from the catabolism of amino acids and proteins by bacteria in the gut, hydrolysis of urea, and deamidation of amino acids in liver. The produced ammonia is typically metabolized in the liver through catalysis of low-toxic glutamine from NH 4 + by glutamine synthetaseor ammonia conversion into urea –. Under normal conditions, the liver maintains blood ammonia (lower than 50 μM in serum) at a low level of dynamic equilibrium. However, upon the metabolic function of hepatocytes decreases, excessive accumulation of ammonia in the liver is resulted, along with a rise in blood ammonia levels. Ammonia accumulation results in inflammatory necrosis of liver cells, even liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hyperammonemia can further lead to hepatic encephalopathy –, with clinical manifestations including behavioral disorders, and even coma. Ammonia permeates the blood-brain barrier predominantly via passive diffusion in its neutral form (NH 3), while the ammonium ion (NH 4 +) traverses to a lesser extent through potassium transporter-mediated mechanisms –. Astrocytes are the only brain cells capable of metabolizing ammonia; however, excessive ammonia causes astrocyte edema –, which inhibits the possibility of neuronal repair, causing irreversible brain damage. Therefore, targeted ammonia clearance is meaningful for the hepatic encephalopathy therapy.

### Blood ammonia and glutamine as predictors of hyperammonemic crises in patients with urea cycle disorder [^f3f5ebe6]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to examine predictors of ammonia exposure and hyperammonemic crises in patients with urea cycle disorders.

Methods

The relationships between fasting ammonia, daily ammonia exposure, and hyperammonemic crises were analyzed in > 100 patients with urea cycle disorders.

Results

Fasting ammonia correlated strongly with daily ammonia exposure (r = 0.764; P < 0.001). For patients with fasting ammonia concentrations < 0.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), 0.5 to < 1.0 ULN, and ≥ 1.0 ULN, the probability of a normal average daily ammonia value was 87, 60, and 39%, respectively, and 10.3, 14.1, and 37.0% of these patients, respectively, experienced ≥ 1 hyperammonemic crisis over 12 months. Time to first hyperammonemic crisis was shorter (P = 0.008) and relative risk (4.5×; P = 0.011) and rate (~5×, P = 0.006) of hyperammonemic crises were higher in patients with fasting ammonia ≥ 1.0 ULN vs. < 0.5ULN; relative risk was even greater (20×; P = 0.009) in patients ≥ 6 years old. A 10- or 25-µmol/l increase in ammonia exposure increased the relative risk of a hyperammonemic crisis by 50 and > 200% (P < 0.0001), respectively. The relationship between ammonia and hyperammonemic crisis risk seemed to be independent of treatment, age, urea cycle disorder subtype, dietary protein intake, or blood urea nitrogen. Fasting glutamine correlated weakly with daily ammonia exposure assessed as 24-hour area under the curve and was not a significant predictor of hyperammonemic crisis.

Conclusion

Fasting ammonia correlates strongly and positively with daily ammonia exposure and with the risk and rate of hyperammonemic crises, suggesting that patients with urea cycle disorder may benefit from tight ammonia control.

### Relationship between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and short-term mortality among patients from the surgical intensive care unit: a population-based real-world study [^f92ca0d9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well-established that protein catabolism is heightened in critically ill patients, leading to an elevation in BUN levels. Renal reabsorption of urea nitrogen likewise affects the BUN levels of patients. Urea nitrogen is passively reabsorbed with water and sodium in the proximal renal tubule. In the more distal renal units, urea nitrogen reabsorption is also closely related to water reabsorption under the influence of antidiuretic hormone, which in turn is regulated by angiotensin II. When patients are dehydrated or have certain cardiovascular diseases occurring, sympathetic excitation and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system can increase the reabsorption of urea nitrogen by the body. Therefore, high BUN level also reflects the state of renal hypoperfusion caused by hypovolemia or reduction of cardiac output. One study has already reported that BUN levels at admission and at discharge were predictors of prognosis in patients with heart failure, and patients with high BUN levels had a poorer prognosis. Additionally, serum albumin serves as a partial indicator of the organism's nutritional status and fulfills crucial functions such as maintaining plasma colloid osmolality, acting as an antioxidant, eliminating oxygen free radicals, serving as a carrier for various compounds, and inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. Hypoalbuminemia has linked to decreased overall survival and increased recurrence rates in diverse malignant tumors.

### Ammonium quantification in human plasma by proton nuclear magnetic resonance for staging of liver fibrosis in alcohol-related liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^70e60c00]. NMR in Biomedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We have developed a method to quantify endogenous ammonium in blood plasma and shown it to be a sensitive biomarker of liver disease. The ammonium cation (NH 4 +) is an essential biomolecule in blood derived from the breakdown of nucleic acids and amino acids: the two processes used by vertebrates to fulfill their nitrogen demand. Ammonium homeostasis is governed systemically by the interplay of multiple organs including the liver, the gastrointestinal system, the muscles, the kidneys, and the brain.

The physiological concentration of NH 4 + in blood at equilibrium is about 40 μM in healthy subjects but may be significantly altered due to pathological conditions. For example, liver disfunction may disrupt the metabolism of NH 4 + into urea and lead to a life‐threatening increase of ammonium in blood. High blood NH 4 + concentration (above 50 μM) is associated with endstage liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy, neutrophil dysfunction, muscle breakdown, and cancer, although its origin remains elusive. In recent research, high levels of NH 4 + have also been found in patients with NASH. Therefore, NH 4 + levels could be a valuable biomarker of liver impairment that together with other assays could shine light on its cause. Yet, a robust and reliable method to quantify blood ammonium concentrations for samples from healthy and diseased patients is not available. Current plasma ammonia quantification methods include titration, colorimetry or fluorometry, electrode‐based, and enzymatic processes. These methods suffer from significant limitations, namely (i) sample contamination (e.g. with volatile bases during titration), (ii) interference from other compounds normally present in blood,(iii) suboptimal environmental conditions for the proper activity of the enzymes involved in the measurement (e.g. low pH and the presence of inhibitors in severe liver disease), and (iv) method calibration using samples of healthy subjects. The latter is critical in a clinical setting, as healthy individuals represent a relatively homogenous sample pool with well‐known basal conditions, while samples from patients with various stages of liver disease present heterogeneous conditions that may affect the NH 4 + readout (e.g. blood pH or lipids concentration). Furthermore, certain biochemical processes such as deamination in patients with elevated gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity and as a consequence of haemolysis can alter blood NH 4 + concentrations postextraction, confounding quantification.

### Evaluation of the hepa wash® treatment in pigs with acute liver failure [^a9ee2dff]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The preserved urine production in the Hepa Wash group might additionally have contributed to the lower creatinine and BUN values, as these water soluble toxins were also effectively eliminated by Hepa Wash. A criticism to the design of the studies may emerge as the medical management of control animals did not comprise hemodialysis. Hyperkalemia was treated successfully with insulin-glucose therapy. No hypoglycemia was observed which could have been a confounding factor for the worse outcome in the control group. The metabolic acidosis was not severe enough to warrant hemodialysis. Oliguria in the ALF model was the only clinical condition which might have prompted the initiation of hemodialysis but then the mean arterial pressure was already very low to allow for treatment with extracorporeal procedures.

The improvement of the cerebral perfusion pressure in the treatment groups was mainly due to amelioration of the mean arterial pressure since the intracranial pressure in the ALF animal model did not show rapid and severe elevations. Therefore, cerebral perfusion pressure appears to be a better parameter to assess the treatment effects. These more pronounced effects on cerebral perfusion pressure are supported by elimination of ammonia by Hepa Wash. In the animal studies on MARS and Prometheus, the intracranial pressure was significantly reduced, though no significant elimination of ammonia was found. The lower levels of intracranial pressure in our ALF model compared with the other models and the resultant difficulty in showing significant differences may explain the different results.

The treatment with Hepa Wash may have improved survival by supporting the detoxification function of the liver and the kidney, thereby interrupting the vicious cycle of elevated toxin level and the resultant worsening of multiple organ failure. Removal of liver disease-related toxins like ammonia, creatinine, bilirubin and vasodilators may reduce their toxic effects and improve the multiple organ failure. We did not use scoring systems like SOFA or MELD as they should be first validated in this animal model (which is of a short duration). The use of surrogate markers and mortality may obviate the use of scoring systems. Bilirubin elimination was not measured in the dialysate or filtrate, whereas the removed acid–base from blood is difficult to accurately quantify due to the nature of the procedure which involves adding strong acid and base to the dialysate. However, the improvement of plasma levels of these surrogate markers may support our assumption of the good detoxification capacity of the procedure.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen level as a predictor of mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure [^b9d807b4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalization for decompensated heart failure is associated with high mortality after discharge. In heart failure, renal function involves both cardiovascular and hemodynamic properties. We studied the relation between renal dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure.

Methods

The prognostic importance of four measures of renal function-blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio, and estimated creatinine clearance-was evaluated in 541 patients (mean [± SD] age, 63 ± 14 years; 377 men [70%]) with a previous diagnosis of heart failure (96% with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms) who were admitted for clinical decompensation.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 343 ± 185 days, 177 patients (33%) died. In multivariable Cox regression models, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with each quartile of blood urea nitrogen, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.3 in patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 4.1; P = 0.005). Creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance were not significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for other covariates. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio yielded similar prognostic information as blood urea nitrogen (adjusted relative risk = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4 to 3.8; P = 0.0007 for patients in the upper compared with the lower quartiles).

Conclusion

Blood urea nitrogen is a simple clinical variable that provides useful prognostic information in patients admitted for decompensated heart failure. In this setting, elevated blood urea nitrogen levels probably reflect the cumulative effects of hemodynamic and neurohormonal alterations that result in renal hypoperfusion.

### Activity-based sensing reveals elevated labile copper promotes liver aging via hepatic ALDH1A1 depletion [^c25b0f4d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Total Protein (TP): Cupric ions in an alkaline solution react with proteins and polypeptides containing at least two peptide bonds to produce a violet colored complex. The absorbance of the complex at 540/660 nm is directly proportional to the concentration of protein in the sample.

Urea Nitrogen (BUN): Urea is hydrolyzed enzymatically by urease to yield ammonia and carbon dioxide. The ammonia and α-oxoglutarate are converted to glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH). Simultaneously, a molar equivalent of reduced NADH is oxidized. The rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm, due to the disappearance of NADH, is directly proportional to the BUN concentration in the sample.

Each assay included quality control samples analyzed daily to verify performance. All results were recorded as U/L for enzymatic activity or mg/dL for concentrations, with conversions to SI units as required. The analytical measurement ranges and interference limits for each assay were consistent with the manufacturer's instructions.

Proteomic analyzes were carried out in the Proteomics Core of the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Liver tissue was homogenized in PBS buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide. The samples were boiled for 30 min to fully denature the proteins and promote reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds. Proteins were chloroform-methanol precipitated and then resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Protein concentration was determined via BCA assay, and the proteins were then digested with trypsin 1:50 w/w (enzyme:substrate) at 37 C. On the following day, the tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 Sep Paks (Waters) and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^b645ac1d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

Methods:

We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

Results:

Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hour, respectively, after a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83) but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

Discussion:

Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.

### Consensus guidelines for management of hyperammonaemia in paediatric patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy [^2e9715cc]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In aqueous solution, ammonia exists as ammonium hydroxide ions, which aid in maintaining acid–base homeostasis, as expressed by the following equilibrium:

Hyperammonaemia is the excessive accumulation of ammonia in the blood, which can result in moderate to severe neurological impairment and cerebral oedema. Ammonia is produced by amino acid catabolism, the activity of glutamine dehydrogenase in the liver, kidney, pancreas and brain, and by the deamination of AMP during exercise in skeletal muscle. Most ammonia produced enters the urea cycle in hepatocytes, is excreted in the urine as urea or is converted into glutamine, a fraction of which is also excreted by the kidneys.

Typically, blood ammonia concentrations ≤ 35 µmol/l (< 60 µg/dl) are considered normal, whereas high concentrations can produce toxic effects and levels > 200 µmol/l (341 µg/dl) are associated with poor neurological outcomes. The primary differential diagnosis of hyperammonaemia in infants and children relates to inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders (UCDs) and organic acidaemias. Toxic levels of ammonia can be due to either a primary or a secondary deficiency of the urea cycle. Congenital deficiency of any of the six enzymes within this cycle — N -acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), carbamoyl phosphate synthase I (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase 1 — will result in a build-up of both ammonia and the substrate of the specific enzyme. UCDs occur in ~1 in 35,000 births, among which OTC deficiency is the most common, with an incidence of 1 in 56,500 births. Hyperammonaemia due to secondary inhibition of the urea cycle occurs in the context of other congenital metabolic abnormalities (such as organic acidaemias), following exposure to certain drugs (such as valproic acid) and in various liver diseases. Organic acidaemias, including methylmalonic acidaemia, propionic acidaemia, isovaleric acidaemia and multiple carboxylase deficiency occur in ~1 in 21,000 births and typically lead to mild to moderate hyperammonaemia due to competitive inhibition of NAGS –. Paediatric patients with acute liver or kidney injury are also susceptible to an accumulation of ammonia due to impaired metabolism and excretion processes, respectively(Fig. 1).

### The role of RRT in hyperammonemic patients [^2127467d]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperammonemia is an important cause of cerebral edema in both adults with liver failure and children with inborn errors of metabolism. There are few studies that have analyzed the role of extracorporeal dialysis in reducing blood ammonia levels in the adult population. Furthermore, there are no firm guidelines about when to implement RRT, because many of the conditions that are characterized by hyperammonemia are extremely rare. In this review of existing literature on RRT, we present the body's own mechanisms for clearing ammonia as well as the dialytic properties of ammonia. We review the available literature on the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltration, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis in neonates and adults with conditions characterized by hyperammonemia and discuss some of the controversies that exist over selecting one modality over another.

### Sodium phenylbutyrate tablets, 500 mg (sodium phenylbutyrate) [^dffe1ddc]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Who should not take sodium phenylbutyrate tablets?

Sodium phenylbutyrate tablets is prescribed only for patients with urea cycle disorders. It is not to be used for any other reason. Keep the medication in a safe place where children cannot reach it.

What other medical conditions may also be present that could increase the risk of taking sodium phenylbutyrate tablets?

Heart failure or decreased kidney function may lead to retention of the sodium content of sodium phenylbutyrate tablets with potentially serious consequences such as worsening heart failure, high blood pressure, and swelling. If these medical conditions are present, the doctor will determine if your child should take sodium phenylbutyrate tablets.

How should I or my child take sodium phenylbutyrate tablets?

The dose of sodium phenylbutyrate tablets prescribed for adults and children is based upon the patient's weight or size. It is very important that the full amount prescribed for any 24-hour period be taken. If a dose is missed it should be administered as soon as possible that same day. The total daily dose should be administered in equally divided amounts with meals.

What medications should I or my child avoid or be cautious of taking while on sodium phenylbutyrate tablets?

Patients with urea cycle disorders usually should not take Depakene®(valproic acid), a drug sometimes prescribed for seizure disorders, or Haldol®(haloperidol), a drug used to treat certain types of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. Both of these drugs have been reported to increase blood ammonia levels. Steroids may break down body protein, thereby increasing blood ammonia levels. The doctor should be consulted before administering medications containing steroids.

### Hyperammonia induces specific liver injury through an intrinsic Ca2 +-independent apoptosis pathway [^17f176a8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute liver failure is a multisystem disorder associated with acute renal failure, hypotension, sepsis, coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and cerebral edema. Some researchers have considered that a few hepatocytes are required to restore the liver mass after profound liver injury, while other liver-repopulation and transplantation studies have indicated that bone-marrow stem cells might have the capacity to differentiate into hepatocytes. However, the regenerative capacity is insufficient after chronic liver injury. Currently, most researchers consider that the activation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of cells in the regenerating liver are controlled by a large number of growth factors and cytokines, which expressed at the sites of injury or reach the liver via the circulatory system. Furthermore, a recent study found that severe lactic acidosis was harmful for cirrhotic patients. Our preclinical studies showed that the clinical symptoms of some patients with liver failure, who did not present with symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and were treated with blood ammonia-lowering drugs, were greatly relieved. The primary disease process in the liver is complicated because of numerous metabolic disturbances throughout the body. Therefore, we inferred that a reduction in the blood ammonia level could promote the functions of synthesis, secretion, and transformation in liver cells and simultaneously relieve the damage to liver cells. Recent studies showed that increasing ammonia concentrations had deleterious effects on the functions of the central nervous system and the elevation of arterial ammonia was associated with high mortality in patients with acute liver failure. Ammonia is a neurotoxin involved in the pathogenesis of neurological disease associated with hyperammonia. Hyperammonia following acute and chronic liver diseases may lead to HE, which is accompanied by the failure of energy metabolism, disturbances of neurotransmission in the brain, and changes in Na + -K + -ATPase. Moreover, our study showed that there was no change in Na + -K + -ATPase using gene chip assays, but arginine disappeared. Although the liver can convert ammonia to nontoxic urea through the urea cycle, the urea synthesis capacity is reduced in patients with liver disease, leading to a reduced capacity to detoxify ammonia in the liver. Besides, hyperammonia is also produced in urea cycle disorders and other conditions leading to either defective ammonium removal or overproduction of ammonium beyond the capacity of liver clearance. Therefore, we thought that ammonia might induce liver injury through another mechanism. However, there are few reports about whether increasing blood ammonia can lead to the damage of hepatocyte function observed in the present study. We also found that NH 4 Cl induced specific liver injury compared with other cell types and apoptosis of primary hepatocytes was significantly increased compared with control cells. In this study, we hypothesized that hyperammonia might directly induce a series of changes leading to liver injury. To verify this assumption, a hyperammonia cell model was established to investigate the effects of NH 4 Cl on liver damage and further examine the effects of NH 4 Cl on hepatocyte apoptosis.

### Blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio: a good predictor of in-hospital and 90-day all-cause mortality in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e02220f2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that BUN/ALB ratio was associated with in-hospital and short-term prognosis in patients with AECOPD. We recommend that BUN/ALB ratio should gain prominence in clinical work. How to quickly and accurately assess the severity of AECOPD in patients and give corresponding intervention measures to improve the prognosis and outcome is crucially important. One research from Zemans et al. showed that combined clinical variables might be more highly predictive of outcomes than individual clinical variables in COPD. BUN/ALB ratio, combined with BUN and ALB, might play a better role in predicting the outcomes of patients with AECOPD (Fig. 2). Mathioudakis et al. summarized novel data on the diagnosis, phenotyping, targeted treatment, and prevention of AECOPD and indicated that the development and validation of accurate biomarkers for early characterization of the different types of COPD exacerbations is still a challenge. Biomarkers should be measurable quickly and simple to perform. In this research, we showed that an elevated BUN/ALB ratio was associated with increased mortality in patients with AECOPD. BUN and ALB measurements are easy to obtain, convenient to use, and are not affected by the evaluator's subjectivity, which is more realistic in clinical work. Therefore, we suggest that BUN/ALB ratio might be a promising indicator for assessment of the severity of AECOPD in patients.

In this study, we also found that CHF was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (RR = 4.36, 95% CI 1.07–17.85, P = 0.040), which was consistent with previous findings that CHF was a significant and independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COPD and had an influence on the COPD course. Stratified by the BUN/ALB ratio, compared with the BUN/ALB ratio of < 0.249 group, there were more patients with congestive heart failure in the BUN/ALB ratio of ≥ 0.249 group (44.1% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.012). The pathophysiological mechanism behind the association between elevated BUN/ALB ratios and CHF has been previously described. This might indicate that those combined with CHF have a higher BUN/ALB ratio and more attention should be paid to those with CHF when considering adverse hospitalization outcomes.

### The relationship between the systemic immune inflammation index and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in American adolescents [^3ed0abe9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

We also found that ALT, triglycerides, and BUN had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between the SII and NAFLD. ALT plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism, particularly in the reciprocal conversion between alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. ALT is capable of transferring the amino group from alanine to alpha-ketoglutarate, generating glutamate and pyruvate. This reaction plays a key role in protein metabolism and energy metabolism. SII responds to an index of inflammation and immune balance in the body. When the SII is high, it triggers oxidative stress and produces excess ROS, which in turn damages liver cells, resulting in an increase in ALT, which means that the liver is inflamed. Inflammatory factors can lead to IR, indicating a reduced response of liver cells to insulin. Insulin typically inhibits the activity of ALT. However, in IR states, this inhibitory effect is diminished, leading to an elevation in ALT levels. Additionally, when liver cells are damaged or undergo cell death, ALT is released into the bloodstream. A higher SII means that the patient has a high level of inflammation in the body and more inflammatory factors. Some inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha, can promote an increase in lipid synthesis within liver cells, leading to the accumulation of triglycerides in liver cells. Additionally, inflammatory factors can interfere with the insulin signaling pathway, causing IR. Insulin resistance is an important hormone that inhibits lipid breakdown and clearance, resulting in its accumulation within liver cells. These processes contribute to the occurrence and development of NAFLD. An elevation in triglyceride levels may impact the filtration function of the kidneys. In situations where triglyceride levels are elevated, the kidneys may need to process more metabolic products, including urea nitrogen. Therefore, elevated triglycerides may be associated with an increase in urea nitrogen levels. Insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism contribute to these metabolic changes, potentially affecting the production and clearance of urea nitrogen. An increase in urea nitrogen levels may be a characteristic feature of NAFLD. In summary, SII may mediate inflammatory pathways and affect the levels of the three, thereby exacerbating inflammation or insulin resistance and promoting disease progression. However, the specific detailed mechanism needs to be further explored by experiments.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^8e64e5ed]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

A potential weakness of our study is the use of the UOG as a surrogate for urinary ammonium concentrations. However, the direct measurement of urinary ammonium was not routinely available in our hospital.

Another weakness of the present trial is that it was only a single-center observation with all its known limitations.

Moreover, the findings derived from our study are only associative and are, therefore, naturally only hypothesis generating.

To compensate for shortcomings in the present trial, we suggest that future trials should be conducted in a multicenter setting, should be based on direct measurement of urinary ammonia, should also focus on unmeasured cations, and should prospectively collect data on multiorgan dysfunction, effectiveness of therapies administered, and neurological/cardiac performance.

Hypoalbuminemia is ubiquitous in critically ill patients represented by positive BE Albumin. Thus, RTA - in the presence of normal arterial pH - may be a physiological response and the result of the counterregulation of metabolic alkalosis due to low albumin levels.

### Variability and lability of ammonia levels in healthy volunteers and patients with cirrhosis: implications for trial design and clinical practice [^c487c7a7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ammonia levels are used to assess hepatic encephalopathy, but their levels are highly variable in clinical practice.

Methods

We studied factors associated with variation in ammonia values in cirrhotic patients without previous hepatic encephalopathy and healthy volunteers (HVs).

Results

Ammonia increased by 12% and 18% at 1 and 2 hour, respectively, after a protein meal in 64 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.001). In 237 HVs, ammonia levels varied significantly between sites (P < 0.0001). New site-specific ammonia upper limits based on HV levels using a strict analysis protocol differed from routinely used values. Correlation between paired fresh samples was high (r = 0.83) but modest between fresh and frozen samples (r = 0.62).

Discussion

Sample handling, processing, and protein intake impact ammonia levels across sites.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^c4fd82fb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and high Serum Creatinine (SCr) levels are risk factors for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). However, the relationship between the Blood Urea Nitrogen to Creatinine (BUN/SCr) ratio (UCR) and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset diabetes is unclear. This study aimed to examine the relationship between blood UCR and the risk of CAD in patients living with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

We analyzed the data from the cohort of 12,299 patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Primary endpoints were the events of CAD. The ANOVA test (continuous indicators) and χ 2 test (categorical indicators) were used to assess the differences of baseline characteristics across the groups of UCR. In order to understand the correlation between variables, we performed correlation analysis on variables that have significant differences between CAD group and non-CAD group. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to estimate the association of the blood UCR with the risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM. The Kaplan–Meier survival function plotting and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the event-free survival according to the groups of UCR. The restricted cubic spline model was used to show the adjusted association between blood UCR and risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.66 years, 1173 CAD were recorded with an event rate of 28.49 events per 1000 person-years. In multivariate-adjusted Cox regression models, elevated blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (UCR) was associated with higher risk of CAD in patients living with T2DM [hazard ratio (HR), 1.782; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.237–2.567]. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves indicated that the high group of UCR tended to have a lower event-free survival than the low group and medium group. There was a nonlinear trend toward increasing risk of CAD across the groups of UCR. And cubic spline function graph suggested that the influence of UCR level on HR for CAD increased significantly at UCR levels above 6.67.

Conclusions

An elevated UCR was significantly associated with an increased risk for CAD in patients living with T2DM.
