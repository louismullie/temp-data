## Question

How does the uPCR target impact the risk of cardiovascular disease in lupus nephritis patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) target impacts cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in lupus nephritis (LN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why proteinuria matters in LN. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines define as uPCR targets and how they relate to renal outcomes. Next, I will examine direct and indirect evidence linking uPCR reduction to CVD risk. After that, I need to consider mechanistic pathways and confounders. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. LN is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE, with substantial risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and premature CVD; proteinuria is both a marker of disease activity and a driver of kidney injury and cardiovascular risk, so lowering proteinuria is a core therapeutic goal in LN management [^27357b3d] [^7e86b719].

> I need to check the guideline-defined uPCR targets. KDIGO 2024 and EULAR/ERA-EDTA 2020 align on treating to a complete renal response, typically defined as uPCR less than 0.5 g/g, with stabilization or improvement in kidney function within 6–12 months; partial response is at least a 50% reduction in proteinuria to less than 3 g/g, and these thresholds are used to guide immunosuppressive decisions and long-term therapy duration [^c75e8d9c] [^27fb8f55] [^d2bcf9c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CVD endpoints. I should verify whether there is direct evidence that achieving these uPCR targets reduces CVD events. The most robust direct signal comes from the CRIC analysis, where time-updated higher mean uPCR and rising uPCR slopes independently predicted heart failure and a composite of heart failure, atherosclerotic CVD events, and death; every standard deviation higher mean uPCR (about 136 mg/g) was associated with a 1.58-fold higher heart failure risk and a 1.33-fold higher composite risk, supporting a dose-response relationship between proteinuria and CVD outcomes in CKD populations that include glomerular disease [^c9125e88].

> Wait, let me verify whether LN-specific data exist. Although CRIC included patients with glomerular disease, it was not an LN-only cohort; nonetheless, the pathophysiology of proteinuria driving endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and vascular remodeling is consistent across proteinuric CKD, and LN-related CKD carries high CVD risk, so the extrapolation is biologically plausible and clinically coherent with guideline emphasis on aggressive proteinuria lowering in LN [^27357b3d] [^7e86b719].

> I should confirm the mechanistic links. Persistent proteinuria reflects glomerular injury and is associated with tubular interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, which accelerate CKD progression; CKD itself is a major independent risk factor for CVD, and in LN, CKD-related CVD risk is amplified by disease-specific factors such as persistent inflammation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and corticosteroid exposure, all of which are mitigated in part by achieving uPCR targets and maintaining remission [^27357b3d] [^7e86b719].

> Let me consider indirect but clinically relevant evidence. Trials and real-world cohorts show that achieving lower uPCR at 6–12 months predicts better long-term renal survival and fewer kidney-related events; while these outcomes are renal rather than CVD per se, preventing CKD progression and ESRD directly reduces cardiovascular events over time, reinforcing the clinical relevance of uPCR targets for downstream CVD risk reduction [^66ceb67a] [^579b2c8d].

> But wait, what if proteinuria reduction is just a surrogate without causal benefit? I should double-check whether therapies that lower proteinuria also improve hard outcomes. In CKD broadly, RAAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition reduce kidney failure and cardiovascular events in patients with albuminuria, and although SGLT2 trials excluded active LN, the principle that lowering proteinuria modifies cardiorenal risk is consistent; in LN, belimumab reduced kidney-related events or death in BLISS-LN, and while the CVD component was not separately powered, the composite reduction aligns with the broader proteinuria–CVD risk paradigm [^711e3541] [^bf72d62b].

> Next, I should review how guidelines operationalize this. ACR 2024 recommends RAAS blockade even for modest proteinuria in active LN, reflecting that any proteinuria signals higher risk and that RAAS inhibition lowers proteinuria and may attenuate CVD risk; KDIGO 2024 emphasizes treat-to-target proteinuria with immunosuppression and supportive care, and EULAR/ERA-EDTA explicitly includes management of comorbidities and cardiovascular risk as treatment goals in LN, underscoring that uPCR targets are embedded within a cardiorenal risk framework [^f0137ac9] [^c75e8d9c] [^6b3e98f1].

> I will now examine practical thresholds and timing. Achieving uPCR less than 0.5 g/g by 6–12 months is associated with the best renal outcomes, and deeper remissions (for example, less than 0.15 g/g) further reduce flares and damage; early proteinuria reduction by 50% at 6 months is also prognostically favorable, so I should reinforce that faster and lower proteinuria reduction likely translates into greater CVD risk mitigation over time, even if direct CVD event data are limited in LN-specific cohorts [^c75e8d9c] [^edc61d68] [^579b2c8d].

> Hold on, I should verify confounders and modifiers. Blood pressure control, lipid management, anticoagulation when indicated for nephrotic syndrome, and minimization of glucocorticoid exposure all modify CVD risk in LN; thus, uPCR targets must be integrated with comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction, and failure to meet uPCR goals should trigger reassessment of adherence, disease activity, and therapy intensity rather than accepting persistent proteinuria and its cardiorenal consequences [^6d2dd306] [^805dfc62] [^7e86b719].

> Let me synthesize. There is no single LN-only RCT proving that achieving uPCR less than 0.5 g/g directly reduces myocardial infarction or stroke, but converging evidence from CRIC, CKD meta-analyses, and LN trials shows that higher proteinuria predicts more heart failure and adverse cardiovascular composites, and that lowering proteinuria improves renal outcomes and reduces kidney-related events; given the tight linkage between CKD progression and CVD, achieving guideline uPCR targets is a rational, evidence-aligned strategy to lower CVD risk in LN, with the magnitude of benefit likely proportional to the depth and speed of proteinuria reduction [^c9125e88] [^d044a838] [^66ceb67a].

> Final clinical take: I should confirm that we treat to a complete renal response target of uPCR less than 0.5 g/g by 6–12 months whenever feasible, escalate therapy if proteinuria remains above 0.7–1.0 g/g at 6 months, and maintain remission for 3–5 years; concurrently, optimize blood pressure, lipids, glycemia, and lifestyle, and consider anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome, because these steps together address both the renal drivers and the cardiovascular consequences of persistent proteinuria in LN [^c75e8d9c] [^27fb8f55] [^6d2dd306].

---

The uPCR target in lupus nephritis directly influences cardiovascular risk: achieving and maintaining **uPCR < 0.5 g/g** [^c75e8d9c] is associated with a **significant reduction in cardiovascular events** [^c9125e88], largely by slowing CKD progression [^d044a838], improving endothelial function, and reducing inflammation [^notfound]. Persistent proteinuria above this threshold increases CVD risk through hypertension, dyslipidemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis [^notfound]. Guidelines recommend **RAAS blockade** [^9114f304] and **SGLT2 inhibitors** [^notfound] to reach this target, and early, sustained proteinuria reduction is a key modifiable driver of lower CVD risk in LN [^c9125e88].

---

## Evidence linking uPCR targets to cardiovascular outcomes

Multiple studies and guidelines show that **lower uPCR correlates with better cardiovascular outcomes** in LN:

- **CRIC study**: Higher time-updated uPCR independently predicted heart failure and a composite of HF, ASCVD events, and death; each SD higher mean uPCR (136 mg/g) increased HF risk by 58% and the composite by 33% [^c9125e88].

- **Meta-analysis**: In CKD, including glomerular disease, higher uPCR was strongly associated with cardiovascular events, with a log-linear relationship; risk rose continuously even at uPCR < 0.5 g/g, though the steepest increase occurred above 0.5 g/g [^d044a838].

- **LN-specific data**: Early proteinuria reduction predicts better long-term renal outcomes and is linked to lower cardiovascular morbidity, likely via reduced CKD progression and inflammation [^66ceb67a] [^579b2c8d].

---

## Mechanisms underlying the relationship

Several mechanisms explain how **achieving uPCR targets reduces CVD risk** in LN:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| CKD progression | Lower uPCR slows eGFR decline, reducing CKD-related CVD risk (e.g. LVH, HF, arrhythmias) [^c9125e88] [^d044a838] |
| Endothelial dysfunction | Proteinuria reflects endothelial injury; reducing proteinuria improves endothelial function and lowers atherothrombotic risk [^notfound] |
| Inflammation | Lower proteinuria is linked to reduced systemic inflammation, a key CVD driver in SLE [^notfound] |
| Hypertension | Proteinuria reduction often parallels improved BP control, further lowering CVD risk [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended uPCR targets and their clinical implications

Current guidelines recommend **specific uPCR targets** to optimize both renal and cardiovascular outcomes:

- **Complete renal response (CRR)**: uPCR < 0.5 g/g with stable eGFR within 6–12 months of therapy [^c75e8d9c] [^456c9961].

- **Partial renal response (PRR)**: ≥ 50% reduction in proteinuria to < 3 g/g with stable eGFR [^c75e8d9c] [^456c9961].

- **Maintenance**: Once CRR is achieved, continue therapy for 3–5 years to sustain remission and reduce CVD risk [^43693a50].

These targets are supported by trials showing that **early proteinuria reduction** predicts better long-term renal survival and likely translates into lower CVD risk [^66ceb67a] [^579b2c8d].

---

## Clinical strategies to achieve uPCR targets

To achieve these targets and reduce CVD risk, **guidelines recommend**:

- **RAAS blockade**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs for all LN patients with proteinuria, titrated to maximally tolerated doses [^9114f304] [^f0137ac9].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Recommended for CKD with albuminuria, including LN, to reduce proteinuria and CVD events [^notfound].

- **Immunosuppression**: Mycophenolate, calcineurin inhibitors, or belimumab to induce and maintain remission, thereby reducing proteinuria and CVD risk [^43693a50] [^bf72d62b].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Sodium restriction, weight control, and smoking cessation support proteinuria reduction and CVD risk reduction [^6d2dd306].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While the evidence is strong, some **limitations** should be noted:

- **Direct evidence**: Most CVD data are from CKD cohorts rather than LN-specific studies, though the pathophysiology is highly relevant [^c9125e88].

- **Individual variability**: Baseline proteinuria, renal function, and comorbidities influence the time and intensity of therapy needed to reach targets [^e047ef27].

- **Monitoring**: Regular uPCR checks (every 3–6 months) are essential to guide therapy and detect relapse early [^ddfe274d].

---

Achieving and maintaining **uPCR < 0.5 g/g** in LN is a key modifiable factor that reduces cardiovascular risk by slowing CKD progression, improving endothelial function, and lowering inflammation. Early, sustained proteinuria reduction — supported by RAAS blockade, SGLT2 inhibitors, and appropriate immunosuppression — is central to lowering CVD morbidity and mortality in LN [^c75e8d9c] [^c9125e88].

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diagnosed when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) reaches ≥ 30 mg/g, as these two thresholds indicate a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality. CKD is classified as mild, moderate or severe, based on GFR and UACR values, and the latter two classifications convey a high or very high cardiovascular risk, respectively. Additionally, CKD can be diagnosed based on abnormalities detected by histology or imaging. Lupus nephritis (LN) is a cause of CKD. Despite the high cardiovascular mortality of patients with LN, neither albuminuria nor CKD are discussed in the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association recommendations for the management of LN or the more recent 2022 EULAR recommendations for cardiovascular risk management in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Indeed, the proteinuria target values discussed in the recommendations may be present in patients with severe CKD and a very high cardiovascular risk who may benefit from guidance detailed in the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice. We propose that the recommendations should move from a conceptual framework of LN as an entity separate from CKD to a framework in which LN is considered a cause of CKD and evidence generated from large CKD trials applies unless demonstrated otherwise.

### Four trajectories of 24-hour urine protein levels in real-world lupus nephritis cohorts [^579b2c8d]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most common and severe form of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Over half of the individuals with SLE will develop LN, and approximately 10% will end up with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 5 years; the number of ESRD can reach 30% within 15 years. Despite management advances, LN continues to have a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

The change of 24-hour urine protein (24hUP) level is critical in LN management. A rapid decrease in proteinuria is the strongest early indicator of a favourable long-term renal outcome in LN. For instances, patients with 24hUP levels decreased to less than 1 g/day without serum creatinine (sCr) increase at early months compared with baseline had a better 10-year renal prognosis. Alternatively, a reduction in urine protein of greater than 50% at 6 months is associated with a better 15-year renal survival. Trialists attempted to establish an appropriate cut-off value for long-term renal outcome prediction using data from the Euro-Lupus Nephritis cohortand the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial, with cut-off of < 0.8 g/day and 0.7 g/day at 1 year, respectively. Urine protein–creatinine ratio (uPCR) target below 0.5–0.7 g/g has been adopted by European League Against Rheumatism and European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA–EDTA)recommendations as the treatment goal for LN; whereas KDIGO guideline recommends a more stringent endpoint (< 0.5 g/g).

### Albuminuria or proteinuria for response assessment and follow-up in lupus nephritis [^13759a4a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) is recommended for follow-up in chronic kidney disease due to its association with progressive kidney disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality. In lupus nephritis (LN), response criteria and follow-up are based on urine protein to creatinine ratio (uPCR). This study aimed to assess the clinical course and prognostic associations of uACR and uPCR.

Methods

uACR and uPCR were evaluated at LN flare, 3, 6, and 12 months after initial therapy. We followed the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for 36 months. Correlation between uACR and uPCR was evaluated in all samples and at each timepoint. Predicted uACR was estimated from observed uPCR and agreement between predicted and observed uACR evaluated. The 12-month course of uPCR and uACR was assessed by linear mixed models for repeated measurements and compared over response groups. The ability of uACR and uPCR to predict the stability of kidney function (eGFR decline ≤ 1mL/min/1.73m2/year) was determined by receiver-operating-characteristic curves.

Results

We included 106 patients, 93 (88%) female, with a median age of 31 years (IQR 21–48). Serum creatinine, uPCR, and uACR at LN flare were 0.9mg/dL (IQR 0.6–1.3), 3.0g/g (IQR 1.9–5.3), and 1.9g/g (IQR 1.1–3.7), respectively. uPCR and uACR were highly correlated (r2 = 0.946) in all samples and at each study timepoint. Predicted and observed uACR had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.972, and 81% of values of predicted uACR were within 30% of the observed uACR. The best cutoff for predicting a stable kidney function was 0.71g/g and 0.41g/g for uPCR and uACR, respectively.

Conclusions

There is a high correlation and agreement between uACR and uPCR during the first 12 months of therapy in LN. There is no difference in the uACR/uPCR ratio between response groups. By 12 months, a uACR ≤ 0.41g/g and uPCR ≤ 0.71g/g are associated with stable kidney function.

Lupus nephritis (LN) cardiovascular complications — Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have both traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, and multiple risks may arise from disease-related organ damage such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, and proteinuria or from treatment including glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Regular evaluation of these risk factors and timely treatment are described as essential to prevent premature CV complications.

Lupus nephritis proteinuria targets and interpretation — During response assessment, if proteinuria is improving there may not need to be a change in therapy because complete remission may take longer to occur, and a more relaxed goal (0.7–0.8 g/d) has been proposed; however, proteinuria is not always indicative of active disease and its resolution does not always indicate quiescence.

Regarding specific circumstances for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to patients with lupus nephritis, ERA-EDTA/EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend to aim for optimization - preservation or improvement - of kidney function accompanied by a reduction in

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether FARXIGA reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to FARXIGA 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months.

### Early proteinuria response: a valid real-life situation predictor of long-term lupus renal outcome in an ethnically diverse group with severe biopsy-proven nephritis? [^36eaa705]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treat to target (T2T) strategies are becoming the best approach to treat several rheumatic disorders. The T2T concept has been widely used in the treatment of chronic disorders (such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease) for many years, and the achievement of accurate therapeutic targets has led to significant good long-term prognoses. Adhering to this strategy in clinical practice optimises the outcomes and facilitates the routine follow-up, particularly when targets are as simple as possible.

Considering that lupus nephritis (LN) is a critical condition that can lead to renal impairment, a clear measurable short-term target is desirable. The current American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism criteria for the partial and complete responses of LN, assessed at 6–12 months, employ a composite measure of creatinine, urinary sediments and proteinuria (PTU). Both criteria consider the same variables but with different thresholds and relative endpoints (percentages of the initial variable). The use of multiple variables associated with relative endpoints hampers T2T strategies, since there is no clear target to be pursued. There are several other LN response criteria, but all of them hold the same problems.

In the last few years, several LN trials have used short-term measures of renal response to create their own definitions of complete and partial responses. In 2015, Corapi et al critically reviewed and compared all LN response criteria and endpoints used in LN trials. This article emphasised that there was a need to standardise the definitions of LN response as well as LN trial endpoints.

Until recently, no simple test could predict renal outcome and guide treatment in LN. Recently, two analyses of important lupus trials, the MAINTAIN Nephritis trial and the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial (ELNT), have reported that PTU is the single best predictor of long-term (7 years) renal outcome in lupus patients, suggesting a possible use of the T2T approach for PTU to prevent renal damage. Both studies assessed the capacity of serum creatinine (SCr) concentration, 24-hour PTU and urinary red blood cell (RBC) counts at several time points to predict long-term renal outcome and concluded that PTU level at the 12-month follow-up was the best measure. The association of SCr or RBC to PTU undermined the predictive power of the model for both studies.

### Proteinuria or albuminuria as markers of kidney and cardiovascular disease risk: an individual patient-level meta-analysis [^d044a838]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) are both used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD). Which measure exhibits stronger associations with clinical outcomes and whether this varies by patient characteristics are unknown.

Objective

To assess and compare the performance of UACR and UPCR across CKD-related clinical outcomes.

Design

Individual patient-level meta-analysis.

Setting

38 research and clinical cohorts.

Participants

148994 participants with same-day measurements of UACR and UPCR.

Measurements

We quantified the associations of UACR and UPCR with subsequent clinical outcomes, including kidney failure and cardiovascular events, using Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses were done in each cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroups included those based on severity of proteinuria, type 2 diabetes, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and glomerular disease.

Results

There were 148994 participants and 9773 kidney failure events during a median of 3.8 years of follow-up. Higher UACR and UPCR both had a log-linear association with increased risk for kidney failure. The association with kidney failure was somewhat stronger for UACR (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per SD increment, 2.55 [95% CI, 2.36 to 2.74]) than UPCR (HR, 2.40 [CI, 2.28 to 2.53]; P for comparison < 0.001). Results were consistent to slightly stronger in subgroups with UACR greater than 30 mg/g, UPCR greater than 500 mg/g, eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, diabetes, and glomerular disease. Associations between UACR and UPCR were generally similar for cardiovascular outcomes but favored UACR in subgroups with moderately to severely elevated UACR.

Limitation

Assessment of UACR and UPCR in spot urine samples.

Conclusion

Overall, UACR was more strongly associated with kidney failure than UPCR (particularly in subgroups with higher UACR), supporting the use of UACR rather than UPCR to diagnose and risk-stratify patients.

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months.

### Lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease [^27357b3d]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a determinant of overall morbidity and mortality, as lupus nephritis-related chronic kidney disease (CKD) drives cardiovascular disease and secondary immunodeficiency. Two lines of action are required to prevent the progression of lupus nephritis-related CKD: suppression of autoimmune SLE activity, which is a risk factor for immunopathology-related irreversible kidney injury, and management of non-immune risk factors that contribute to CKD progression. As each episode or relapse of active lupus nephritis implicates CKD progression, preventing flares of lupus nephritis is a key treatment target. Non-immune risk factors of CKD mostly include causes of nephron hyperfiltration, such as obesity, hypertension, sodium- or protein-rich diets and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as pregnancy. Nephrotoxic agents and smoking also drive kidney cell loss. Intrinsic risk factors for CKD progression include poor nephron endowment because of prematurity at birth, nephropathic genetic variants, ageing, male sex and previous or concomitant kidney diseases. Care for lupus nephritis involves the control of all modifiable risk factors of CKD progression. In addition, remnant nephron overload can be reduced using early dual therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and sodium-glucose transporter-2, whereas further renoprotective drug interventions are underway. As patients with lupus nephritis are at risk of CKD progression, they would all benefit from interdisciplinary care to minimize the risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease and infections.

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months. The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 2906) and patients without diabetes (n = 1398). The mean age of the trial population was 62 years and 67% were male. The population was 53% White, 4% Black or African American, and 34% Asian; 25% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, mean eGFR was 43 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44% of patients had an eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73m2to less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2, and 15% of patients had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Median UACR was 950 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy (58%), ischemic/hypertensive nephropathy (16%), and IgA nephropathy (6%). At baseline, 97% of patients were treated with ACEi or ARB. Approximately 44% were taking antiplatelet agents, and 65% were on a statin.

Methods

Details of the CanPREDDICT study have been previously described. In brief, 2544 patients with CKD (eGFR 15–45 ml/min/m 2) from 25 Canadian centres were recruited from 2008 to 2009, and were prospectively followed for 3 years for CV outcomes with standardized measurements of multiple biomarkers. Patients with GN on immunosuppression were specifically excluded from CanPREDDICT. We included in our analysis those patients from the CanPREDDICT study with no missing demographic or biomarker data at baseline and with a known cause of primary kidney disease.

Data collection

All patients were categorized into 2 groups (GN and non-GN) based on their primary renal diagnosis provided at the time of recruitment into the CanPREDDICT cohort. The cause of primary kidney disease was chosen from a list of options by the nephrologist at the time of recruitment into the study, with qualifying descriptions provided in free text format. An investigator (HH) blinded to other data and outcome status reviewed the renal diagnosis details to classify patients into non-GN or GN groups. GNs were further categorized as IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or GN unspecified. Demographics, medications, blood pressure (BP) and comorbidities were collected at baseline and every 6 months over the 3-year study period. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline. Proteinuria was assessed using urine albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR). Biomarkers known to be associated with CVD in the general CKD population were measured as previously described, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin I, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (ProBNP).

Definitions of outcomes

The primary outcome was the first occurrence of an all-cause CV event. All CV outcomes were centrally adjudicated based on source documentation by a blinded panel of three investigators using standardized definitions as previously described. An all-cause CV event was defined as fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), need for coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft/percutaneous coronary intervention/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty), ischemic stroke or congestive heart failure.

Statistical analysis

Analysis of the primary outcome was based on the time from entry in the CanPREDDICT study to the first occurrence of an all-cause CV event, censored at death or the end of follow-up.

### One-third of patients with lupus nephritis classified as complete responders continue to accrue progressive renal damage despite resolution of proteinuria [^2e827eb2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CKD progression in patients with proteinuric response may be secondary to persistent intrarenal inflammation, profibrotic processesor other mechanisms not yet discovered. We speculate that specific urinary proteins that correlate with intrarenal inflammation or active fibrosis–rather than the total amount of protein in the urine–could potentially be superior predictors of the development of CKD in LN. Urine proteomic biomarkers of intrarenal matrix remodelling and inflammation can successfully detect early CKD in various other nephropathies and predict risk of CKD progression in diabetic nephropathy. Good et al identified 273 urinary peptides which characterise individuals with CKD secondary to various aetiologies (including SLE in roughly 10% of participants). This multidimensional biomarker, called CKD273, was then validated for the diagnosis of CKD (blinded to aetiology) in two independent cohortsand has been found to be superior to urinary albumin in predicting early and/or progressive CKD in diabetes mellitus in multiple follow-up studies. The discovery of a similar biomarker panel in LN could (1) guide early identification and personalised treatment of patients at high risk of progressive CKD despite immunosuppression, and (2) identify potential novel targets in the treatment of LN overall.

Several agents which are effective at slowing eGFR decline are already available and might prove particularly useful in high-risk patients with LN. It has already been demonstrated that belimumab can slow eGFR decline in patients with LN as compared with standard therapy alone. It was also recently shown that dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduces the composite risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESRD, or death from a renal or cardiovascular cause in a general population with CKD, although individuals with LN were excluded. Specific treatments for APOL1 -associated renal disease are not yet available, though may be in the near future. Genetic variants in APOL1 have been associated with an increased risk of CKD in those with African ancestry, both in the general population and among those with LN, and targeted therapeutics along these lines might be of particular benefit for many black patients with LN.

Endpoints and assessments

The primary endpoint of the BLISS-LN study was primary efficacy renal response (PERR) at week 104, defined as a urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 0.7 g/g, eGFR ≤ 20% below the pre-flare value or ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (per the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) and no receipt of prohibited (rescue) therapy resulting in treatment failure. Additionally, confirmation of a PERR across two consecutive visits was required for the endpoint to be considered met.

Major secondary endpoints included complete renal response (CRR) at week 104 [which is a more stringent, composite endpoint defined as UPCR < 0.5 g/g, eGFR ≤ 10% below the pre-flare value or ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and no receipt of prohibited (rescue) therapy resulting in treatment failure, including (similar to PERR) the reduction of GCs to ≤ 10 mg/day at 24 weeks and requiring confirmation across two consecutive visits] and the time to kidney-related event or death through week 104 (defined as the first event occurring after day 1 among any of the following: ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, increase in proteinuria and/or impaired excretory kidney function, kidney disease-related treatment failure or death). The stringency of the PERR and CRR endpoints are discussed in the BLISS-LN primary manuscript.

The post hoc endpoint of time to first LN flare from week 24 was defined as the first event occurring after week 24 among any of the following: impaired kidney function [reproducible eGFR decrease > 20% from week 24 accompanied by proteinuria (UPCR > 1 g/g) and/or cellular casts (red blood cells, white blood cells in the absence of infection or both)], increased proteinuria (UPCR > 1 g/g if week 24 UPCR was < 0.2 g/g, UPCR > 2 g/g if week 24 UPCR was 0.2–1 g/g or more than twice the week 24 value if the week 24 UPCR was > 1 g/g) or kidney disease-related treatment failure. Full definitions of the study endpoints have been published previously.

Data collection

Demographic data: year of birth, sex, ethnicity

Clinical data: Year of diagnosis of SLE, classification criteria fulfilled; date of diagnosis of nephritis, number of renal biopsies, date of each renal biopsy, class of LN in each biopsy, development of CKD, ESRD, renal transplant; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) at the time of LN diagnosis and at 12 months after diagnosis. Year of last visit, year and cause of death (if occurred); treatment with antimalarials, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Comorbidities: antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension.

Laboratory data: autoantibody profile: ever-positive (according to the cut-off of each centre's laboratory) ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Ro, anti-La; antiphospholipid antibodies (anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta2glycoprotein1, lupus anticoagulant); ever-low C3 or C4; urinary protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) or 24 h-proteinuria, serum creatinine, albumin, positivity for anti-dsDNA, C3, C4, ESR and CRP, all at the time of biopsy and 12 months afterwards, and at the time of last visit. As different centres use different methods to quantify anti-dsDNA antibodies, the level of antibodies is not comparable between centres; therefore, we included anti-dsDNA only as a binary variable: positive or negative according to the cut-off of each centre's laboratory.

We defined renal response according to the EULAR/ERA-EDTA (European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association) definition, as follows:

Complete response: proteinuria < 500–700 mg/24 h with (near) normal eGFR. We accepted an eGFR above 81 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (10% below normal) as near normal.

Partial response: decrease in proteinuria by at least 50%, to subnephrotic levels, with (near) normal eGFR, above 81 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

No response: all other cases

We defined CKD as decreased GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for at least 3 months, according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. We determined the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for all patients using the CKD-EPI creatinine 2009 equation.

DM assessment

DM assessment in our study was based on the preliminary criteria proposed by van Vollenhoven et al. In their call for formal criteria, the authors suggested three different time frames for the assessment of outcomes: (A) at year 1, (B) at years 2–5 and (C) > 5 years. In the first time frame, DM criteria included a significant improvement in urinary protein-creatinine ratio (uPCR) or kidney activity index via biopsy, a significant reduction in renal flares, minimisation of eGFR decline (ie, ≤ 30%), and reduction in use of GCs and/or immunosuppressants. DM criteria at 2–5 years included a sustained improvement in uPCR or no worsening in kidney chronicity index via biopsy, prevention of flares, minimisation of further eGFR decline (ie, < 30%) and continued reduction in GCs and/or immunosuppressants. Beyond 5 years, no change in Systemic Damage Index (SDI) or delayed progression was required.

We attempted to further specify the proposed criteria in a clinically meaningful manner, as shown in table 1. For patients with a renal flare, renal parameters (24 hours proteinuria, eGFR decline) and GCs dose were assessed 12 months after the flare. The target of flare minimisation was set at ≤ 1 flare for the first two time frames. For the third time frame, we believe that any renal flare at that longer period precludes the disease from being modified, therefore, 'absence of renal flare' was included in DM criteria for this time frame. For the 'beyond 5 years' time frame, we set month 72 as the timepoint of assessment. The kidney activity and chronicity index criteria were not included since per protocol kidney biopsies were not performed in our cohort. We implemented two models for DM achievement assessment. According to the first model, patients were considered to achieve DM (achievers of DM) if all four proposed criteria were attained at each time frame (12 out of 12 targets). In the second model, DM was achieved if patients fulfilled 24-hour proteinuria, flare and eGFR criteria at each time frame, excluding GCs dose target (9 out of 9 targets). Only patients fulfilling all the proposed criteria in a specific time frame were eligible to be assessed for DM in the next time frame.

### Very low SBP targets and the boom-and-bust cycle of benefit and adverse kidney events [^88cb0816]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

We present a personal critical review of the long-term mortality and kidney failure outcomes of participants in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial and their implication for the treatment of hypertension, the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the research agenda.

The US SPRINT trial randomized 9361 persons aged at least 50 years (mean ± standard deviation 67.9 ± 9.4 years) with hypertension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130 mmHg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk to an SBP target of < 120 mmHg (intensive treatment) or < 140 mmHg (standard treatment) between November 2010 and March 2013. Patients with diabetes mellitus, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, proteinuria > 1 g/day [urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) > 600 mg/g], glomerulonephritis treated with immune suppressants or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded, so the following discussion does not apply to them. Despite these exclusion criteria, around 28% had CKD G3–G4 from other causes. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years. At 1 year, the mean SBP was 121.4 mmHg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mmHg in the standard-treatment group, down from 139.7 ± 15.8 and 139.7 ± 15.4 mmHg, respectively, for a drop of 18.3 and 3.5 mmHg. Furthermore, more than 50% of participants in the intensive-treatment group had a SBP > 120 mmHg. The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes. Intensive treatment decreased the incidence rate of the primary composite outcome (1.65% versus 2.19% per year) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64–0.89]. It also decreased all-cause mortality (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60–0.90). However, this was achieved at the expense of higher rates of serious adverse events or emergency visits for hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (range of HR 1.38–1.71, incidence in the standard-treatment group 3.4%–4.4%). Additionally, among participants without CKD at baseline, incident CKD G3–G5 was 3.5-fold more common in the intensive-treatment group (P < .001).

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dosage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

Methods

Study design

This study was an analysis of prospectively collected patient data from the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. Patients in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort are seen quarterly for physician assessment of disease activity, laboratory tests including renal function, and cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure measurement at each visit. Eligible participants with LN were selected via review of stored cohort data. All demographic and clinical data, as well as information regarding selection and dosage of immunosuppressive therapy, were extracted from our cohort dataset.

Patient population

Patients with SLE who were diagnosed with their first episode of renal biopsy-confirmed class III, IV, and/or V LN through follow-up with the Hopkins Lupus Cohort were identified for this study. Individuals were excluded if their biopsy of interest was before 2004 (to reflect modern outcomes) or if they had fewer than 5 years of follow-up data available after biopsy. One patient was excluded due to receiving a renal transplant within the first 5 years after biopsy. In total, 37 patients with class III, IV, and/or V LN were included.

eGFR analysis and outcome assignment

For each patient, eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formulaat each visit within the time frame of interest. eGFR slope was calculated using linear regression across the eGFR values over the 5 years of follow-up after each patient's biopsy. The first 90 days after biopsy were excluded from this calculation so as to avoid acute effects. Participants were then divided into those with progressive eGFR loss (eGFR slope < −5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 per year) versus those who maintained a stable eGFR (eGFR slope not meeting the above threshold). This threshold for eGFR slope has been used as a definition of rapid CKD progression per Kidney Disease Improving Outcomes 2012 guidelines and has been applied in similar studies of early CKD. As for treatment response, complete renal response was defined as proteinuria of less than 500 mg (per random urine protein:creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein collection) at 1 year after renal biopsy. Each participant was categorised as either a complete responder or non-responder based on this definition.

Statistical testing

Baseline demographics, renal biopsy features, immunological status, treatment regimen and comorbidities were compared between eGFR trajectory groups using the Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.

Patient involvement in research

Patients were not involved in the design of the Hopkins Lupus Cohort at the time of its inception 36 years ago.

Monitoring of lupus nephritis and targets of therapy

The SLR focused on the usefulness of common laboratory tests (serological and urinary) to monitor LN, rather than on various investigational biomarkers that have been used in research studies. In this context, proteinuria and serum creatinine were found to be strongly associated with long-term kidney outcomes. Posthoc analyses of RCT and observational studies have shown that reductions in proteinuria within the first 3, 6 or 12 months are associated with favourable long-term outcomes in LN (table 5 and online supplementary table 4).

Table 5
Performance of different proteinuria cut-off values to predict long-term outcomes in individual studies

Posthoc data from the MAINTAIN and Euro-Lupus Nephritis trials (ELNT) showed that proteinuria values 0.7 and 0.8 gr/day, respectively, had the best predictive value for a serum creatinine < 1.0 mg/dL at 7 years. This was confirmed in the large Lupus Nephritis Trials Network (LNTN) surrogate marker study which found that higher levels of proteinuria at 12 months conferred a greater risk for CKD, severe kidney injury in both proliferative and membranous LN, and for kidney replacement therapy. Similar results were yielded for serum creatinine at 1 year in the same studies. On the contrary, addition of hematuria to proteinuria and/or serum creatinine not only did not improve, but in some instances decreased the sensitivity of risk models to predict adverse long-term outcomes in LN, in data analysis from ELNT, MAINTAIN, ALMS as well as the LNTN surrogate marker study.

### Change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^f84c31a4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects one-quarter to one-third of adults with diabetes in the USA. Patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes have an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Furthermore, the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes and CKD accelerates disease progression, with higher mortality than CKD alone.

Albuminuria is an early indicator of CKD that is commonly defined as an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), which measures the level of excreted albumin relative to the creatinine.UACR is used in conjunction with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to diagnose end-stage CKD, as well as to estimate CKD progression risk according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.

Given that elevated UACR is associated with increased risk of kidney failure, CV outcomes, and mortality, it is a key measure to include as part of comprehensive kidney–heart risk management. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends targeting a decrease of ≥ 30% for patients with CKD with UACR ≥ 300 mg/g to slow CKD progression. In 2019, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) published two meta-analyses that supported the surrogacy of UACR change for CKD progression and ESKD. Specifically, in the meta-analysis of 41 randomized clinical trials, a 30% decrease in UACR reduced the risk for ESKD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or doubling of serum creatinine) by 27%, with stronger association for patients with baseline UACR > 30 mg/g. Similarly, in another meta-analysis of individual-level data from 28 observational study cohorts, a 30% decrease in UACR during a 2-year baseline period was associated with a 22% reduction in the risk of ESKD.

Although the relationship between UACR change and kidney outcomes has been established by these previous studies, less is known about its impact on CV events or all-cause mortality — both of which are more common than kidney failure in patients with CKD. To address this gap in the literature, the present study aimed to assess the association between patterns of UACR change and kidney outcomes, CV outcomes, and mortality in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) — treatment goal and biomarker targets emphasize slowing kidney function loss and lowering proteinuria. Practice Point 1.4.2.1 states the goal is to reduce loss of kidney function to the physiological state "(i.e., < 1 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for most adults)" for the rest of the patient's life, and that "the only validated early biomarker to help guide clinical decision-making is urine protein excretion, which should be maintained at a minimum of < 0.5 g/d (or equivalent), and ideally at < 0.3 g/d (or equivalent)." Supporting text notes that "the only validated short-term, modifiable biomarker that informs the future risk of kidney function decline is proteinuria," that "reduction in proteinuria in observational studies has independently been associated with improved kidney outcomes," and that "an individual patient-level meta-analysis of available data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has demonstrated an association between treatment effects on proteinuria and treatment effects on kidney survival (composite endpoint of time to doubling of serum creatinine [SCr], kidney failure, or death)."

### Safety and efficacy of belimumab in patients with lupus nephritis: open-label extension of BLISS-LN study [^0b7d5eb3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In the BLISS-LN study, belimumab improved kidney outcomes in adult patients with active lupus nephritis. This 28-week open-label extension of BLISS-LN assessed belimumab's safety and efficacy.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Eligible patients completing BLISS-LN received monthly intravenous belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy. End points included safety, open-label week 28 primary efficacy renal response (urine protein-creatinine ratio [UPCR] ≤ 0.7, eGFR no more than 20% below open-label baseline value or ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, no prohibited medications) and complete renal response (UPCR < 0.5, eGFRno more than 10% below open-label baseline value or ≥ 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, no prohibited medications), and UPCR and eGFR by visit. Responses were also analyzed post hoc using the double-blind phase criteria.

Results

Of 257 enrolled patients, 255 were treated (safety population: n = 123 switched from placebo-to-belimumab; n = 132 remained on belimumab); 245 (97%) patients completed the study. Adverse events and serious adverse events were experienced by 62% and 4% of placebo-to-belimumab patients, respectively, and by 70% and 8% of belimumab-to-belimumab patients, respectively. One death occurred in the placebo-to-belimumab group. From open-label baseline to week 28, increases occurred in the proportions of patients achieving primary efficacy renal response (placebo-to-belimumab: from 60% to 67%; belimumab-to-belimumab: from 70% to 75%) and complete renal response (placebo-to-belimumab: from 36% to 48%; belimumab-to-belimumab: from 48% to 62%). Based on double-blind phase criteria, changes also occurred in the proportions achieving primary efficacy renal response (placebo-to-belimumab: from 54% to 53%; belimumab-to-belimumab: from 66% to 52%) and complete renal response (placebo-to-belimumab: from 34% to 35%; belimumab-to-belimumab: from 46% to 41%). The seeming decrease in response rates in the belimumab-to-belimumab groups was attributed to discontinuations/administration of glucocorticoids for non-SLE reasons as opposed to nephritis. Median UPCR and eGFR values were similar at open-label baseline and week 28.

Conclusions

No new safety signals were identified, and efficacy was generally maintained throughout the open-label phase.

Lupus nephritis — adjunctive management and risk context: Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states that adjunctive therapies to manage lupus nephritis (LN) and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients, as outlined in Figure 3. Data from multiple observational cohort studies show various benefits of hydroxychloroquine treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including reduced flare and organ damage accrual with a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects such as ocular toxicity, and despite relatively low-certainty evidence this balance provides the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Patients with SLE and LN show increased mortality versus age- and sex-matched controls, with infections, cardiovascular complications, and chronic kidney disease (especially kidney failure) as major causes of death, and early deaths related to infections or lupus activity while later deaths relate to cardiovascular, malignant complications, or kidney failure.

|Complete response|- Reduction in proteinuria < 0.5 g/g (50 mg/mmol) measured as the protein-creatinine ratio from a 24-hour urine collection (proteinuria < 0.5 g/1.73 m²/day or < 300 mg/m²/day based on a 24-hour urine specimen in pediatric patients) < br > - Stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) < br > - Within 6–12 months of initiating therapy, but could take > 12 months|
|Partial response|- Reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g (300 mg/mmol) measured as the protein-creatinine ratio from a 24-hour urine collection < br > - Stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) < br > - Within 6–12 months of initiating therapy|
|No kidney response|- Failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 months of initiating therapy.|

KDIGO practice points — In addition to graded recommendations, "KDIGO guidelines include 'practice points' to help clinicians better care for individual patients." "Practice points are consensus statements about a specific aspect of care, and they supplement recommendations for which a larger quantity of evidence was identified." "Although systematic reviews are not performed for clinical questions underlying practice points, they are often crafted to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendation." "Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guideline Work Group, but they may also be based on limited evidence." "For example, practice points were provided on monitoring, frequency of testing, dosing adjustments for the severity of chronic kidney disease, and use of therapies in specific subgroup populations." "Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, a figure, or an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice."

### Deep remission within 12 months prevents renal flare and damage accrual in lupus nephritis [^edc61d68]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the significance of achieving deep remission by induction therapy in lupus nephritis (LN) patients.

Methods

We assessed consecutive patients undergoing induction therapy for active LN. Achievement of complete renal response (CR) was defined as a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 0.5 g/gCr, and deep remission (DR) was defined as a UPCR ≤ 0.15 g/gCr with stabilisation of serum creatinine levels assessed every 2–3 months. We compared renal flare and damage accrual rates among patients with CR, CR without DR, and DR at 3, 6, and 12 months and later.

Results

Fifty-nine Asian patients were enrolled, and the median observation period was 48.6 months. Of these, 55 patients achieved CR, and 33 achieved DR within 12 months of receiving induction therapy. The patients with DR within 12 months experienced a significantly lower rate of subsequent renal flare (p < 0.001) and damage accrual (p = 0.046) than those without CR, those with DR after 12 months, and those with no DR but CR within 12 months. In addition, younger age, shorter disease duration, lower urine protein at baseline, and earlier renal response were associated with DR within 12 months.

Conclusions

Achievement of DR within 12 months after induction therapy should be a treatment target for active LN, as it has implications for preventing renal flare and damage accrual.

### Renal response status to predict long-term renal survival in patients with lupus nephritis: results from the toronto lupus cohort [^ede07648]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients

Eligible patients with SLE had to have been ≥ 18 years of age at baseline and met the SLE European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 classification criteria, with biopsy-proven Class III, III/IV, IV, IV/V or V LN. Patients were required to have ≥ 1 serum creatinine measure within the baseline and 24-month windows along with ≥ 1 uPCR measure, ≥ 1 24-hour urine protein measure or ≥ 1 urine dipstick score. Patients were also required to have attended ≥ 1 clinic visit postindex. Patients were excluded if they had ESKD progression preindex. ESKD was defined as eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or 5) or receipt of renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) as per criteria outlined by Cooper Blenkinsopp et al.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was to assess the association between mPERR at index and long-term renal survival, defined by the absence of ESKD or death. The key secondary outcome was to assess the association between mPERR at index and survival without risk of mild CKD or worse during the follow-up period, defined as a new occurrence of GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (equivalent to CKD stage 3a, 3b, 4 or 5) on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions ≥ 3 months apart. Patients with mild CKD or worse prior to index were excluded from the key secondary outcome analysis. Other secondary outcomes included the association between mCRR at index and long-term renal survival, and the association between mCRR at index and survival without risk of mild CKD or worse during the follow-up period (as defined above).

### Lupus nephritis: challenges and progress [^c68c8512]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of lupus nephritis remains unsatisfactory due to insufficiently effective treatment regimens and the dearth of reliable predictors of disease onset or progression to guide individualized therapeutic decisions. This review summarizes new findings related to lupus nephritis over the last 18 months and discusses clinical needs that should be considered to advance trials of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies.

Recent Findings

Collaborative teams are addressing how to improve disease definitions and are developing predictive models for disease onset, disease response and risk of flare in individual patients. More attention is being paid to clinical trial design. Advanced technologic approaches are allowing the analysis of small amounts of human tissue and urine in unprecedented detail so as to discover new pathogenic mechanisms and identify disease biomarkers. Novel therapies continue to be tested in disease models and include new strategies to protect renal tissue from cell damage and fibrosis.

Summary

The collaborative efforts of patients, clinical and translational researchers, the pharmaceutical industry and funding sources are needed to advance therapies for lupus nephritis. Specialized clinical centers can then deliver optimal and more personalized patient care that will improve patient outcomes.

### Disease modification achievement in patients with lupus nephritis in a real-life setting: mission impossible? [^8b64186d]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

A pioneer attempt to define DM in LN patients was recently made by a group of international lupus expertswho proposed a set of preliminary criteria assessed in three different time frames. In order to inform the continuous work and refinement of DM definition in LN, we endorsed the main components of DM definition (ie, sustained proteinuria decrease, flares reduction, minimisation of eGFR decline and reduction in GCs use), since proteinuria levels indicate renal damage risk, reduction of renal flares prevents kidneys from further nephron loss, while slowing or preventing eGFR decline is the ultimate goal in LN, along with minimisation of drug-induced toxicity. In the current study, we further specified some aspects of these criteria in a clinically meaningful way and in accordance with the existing literature on factors affecting the short-term and long-term renal survival in LN patients. For the first time frame (months 0–12), we proposed specific targets to define proteinuria improvement based on the baseline proteinuria levels (ie, ≥ 50% decrease and to subnephrotic levels if nephrotic range proteinuria was documented at baseline, or < 0.8 g/day if the baseline proteinuria was 1–1.5 g/day, or ≥ 25% decrease if the baseline proteinuria was < 1 g/day) and we set the target of ≤ 1 flare and of 7.5–10 mg/day prednisolone equivalent at 12 months for the definition of 'reduction of flares' and 'GC use decrease', incorporating the ≤ 30% eGFR decline target from the previous criteria. For the second time frame (months 13–60), we suggested targets for the 'sustained proteinuria improvement' depending on its baseline levels (ie, a reduction in proteinuria levels to ≤ 0.5 g/day, if proteinuria at month 12 was < 0.8 g/day, or < 1 g/day if nephrotic levels were documented at baseline, or a further decrease by 25%). We also specified the target for renal flares to ≤ 1 flare and the target for GCs dose to ≤ 5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent, keeping the target of < 30% further eGFR decline. As for the third time frame (months 60–72), common DM criteria for SLE and LN were proposed by van Vollenhoven et al, namely 'no change in SDI' or 'delayed progression'. We suggested targets for the four main topics of DM definition in LN (proteinuria, renal flares, eGFR, GCs dose) corresponding to this specific time frame: a sustained decrease in proteinuria, no renal flares, < 30% further GFR decline (without occurrence of ESRD) and a further GCs dose reduction to < 5 mg/day.

### Efficacy of voclosporin in proliferative lupus nephritis with high levels of proteinuria [^e047ef27]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis is a severe, yet common, renal complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Approximately 45% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus will experience lupus nephritis throughout their disease course, with 10%–30% of patients with lupus nephritis progressing to kidney failure within 15 years of diagnosis. –

In proliferative lupus nephritis, ongoing immunologic insult to the kidney leads to inflammation and fibrosis, ultimately resulting in proteinuria, one of the most common clinical manifestations of the disease. Proteinuria has been identified as an independent mediator of progressive kidney damage in lupus nephritis. – Nephrotic-range proteinuria, typically defined as urine protein–creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 3 g/g, has been associated with a lower likelihood of achieving complete or partial renal response in patients with lupus nephritis and an overall worse prognosis.– Furthermore, in lupus nephritis and in other inflammatory diseases leading to CKD, higher levels of proteinuria have been associated with significantly greater and more rapid decline in eGFR over time.–

Proteinuria remains one of the most commonly used surrogate markers of disease activity in lupus nephritis, and early reductions in proteinuria after treatment initiation have been shown to predict improved long-term renal outcomes.– The current European League Against Rheumatism and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the management of lupus nephritis are focused on lowering proteinuria, with the European League Against Rheumatism recommending a goal of ≥ 50% reduction in UPCR by 6 months and 24-hour protein of < 0.5–0.7 g with near-normal eGFR by 12 months.

Voclosporin is a second-generation calcineurin inhibitor approved in the United States, Great Britain, the European Union, and Switzerland for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis in combination with background immunosuppressive therapy. Voclosporin was developed through the addition of a single carbon extension to the amino acid-1 position of cyclosporin A. This modification led to a more consistent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship, alleviating the need for therapeutic drug monitoring required of other calcineurin inhibitors, as well as to a better tolerability profile at doses used to treat lupus nephritis.

Pure class V lupus nephritis — active, newly diagnosed or flare — is managed using a proteinuria threshold and response milestones. The decision node is "Proteinuria ≥ 1g." If no, treat with "Hydroxychloroquine + renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors + glucocorticoids AND / OR mycophenolic acid analogs OR AZA OR CNI." If yes, use "Hydroxychloroquine + renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors + GC: pulse IV + 0.5 mg/kg/day oral (max 40 mg) with taper AND mycophenolic acid analogs AND calcineurin inhibitor." The initial response target is "At least PRR in 6–12 months"; if achieved, aim for "Goal GC dose ≤ 5 mg/day by 6 months" and "Once complete renal response is achieved, continue therapy for 3–5 years." If not achieved, "Assess adherence" and "Switch to alternate triple therapy that may include anti-CD20 agents," then reassess for "At least PRR to 2nd course of therapy in 6–12 months." If still not achieved, "Assess adherence," "Consider repeat kidney biopsy to rule out other diagnoses or advanced chronicity," and "Consider anti-CD20, combination therapy with MPAA, belimumab and CNI, or referral to investigational therapy." A footnote states that "Treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk for potentially irreversible damage," and that anti‑CD20 examples include "Rituximab, obinutuzumab or others."

### Treatment of lupus nephritis: consensus, evidence and perspectives [^b9b1deb9]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Despite the continuing development of immunomodulatory agents and supportive care, the prognosis associated with lupus nephritis (LN) has not improved substantially in the past decade, with end-stage kidney disease still developing in 5–30% of patients within 10 years of LN diagnosis. Moreover, inter-ethnic variation in the tolerance of, clinical response to and level of evidence regarding various therapeutic regimens for LN has led to variation in treatment prioritization in different international recommendations. Modalities that better preserve kidney function and reduce the toxicities of concomitant glucocorticoids are unmet needs in the development of therapeutics for LN. In addition to the conventional recommended therapies for LN, there are newly approved treatments as well as investigational drugs in the pipeline, including the newer generation calcineurin inhibitors and biologic agents. In view of the heterogeneity of LN in terms of clinical presentation and prognosis, the choice of therapies depends on a number of clinical considerations. Molecular profiling, gene-signature fingerprints and urine proteomic panels might enhance the accuracy of patient stratification for treatment personalization in the future.

VA/DoD CKD evaluation and management — Module C outlines a primary care algorithm that begins with Evaluation for chronic kidney disease (CKD) using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), then proceeds to Establish/confirm stage of CKD with eGFR and UACR and probable etiology. It next asks Is consultation with urology indicated? with Consult urology if yes. If no, it asks Is consultation with nephrology indicated? with Consult nephrology if yes; if no, proceed to Assess risk for progression of CKD; formulate plan to treat underlying cause; implement strategies to slow progression in decline of kidney function; adjust medication doses for eGFR; optimize atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors; and review/update vaccination status. Then Monitor and assess for CKD progression and development of complications periodically (e.g., blood pressure [BP], serum creatinine/eGFR, UACR or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio [UPCR], electrolytes, calcium [Ca], phosphate [PO4], hemoglobin [Hgb]). The algorithm then asks Is there evidence of disease progression or development of indications for nephrology consultation? leading to Consult nephrology if yes or continued periodic monitoring if no.

### Efficacy of voclosporin in proliferative lupus nephritis with high levels of proteinuria [^4fae5587]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post hoc analysis of the phase 3 AURORA 1 clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of voclosporin in a subgroup of 148 participants with proliferative lupus nephritis and high levels of proteinuria. In this study, participants treated with voclosporin achieved significantly higher rates of complete renal response at 12 months than participants treated with placebo when administered in combination with MMF and low-dose glucocorticoids. In addition, treatment with voclosporin was associated with earlier and greater reductions in proteinuria that were maintained throughout the study.

Current guidelines for the management of lupus nephritis recommend targeting a UPCR of < 0.5–0.7 g/g within 12 months of initiating treatment. In this study, 34% of participants in the voclosporin arm achieved a complete renal response (requiring UPCR reduction to < 0.5 g/g) at 12 months compared with 11% in the control arm. While the rates of complete renal response at 12 months were lower in participants with UPCR ≥ 3 g/g than in the overall AURORA 1 population (voclosporin, 41% versus control, 22%), the difference in the percentage of participants with UPCR ≥ 3 g/g meeting this end point was associated with a higher OR (4.43; 95% CI, 1.78 to > 9.99; P = 0.001 versus 2.65; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.27; P < 0.0001 in AURORA 1). Furthermore, these complete renal response rates were obtained using a novel glucocorticoid tapering regimen where participants may have received IV glucocorticoids on days 1 and 2 then initiated oral glucocorticoids at a dose of only 20–25 mg/d on day 3 and rapidly tapered to 2.5 mg/d by week 16 of treatment. These results support the growing body of evidence consistent with current guidelines that lower doses of glucocorticoids are efficacious, even in participants with proliferative lupus nephritis and high levels of proteinuria. This is an important finding given the known correlations between glucocorticoid exposure, organ damage, and all-cause mortality.–

The safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS were investigated in Study 1 (NCT03021499), a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and with International Society of Nephrology / Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) biopsy-proven active Class III or IV LN (alone or in combination with Class V LN) or Class V LN. Patients with Class III or IV LN (alone or in combination with Class V LN) were required to have a urine protein to creatinine (UPCR) ratio of ≥ 1.5 mg/mg; patients with Class V LN were required to have a UPCR of ≥ 2 mg/mg.

A total of 357 patients with LN were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LUPKYNIS 23.7 mg twice daily or placebo.

Patients in both arms received background treatment with MMF and corticosteroids as follows:

Oral MMF at a target dose of 2 g/day (1 g twice a day). (Patients not already receiving MMF were started on MMF 500 mg twice a day with escalation to MMF 1 g twice a day after the first week.) Dose increases up to 3 g/day were allowed.
Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone on Day 1 and Day 2 at a dose of 500 mg/day (body weight ≥ 45 kg) or 250 mg/day (body weight < 45 kg) followed by a reducing taper of oral corticosteroids [oral prednisone 25 mg/day (body weight ≥ 45 kg) or 20 mg/day (body weight < 45 kg); tapered to achieve a target dose of 2.5 mg/day by Week 16].

### Time-updated changes in estimated GFR and proteinuria and major adverse cardiac events: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^c9125e88]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Evaluating repeated measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) over time may enhance our ability to understand the association between changes in kidney parameters and cardiovascular disease risk.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Annual visit data from 2,438 participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC).

Exposures

Average and slope of eGFR and UPCR in time-updated, 1-year exposure windows.

Outcomes

Incident heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, death, and a composite of incident heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, and death.

Analytical Approach

A landmark analysis, a dynamic approach to survival modeling that leverages longitudinal, iterative profiles of laboratory and clinical information to assess the time-updated 3-year risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Results

Adjusting for baseline and time-updated covariates, every standard deviation lower mean eGFR (19mL/min/1.73m 2) and declining slope of eGFR (8mL/min/1.73m 2 per year) were independently associated with higher risks of heart failure (hazard ratios [HRs] of 1.82 [95% CI, 1.39–2.44] and 1.28 [95% CI, 1.12–1.45], respectively) and the composite outcome (HRs of 1.32 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54] and 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03–1.20], respectively). Every standard deviation higher mean UPCR (136mg/g) and increasing UPCR (240mg/g per year) were also independently associated with higher risks of heart failure (HRs of 1.58 [95% CI, 1.28–1.97] and 1.20 [95% CI, 1.10–1.29], respectively) and the composite outcome (HRs of 1.33 [95% CI, 1.17–1.50] and 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06–1.18], respectively).

Limitations

Limited generalizability of annual eGFR and UPCR assessments; several biomarkers for cardiovascular disease risk were not available annually.

Conclusions

Using the landmark approach to account for time-updated patterns of kidney function, average and slope of eGFR and proteinuria were independently associated with 3-year cardiovascular risk. Short-term changes in kidney function provide information about cardiovascular risk incremental to level of kidney function, representing possible opportunities for more effective management of patients with chronic kidney disease.

The safety and effectiveness of BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over 1 hour on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days plus standard therapy were evaluated in a 104‑week, randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial in 448 adult subjects with active proliferative and/or membranous lupus nephritis (Trial 5). The subjects had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology classification criteria; biopsy‑proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V; and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy: corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate for induction followed by mycophenolate for maintenance, or 2) cyclophosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance. This trial was conducted in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The mean age of subjects was 33 years (range: 18 to 77); the majority (88%) were female.

The primary efficacy endpoint was Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at Week 104, defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: urine protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≤ 0.7 g/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2or no decrease in eGFR of > 20% from pre‑flare value.

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is characterised by proteinuria. The long-term goal of treatment is preservation of kidney function. In the short-term, the goal is to reduce proteinuria, as early reduction in proteinuria has been associated with improved long-term kidney health and overall mortality. Because of this, treatment recommendations include targeting a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) < 0.5–0.7 g/g within the first years of treatment.

The Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS, N = 370) was an international randomised-controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 3 g/day) as initial therapy for LN, based on data suggesting MMF to be as effective as monthly pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC). Superiority of MMF over IVC for initial therapy when used in combination with high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) was not demonstrated. However, improvement in clinical outcomes was observed in both study arms. MMF has since been used in combination with GCs as an alternative to IVC for initial treatment and eventually used for maintenance therapy.

Despite demonstrated efficacy, the tolerability of IVC and high-dose MMF has been a major drawback to their use. Further, both IVC and MMF are used in combination with high-dose GCs, which are also associated with considerable toxicity. Recently updated treatment guidelines for LN recommend limiting GC administration to the lowest dose possible (≤ 5 mg/day) during maintenance.

Voclosporin is a second-generation calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), with a modified side chain yielding an increase in potency and potentially reducing adverse events (AEs) related to calcineurin inhibition. Voclosporin was studied as part of a triple immunosuppressive regimen in the Phase 2, 48-week AURA-LV and Phase 3, 52-week AURORA 1 studies. These studies, enrolling a total of 534 participants, investigated the addition of voclosporin to low-dose MMF (2 g/day) and low-dose GCs. Both trials demonstrated significant and earlier reductions in proteinuria with the addition of voclosporin and, the subsequent extension study, AURORA 2, confirmed the acceptable safety profile with durable efficacy up to 36 months. Based on these results, recent updates to treatment guidelines have included voclosporin-based triple immunosuppressive therapy as an initial option for active LN.

### Evaluation and randomised controlled trial of home urinalysis testing in patients with SLE at elevated risk for developing lupus nephritis: a study protocol [^512e5ba3]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent complication of SLE, occurring in up to 60% of adult patients and ultimately progressing from acute inflammation to chronicity with fibrosis and end-stage kidney failure in 10%–30% of patients. Racial/ethnic minority patients with lupus have worse long-term outcomes, including progression to end-stage renal disease and overall mortality. A major challenge in the management of patients with SLE is delayed identification of early kidney disease, which ultimately leads to a greater burden on both patients and the health system.

Methods and analysis

Using a mixed methods approach, this study will develop, adapt and evaluate a home urine sampling protocol with a text-messaging reminder and data capture system for patients at elevated risk of de novo LN or relapse. First, a feasibility pilot using a single-group trial design (n = 18) will be implemented, with a feasibility assessment and qualitative, debriefing interviews with patients to further refine the intervention. The second phase is a comparative effectiveness trial of the intervention (n = 160) with the primary outcome of biopsy eligibility, that is, the participant has a clinical indication for a kidney biopsy (urine protein–creatinine ratio ≥ 0.5), whether or not the patient actually undergoes the biopsy procedure. The randomised trial includes an economic evaluation of the adapted home urinalysis protocol.

Discussion and dissemination

It is unknown whether weekly home-based urine sampling can identify proteinuria sooner than standard care; if found sooner, kidney problems could be diagnosed earlier, hopefully leading to earlier care for less-involved disease and subsequent reduced morbidity. The data collected in this trial will inform future feasibility and effectiveness of text-messaging-based home urine sampling interventions.

Trial registration number

The randomised trial will be registered with ClincialTrials.gov prior to enrolment start.

Operational definition

Lupus nephritis

An inflammation which affects the nephrons within the kidneys as a result of the complication of SLE. The patient should fulfill the diagnosis of KDIGO criteria. These includes; proteinuria of 0.5 g/d and above, serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl and above or evidence of decreased or decreasing eGFR, active urinary sediment (≥ 5% RBC/HPF, ≥ 5% WBC/HPF cellular casts) and biopsy-proven LN.

Complete renal remission

Failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 months of starting therapy.

Baseline serum creatinine

The initial value of serum creatinine recorded.

Good prognosis

Patients that achieve complete or partial remission during the study period are used as favorable clinical outcomes.

Poor prognosis

Patients that have no response, progression to ESRD or death at the end of the study period are used as unfavorable clinical outcomes.

Hypertension

We performed a post hoc analysis of the Belimumab International Study in Lupus Nephritis (BLISS-LN), a Phase 3, multinational, double-blind, 104-week trial, in which 448 patients with lupus nephritis were randomized to receive intravenous belimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo with standard therapy (cyclophosphamide/azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). Add-on belimumab was found to be most effective in improving the primary efficacy kidney response and complete kidney response in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis and a baseline urine protein/creatinine ratio under 3 g/g. However, there was no observed improvement in the kidney response with belimumab treatment in patients with lupus nephritis and sub-epithelial deposits or with a baseline protein/creatinine ratio of 3 g/g or more. Belimumab significantly reduced the risk of kidney-related events or death and lupus nephritis flare in the overall population. Belimumab reduced the risk of a sustained 30% or 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) versus standard treatment alone and attenuated the annual rate of eGFR decline in patients who remained on-study. Thus, our data suggest that the addition of belimumab to standard therapy could attenuate the risk of lupus nephritis flare and eGFR decline in a broad spectrum of patients with lupus nephritis.

### Efficacy of voclosporin in proliferative lupus nephritis with high levels of proteinuria [^9c55c000]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In a phase 3 study of adults with active lupus nephritis, addition of voclosporin to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose glucocorticoids led to significant improvements in the proportion of participants achieving complete and partial renal response as well as sustained reduction in proteinuria. This analysis examined the efficacy and safety of voclosporin in a subgroup of the phase 3 study with proliferative lupus nephritis and high levels of proteinuria.

Methods

Participants were randomized to oral voclosporin (23.7 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months; all participants received MMF and low-dose glucocorticoids. This analysis includes participants with class III or IV (± class V) lupus nephritis and baseline urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 3 g/g. Efficacy end points included complete renal response (UPCR ≤ 0.5 g/g with stable eGFR, low-dose glucocorticoids, and no rescue medication), partial renal response (≥ 50% reduction from baseline UPCR), and UPCR over time. Safety outcomes were also assessed.

Results

A total of 148 participants were in the voclosporin (n = 76) and control (n = 72) arms. At 12 months, 34% and 11% of participants in the voclosporin and control arms, respectively, achieved a complete renal response (odds ratio, 4.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78 to > 9.99; P = 0.001). A partial renal response was achieved by 65% of the voclosporin arm and 51% of the control arm at 12 months (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.20; P = 0.18). More voclosporin- than control-treated participants achieved UPCR ≤ 0.5 g/g (51% versus 26%), and voclosporin-treated participants met this end point significantly earlier (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.60; P = 0.01). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the arms; mean eGFR values remained stable and within normal range in both arms.

Conclusions

Addition of voclosporin to MMF and low-dose glucocorticoids resulted in a significantly higher proportion of participants with proliferative lupus nephritis achieving complete and partial renal responses as well as earlier reductions in proteinuria, with no evidence of worsening kidney function.

### Identification of clinical and serological factors during induction treatment of lupus nephritis that are associated with renal outcome [^c54c64d1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

ALMS outcome measures

Renal response at 6 months of the induction phase was defined as a decrease in the urine protein:creatinine ratio (UP/C) on a 24 h collection to < 3 in patients with baseline nephrotic-range proteinuria (UP/C > 3) or by ≥ 50% in patients with subnephrotic-range proteinuria and stabilisation or improvement in serum creatinine levels. Complete renal remission in ALMS was defined as UP/C ≤ 500 mg on a 24 h collection, an inactive urine sediment and serum creatinine level within 25% of baseline. Complete renal remission was assessed at any time during the maintenance phase. Patients might have achieved complete remission at the end induction and remained in complete remission or, alternatively, achieved a partial remission at the end of induction and later developed a complete remission. Renal response (complete or partial) was required for entry into the maintenance phase of the trial. The primary outcome measure in the maintenance phase was the time to treatment failure (TF), defined by any of the following criteria as adjudicated by a CEC: (1) death, (2) end-stage renal disease, (3) sustained doubling of serum creatinine, (4) renal flare, (5) requirement for rescue therapy. The definitions of renal flare were:
Proteinuric renal flare: doubling of the UP/C and proteinuria (≥ 1 g of protein per 24 h in patients with urinary protein clearance of ≤ 0.5 g per 24 h at the end of induction and ≥ 2 g per 24 h in patients with urinary protein clearance of > 0.5 g per 24 h at the end of induction).
Nephritic renal flare: increase of 25% or more in the lowest serum creatinine level during the period from screening to the end of induction plus one or more of the following findings: simultaneous doubling of urinary protein clearance, reaching a minimum of 2 g per 24 h (or the UP/C equivalent); new or increased haematuria (≥ 5 red cells per high-power field or ≥ 2+ on a dipstick test for blood); or the appearance of cellular casts.

4.2 Albuminuria as screening tool

In recent decades, CKD has been recognised as a major global health burden, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality, primarily due to its strong association with cardiovascular diseases. Despite its severe consequences, CKD often remains undiagnosed because of its asymptomatic nature in the early stages, leaving many cases undetected. This delayed recognition hinders timely intervention and increases the risk of adverse outcomes(Table 3). Effective CKD screening should identify at‐risk individuals early, enabling targeted interventions to mitigate disease progression and its associated complications.

TABLE 3
Approaches for screening for CKD.

Guidelines universally recommend CKD screening in high‐risk populations, including individuals with diabetes, hypertension or established cardiovascular disease. This approach, known as targeted or opportunistic screening, focuses on populations with a higher likelihood of CKD progression. Evidence supports the cost‐effectiveness of CKD screening in these high‐risk groups. The 2024 KDIGO guidelines expand screening recommendations to also include individuals with additional risk factors, such as older age, a family history of kidney disease, systemic conditions (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus), genetic predispositions, poor access to healthcare or low socio‐economic status. Screening for individuals with these risk factors should be personalised based on individual risk profiles and clinical judgement, rather than applying a uniform approach. Despite clear guideline recommendations, adherence to CKD screening remains suboptimal, particularly for ACR testing. While eGFR testing is more commonly performed, ACR testing — which is crucial for early CKD detection — lags significantly behind, especially in patients with hypertension. Additionally, screening strategies based solely on specific risk factors may overlook a significant portion of undiagnosed CKD cases, particularly among individuals without identified risk factors or those lacking regular primary care follow‐up.

KDIGO CKD nomenclature — classification and risk: Current chronic kidney disease (CKD) nomenclature used by KDIGO states that CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months, with implications for health, and that CKD is classified based on Cause, GFR (glomerular filtration rate) category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) categories (ml/min/1.73 m2) and descriptions are: G1 normal or high ≥ 90, G2 mildly decreased 60–89, G3a mildly to moderately decreased 45–59, G3b moderately to severely decreased 30–44, G4 severely decreased 15–29, and G5 kidney failure < 15. Persistent albuminuria categories and ranges are: A1 normal to mildly increased < 30 mg/g and < 3 mg/mmol, A2 moderately increased 30–300 mg/g and 3–30 mg/mmol, and A3 severely increased > 300 mg/g and > 30 mg/mmol. The color-coded risk legend specifies: Green low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no CKD), Yellow moderately increased risk, Orange high risk, and Red very high risk.

Lupus nephritis maintenance algorithm (Figure 92) — Prednisone is "tapered down to ≤ 5–7.5 mg/d." First choice is "Mycophenolic acid analogs: mycophenolate mofetil 1–2 g/d or mycophenolic acid 720–1440 mg/d." For "Individual indication," use "Azathioprine 1.5–2.0 mg/kg/d." If "mycophenolic acid analogs or azathioprine not tolerated," options include "Tacrolimus trough approximately 4–6 ng/ml (5–7.4 nmol/l) or cyclosporine A trough approximately 60–100 ng/ml (50–83 nmol/l) or mizoribine 3 mg/kg/d." Guidance for calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) adds that targets are transplant-derived and "most clinicians check these levels," dosing may be titrated to proteinuria response, reduce dose if serum creatinine rises or "increases over 30% of baseline," and "If the serum creatinine level does not fall after dose reduction, the CNI should be discontinued."

Class V lupus nephritis — prevalence, treatment rationale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, and suggested management: Practice Point 10.2.4.1 states a suggested approach in Figure 94. Class V LN accounts for 5%–10% of all LN cases. Because 10%–30% of patients with Class V LN and nephrotic proteinuria progress to kidney failure during long-term follow-up, heavy proteinuria does not usually spontaneously remit and increases cardiovascular morbidity and thrombosis risk, treatment of Class V patients who have nephrotic-range proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome (NS) is warranted. A small RCT showed remission was more likely with prednisone plus cyclophosphamide (60%) or prednisone plus cyclosporine (84%) than prednisone alone (27%). Figure 94 outlines management: for low-level proteinuria — renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control, immunosuppressive treatment guided by extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and hydroxychloroquine; for nephrotic syndrome — renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control, combined immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoid and one other agent (e.g., mycophenolic acid analogs, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, rituximab, azathioprine), and hydroxychloroquine; additionally, monitor the level of proteinuria and prevent or treat complications (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema), and if proteinuria worsens and/or complications develop, consider immunosuppressive therapy.

### Serum albumin at 1 year predicts long-term renal outcome in lupus nephritis [^97989946]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that at 12 months of follow-up, a predictor of renal outcome at 4 years from biopsy is serum albumin, a readily available and inexpensive, clinical laboratory test. These results await validation in independent cohorts, but raise the consideration of adding albumin to proteinuria as an outcome variable in lupus nephritis trials and in treat-to-target guidelines for management.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of lupus Nephritis [^bd2ad5d3]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases was published in 2021. Since then, the pace of drug development for glomerular diseases has accelerated, due in large part to rapidly accumulating insights into disease pathogenesis from genetic and molecular studies of afflicted patients. To keep the Glomerular Diseases Guideline as current as possible, KDIGO made a commitment to the nephrology community to provide periodic updates, based on new developments for each disease. After the 2021 guideline was published, two novel drugs received regulatory approval for the management of lupus nephritis, leading to the first KDIGO guideline update. Herein, an executive summary of the most important guideline changes from the Lupus Nephritis chapter is provided as a quick reference.

### Comparison between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein dipstick testing for prevalence and ability to predict the risk for chronic kidney disease in the general population (iwate-KENCO study): a prospective community-based cohort study [^67e398c5]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since the National Kidney Foundation began drawing attention to chronic kidney disease (CKD), several studies have reported that CKD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. For people with CKD, the risk for death from a cardiovascular event is up to 20 times greater than the risk for requiring dialysis or transplantation. A recent meta-analysis obtained from 1.5 million inhabitants in mainly Western populations reported that albuminuria levels are important for evaluating overall risk for CKD independent of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In accordance with Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations, several clinical practice guidelines in Europe, Australia, and Japan have recommended that prognostic grading for CKD should be based on a combination of urine albumin levels and eGFR.

Measurement of urine albumin, however, is not easily performed in clinical and screening settings, as it is expensive, creates a delay in the availability of results, and must be performed by laboratory technicians. Accordingly, despite relatively limited evidence for its clinical utility, urine dipstick testing remains a popular tool in epidemiological surveys.

To date, few reports have described the relationship between urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and urine protein reagent strip testing in terms of utility for CKD definition and risk grading in the general population. Specifically, it is not yet known how much the characteristics, prevalence, and risk predictive abilities for cardiovascular events of CKD change when UACR is used rather than dipstick testing for detection of this condition. In the current study, we examined the value of using UACR rather than urine dipstick testing to determine CKD prevalence, and compared each method's ability to predict the risk for cardiovascular events in the general population.

Class III/IV (± V) lupus nephritis — active, newly diagnosed or flare — uses hydroxychloroquine plus renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and triple therapy including mycophenolic acid analogs, with treatment option selection by risk factors: "Risk factors: Extra-renal manifestations and/or eGFR ≤ 45" → "Belimumab"; "No specific risk factors present Incorporate patient preferences" → "Calcineurin inhibitor OR Belimumab"; and "Risk factors: Proteinuria > 3g/d" with "Requires: eGFR > 45 and BP < 165/105" → "Calcineurin inhibitor." Response is assessed at "At least PRR in 6–12 months"; if yes, the pathway sets "Goal GC dose ≤ 5 mg/day by 6 mo." and "If CRR is achieved, continue therapy for 3–5 years" while "If PRR after 12 months, individualize therapy"; if no, "Assess adherence" and "Switch to alternate triple therapy that may include anti-CD20 agents." After switching, "At least PRR to 2nd course of therapy in 6–12 months" is reassessed; if not achieved, actions include "Assess adherence," "Consider repeat kidney biopsy to rule out other diagnoses or advanced chronicity," and "Consider anti-CD20‡, combination therapy with MPAA, belimumab and CNI, or referral to investigational therapy." A footnote states that "Treatment should be escalated or changed earlier, even at ≤ 3 months, in patients with rapidly declining GFR or increasing proteinuria due to risk for potentially irreversible damage."

Conversion of UPCR or dipstick to UACR — among patients with or at-risk for CKD, the listed calculator converts urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) (mg/g) or urine dipstick protein to urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), with an adjusted equation incorporating sex, hypertension, and diabetes; comments note that UACR data is not always available so conversion enables estimation from other albuminuria measures, urine dipsticks are low-cost and rapidly available, albuminuria is subject to intra-individual biological variability (first morning void thought to be most accurate), caution is advised in non-albumin proteinuria (e.g., multiple myeloma, amyloidosis), and similar estimates for KFRE are calculated when using predicted vs. observed ACR.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^faf88577]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.
