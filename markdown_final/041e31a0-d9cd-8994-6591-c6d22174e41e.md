## Question

Eye and lung chlorine exposure with burning eyes and shortness of breath. Treatment and management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment and management of eye and lung chlorine exposure with burning eyes and shortness of breath. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate decontamination and scene safety. Then, I should verify airway and breathing priorities and when to intubate. Next, I will review ocular management, including irrigation and ophthalmology referral. After that, I need to check supportive respiratory therapies, including oxygen, bronchodilators, and the role of corticosteroids. I will then consider advanced therapies for severe lung injury, monitoring for delayed pulmonary edema, and disposition planning. Finally, I should confirm special populations and long-term follow-up, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: remove the patient from the exposure source, ensure scene safety for responders, and initiate decontamination, because chlorine is highly water soluble and rapidly irritates moist tissues, so time-sensitive removal and irrigation reduce ongoing injury and symptoms [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2].

> Wait, let me verify the ocular decontamination specifics before moving on. Copious irrigation with lukewarm water or normal saline for at least 15 minutes is recommended, with removal of contact lenses if present, and if irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist beyond 15 minutes, an ophthalmologic examination is warranted to assess for corneal injury, which can progress even when initial symptoms seem mild [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2] [^8adec062].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the airway. I need to check for evolving upper airway edema and bronchospasm, because chlorine causes early upper airway irritation and later lower airway obstruction; stridor, hoarseness, or progressive dyspnea signal impending airway compromise and may require early intubation, and I should remember that pulmonary edema can be delayed by 2–4 hours after moderate exposure and 30–60 minutes after severe exposure, so observation is essential even if the patient looks initially well [^e14ec740] [^0047f864] [^5c139c80].

> I will now examine supportive respiratory care. Humidified oxygen is first-line for dyspnea or hypoxemia, and inhaled bronchodilators such as albuterol, often combined with ipratropium, are standard to treat bronchospasm and airway irritation. I should double-check that the evidence base supports this approach, and yes, systematic review and disaster experience consistently endorse bronchodilators as foundational therapy in chlorine inhalation [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957] [^d7a29cc9].

> Let me consider corticosteroids carefully, because I need to ensure I don't overstate benefit. Clinical data are limited and mixed, but animal models suggest early systemic corticosteroids may reduce lung edema and inflammation when given within 1–6 hours; in severe cases, many clinicians use IV corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, acknowledging that definitive human efficacy data are lacking, so I should frame this as reasonable but evidence-limited adjuncts in moderate-to-severe exposures [^8afd4ddf] [^be670920] [^33fcaf5a].

> Next, I should review advanced therapies for severe lung injury. For ARDS or refractory hypoxemia, evidence-based ARDS care applies: lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, and inhaled vasodilators such as inhaled epoprostenol can be considered. I should confirm that case-based success has been reported with these strategies in chlorine-induced ARDS, which it has, albeit with low-quality evidence [^33fcaf5a] [^80a02957].

> But wait, what about nebulized sodium bicarbonate? I initially thought it might be standard, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. A randomized trial showed only modest improvements in FEV1 at 2–4 hours without clear clinical outcome benefits, so I should not recommend it routinely; it may be considered case-by-case for persistent bronchospasm, recognizing the limited benefit signal [^8afd4ddf].

> I need to ensure I address delayed complications. Pulmonary edema and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome can manifest hours after exposure, so any patient with significant inhalation should be observed for at least 24 hours when feasible, and discharged patients should receive strict return precautions for worsening dyspnea, chest tightness, or wheeze, with follow-up to assess for persistent hyperreactivity or asthma-like symptoms [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2] [^8adec062].

> Let me think about special populations. Children may be more vulnerable to airway injury and secondary infection, so I should maintain a lower threshold for admission and consider age-appropriate dosing and monitoring. Patients with asthma or COPD are at higher risk of severe bronchospasm and may require more aggressive bronchodilator therapy and observation, and I should confirm that guidelines emphasize exposure avoidance and optimized chronic management to prevent recurrence [^f6122b4d] [^8822bcd9] [^56ae033f].

> I should confirm long-term follow-up needs. Even after apparent recovery, some patients develop persistent cough, wheeze, or exercise intolerance; spirometry and, if symptoms persist, methacholine challenge can help identify RADS or chronic bronchial hyperreactivity, and patients should be counseled to avoid irritant exposures and referred for pulmonary or occupational medicine evaluation as indicated [^80a02957] [^68fa4bf2].

> Hold on, I should verify that my algorithm aligns with authoritative guidance. The CDC and CHEMM emphasize immediate removal, copious ocular irrigation, humidified oxygen, bronchodilators, and observation for delayed pulmonary injury, with hospitalization for significant exposures or persistent symptoms; this matches the stepwise approach I've outlined and supports the strength of recommendation for core measures versus the weaker evidence for adjuncts like bicarbonate or early steroids [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2] [^0047f864].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan remains concise and actionable: secure the scene and remove from exposure, irrigate eyes for at least 15 minutes and arrange ophthalmology if symptoms persist, assess airway early and intubate for compromise, provide humidified oxygen and inhaled bronchodilators, consider IV corticosteroids in moderate-to-severe cases, escalate to ARDS-directed care if severe, observe for delayed pulmonary edema, and tailor disposition to exposure severity and comorbidities, with clear return precautions and follow-up for potential RADS [^e14ec740] [^8afd4ddf] [^33fcaf5a].

For chlorine exposure with burning eyes and shortness of breath, **immediate decontamination** is essential: move to fresh air, remove contaminated clothing, and flush eyes with copious lukewarm water or saline for at least 15 minutes [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2]. Provide **humidified oxygen** and inhaled bronchodilators for respiratory symptoms; consider systemic corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957]. Monitor for delayed pulmonary edema for 24–48 hours, and admit patients with significant exposures, persistent symptoms, or corneal injury [^e14ec740] [^8adec062]. There is **no specific antidote**, so care is supportive; prognosis is generally favorable with prompt treatment, though reactive airways dysfunction syndrome may occur [^68fa4bf2] [^80a02957].

---

## Immediate decontamination and first aid

Immediate decontamination is critical to limit ongoing injury:

- **Remove from exposure**: Move the patient to fresh air immediately [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2].

- **Remove contaminated clothing**: Carefully remove clothing and jewelry to prevent continued exposure [^d5365b98].

- **Eye irrigation**: Flush eyes with copious lukewarm water or normal saline for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses if present and continue irrigation [^e14ec740] [^68fa4bf2] [^0047f864].

- **Skin decontamination**: Rinse skin thoroughly with water if exposed [^d5365b98].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

A thorough clinical assessment is essential to guide management:

- **Airway and breathing**: Assess for stridor, wheezing, bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia [^e14ec740] [^7bc3c234].

- **Ocular examination**: Evaluate for corneal injury, conjunctival injection, and persistent irritation [^e14ec740] [^8adec062].

- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: Monitor for arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability, especially in severe exposures [^0047f864].

- **Laboratory tests**: Consider arterial blood gases, chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests based on severity [^notfound].

---

## Medical management

### Respiratory management

- **Oxygen therapy**: Administer humidified oxygen for dyspnea or hypoxemia [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957].

- **Bronchodilators**: Use inhaled beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol) and ipratropium bromide for bronchospasm and airway obstruction [^8afd4ddf] [^80a02957].

- **Corticosteroids**: Consider systemic corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) for moderate-to-severe exposures to reduce inflammation and prevent reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) [^8afd4ddf] [^33fcaf5a].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Provide supportive ventilation for severe respiratory failure or ARDS [^33fcaf5a].

---

### Ocular management

- **Continued irrigation**: Continue eye irrigation until pH normalizes and symptoms resolve [^notfound].

- **Topical anesthesia**: Use topical anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine) for pain control during irrigation [^12bc5243].

- **Ophthalmologic consultation**: Obtain immediate ophthalmology evaluation for corneal injury or persistent symptoms [^e14ec740] [^8adec062].

- **Topical antibiotics**: Prescribe topical antibiotics if corneal injury is present to prevent infection [^notfound].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for the following scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Significant respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxemia) | Risk of delayed pulmonary edema and respiratory failure [^e14ec740] [^0047f864] |
| Corneal injury or persistent ocular symptoms | Risk of permanent vision loss [^e14ec740] [^8adec062] |
| High-concentration or prolonged exposure | Increased risk of severe respiratory injury [^e14ec740] [^d7a29cc9] |
| Underlying respiratory conditions (asthma, COPD) | Higher risk of complications [^8822bcd9] |

---

## Potential complications

Chlorine exposure can lead to several complications, including:

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Severe pulmonary injury requiring intensive care [^33fcaf5a].

- **Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)**: Chronic asthma-like symptoms persisting after exposure [^80a02957] [^68fa4bf2].

- **Corneal injury**: Permanent vision impairment if not treated promptly [^e14ec740] [^8adec062].

- **Pneumomediastinum**: Rare complication due to alveolar rupture [^98b554d5].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is generally favorable with prompt treatment, though **persistent respiratory symptoms** may occur, particularly in patients with significant exposure or underlying respiratory conditions [^80a02957] [^68fa4bf2]. Long-term follow-up is recommended for patients with severe exposures or persistent symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and public health considerations

Public education on safe handling of chlorine-containing products and proper pool chemical storage and use is essential to prevent accidental exposures [^64236740] [^6eaad1cd]. Occupational safety measures, including adequate ventilation and personal protective equipment, are critical in workplaces with potential chlorine exposure [^e3623f29].

---

Effective management of chlorine exposure with ocular and respiratory symptoms centers on **immediate decontamination**, supportive respiratory care, and close monitoring for delayed complications. Hospitalization is indicated for significant exposures or persistent symptoms, and long-term follow-up may be necessary for chronic sequelae.

Chemical irritants and choking agents — exposure features and initial care include that the irritants and corrosives include common chemicals such as ammonia, bromine, and chlorine, which can affect the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and predominantly, the upper and lower respiratory tracts; decontamination includes copious water irrigation of the skin and eyes, management is mainly supportive, and the risk of delayed pulmonary injury remains for 24 hours, with a noted report that the Assad regime in Syria has used chlorine gas against civilians, causing at least 1 pediatric death. Choking agents are described as producing delayed pulmonary injury with immediate eye symptoms; most choking agents are heavier than air, which could produce higher concentrations at the breathing level of the child, and treatment is supportive.

### Chlorine gas induced acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pool shock [^33fcaf5a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chlorine gas is a known pulmonary irritant with potential to cause significant lung injury. Most severe cases stem from industrial accidents or chemical warfare, and while exposure is common with chlorinated household cleaners, life threatening events are rare. A 75-year-old male developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following an accidental chlorine exposure after mixing calcium hypochlorite powder with water in his sink, triggering an explosion with chlorine gas release. He rapidly developed bronchospasm, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure within hours of exposure, in addition to severe chemical conjunctivitis. He was rapidly intubated, received bronchodilators, intravenous dexamethasone and inhaled epoprostenol, and underwent prone positioning. Targeted therapy for chlorine gas induced lung injury is limited. Despite a rapid decline over his initial clinical course, and prognostic markers all portending a poor outcome, aggressive management of his lung injury with standard ARDS care proved to be effective, and the patient made an excellent recovery.

Introduction

Chlorine exposure can lead to pulmonary obstruction, reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and, rarely, death.

Objective

We performed a systematic review of published animal and human data regarding the management of chlorine exposure.

Methods

Three databases were searched from 2007 to 2017 using the following keywords "("chlorine gas" OR "chlorine-induced" OR" chlorine-exposed") AND ("therapy" OR "treatment" OR "post-exposure")". Forty-five relevant papers were found: 22 animal studies, 6 reviews, 19 case reports and 1 human randomized controlled study. General management: Once the casualty has been removed from the source of exposure and adequately decontaminated, chlorine-exposed patients should receive supportive care. Humidified oxygen: If dyspnea and hypoxemia are present, humidified oxygen should be administered. Inhaled bronchodilators: The use of nebulized or inhaled bronchodilators to counteract bronchoconstriction is standard therapy, and the combination of ipratropium bromide with beta 2 -agonists effectively reversed bronchoconstriction, airway irritation and increased airway resistance in experimental studies. Inhaled sodium bicarbonate: In a randomized controlled trial, humidified oxygen, intravenous prednisolone and inhaled salbutamol were compared with nebulized sodium bicarbonate. The only additional benefit of sodium bicarbonate was to increase the forced expiratory volume in one second, 2 and 4h after administration. Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone 100mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) reduced lung edema when given within 1h of chlorine inhalation and when administered within 6h significantly decreased (p < 0.01) the leukocyte count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). As corticosteroids were never given alone in clinical studies, it is impossible to assess whether they had an additional beneficial effect. Antioxidants: An ascorbic acid/deferoxamine combination (equivalent to 100mg/kg and 15mg/kg, respectively) was administered intramuscularly 1h after chlorine exposure, then every 12h up to 60h, then as an aerosol, and produced a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in BAL leukocytes and a significant reduction (p < 0.007) in mortality at 72h. The single clinical case reported was uninterpretable. Sodium nitrite: Sodium nitrite 10mg/kg intramuscularly (IM), 30min post-chlorine exposure in mice and rabbits significantly reduced (p < 0.01) the number of leukocytes and the protein concentration in BAL and completely reversed mortality in rabbits and decreased mortality by about 50% in mice. No clinical studies have reported the use of sodium nitrite. Dimethylthiourea: Dimethylthiourea 100mg/kg IP significantly decreased (p < 0.05) lymphocytes and neutrophils in BAL fluid 24h after chlorine exposure in experimental studies. No clinical studies have been undertaken. AEOL 10150: Administration of AEOL10150 5mg/kg IP at 1h and 9h post-chlorine exposure reduced significantly the neutrophil (p < 0.001) and macrophage (p < 0.05) bronchoalveolar cell counts. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4): IM or IP TRPV4 reduced significantly (p < 0.001) bronchoalveolar neutrophil and macrophage counts to baseline at 24h. No clinical studies have been performed. Reparixin and triptolide: In experimental studies, triptolide 100–1000 µg/kg IP 1h post-exposure caused a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in bronchoalveolar neutrophils, whereas reparixin 15mg/kg IP 1h post-exposure produced no benefit. Rolipram: Nanoemulsion formulated rolipram administered intramuscularly returned airway resistance to baseline. Rolipram (40%)/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (60%) 0.36mg/mouse given intramuscularly 1h post-exposure significantly reduced (p < 0.05) extravascular lung water by 20% at t+6h. Prophylactic antibiotics: Studies in patients have failed to demonstrate benefit. Sevoflurane: Sevoflurane has been used in one intubated patient in addition to beta 2 -agonists. Although the peak inspiratory pressure was decreased after 60min, the role of sevofluorine is not known.

Conclusions

Various therapies seem promising based on animal studies or case reports. However, these recommendations are based on low-level quality data. A systematic list of outcomes to monitor and improve may help to design optimal therapeutic protocols to manage chlorine-exposed patients.

Treatment

Upon admission, her condition was considered to be an acute exacerbation of asthma. She was given anti-obstructive treatment with salbutamol and ipratropium bromide on vaporizer and corticosteroids. Her condition gradually improved over the course of several hours and she was discharged the following day. She was prescribed anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, and she was told that she should avoid further exposure to chlorine dioxide disinfectant.

Riot control agents — clinical symptoms and assessment findings include that symptoms after exposure may involve the eyes (tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, blurred vision), nose/mouth/throat (rhinorrhea, burning/pain, trouble swallowing, drooling), lungs (chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, wheezing, dyspnea), skin (burning, redness, dermatitis), and gastrointestinal system where nausea and vomiting are rare. Pertinent assessment findings include whether a riot control agent was used, symptoms of exposed, lung sounds, and evidence of other traumatic injuries.

### Chemical pneumonitis in a 9-year-old following chlorine gas exposure [^de82f444]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A previously fit and well 9-year-old boy developed shortness of breath and chest pain after playing with friends on a building site where bonfire materials were being collected. Firstline investigations failed to explain his symptoms, which worsened over the next 24hours, necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. When public health and the police retraced his steps, they found barrels of sodium hypochlorite and red diesel at the bonfire site, which when mixed had the potential to form chlorine gas leading to the diagnosis of a chemical pneumonitis secondary to chlorine gas inhalation. Supportive care was continued, and he was successfully extubated after 48hours. At 6-week follow-up, he had no ongoing pulmonary symptoms.

### Mustard gas: imminent danger or eminent threat? [^92d7fa70]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To increase awareness of the widespread environmental prevalence of the chemical warfare agent mustard gas, examine the acute and chronic toxic effects to exposed humans, and discuss medical treatment guidelines for mustard gas exposures.

Data Sources

Literature retrieval of medical case reports and clinical studies was accomplished using PubMed and the Cochrane Database (1919-March 2007). Search terms included mustard, mustard gas, sulfur mustard, chemical warfare, blister agents, vesicants, and war gas. Historical information and current events were accessed through military field manuals and Internet searches.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. Adult and pediatric populations were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

Mustard gas and other chemical weapons are feared for their use as weapons of terror; however, the major threat of mustard gas lies elsewhere. Tons of this chemical agent were produced for war, then subsequently buried in landfills, disposed of at sea, or left to decay in storage facilities. There are documented and anecdotal reports of chemical weapon burial sites and ocean dumps across the globe spanning from the Arctic Circle to Australia. Numerous accidental exposures have occurred over the past decade. Mustard gas is corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Extensive exposures can also affect other organ systems. Its ability to cause harm to multiple organ systems at extremely low doses in virtually any environmental condition makes it an extremely dangerous agent. Immediate decontamination of people exposed to mustard gas liquids and vapors is paramount. Supportive care and long-term followup is necessary for exposed persons. Research is under way to find antidotes or treatment methods for mustard gas exposure, but currently there are no definitive treatment guidelines.

Conclusions

Mustard gas is a weapon, but also a prevalent environmental threat. Recognizing the immense environmental presence of mustard gas disposal sites and the signs and symptoms of exposure will help speed treatment to those accidentally or purposefully exposed.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^61b1b858]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Key learning points

What is already known about this subject:

During the COVID-19 pandemic chlorine dioxide has emerged as a widely used surface disinfectant.
Chlorine dioxide has been marketed as the ideal surface disinfectant: efficient against near all pathogenic microorganisms, fast-acting, non-toxic and safe to use.
Chlorine dioxide gas is a known irritant, but the concentration in the product used for surface disinfection is below the limit requiring the product to be labelled as potentially hazardous to health.

What this study adds:

Even though the chlorine dioxide concentration in the aqueous solution is very low, when the gas is released during use, the concentration in the working atmosphere may exceed relevant occupational exposure levels.
This case raises concern that normal use of these products may cause respiratory health damage.

What impact this may have on practice or policy:

The current legislation should be revised so that such products are required to be marked according to their potential health hazard.
Before adopting this chemical for surface disinfection purposes, careful assessment of the risk for health damage is advised, including measurements of chlorine dioxide concentrations in the working atmosphere.
In healthcare settings, the health hazard for patients should also be considered. Patient rooms should be adequately ventilated before they are used after having been disinfected with chlorine dioxide.

### Clinical management of casualties exposed to lung damaging agents: a critical review [^be670920]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

There is no specific antidote for the treatment of casualties exposed to chlorine, phosgene, or mustards; therefore, management is largely supportive. Corticosteroid treatment has been given to casualties accidentally exposed to chlorine. Clinical data on efficacy are inconclusive as the numbers given steroids have been small and the indications for administration unclear. There have been no clinical controlled studies. There is a stronger evidence base from animal studies, particularly from porcine and rodent models. Lung injury induced by phosgene and mustard appears to be mediated by glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, free radical generation, and subsequent cellular toxicity. There is limited evidence to suggest that repletion of glutathione reduces and/or prevents lung damage by these agents. This may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.

### Chlorine | Chemical emergencies… [^4a9fbe30]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Warning. Chlorine can explode or create explosive products with many common substances. They include: acetylene, ether, turpentine, ammonia, fuel gas, hydrogen, and finely divided metals. When chlorine gas touches moist tissues it creates an acid that can hurt these tissues. If high amounts are breathed in, breathing problems may show up right away. Symptoms of exposure to higher levels of chlorine include the following:

- Blurred vision or eye tearing
- Burning feeling in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
- Coughing and/or coughing up white to pink-colored fluid
- Chest tightness
- Breathing problems, shortness of breath, or rapid and shallow breathing
- Respiratory failure
- Frostbite if exposed to liquid chlorine
- Nausea and/or vomiting
- Skin pain, redness, and/or blisters If low amounts are breathed in, symptoms may show up later. Do not scrub.

If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia. This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Get help Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Treatment If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting. No known cure exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel.

Long-term health effects Short exposure Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, asthma caused by chemicals. Long term exposure This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened. Multiple exposures to chlorine may also produce flu-like symptoms and high risk of RADS.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^a3d25939]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): The panel made an explicit decision that the primary outcome driving the decision for any post-exposure prophylaxis is the ability to prevent infection; when the evidence demonstrates a very low likelihood of effective post-exposure prophylaxis, other outcomes become secondary; and when healthy persons are considered for preventive medications (such as would occur in post-exposure settings), a higher threshold for benefits is required and (even putative) harms become more important. The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence against prophylaxis treatment with HCQ was moderate (failure to prevent infection) due to concerns with imprecision, and the panel balanced the lack of clear benefit with the increased risk of harms from the body of evidence reported in the treatment section, in addition to the side effects reported in the trials to make a strong recommendation. The guideline panel recommended against the use of HCQ as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for persons exposed to COVID-19.

### Management strategies of ocular chemical burns: current perspectives [^ac89eb07]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is inevitable for an ophthalmologist to be consulted for an acute chemical burn. Many of such cases are mild and may be managed easily without remarkable sequelae. On the other hand, some chemical burns are so severe that they require frequent ophthalmic examinations and surgical operations for the management of structural, functional, and cosmetic complications. Despite what seems appropriate and timely management, further damage may ensue and result in severe loss of vision.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^8cf95b75]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

In the period after the hospital admission, she avoided working with chlorine dioxide and her symptoms gradually resided, even though she stopped taking inhalation corticosteroids after a few weeks. During the following year, she still experienced symptoms of irritation in the throat and chest when exposed to chlorine dioxide. If she worked with chlorine dioxide over several days, she again experienced wheezing and shortness of breath. About eighteen months after the acute admission, she underwent spirometry that showed normal dynamic lung volumes and a methacholine challenge test with no sign of bronchial hyperreactivity with a PD20 of 1330 μg methacholine. At this time, she had been away from exposure to chlorine dioxide for at least one month and experienced no symptoms.

After several other hospital cleaners reported airway irritation when working with chlorine dioxide, the hospital suspended the use of chlorine dioxide disinfectant until further examinations due to concerns about employee and patient safety.

TABLE 2
Guidelines and recommendations for management of allergy patients during COVID‐19

FIGURE 9
Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in allergic patients might be complex due to overlap of aeroallergy and COVID‐19 symptoms. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, body aches, and sore throat can indicate SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, whereas runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, and watery eyes point‐out more into respiratory diseases manifestation. Uncertainty regarding the source of observed manifestations should be always (tele)consulted with physicians and an extensive screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 should be assured to limit the spread of the virus. COVID‐19, coronavirus disease 2019; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

In summary, allergic diseases and asthma do not aggravate the risk of severe/critical COVID‐19 outcomes in the absence of underlying lung disease or any other immunosuppressive or metabolic comorbidities. Adherence to recommended social distancing and the use of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, can lower the incidence of exacerbations by reducing aeroallergen exposure. Patients with any underlying allergic disease should continue with standard treatment and be reassured of its safety and efficacy. Detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in allergic patients might be challenging due to overlap of allergy and COVID‐19 symptoms and reluctance for doctor consultations. Screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 is imperative to minimize viral transmission and to differentiate between COVID‐19 symptoms and allergies.

Background

Recently, aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide gas has emerged as a commonly used disinfectant for both surfaces and equipment in various industries and in healthcare settings. Even though chlorine dioxide gas is a potent respiratory irritant, the typical concentration used in disinfectant solutions of chlorine dioxide, is below the levels requiring the product to be marked as hazardous to health according to the European Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) regulation. Here we present a case history of a hospital cleaner being admitted to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress following repeated exposure to chlorine dioxide disinfectant.

Miscellaneous disinfectants — chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and ozone (O3) — are described as potent biocides due to strong oxidizing potential that have been used for many years to disinfect municipal water and numerous other industrial applications, but until recently benefits were limited to large-scale applications because standard formulations must be made on-site and are associated with a risk for producing volatile or toxic gas; newer methods may enable cost-effective and portable generation for small-scale applications.

### Ethylene glycol exposure: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^447bf90b]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

In 2002, poison centers in the US reported 5816 human exposures to ethylene glycol. A guideline that effectively determines the threshold dose for emergency department referral and need for pre-hospital decontamination could potentially avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, optimize patient outcome, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected exposure to ethylene glycol by (1) describing the process by which the exposure might be evaluated, (2) identifying the key decision elements in managing the case, (3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and (4) identifying needs for research. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. (1) A patient with exposure due to suspected self-harm, misuse, or potentially malicious administration should be referred to an emergency department immediately regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). (2) Patients with inhalation exposures will not develop systemic toxicity and can be managed out-of-hospital if asymptomatic (Grade B). Patients with clinically significant mucous membrane irritation should be referred for evaluation (Grade D). (3) Decontamination of dermal exposures should include routine cleansing with mild soap and water. Removal of contact lenses and immediate irrigation with room temperature tap water is recommended for ocular exposures. All patients with symptoms of eye injury should be referred for an ophthalmologic exam (Grade D). (4) Patients with symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning should be referred immediately for evaluation regardless of the reported dose (Grade C). (5) The absence of symptoms shortly after ingestion does not exclude a potentially toxic dose and should not be used as a triage criterion (Grade C). (6) Adults who ingest a "swallow" (10–30 mL), children who ingest more than a witnessed taste or lick, or if the amount is unknown of most ethylene glycol products should be referred immediately for evaluation. The potential toxic volume of dilute solutions (e.g., concentration < 20%) is larger and can be estimated by a formula in the text (Grade C). (7) A witnessed taste or lick only by a child, or an adult who unintentionally drinks and then expectorates the product without swallowing, does not need referral (Grade C). (8) Referral is not needed if it has been > 24 hours since a potentially toxic unintentional exposure, the patient has been asymptomatic, and no alcohol was co-ingested (Grade D). (9) Gastrointestinal decontamination with ipecac syrup, gastric lavage or activated charcoal is not recommended. Transportation to an emergency department should not be delayed for any decontamination procedures (Grade D). (10) Patients meeting referral criteria should be evaluated at a hospital emergency department rather than a clinic. A facility that can quickly obtain an ethylene glycol serum concentration and has alcohol or fomepizole therapy available is preferred. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures and community resources (Grade D). (11) The administration of alcohol, fomepizole, thiamine, or pyridoxine is not recommended in the out-of-hospital setting (Grade D).

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^2557cb2c]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This case report presents new information on a possible health hazard associated with the use of chlorine dioxide solutions for surface disinfection in an occupational setting. This health hazard is not currently reflected in the product's Material Safety Data Sheet, as the concentration of the gas in the solution is below the level that requires it to be marked as potentially hazardous to health according to European CLP regulation. We show with a simple estimation that there is a potential exposure for chlorine dioxide gas well above relevant occupational exposure limit values during surface disinfection with 200 ppm chlorine dioxide solutions. Before adopting this chemical for surface disinfection purposes, we advise careful assessment of the risk for health damage. Preferably, these risk assessments should include measurements of chlorine dioxide concentrations in the working atmosphere. In hospital settings, also the potential health hazard for patients should be considered.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^56ae033f]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Asthma irritant avoidance — tobacco smoke; smoke, strong odors, and sprays; vacuum cleaning; and other exposures — provides specific steps: If you smoke, visit smokefree.gov or ask your health care provider for ways to help you quit, ask family members to quit smoking, and do not allow smoking in your home or car. For combustion and odor triggers, if possible, avoid using a wood-burning stove, kerosene heater, or fireplace, vent gas stoves to outside the house, and try to stay away from strong odors and sprays, such as perfume, talcum powder, hair spray, and paints. For vacuuming, try to get someone else to vacuum for you once or twice a week, if you can, stay out of rooms while they are being vacuumed and for a short while afterward, and if you must vacuum yourself, using high efficiency air-filtration (HEPA) filter vacuum cleaners may be helpful. Other things that can make asthma worse include sulfites in foods and beverages — do not drink beer or wine or eat dried fruit, processed potatoes, or shrimp if they cause asthma symptoms — cold air: cover your nose and mouth with a scarf on cold or windy days, and other medicines: tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including nonselective beta-blockers (including those in eye drops).

Investigations

On examination, she was found to be clinically obstructive with tachypnoea, tachycardia, expiratory and inspiratory wheezing, and prominent coughing. She had sinus tachycardia, otherwise normal ECG, normal chest x-ray and normal blood tests, including infection markers.

Shortly after she started working with chlorine dioxide disinfectant, the patient experienced sore throats and airways, nausea and headaches when applying the disinfectant. She gradually developed shortness of breath and wheezing related to her work exposure. In her experience, there was a clear connection between her symptoms and the use of chlorine dioxide disinfectant at work. In the beginning, she experienced the symptoms only during and shortly after exposure, but after a few months, she felt that the symptoms became more persistent, and she did not experience full remission between work shifts. Her symptoms were most pronounced when she got home after a shift. As she felt that lying down further exacerbated her difficulty breathing, she often slept sitting in a chair after having worked a night shift. After having worked four consecutive night shifts, she experienced respiration-dependent chest pain, chest tightness, coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. She contacted the out-of-hours medical service, which led to her being admitted to the emergency department.

Graniteville chlorine gas release — exposure characteristics and clinical outcomes are detailed. In January 2005, an early morning train accident released approximately 54,000 lb of chlorine gas, with most residents asleep except 180 millworkers on-shift. Three exposure durations were defined as very short-term (1–5 min), short-term (~10–15 min), and long-term (~30–60 min), with exposure doses varying from lethal (> 1,000 ppm) to the harmless odor threshold (0.2 ppm), and the plume was about 1.5 km wide at severe concentrations (≥ 20 ppm). Eight of nine immediate fatalities occurred on site, all due to asphyxiation or acute respiratory failure with pulmonary edema on autopsy. The most severely injured (n = 71) were admitted, with one death after discharge, and a hospital review of patients with both spirometry and chest X-ray found a predominantly restrictive lung function pattern. Treatments included β-agonists, ipratropium bromide, inhaled, oral, or intravenous corticosteroids, antibiotics, and nebulized or intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Five hundred and twenty-nine people were treated and released from emergency departments, and 331 sought medical care at physician's offices. Long-term follow-up of the known 1,384 victims is on-going, with preliminary evidence demonstrates significantly reduced lung volumes in the severely exposed.

### Complications of chlorine inhalation in a pediatric chemical burn patient: a case report [^57ad6dec]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of burn injuries in the pediatric population occur at home, and a significant proportion are the result of exposure to household cleaning products. A common injury-causing agent is bleach, which has the potential to release chlorine gas, a potent respiratory irritant that leads to the added risk of inhalation injury. The survival of pediatric patients with chemical burns is extremely high, and the 3 strongest predictors of mortality are large burn size, age < 48 months, and the presence of inhalation injury. The authors present a rare case of a pediatric fatality from a chemical bleach burn that resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as hemodynamic and pulmonary instability that required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The authors critically appraised the management of this patient to determine the possible effect certain events had on the unexpected and poor outcome of this patient, including fluid resuscitation, the effect of the chemical inhalation injury, sedation, and the need for invasive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation life support.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^6f67549e]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chlorine dioxide gas is a potent respiratory irritant, and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has proposed a threshold limit value — ceiling (TLV-C) of 0.1 ppm in the working atmosphere due to the potential for respiratory tract irritation and pulmonary oedema. Even though the concentration of chlorine dioxide in the disinfectant solution is relatively low, an estimation based on the described use and some theoretical assumptions shows that the patient may have been exposed to concentrations far above this threshold limit value, see time–history graph of estimated concentration in Figure 1 applying a Near Field–Far Field model. This estimation shows a maximum concentration of 4 ppm and a 30-min mean of 3 ppm. The assumptions in this model are that 1 l of 200 ppm chlorine dioxide solution is used to clean a room with a 40 m 3 volume over 30 min. It is assumed that all the chlorine dioxide gas in the solution is released as the solution evaporates and that the gas is evenly distributed in the room volume. The room is assumed to be ventilated with five air changes per hour. This shows that even though the product has a concentration below the threshold requiring it to be marked as potentially hazardous to health according to the European CLP regulation, the concentrations in the working atmosphere of cleaning personnel may greatly exceed the levels considered to be safe.

Figure 1.
Exposure estimate chlorine dioxide based on the case report. NF = Near Field exposure, FF = Far Field exposure, C = Concentration, TWA = time weighted average.

Our evaluation of this case history is that the patient's symptoms most likely represent an irritant asthmatic reaction caused by repeated exposure to chlorine dioxide gas in concentrations that likely were above the relevant health-based threshold limit values. Her symptoms show a tight-linked relation with exposure to the disinfectant. Unfortunately, spirometry or other investigations objectively demonstrating airway reactions were not performed in the symptomatic phase of her condition. Differential diagnoses for the acute exacerbation leading up to the hospital admission are mainly infection or an allergic reaction. Infection is considered not to be likely due to the lack of fever or other clinical signs of infection, and the lack of infection markers in the blood. Allergic reaction is considered less likely because no plausible allergic agents have been identified. Infection or allergic reaction cannot explain the airway irritation she experienced during repeated exposures to chlorine dioxide.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^f45566ca]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A hospital cleaner developed acute respiratory distress after working with a chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant. The content of chlorine dioxide in the product is below the limit that would require the product to be labelled as hazardous to health, but we show with a simple estimation that the relevant threshold limit values for chlorine dioxide in the working atmosphere may be exceeded under normal use of the product. This may have implications for risk assessment of the use of such chlorine dioxide-based disinfectants and may warrant stricter regulations for labelling these products.

### The influence of chlorine in indoor swimming pools on the composition of breathing phase of professional swimmers [^71bf4556]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Chemical side products were released in swimming pools as a result of the interactions between organic matter and chlorine. They contained mainly trihalomethanes, usually represented by haloacetic acids and chloroform. The chlorine present in the pool reacted with ammonia, which appeared along with urine, sweat or soap residue from users. The resulting haloacetic acids contributed to the irritation of the skin and eyes. In addition, chloramines and chlorine gas irritated the respiratory system. Research has shown that problems with irritation of the nasal mucosa were very common in people regularly exercising in a swimming pool. A total of 25–74% of swimmers complained about chronic symptoms of rhinitis. Symptoms associated with irritation of the upper respiratory tract included nasal obstruction, pruritus, sneezing and symptoms associated with sinusitis. In addition, swimmers often complained about a sore throat, headache and ocular symptoms. Current literature reports a relationship between airway dysfunction and professional swimming training.

It was already reported that acute exposition to chlorine may damage airways and alveoli results in acute lung injury characterized by cough and dyspnea. This prolonged exposition lead to secondary acute airway obstruction and sometimes pulmonary edema, which may convert into chronic process. The cause of chronic symptoms may be chlorine induced pulmonary inflammation and remodeling sometimes called as chlorine-induced reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). Persistent chlorine induced airway irritation may be responsible for development of asthma like symptoms, but with more persistent consequences. Even short, but intensive exposure may result in persistent respiratory symptoms, complains and impairment of pulmonary function.

In acute chlorine gas exposure it is currently speculated that a transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have an important role in respiratory disease. It has to be underlined that although the effect of chlorine on lungs and airways is often described as persistent in most publications acute high exposures are described whereas according to our best knowledge the scarce data about effect of low dose persistent exposition on human lungs and airways. Moreover, at his stage there are no prospectively confirmed specific treatment, therefore in acute intoxication treatment regimens are symptomatic, however, based on experimental studies the vanilloid-type TRP channels family TRPV4 may be considered as a candidate for management of acute lung injury caused by acute chlorine gas exposure, but this needs to be confirmed in humans. Therefore, at this stage, asthma like syndrome caused by exposition to chlorine compounds is usually treated with anti-asthmatic drugs, but this treatment does relieve symptoms but does not ameliorate the underlying disease pathogenesis.

### Chlorine gas inhalation: human clinical evidence of toxicity and experience in animal models [^80a02957]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Humans can come into contact with chlorine gas during short-term, high-level exposures due to traffic or rail accidents, spills, or other disasters. By contrast, workplace and public (swimming pools, etc.) exposures are more frequently long-term, low-level exposures, occasionally punctuated by unintentional transient increases. Acute exposures can result in symptoms of acute airway obstruction including wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and/or dyspnea. These findings are fairly nonspecific, and might be present after exposures to a number of inhaled chemical irritants. Clinical signs, including hypoxemia, wheezes, rales, and/or abnormal chest radiographs may be present. More severely affected individuals may suffer acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to 1% of exposed individuals die. Humidified oxygen and inhaled beta-adrenergic agents are appropriate therapies for victims with respiratory symptoms while assessments are underway. Inhaled bicarbonate and systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids also have been reported anecdotally to be beneficial. Chronic sequelae may include increased airways reactivity, which tends to diminish over time. Airways hyperreactivity may be more of a problem among those survivors that are older, have smoked, and/or have pre-existing chronic lung disease. Individuals suffering from irritant-induced asthma (IIA) due to workplace exposures to chlorine also tend to have similar characteristics, such as airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and to be older and to have smoked. Other workplace studies, however, have indicated that workers exposed to chlorine dioxide/sulfur dioxide have tended to have increased risk for chronic bronchitis and/or recurrent wheezing attacks (one or more episodes) but not asthma, while those exposed to ozone have a greater incidence of asthma. Specific biomarkers for acute and chronic exposures to chlorine gas are currently lacking. Animal models for chlorine gas inhalation have demonstrated evidence of oxidative injury and inflammation. Early epithelial injury, airways hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling, likely diminishing over time, have been shown. As in humans, ALI/ARDS can occur, becoming more likely when the upper airways are bypassed. Inhalation models of chlorine toxicity provide unique opportunities for testing potential pharmacologic rescue agents.

Phosgene (carbonyl chloride, CAS 75-44-5) is a highly reactive gas of historical interest and current industrial importance. Phosgene has also proved to be a useful model for the study of those biochemical mechanisms that lead to permeability-type pulmonary edema (adult respiratory distress syndrome). In turn, the study of phosgene-induced adult respiratory distress syndrome has provided insights leading to revised treatment strategies for exposure victims. We summarized recent findings on the mechanisms of phosgene-induced pulmonary edema and their implications for victim management. In light of that research, we also provide a comprehensive approach to the management and treatment of phosgene exposure victims.

### Management strategies of ocular chemical burns: current perspectives [^01590e86]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Management Strategies

Appropriate management of ocular chemical burn requires caring for epithelial defects, inflammatory response, and complications through steps that promote epithelialization, reduce inflammation, and prevent complications. This will break a vicious cycle that each of these factors, if left untreated, may bring about, and thus, may adversely affect outcomes (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies of ocular chemical burns have three facets: promotion of epithelialization, reduction of inflammation, and prevention of complications.

An ophthalmologist taking care of ocular chemical burns must be familiar with both medical and surgical management of complications. While lower grades may demonstrate continued healing with an excellent prognosis, higher grades may deteriorate rapidly and require surgical interventions at earlier stages. Table 3 provides stage-specific treatment options in ocular chemical burns.

### Updates on the evaluation and management of caustic exposures [^b1f6e477]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

In 2004, the American Association of Poison Control Centers' Toxic Exposure Surveillance System documented over 200,000 exposures to caustic substances, in both household and industrial products. Although the most commonly affected body areas are the face, eyes, and extremities, all reported fatalities were as a result of ingestion. Little controversy exists in patient management following dermal or ocular caustic exposure. Immediate water irrigation of the site of caustic exposure, followed by routine burn care, analgesia, intravenous fluids, and electrolyte replacement are standards of care. In this manuscript, a thorough review of the management of gastrointestinal caustic exposure is explored, not only because of the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with these exposures, but also because there remains controversy regarding appropriate management of such exposures. Hydrofluoric acid, a weak acid in its aqueous form, requires special consideration and specific antidotes, and as such, is addressed separately.

### Acute respiratory distress after exposure to chlorine dioxide-based disinfectant [^f9428ad3]. Occupational Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

As a child, she had been medically treated for suspected asthma up to the age of two or three years. After that, no asthmatic symptoms until the current events. She reported a history of allergic symptoms with conjunctivitis and nasal obstruction after exposure to pollen and animal hair, but no asthmatic reactions to any exposures.

The patient started working as a hospital cleaner about six months prior to the admission. She mostly worked shifts in the emergency department, cleaning and disinfecting patient rooms. She reports cleaning and disinfecting up to 17 patient rooms per shift, which lasted 7–9 h. In the first few months, she used a potassium peroxymonosulphate-based disinfectant and experienced no work-related symptoms. After these initial months, the type of disinfectant was changed to a chlorine dioxide-based product. She used about 1 l of 200 ppm or 0.02% aqueous chlorine dioxide solution per room. She moistened microfiber cloths with the solution and then used these cloths to wipe off surfaces. For cleaning the patient's bed and floor, she applied the solution directly with a squeeze bottle and then wiped it off. After wiping, a liquid-film should remain on the surface left to act on the surface for at least 2 min.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in acute airway injury — noxious airborne chemicals "are detected by the trigeminal and vagal sensory nerves of the airways, eyes, and skin" and "initiate respiratory reflexes including cough, sneezing, and decreased respiratory rate; sensations of irritation and pain; and glandular secretions." Agents including "chlorine gas, capsaicin (in pepper spray), acrolein (in smoke), and tear gas agents (chlorobenzylidene malononitrile [CS] and chloroacetophenone [CN]) trigger strong neuronal irritant responses." "TRP ion channels are key airway nociceptor chemical receptors," with TRPA1 identified as the neuronal target of acrolein, methyl isocyanate, and chlorine gas; "Tear gas agents CN, CS, and dibenzoxazepine (CR) are the most potent activators of TRPA1." "TRPA1-deficient mice are insensitive to the acute irritant effects," and "TRPA1 inhibitors attenuated behavioral pain responses to CN and CS, and reduced the inflammatory response." TRPV4 has "been shown to be a crucial mediator of ventilator and heart failure–associated lung injury," and in chlorine and hydrochloric acid models, "postexposure treatment with TRPV4 inhibitors reduced pulmonary inflammation" and histopathologic injury, "reduced vascular and epithelial leakage, airway hyperreactivity, and airway elastance, while improving blood oxygen saturation," with "Chlorine-exposed TRPV4-deficient mice" showing diminished inflammation.

### Respiratory and ocular symptoms among employees of a hotel indoor waterpark resort – Ohio, 2007 [^82e4d9e7]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

During January — March 2007, the Warren County Combined Health District (WCCHD) received 665 reports of respiratory and eye irritation from patrons and lifeguards at a hotel indoor waterpark resort in Ohio. Tests revealed normal water chemistry and air chlorine concentrations, and exposure to airborne trichloramine in the waterpark was suspected as the cause of the symptoms. Because of the number of symptom reports and WCCHD's limited ability to measure trichloramine, the district requested an investigation by CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This report describes the results of that investigation, which revealed that trichloramine concentrations in the waterpark ranged from below the limit of detection to 1.06 mg/m3, and some concentrations were at levels that have been reported to cause irritation symptoms (≥ 0.5 mg/m3). Lifeguards reported significantly more work-related symptoms (e.g., cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and eye irritation) than unexposed hotel employees. Lifeguards also reported significantly more eye irritation and cough on days when hotel occupancy was high versus low. Insufficient air movement and distribution likely led to accumulation of trichloramine and exacerbation of symptoms. Based on recommendations to increase air movement and distribution at pool deck level, hotel management modified the ventilation system extensively, and subsequently no new cases were reported to WCCHD. The results of this investigation emphasize the importance of appropriate design and monitoring of ventilation and water systems in preventing illness in indoor waterparks.

### The clinical toxicology of sodium hypochlorite [^e0baf7f0]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium hypochlorite is used as a bleaching and disinfecting agent and is commonly found in household bleach.

Objective

The objective is to review critically the epidemiology, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of hypochlorite poisoning.

Methods

PubMed was searched from January 1950 to June 2018 using the terms "Hypochlorite", "Sodium Hypochlorite", "Sodium Oxychloride", "Hypochlorous Acid", "Bleach", "Chlorine Bleach", in combination with the keywords "poisoning", "poison", "toxicity", "ingestion", "adverse effects", "overdose", and "intoxication". In addition, bibliographies of identified articles were screened for additional relevant studies including non-indexed reports. Non-peer-reviewed sources were also included. These searches produced 110 citations which were considered relevant.

Epidemiology

There is limited information regarding statistical trends on world-wide poisoning from sodium hypochlorite. In the United States of America, poison control center data have shown that enquiries regarding hypochlorite bleaches have ranged from 43,000 to 46,000 per year over the period 2012–2016. Mechanisms of toxicity: Hypochlorite's potential to cause toxicity is related to its oxidizing capacity and the pH of the solution. Toxicity arises from its corrosive activity upon contact with mucous membranes and skin. Features following ingestion: While small accidental ingestions are very unlikely to cause clinically significant toxicity, large ingestions may cause corrosive gastrointestinal injury and systemic effects, including metabolic acidosis, hypernatremia, and hyperchloremia. Features following dental exposure: Hypochlorite is used extensively by dentists for cleaning root canals and is safe if the solution remains within the root canal. Extrusions into the periapical area can result in severe pain with localized large and diffuse swelling and hemorrhage. Features following skin exposure: Prolonged or extensive exposure may cause skin irritation and damage to the skin or dermal hypersensitivity. Such exposures can result in either immediate or delayed-type skin reactions. High concentration solutions have caused severe chemical skin burns. Features following inhalation: Although there are only limited data, inhalation of hypochlorite alone is likely to lead to no more than mild irritation of the upper airways. Features following ocular exposure: Corneal injuries from ocular exposure are generally mild with burning discomfort and superficial disturbance of the corneal epithelium with recovery within 1 or 2 days. With higher concentration solutions, severe eye irritation can occur.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis can typically be made on the basis of a careful history, including details of the specific product used, its hypochlorite concentration, and the amount involved. As hypochlorite bleach produces a characteristic smell of chlorine, this may provide a diagnostic clue. In severe cases, corrosive injury is suggested on presentation because of hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, retrosternal pain or hematemesis.

Management

Symptom-directed supportive care is the mainstay of management. Gastrointestinal decontamination is not beneficial. Local corrosive injury is the major focus of treatment in severe cases. Fiberoptic endoscopy and CT thorax/abdomen are complimentary and have been shown to be useful in corrosive injuries in assessing the severity of injury, risk of mortality and risk of subsequent stricture formation and should be performed as soon as possible after ingestion. Dental periapical extrusion injuries should be left open for some minutes to allow bleeding through the tooth and to limit hematoma development in tissue spaces. Once the bleeding has ceased, the canal can be dressed with non-setting calcium hydroxide and sealed coronally.

Conclusions

Accidental ingestion of household bleach is not normally of clinical significance. However, those who ingest a large amount of a dilute formulation or a high concentration preparation can develop severe, and rarely fatal, corrosive injury so prompt supportive care is essential as there is no specific antidote. Treatment primarily consists of symptom-directed supportive care.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — topical chemical burn treatment and interventions directs: "If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical prior to flushing the site as the irrigating solution may activate a chemical reaction" and "If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient's skin (and eyes, if involved) with copious amounts of water or normal saline." It further states to "Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline," "Consider the use of topical anesthetic eye drops (e.g., tetracaine) for chemical burns of the eye," "For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of irrigation fluid to eye — Morgan lens may facilitate administration," "Early airway intervention for airway compromise or bronchospasm associated with oropharyngeal burns," "Take measures to minimize hypothermia," and "Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation if necessary to obtain hemodynamic stability."

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8822bcd9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Airway respiratory irritants — Key considerations for care and responder safety: Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and precipitate or exacerbate bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. As patients may be off gassing (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the back of the transport vehicle, it is important to have adequate ventilation of the patient compartment. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive therapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and rapid transport are core elements of care as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inhaled agents except for heavy metals that may be chelated in-hospital after agent identification. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into inaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim will not perceive the smell, yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still present. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide and, if there is some form of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances visible as you arrive at the vehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) before opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases may be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to EMS responders. Household bathroom, kitchen, and oven cleaners when mixed can generate various airway respiratory irritants (ammonia, chloramine, and chlorine gas releases are particularly common), and a very common exposure is to chloramine, a gas liberated when bleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined; chloramine then hydrolyzes in the distal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorous acid. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse. Some inhalants can cause cardiac arrest due to dysrhythmias from irritated myocardium, and this syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane, and effects of the chemicals in the aerosols.

### A practical approach to severity classification and treatment of dry eye disease: a proposal from the Mexican dry eye disease expert panel [^b1951b20]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Mexican Dry Eye Disease Expert Panel Proposed Treatment Approach Based on Dry Eye Disease Severity

The management of DED is complex due to its multifactorial nature. The well-accepted principle that diagnosis precedes therapy means that clinicians must endeavor to identify the degree to which different types of dry eye and other ocular surface conditions contribute to the patient's clinical presentation. The primary objective of DED management is to restore homeostasis of the ocular surface by breaking the vicious cycle of the disease. While treatments may be indicated explicitly for one aspect of an individual patient's condition, several treatment modalities might appropriately be recommended for multiple aspects of a DED clinical presentation. Beyond the aim of identifying and treating the leading cause of the disease, the management of DED typically involves dealing with chronic sequelae requiring continuous rather than short-term treatment to eliminate the dry eye issues.

According to the disease stage, management algorithms are essential for a systematic therapy sequence, but such strategy is not always possible for DED as it is a complex condition varying inter-individually in severity and clinical course. However, to assist all eye care practitioners to custom a practical and efficacious evidence-based treatment strategy, we propose the management algorithm illustrated in Figure 7 and detailed in the following subsections. We also provide an evidence-based rationale for chosen therapeutic modalities.

Figure 7
Systematic treatment approach proposed by the Mexican Dry Eye Expert Panel.

General Rules for All Patients

According to DED severity, the recommended step-management for patients' refractory to therapy is additive and sequential. Regardless of disease severity, specific recommendations are suitable for all patients, including as-needed ocular lubricants, with a frequency depending on symptom severity.

Patient Education

Once diagnosis and severity are established, patient education regarding treatment strategies and prognosis is paramount. It is crucial to determine the frequency of episodes, presenting symptoms and signs, systemic medication intake, and associated systemic conditions. Whenever possible, such medications should be suspended. It is essential to assess for therapeutic adherence at every visit and identify potential aggravating factors of DED.

Environmental Conditions

Low humidity, air conditioning, and other hostile environmental conditions can exacerbate DED symptoms and should be considered. For example, in patients with ADDE or EDE, including Sjögren syndrome, GvHD, rosacea or severe MGD, protective eyeglasses, prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE), or low-water content contact lenses should be used to limit exposure to adverse environmental conditions.

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^6be96ac8]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Common presenting symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. However, patients may have a wide range of symptoms representing a spectrum of mild to severe illness. Symptoms in children tend to be milder and may include fever, cough, and feeding difficulty. The incubation period is two to 14 days, although symptoms typically appear within five days of exposure. Multiple testing modalities exist, but infection should be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using a nasopharyngeal swab. There are no evidence- based treatments appropriate for use in the outpatient setting; management is supportive and should include education about isolation. In hospitalized patients, remdesivir should be considered to reduce time to recovery, and low-dose dexamethasone should be considered in patients who require supplemental oxygen. Overall, 85% of patients have mild illness, whereas 14% have severe disease requiring hospitalization, including 5% who require admission to an intensive care unit. Predictors of severe disease include increasing age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, low oxygen saturation, and increased levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, transaminases, and lactate dehydrogenase.

### Chlorine-related inhalation injury from a swimming pool disinfectant in a 9-year-old girl [^09e14ceb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chlorine is a potential respiratory hazard in both occupational and household settings. The clinical sequelae of inhalation are variable in severity and timing, and subacute presentation is a concern. We report the case of a 9-year-old girl who developed dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pneumonitis approximately 12 hours after exposure to chlorine released from aerosolized swimming pool purification tablets. Her course was characterized by improvement with supplemental oxygen and bronchodilator therapy. Follow-up pulmonary testing at 4 months after the episode revealed the presence of mild obstructive reactivity of the airways, but she was able to perform normal activities without requiring medications. We discuss the pathophysiology, symptoms, therapy, and long-term follow-up of chlorine inhalation injuries.

### Coral keratitis: case report and review of mechanisms of action, clinical management and prognosis of ocular exposure to palytoxin [^301c35ad]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 37-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for testicular cancer and nephrolithiasis and unremarkable past ocular history was examined in the hospital by the emergency department provider for right eye pain. The previous night, the patient was handling some coral he had bought online and cut his hand on the rock. Additionally, upon putting the coral in his aquarium, a plume of dust was released into the air. Within a couple of hours, he noticed severe right eye (OD) pain. At no point during his care did the patient have any complaints or abnormal findings on his left eye (OS). It is possible that he may have inadvertently touched the affected eye (OD) with his fingers but did not recall this when he gave his history.

The patient presented to the emergency room the morning after exposure where he was examined by an emergency room provider, given erythromycin ointment and discharged home with outpatient ophthalmology follow-up scheduled. Over the course of that day, his previously healthy dog got sick and died, and his cat developed respiratory symptoms. The patient's 17-year-old daughter and her boyfriend also developed a cough. The patient developed worsening eye pain and respiratory symptoms and re-presented to the ED that same night where he was evaluated by the ED provider, prescribed topical ciprofloxacin, and sent home again. The patient awoke the next morning (2 days after exposure) with eye pain and discharge, difficulty breathing, epigastric abdominal pain, streaks up his forearm, and diffuse pruritis. He re-presented a third time to the ED, was admitted to the hospital, and was later transferred to the ICU for increasing shortness of breath and a likely diagnosis of palytoxin exposure.

### Is secondary chemical exposure of hospital personnel of clinical importance? [^e3623f29]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is increasing concern among hospital personnel about potential secondary exposure when treating chemically contaminated patients.

Objective

To assess which circumstances and chemicals require the use of Level C Personal Protective Equipment (chemical splash suit and air-purifying respirator), to prevent secondary contamination of hospital personnel treating a chemically contaminated patient.

Methods

The US National Library of Medicine PubMed database was searched for the years 1985 to 2020 utilizing combinations of relevant search terms. This yielded 557 papers which were reviewed by title and abstract. After excluding papers on biological or radiological agents, or those not related to hospital personnel, 38 papers on chemicals remained. After a full-text review, 13 papers without an in-depth discussion on the risk for secondary contamination were omitted, leaving 25 papers for review. The references of these papers were searched and this yielded another seven additional citations, bringing the total to 32 papers.

Incidence Of Secondary Toxicity

Secondary toxicity in hospital personnel is rare: a large-scale inventory of 120,000 chemical incidents identified only nine cases, an occurrence of 0.0075%.

Skin Contact As A Secondary Exposure Route

Skin exposure is rare under normal hygienic working conditions, reflected by the very small number of cases reported in the literature: two cases with corrosive effects due to unprotected contact and one case of presumed skin absorption.

Inhalation As A Secondary Exposure Route

Most case reports described secondary toxicity as a result of inhalation. The chemicals involved were irritating solid particles (capsaicin spray/CS), toxic gases formed in the stomach of patients (arsine/hydrazoic acid/phosphine) and vapours from volatile liquids (solvents).

Features Of Secondary Toxicity

Reported symptoms after secondary inhalation were generally mild and reversible (mostly irritation of eyes and respiratory tract, nausea, headache, dizziness/light-headedness) and did not require treatment. In many cases, special circumstances increased exposure: treatment/decontamination of multiple patients, regurgitation of the chemical agent from the stomach, or inadequate room ventilation.

Use Of More Than Standard Personal Protective Equipment

Normal hygienic precautions prevent direct skin contact from exposure to common chemical agents. When solid particle contamination is extensive, a mask and eye protection should be applied. Splash proof outer clothing (splash suit) and eye protection is preferred if (partial) wet decontamination is performed on single patients. Adequate ventilation, careful removal of clothing in case of solid particles contamination and adequate disposal of gastric content reduces exposure. Hospital staff can be rotated if symptoms occur, which can be odour-mediated. The use of more elaborate personal protective equipment with an air-purifying respirator (Level C) is only necessary in exceptional cases of contamination with highly toxic volatile chemicals (e.g., sarin). It should also be considered when decontaminating a large number of patients.

Conclusions

The risk of secondary contamination and subsequent toxicity in hospital personnel decontaminating or treating chemically contaminated patients is small. Normal hygienic precautions (gloves and water-resistant gown) will adequately protect hospital staff when treating the majority of chemically contaminated patients. More extensive protection is only necessary infrequently and there is no reason to delay critical care, even if more elaborate protection is not immediately available.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^13201c95]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients. The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined. This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

### Trends in chlorine and chloramine gas exposures reported to United States poison centers [^64236740]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chlorine and chloramine gas inhalation can occur when household cleaners are mixed. The increased emphasis on disinfecting practices during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to an increase in chlorine and chloramine gas exposures in the United States, which has not been studied.

Methods

In a retrospective review, reported data on chlorine and chloramine gas exposures in the National Poison Data System were collected from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. Data included demographics and exposure details, including location, dose, formulation, co-exposures, treatments, and outcomes. Demographic analyses and descriptive statistics were conducted.

Results

During the study period, 85,104 total exposures to chlorine and chloramine gas were reported, consisting of 79,281 isolated exposures and 5,823 co-exposures. Total exposures increased by 61% from 8,385 in 2015 to 13,503 in 2022, with the largest increase of 38.3% occurring from 2019 to 2020. Total exposures remained increased through 2022 with no return to pre-pandemic levels. Most exposures occurred in "own residence" (n = 72,213, 84.9%), with a larger proportion of exposures occurring at home peri-pandemic versus pre-pandemic (88.4% versus 81.7%). One percent (n = 1,030) of exposures were admitted to a non-critical care unit, 0.73% (n = 619) were admitted to a critical care unit, and 0.03% (n = 26) resulted in death.

Discussion

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased emphasis on cleaning practices were likely contributing factors to the marked increase in exposures in 2020, which persisted through 2022. Cleaning practices that developed during the beginning of the pandemic likely persisted despite returning to more normal daily routines, which may explain the ongoing increase in reported exposures. Most reported exposures were unintentional, mild in symptomatology, and required the use of non-invasive therapies, if any.

Conclusions

Future efforts should focus on public education on the safe use of cleaning products to prevent exposure to toxic chlorine and chloramine gases.

### Chlorine: exposure, decontamination, treatment… [^68fa4bf2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms vary depending on how the person was exposed, the amount of chlorine, and the length of time of the exposure. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing chlorine than others. During or immediately after exposure to high concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:

- Blurred vision
- Burning sensation in the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes
- Coughing
- Coughing up white to pink-tinged fluid that may be delayed by a few hours
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Eye tearing
- Frostbite if exposed to liquified chlorine
- Nausea
- Rapid and shallow breathing
- Respiratory failure
- Skin pain, redness, blisters
- Vomiting
- Wheezing.
- If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, flush your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water.

Do not use eye drops.
- Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia. This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Treatment for Chlorine Exposure No known antidote exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment consists of removing the chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. If someone has ingested chlorine, do NOT induce vomiting. Long-term Health Effects After acute exposure, pulmonary function usually returns toward normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and prolonged pulmonary impairment may persist for those more seriously exposed.

Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, a chemical irritant–induced type of asthma. Chronic exposure to chlorine, usually in the workplace, may cause corrosion of the teeth. Multiple exposures to chlorine may produce flu-like symptoms and a high risk of developing RADS. For a comprehensive list of chemical agent information, see Chemicals A-Z.

Halogen taste mitigation and dosing — household disinfection — notes that taste becomes distinctive above 3 mg·L−1 and can be improved by using the minimum necessary dose with a longer contact time (30–60 m). For household chlorination, the Safe Water System "provides a low dosage of 1.875 or 3.75 mg·L−1 of NaOCl with a contact time of 30 min," and post-treatment taste can be removed chemically using ascorbic acid; a small pinch in a liter after the contact time will usually suffice.

### The public health consequences from acute chlorine releases, 1993–2000 [^d4b6e11d]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chlorine, a commonly used hazardous substance, can be harmful to human health when improperly released. Data from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance system were used to conduct a retrospective analysis on the public health consequences from acute chlorine release in 16 states during 1993 through 2000. There was an overall decline in the number of chlorine events during the period analyzed; however, chlorine events were more likely to result in events with victims, evacuations, and decontaminations when compared with nonchlorine events (relative risk [RR] = 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1 to 5.0; [RR] = 4.8, CI 4.3 to 5.3; and [RR] = 2.0, CI 1.7 to 2.4, respectively). Most chlorine victims were employees and members of the general public. The predominant symptoms sustained were respiratory and eye irritation. Equipment failure and human error were the most frequent factors leading to an event. Continuous employee training and preventive equipment maintenance can help prevent chlorine releases from occurring and minimize exposure to the general public.

### Inhalational chlorine injuries at public aquatic venues-California, 2008–2015 [^6eaad1cd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In June 2015, personnel from California's Contra Costa Health Services Environmental Health and Hazardous Materials (hazmat) divisions were alerted to a possible chemical release at a swimming pool in an outdoor municipal water park. Approximately 50 bathers were in the pool when symptoms began; 34 (68%) experienced vomiting, coughing, or eye irritation. Among these persons, 17 (50%) were treated at the scene by Contra Costa's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and released, and 17 (50%) were transported to local emergency departments; five patients also were evaluated later at an emergency department or by a primary medical provider. Environmental staff members determined that a chemical controller malfunction had allowed sodium hypochlorite and muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) solutions to be injected into the main pool recirculation line while the recirculation pump was off; when the main recirculation pump was restarted, toxic chlorine gas (generated by the reaction of concentrated sodium hypochlorite and muriatic acid) was released into the pool. A review of 2008–2015 California pesticide exposure records identified eight additional such instances of toxic chlorine gas releases at public aquatic venues caused by equipment failure or human error that sickened 156 persons. Chemical exposures at public aquatic venues can be prevented by proper handling, storage, and monitoring of pool chemicals; appropriate equipment operation and maintenance; training of pool operators and staff members on pool chemical safety; and reporting of chemical exposures.

### Acute inhalation injury with evidence of diffuse bronchiolitis following chlorine gas exposure at a swimming pool [^f0639bfd]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 23-year-old man with nonproductive cough and sore throat presented to the hospital a few hours after chlorine gas exposure at a fitness center swimming pool. Initial physical examination and chest radiograph were normal. Thirty-six hours later he developed worsening dyspnea and cough, with development of blood-tinged sputum. Arterial blood gas analysis showed mild hypoxemia and a subsequent chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse tiny nodular opacities. Findings on a thin-section computed tomogram of the chest were consistent with diffuse bronchiolitis. Pulmonary function tests showed a mild obstructive abnormality and he demonstrated substantial bronchodilator response. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids and an inhaled beta(2) agonist, to which he responded well, with full clinical recovery occurring over 5 months. This manifestation of chlorine gas exposure at a swimming pool is unusual.

### Pharmacist compliance with therapeutic guidelines on diagnosis and treatment provision [^4190a80f]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Chlorine gas exposure at a metal recycling facility – California, 2010 [^7e1c00c5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

On June 8, 2010, chlorine gas was released from a ruptured, 1-ton, low-pressure tank being recycled at a California metal recycling facility. A total of 23 persons, including employees, customers, and workers at nearby businesses, were treated for the effects of the fumes at seven area hospitals. Chlorine is a corrosive, greenish-yellow gas that is heavier than air and can cause severe respiratory damage; it is used widely in water purification, sewage treatment, and disinfectant washes for foods. Following the incident, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and CDC collaborated with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) on an Assessment of Chemical Exposures (ACE) to determine 1) the circumstances surrounding those exposed during the chlorine gas release, 2) health effects associated with exposures, and 3) recommendations for preventing recurrences. This report describes the chlorine gas release in California and summarizes the results of the ACE investigation. Of 29 persons potentially exposed to chlorine gas, 27 were interviewed to collect information regarding their exposures. In addition, information regarding acute health effects and symptoms was abstracted from medical records. At the time of the chlorine gas release, 15 persons were outdoors, and 13 were exposed for > 30 minutes before they were decontaminated. Twenty-three persons reported experiencing one or more upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms within 24 hours of exposure; six persons were hospitalized for 1–11 days. Based on these findings, CDPH issued a statewide alert to all recycling facilities on how to handle containers with potential hazardous waste.

First Responder Survey

Thirty-eight first responders suspected of entering the plume were surveyed (Table 2); 18 (47%) reported entering the plume, five (13%) reported having been near the plume, 11 (29%) did not enter the plume, and the exposure status of four (11%) was unknown. Because dispatchers initially reported the incident as a car fire, some first responders arriving at the scene who were unaware of the chemical release were also overcome by the gas. Other responders who smelled ammonia and saw the white plume retreated several blocks to don a self-contained breathing apparatus before attempting rescues. Among the 18 first responders who entered the plume, nine experienced symptoms of illness within 24 hours of the release; the four most common symptoms, each reported by five responders, were cough, burning lungs, shortness of breath, and eye irritation. Thirteen first responders were transported by EMS to the hospital; many of these responders were evaluated as a precautionary measure. One first responder was hospitalized, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and ICU care.

### Recreational waterborne illnesses: recognition, treatment, and prevention [^591b0a77]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Illness after recreational water activities can be caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, algae, and even chlorine gas. These illnesses are more common in summer. Waterborne illnesses are underreported because most recreational activity occurs in unsupervised venues or on private property, and participants tend to disperse before illness occurs. Symptoms of waterborne illness are primarily gastrointestinal, but upper respiratory and skin manifestations also occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms are usually self-limited, and supportive treatment may be all that is necessary. However, some infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Cryptosporidium and Giardia intestinalis are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness and have partial chlorine resistance. Respiratory infections are typically mild and self-limited. However, if legionnaires' disease develops and is unrecognized, mortality may be as high as 10%. Cellulitis caused by Vibrio vulnificus can result in serious illness, amputation, and death. Early and appropriate antibiotic treatment is important. Chronically ill and immunocompromised persons are at high risk of infection and should be counseled accordingly.

### Inhalational chlorine injuries at public aquatic venues-California, 2008–2015 [^cd4b3c37]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

FIGURE
Timeline of events showing deactivation and reactivation of recirculation pump, release of sodium hypochlorite and muriatic acid into the pool water, * and call to emergency services — Municipal Water Park, Contra Costa County, California, June 17–18, 2015

* Caused by an unknown equipment failure

To characterize such chemical exposures at public aquatic facilities, investigators reviewed California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) Pesticide Episode Notification Record * extracts recorded during 2008–2015. Eight additional toxic chlorine releases with multiple persons injured by each release were identified, and Pesticide Episode Closing Reports of each of these incidents were reviewed. Medical records were obtained for nine incidents occurring in 2015 (Table). Among all nine incidents, a total of 155 persons (median = 16 per incident, range = 2–34) were symptomatic (primarily respiratory symptoms, vomiting, and eye irritation), 121 (78%) patients were transported to an emergency department or were evaluated by their primary medical provider (median = 11 per incident, range = 2–27), and five of 70 (7%) persons for whom information on hospitalization was available required hospital admission (median = 1 per incident, range = 0–2). Factors contributing to these incidents included one or more of the following: chemical controller failures, valve failures, or human error. A feature noted in all events was that chemicals were inappropriately dispensed while main recirculation pumps were deactivated, causing the chemicals to mix at concentrations that resulted in the generation of toxic chlorine gas. In seven of the nine incidents, main recirculation pumps were turned on while bathers were present in pools.

### Mitigation of chlorine lung injury by increasing cyclic AMP levels [^6dd65e93]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Chlorine is considered a chemical threat agent to which humans may be exposed as a result of accidental or intentional release. Chlorine is highly reactive, and inhalation of the gas causes cellular damage to the respiratory tract, inflammation, pulmonary edema, and airway hyperreactivity. Drugs that increase intracellular levels of the signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP) may be useful for treatment of acute lung injury through effects on alveolar fluid clearance, inflammation, and airway reactivity. This article describes mechanisms by which cAMP regulates cellular processes affecting lung injury and discusses the basis for investigating drugs that increase cAMP levels as potential treatments for chlorine-induced lung injury. The effects of beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, which stimulate cAMP synthesis, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which inhibit cAMP degradation, on acute lung injury are reviewed, and the relative advantages of these approaches are compared.

Variables

The variables analysed included: site of case management (hospital/non-hospital), demographic characteristics (age and gender; month and year of exposure), route of exposure, clinical effects and treatments. The product companies were classified into two groups — MC, covering 100% to 50% of the Italian market during the study period, and OCs. Data collected for each symptomatic case were reviewed by one of the authors (FD), a clinical toxicologist, to evaluate the association between clinical effects and exposure. Additionally, severity of outcome was graded according to the Poisoning Severity Score, — that is, none — no signs/symptoms; low — mild, transient and spontaneously resolving signs/symptoms, including eye irritation/redness, rash, skin redness/irritation, oral cavity irritation/redness, emesis (one to three episodes), diarrhoea (one to three episodes), self-resolving cough, sore tongue/mouth/throat; moderate — pronounced or prolonged signs/symptoms, including corneal ulceration, skin erythema/burns, emesis (more than three episodes), diarrhoea (more than three episodes), persistent cough, difficulty in breathing not requiring intubation, burning sensation of the mouth, transient drowsiness/central nervous system depression; high — life-threatening signs/symptoms or resulting in significant residual disability or disfigurement, including oedema of epiglottis/glottis/pharynx/larynx, difficulty in breathing requiring intubation, persistent drowsiness/ central nervous system depression, corrosive injuries of the gastrointestinal tract, metabolic acidosis, melena; fatal — death as a result of exposure or of direct complications of the exposure effects; not associated — no signs/symptoms possibly related to the exposure; insufficient data — the available information is indicative of a causal relationship between exposure and an adverse health effect but it is inadequate for severity grading.

### Inhalational chlorine injuries at public aquatic venues-California, 2008–2015 [^0dbce84b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

On June 18, 2015, at 2:29 p.m. an initial 9-1-1 call reported 10–12 persons experiencing vomiting or respiratory symptoms at one of five swimming pools at an outdoor municipal water park in Contra Costa County. Contra Costa EMS and fire department personnel were dispatched. At 2:42 p.m. fire personnel requested that hazmat personnel assist in incident response, but at 2:44 p.m. the request was cancelled after fire personnel determined that there was no active chemical leak. At 3:07 p.m. fire personnel again requested hazmat personnel to investigate a possible chemical leak. Hazmat staff members arrived at the water park at 4:14 p.m. and Environmental Health personnel arrived at 4:30 p.m.; both integrated into a fire department–led incident command structure. EMS personnel evaluated and transported patients to local emergency departments. Among the 17 patients transported to an emergency department, 16 (94%) were released the same day; one patient who was experiencing tachycardia and wheezing was admitted for monitoring and breathing treatments and discharged the next day. Hazmat staff members reviewed the pool chemical controller data and performed air monitoring around the perimeter of the water park, within the immediate vicinity of the affected pool, and at the chemical storage building. Environmental Health staff members measured the free chlorine concentrations and pH of each pool and interviewed municipal water park employees and the pool maintenance contractor.

Hazmat personnel did not detect chlorine in the air during sampling conducted > 2 hours after the initial 9-1-1 call. The free chlorine concentration measured in the water of the affected pool > 2 hours after the initial 9-1-1 call was 10.5–13.5 ppm, and the pH was 6.8. Both measurements were in violation of California regulations, which allow a maximum of 10 ppm free chlorine and a pH range of 7.2–7.8. The free chlorine concentrations also violated the manufacturer's label instructions that allow a concentration of no greater than 4 ppm in pool water. The pH of the water in two of the other four pools at the park was also < 7.0. Environmental Health ordered that the water park and the pool where the exposure incident occurred be immediately closed and remain closed until Environmental Health completed a review of the park's remediation plan for the pool.

### Myocardial infarction, acute ischemic stroke, and hyperglycemia triggered by acute chlorine gas inhalation [^723e81b3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Chlorine is one of the most common substances involved in toxic inhalation. Until now, several accidental exposures have been reported. The damage to the respiratory tract in the immediate phase after exposure to chlorine is well defined. Death occurs particularly due to pulmonary edema with respiratory failure and circulatory collapse. On the other hand, no association with myocardial infarction, acute stroke, severe hyperglycemia, and acute chlorine inhalation has been reported in literature. In the present study, an elderly (74-year-old) and diabetic case with myocardial infarction, acute stroke, hyperglycemia, and respiratory failure associated with acute chlorine intoxication after a diagnosis of acute chlorine poisoning and treatment in the emergency department is reported and the literature is revisited. Physicians should know that in elderly patients with a systemic disease who apply with chlorine gas inhalation, more serious complications along with damage in respiratory tract might be observed.

### Pneumomediastinum from acute inhalation of chlorine gas in 2 young patients [^98b554d5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Trichloroisocyanuric acid is a high-efficiency and-low toxicity fungicide and bleach. It is commonly used as disinfectant for industrial circulating water, swimming pools, restaurants, and other public places in China. When trichloroisocyanuric acid is put into water, chlorine gas is produced. Chlorine gas is a potent pulmonary irritant that causes acute damage in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts (J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1998;36(1–2):87–93). Pneumomediastinum is a rare complication in patients with acute chlorine gas poisoning. A small amount of gas can be asymptomatic, but a large amount of gas entering the mediastinum suddenly will lead to respiratory and circulatory disorder, mediastinal swing, or even cardiopulmonary arrest. Severe chlorine gas poisoning patients usually need mechanical ventilation; if the pneumomediastinum is not found on time, threat to life would be greatly increased. It requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and rapid treatment. The proper use of ventilator, timely and effective treatment of original disease, and multiple system organ support had significant impact on the prognosis. The pneumomediastinum case secondary to inhalation of chlorine gas that we report here should remind all emergency department physicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease and seek immediate and proper intervention when treating patients with acute chlorine gas poisoning, once diagnosed, especially in younger patients.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^633919ee]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Pool water chemistry and chlorine disinfectants — The effective use of halogen disinfectants depends on pH, hardness, and alkalinity, and improper levels can negate disinfection. The ideal pH to avoid eye irritation is 7.3, and national standards typically recommend a range of 7.2 to 7.6. Options for chlorine disinfectant forms are varied; solid chlorine costs the least, and relative cost increases across forms. Solids such as calcium hypochlorite are quite reactive; when exposed to organic compounds they can generate a great deal of heat and are potentially explosive. Misstorage risks are highlighted, including that even a pencil with a graphite core dropped into calcium hypochlorite can trigger a reaction leading to a fire releasing free chlorine gas. Chemicals listed produce chlorine by-products that reduce chlorine effectiveness and cause most eye irritation, with example reactions including Cl2 + H2O = HCl + HOCl and HOCl + NHCl2 = H2O + NCl3.

### Chlorine: lung damaging agent | NIOSH… [^e14ec740]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

Chlorine gas is highly soluble in water; therefore, it is severely irritating on contact with moist tissues, such as the eyes, skin, nose, throat, and upper respiratory tract. At low concentrations, chlorine can cause eye and nose irritation, sore throat, and cough. At high exposure levels, irritation of the upper respiratory tract and accumulation of fluid in the lungs contribute to a sensation of choking. Suffocation is the characteristic initial complaint of patient/victims exposed to chlorine. The majority of deaths occur within 24 hours and are due to respiratory failure.
- **Mild to moderate**: Burning discomfort, spasmodic blinking or involuntary closing of the eyelids, redness, inflammation of the eye's membranes, and tear production.
- **Severe**: Corneal burns leading to cell death and tissue damage.

the upper airway; severe chest discomfort; narrowing of the lower airways is an early and prominent effect of exposure; patient/victim describes the sensation of feeling smothered; symptoms and signs of accumulation of fluid in the lung may appear within 2 to 4 hours.
- Immediately remove the patient/victim from the source of exposure.
- Immediately decontaminate eyes with large amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes.
- Seek medical attention immediately.
- Immediately remove the patient/victim from the source of exposure.
- Seek medical attention immediately.
- Immediately remove the patient/victim from the source of exposure.
- Evaluate respiratory function and pulse.
- Ensure that the patient/victim has an unobstructed airway.
- If shortness of breath occurs or breathing is difficult, administer oxygen.
- Assist ventilation as required. Always use a barrier or bag-valve-mask device.
- If breathing has ceased, provide artificial respiration. Long-Term Implications All patient/victims who have a suspected significant exposure or who have eye burns or serious skin burns should be observed in a hospital setting. Patient/victims suffering frostbite should be evaluated by a physician. An ophthalmologist should be immediately consulted for patient/victims who have injury to the cornea. Symptomatic patient/victims complaining of persistent difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, severe cough, or chest tightness should be admitted to the hospital and observed until symptom-free.

Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and ozone (O3) — field disinfection characteristics and graded guidance — Chlorine dioxide–production tablets contain 6.4% sodium chlorite as the active ingredient, and a long reaction or contact time of upwards of 2 to 4 h is needed; ClO2 does not produce a lasting residual and water must be protected from sunlight. Ozone is one of the strongest oxidants and disinfectants and rapidly kills organisms but breaks down rapidly, so adequate concentration and contact time must be assured. Recommendations are as follows: "Chlorine dioxide and O3 are widely used and potent water disinfectants, including efficacy against the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence." Additionally, "Portable, point-of-use products generating ClO2 or O3 have limited data demonstrating effective concentration and contact time.
