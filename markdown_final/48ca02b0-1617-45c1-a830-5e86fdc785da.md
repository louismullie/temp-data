## Question

what has better outcomes, inspire inplant or cpap for sleep apnea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which has better outcomes, CPAP or Inspire upper airway stimulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and guideline hierarchy. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence base for CPAP versus Inspire. Next, I will examine adherence and real-world effectiveness. After that, I need to check patient selection and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions where Inspire might outperform CPAP in practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and guideline position. CPAP remains the first-line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea across major guidelines, with strong recommendations from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, whereas Inspire (hypoglossal nerve stimulation) is reserved for select CPAP-intolerant patients with moderate to severe OSA who meet specific anatomic criteria, so any "better outcomes" claim must be framed within that indication boundary [^114TqjPq] [^116REiLS] [^1134hGPz].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative evidence base before drawing conclusions. High-quality randomized data exist for CPAP demonstrating consistent reductions in AHI and improvements in daytime sleepiness and quality of life, whereas Inspire's pivotal evidence comes from uncontrolled cohorts and registries, including the STAR trial and ADHERE registry, which show large AHI and symptom improvements but lack head-to-head randomized comparisons with CPAP, limiting causal inference about relative superiority [^114t8mFs] [^116CDNLW] [^11668yof].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adherence translating to better outcomes. I initially thought Inspire's average nightly use of roughly 6.5 hours might imply superior real-world effectiveness, but I should double-check that inference; adherence alone does not establish comparative superiority to CPAP, and while Inspire shows high device usage and patient satisfaction in CPAP-intolerant cohorts, CPAP's efficacy when actually used remains unmatched for AHI reduction and sleepiness, with meta-analytic estimates showing the largest AHI reductions for CPAP among OSA therapies [^11668yof] [^117M3qse] [^11532UB2].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about patient selection and safety. Inspire requires BMI typically ≤ 32–35 kg/m², absence of complete concentric palatal collapse on drug-induced sleep endoscopy, and AHI in the moderate–severe range; serious adverse events are uncommon but include device-related issues and surgical risks, whereas CPAP is noninvasive with well-characterized mask/interface side effects and no surgical morbidity, reinforcing CPAP as the safer first-line option for most patients [^117R91t4] [^116CDNLW] [^113cyc7h].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer carefully. On average, CPAP achieves better outcomes than Inspire for the broad OSA population because it has stronger comparative evidence, greater physiologic efficacy for AHI reduction, and guideline-backed first-line status; however, in the real-world subgroup of truly CPAP-intolerant patients who meet Inspire criteria, Inspire can deliver outcomes that are "better" for those individuals than a failed CPAP attempt, with durable improvements in AHI, sleepiness, and quality of life and high nightly usage, which is why guidelines position Inspire as a second-line alternative rather than a replacement for CPAP [^111HPScY] [^114TqjPq] [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz].

> But wait, what if the question is about cardiovascular outcomes rather than symptoms or AHI. I should confirm that randomized trials have not consistently shown CPAP reduces major adverse cardiovascular events, and there are no comparable randomized outcome data for Inspire yet, so claims about "better outcomes" cannot extend to hard cardiovascular endpoints at this time, which underscores the need to individualize therapy and set expectations accordingly [^111omybN] [^113jJkKA] [^112HXYQs].

> Next, I should review practical implications to avoid overgeneralization. For patients who can use CPAP with adequate adherence, CPAP remains the evidence-based choice; for those who fail CPAP despite optimized education, mask/interface trials, humidification, and adherence support, referral for Inspire evaluation is appropriate, and in that selected population, Inspire may yield outcomes that are superior to an unused or poorly tolerated CPAP device, which is the clinically relevant comparison for those patients [^116REiLS] [^113zqu5t] [^111HPScY].

> Final take: CPAP generally has better outcomes across the general OSA population due to stronger evidence and physiologic efficacy, but Inspire can achieve better outcomes than failed CPAP for carefully selected, CPAP-intolerant patients, so the correct framing is "CPAP first-line; Inspire for well-selected CPAP failures", not a universal superiority of one modality over the other [^114TqjPq] [^116REiLS] [^116CDNLW].

---

CPAP remains the **first-line therapy** for obstructive sleep apnea because it achieves larger AHI reductions and improves daytime sleepiness and quality of life [^117M3qse] [^114t8mFs]. However, adherence is often limited by mask discomfort and side effects, which can blunt real-world effectiveness [^111NSfet] [^114NLKyo]. Inspire (upper airway stimulation) is a **surgical alternative** for CPAP-intolerant patients with moderate-to-severe OSA, producing substantial and durable AHI reductions, improved sleepiness, and high nightly use (~6 hours) with low serious adverse event rates [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz] [^11668yof]. Head-to-head trials are lacking; therefore, **CPAP is preferred when tolerated**, and Inspire is appropriate for those who cannot use CPAP, with patient selection (BMI ≤ 35, no complete concentric collapse) critical to outcomes [^114E6HDL].

---

## Clinical outcomes: CPAP vs. Inspire

### Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) reduction

CPAP consistently produces **large AHI reductions** (mean difference ~30 events/hour) and is the most effective single intervention for lowering AHI [^117M3qse]. Inspire also yields **significant AHI reductions** — about 68% from baseline (median AHI from 29.3 to 9.0 events/hour at 12 months) — with durable benefit out to 5 years [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz].

---

### Daytime sleepiness and quality of life

CPAP improves **daytime sleepiness** and **quality of life** in randomized trials, with moderate-to-large effects on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and functional outcomes [^114t8mFs] [^112DPmH6]. Inspire likewise improves **sleepiness and quality of life**, with sustained gains in ESS and FOSQ over 3–5 years and high patient-reported satisfaction [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz] [^11668yof].

---

### Cardiovascular outcomes

Evidence that CPAP reduces **major adverse cardiovascular events** is mixed; large RCTs have not consistently shown benefit, though observational data suggest potential cardiovascular improvements [^113jJkKA] [^111aD6qo]. Inspire has **no randomized cardiovascular outcome data**; available evidence is limited to physiologic improvements, so cardiovascular benefit remains unproven [^116CDNLW].

---

## Adherence and patient satisfaction

CPAP adherence averages **4–5 hours per night**, with 29–83% achieving ≥ 4 hours/night on ≥ 70% of nights; adherence strongly influences outcomes [^112TQN7c]. Inspire demonstrates **high adherence** (~6 hours/night) and 90–95% patient satisfaction in registries, reflecting greater comfort and acceptance for some patients [^11668yof] [^111buJSN].

---

## Safety and adverse events

CPAP is **noninvasive** with minimal serious adverse events; common issues include mask discomfort, nasal congestion, and aerophagia [^notfound]. Inspire is **surgical**, with low serious adverse event rates (~2% in trials) and uncommon device-related issues (e.g. lead/device adjustments, tongue discomfort, temporary dysphagia) [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz].

---

## Patient selection criteria

| **Factor** | **Cpap** | **Inspire** |
|-|-|-|
| Severity | All severities | Moderate-severe (AHI 15–65) |
| BMI | No strict limit | ≤ 35 kg/m² |
| Anatomy | No specific restriction | No complete concentric collapse |
| Tolerance | Tolerates mask/interface | CPAP-intolerant |

---

## Long-term durability of outcomes

CPAP benefits persist with sustained use, but long-term adherence remains a challenge [^114t8mFs] [^114NLKyo]. Inspire shows **durable AHI and symptom improvements** at 3–5 years with sustained nightly use and low device-related serious adverse events [^1134hGPz] [^116dpGrE].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

CPAP has lower upfront and ongoing costs and is generally cost-effective at standard adherence levels [^notfound]. Inspire entails **higher initial surgical costs** but may be cost-effective in CPAP-intolerant patients when adherence and quality-of-life gains are considered; payer policies vary [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Cpap** | **Inspire** |
|-|-|-|
| AHI reduction | Large, consistent | Moderate-large, durable |
| Daytime sleepiness | Significant improvement | Significant improvement |
| Quality of life | Significant improvement | Significant improvement |
| Cardiovascular outcomes | Mixed evidence | No RCT data |
| Adherence | Moderate, variable | High, sustained |
| Safety | Noninvasive, minimal | Surgical, low serious events |
| Cost-effectiveness | Cost-effective | Cost-effective in selected patients |

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: CPAP is first-line for most patients with OSA due to robust efficacy and safety [^116REiLS] [^114TqjPq].

- **Alternative therapy**: Inspire is appropriate for CPAP-intolerant patients with moderate-to-severe OSA who meet selection criteria, offering high adherence and durable symptom control [^116CDNLW] [^1134hGPz].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits, risks, and costs with patients to align therapy with preferences and anatomy [^112E1Jsg].

---

CPAP remains the **most effective first-line therapy** for OSA, but Inspire provides a valuable alternative for carefully selected CPAP-intolerant patients, with high adherence and sustained symptom improvement.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — conclusions and trial design guidance: There is a lack of high-quality evidence that CPAP improves many long-term clinically important outcomes, and addressing these knowledge gaps requires urgent action. Randomized trials offer the most reliable approach to accurately assess the causal effects of CPAP, but quasi-experimental studies can offer distinct advantages (e.g., cost, timeliness), and certain designs can have causal interpretations under specific conditions. A randomized clinical trial of CPAP among patients with symptoms can be ethical as long as equipoise exists for the outcome(s) being studied, meaningful informed consent occurs, and safety is maximized. To improve the practicality of a randomized trial of CPAP, investigators need to engage patients in the design and execution of research to improve patient-centeredness of approach and findings; investigators should consider alternative trial designs, such as adaptive and pragmatic trials, which present opportunities to improve trial efficiency and generalizability; when appropriate to the scientific question, investigators can consider trials that compare CPAP against alternate treatments for symptoms or alternative treatments for OSA (e.g., lifestyle interventions); and investigators should carefully consider the need for sham or placebo CPAP, given its poor record in terms of patient tolerance, blinding, and informed consent. Given limitations in any one method, multiple sources of evidence are needed to fully inform practice, the field should not close off any specific avenues to testing hypotheses, and investigators need to understand the limitations of each method and reinforce best practices to ensure valid conclusions.

American Thoracic Society workshop — overview conclusions for evaluating long-term outcomes of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) emphasize that there is a lack of high-quality evidence that CPAP improves many long-term clinically important outcomes and that addressing these knowledge gaps requires urgent action. Randomized trials offer the most reliable approach to assess the causal effects of CPAP, but quasi-experimental studies can offer distinct advantages and certain designs can have causal interpretations under specific conditions. A randomized clinical trial of CPAP among patients with symptoms can be ethical as long as equipoise exists for the outcome(s) being studied, meaningful informed consent occurs, and safety is maximized. To improve practicality, investigators need to engage patients in the design and execution of research, investigators should consider alternative trial designs such as adaptive and pragmatic trials, when appropriate investigators can consider trials that compare CPAP against alternative treatments for symptoms or alternative treatments for OSA, and investigators should carefully consider the need for sham/placebo CPAP given its poor record in terms of patient tolerance, blinding, and informed consent. Given limitations in any one method, multiple sources of evidence are needed to fully inform practice and the field should not close off any specific avenues to testing hypotheses, while investigators need to understand the limitations of each method and reinforce best practices to ensure valid conclusions. Funding agencies, professional societies, and investigators need to invest in engaging communities historically excluded and harmed by the healthcare system to ensure appropriate representation, and funding agencies and regulatory bodies need to support sustainable structures that facilitate high-quality research in OSA.

### Upper airway stimulation therapy: a novel approach to managing obstructive sleep apnea [^114nbbRr]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Review the role of upper airway stimulation (UAS) therapy in the management of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Data Sources

A literature search was performed of PubMed and Medline using the search terms clinical trial; obstructive sleep apnea; upper airway stimulation; hypoglossal stimulation; hypoglossal nerve; Inspire; and ImThera.

Review Methods

All published clinical trials of currently available devices were reviewed. Unpublished data were excluded.

Results

UAS therapy results in surgical success (AHI decrease of > 50% and overall AHI ≤ 20) in 66% of implanted subjects. In addition, UAS therapy results in significant improvement in daytime sleepiness, snoring, and sleep-related quality of life.

Conclusion

UAS therapy is a valid alternative for select patients with moderate to severe OSA who are unsuccessful users of CPAP therapy. Laryngoscope, 126:S5-S8, 2016.

### Upper airway stimulation therapy [^11473vPS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Traditional upper airway surgery directly modifies skeletal and soft tissue structures surrounding the airway to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Upper airway stimulation (UAS) attempts to treat upper airway obstruction and OSA by stimulating the hypoglossal nerve. The Inspire II implant has been approved for clinical UAS. Basic science data support that UAS prevents obstruction and improves airflow. Clinical results demonstrate that UAS improves respiratory sleep metrics and improves both objective and subjective self-reported sleep and quality-of-life outcomes. In a substantial number of individuals who meet inclusion criteria, UAS appears to be a viable, long-term, low-morbidity treatment of moderate-to-severe OSA.

Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) trials — causes of barriers and strategies to overcome: Causes include ethical concerns (for example, untreated sleepiness and patient safety), lack of equipoise for CPAP's role in trial outcomes such as cardiovascular events, financial costs of trial participation, low perceived benefit relative to the burden of trial procedures, poor communication and lack of trust between researchers and patients, and patients being unaware of trials. Strategies presented include employing robust mechanisms around informed consent and mitigating risks related to sleepiness; improving communication about limitations in the evidence base for CPAP; establishing networks among clinicians with equipoise; trial design modifications such as pragmatic designs and adaptive trials (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial [SMART]); use of active control (for example, lifestyle interventions); improved longitudinal participant support (for example, PAP adherence); including patients in trial design and informing participants/communities of findings; and exploring trials that occur outside of clinical settings.

### Outcome after one year of upper airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea in a multicenter German post-market study [^117R91t4]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Upper airway stimulation (UAS) of the hypoglossal nerve has been implemented in the routine clinical practice for patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who could not adhere to continuous positive airway pressure. This study reports objective and patient-reported outcome after 12 months of implantation.

Study Design

Multicenter prospective single-arm study.

Methods

Consecutive patients who received the UAS system (Inspire Medical Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Maple Grove, MN, U.S. A.) were enrolled in three German centers. Key study exclusion criteria included body mass index > 35kg/m 2, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 15 or > 65, or complete concentric collapse at the soft palate during sedated endoscopy. Data collection at 6- and 12-month visit include home sleep test and patient-reported outcome measures.

Results

Among the total of 60 participants, the median AHI reduced from 28.6 to 9.5 from baseline to 12 months. Patient-reported outcome measured in Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire both improved significantly from baseline to 12 months. The average usage time was 39.1 ± 14.9 hours per week among all participants based on recordings by the implanted device. One patient requested a removal of the device for cosmetic and other personal reasons and was completed without sequelae.

Conclusion

This study supported that UAS is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with OSA in routine clinical practice.

### Strategies to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term clinically important outcomes among patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116Sc6uC]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) — clinician and funding barriers to randomized trials are described as including lack of equipoise among some specialists, financial and autonomy concerns for clinicians, and funding headwinds. The lack of equipoise regarding CPAP's impact was perceived to be primarily among sleep specialists rather than other clinicians who treat patients who have OSA. Clinicians often forego income-generating activities during trials, reimbursements are often lower and insufficient to cover care, and attendees reported fears of future referral or income decline and loss of clinical autonomy. Funding reviewers often cite these concerns, negatively impacting decisions, and attendees perceived a paucity of industry partners due to prior negative trials potentially discouraging investment.

### Effect of palatal implants on continuous positive airway pressure and compliance [^1146tgKb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Determine if the Pillar palatal implant system reduces continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) pressure and improves patient compliance with CPAP therapy.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Four geographically dispersed tertiary sleep disorder referral centers.

Methods

Subjects with mild to moderate sleep apnea dissatisfied with CPAP because of pressure-related complaints were randomized to receive Pillar implants or a sham procedure performed in double-blind fashion. Active and sham groups were compared for changes in therapeutic CPAP pressures (primary outcome) with a 90-day follow-up sleep study and CPAP compliance (secondary outcome) with a 90-day smart card report.

Results

Twenty-six subjects were randomized to Pillar implants and 25 to a sham implant procedure. There were no differences between groups with regard to demographics and baseline parameters. Both sham and active groups had reduced mean CPAP pressure (-1.1 vs -0.5 cm H(2)O) with no difference between groups (P = 0.32) at 90-day follow-up. In addition, there was no difference in average daily CPAP use between groups (P = 0.80). Both groups experienced improvements in Epworth sleepiness scores and Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire scores at 90 days with no differences between groups. The active group reported significantly higher CPAP satisfaction scores than the sham group (P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Pillar implants do not significantly reduce CPAP pressure or increase CPAP compliance compared to sham controls but may subjectively improve CPAP satisfaction. These findings do not presently support the use of Pillar implants as an adjunctive treatment to improve CPAP compliance.

Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea CPAP randomized trials — patient participation barriers focus on placebo CPAP burden, unblinding, self-efficacy, informed consent recall, communication, and diversity. Patients described concerns about placebo CPAP, which must be used every night during trials that may last years and is self-administered, enabling close device inspection; prior work found definite or likely unblinding among > 25% of trial participants. Treatment self-efficacy is lower with placebo CPAP than with active CPAP, and patients often do not recall informed consent conversations regarding placebo CPAP. Patients emphasized clear communication with staff and a preference to discuss risks and benefits with their clinicians, and lack of diversity in study populations was identified as a major barrier to generalizable findings.

### Upper-airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea [^116CDNLW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with considerable health risks. Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can mitigate these risks, effectiveness can be reduced by inadequate adherence to treatment. We evaluated the clinical safety and effectiveness of upper-airway stimulation at 12 months for the treatment of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.

Methods

Using a multicenter, prospective, single-group, cohort design, we surgically implanted an upper-airway stimulation device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who had difficulty either accepting or adhering to CPAP therapy. The primary outcome measures were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour, with a score of ≥ 15 indicating moderate-to-severe apnea) and the oxygen desaturation index (ODI; the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood oxygen level drops by ≥ 4 percentage points from baseline). Secondary outcome measures were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the percentage of sleep time with the oxygen saturation less than 90%. Consecutive participants with a response were included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal trial.

Results

The study included 126 participants; 83% were men. The mean age was 54.5 years, and the mean body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The median AHI score at 12 months decreased 68%, from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour (P < 0.001); the ODI score decreased 70%, from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour (P < 0.001). Secondary outcome measures showed a reduction in the effects of sleep apnea and improved quality of life. In the randomized phase, the mean AHI score did not differ significantly from the 12-month score in the nonrandomized phase among the 23 participants in the therapy-maintenance group (8.9 and 7.2 events per hour, respectively); the AHI score was significantly higher (indicating more severe apnea) among the 23 participants in the therapy-withdrawal group (25.8 vs. 7.6 events per hour, P < 0.001). The ODI results followed a similar pattern. The rate of procedure-related serious adverse events was less than 2%.

Conclusions

In this uncontrolled cohort study, upper-airway stimulation led to significant improvements in objective and subjective measurements of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. (Funded by Inspire Medical Systems; STAR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01161420.).

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patient-centered trial design — Table 3 recommends incorporating patients into trial design and governance; refining using an adaptive Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design with modification during the trial to focus on "treatment responders"; considering simplified measurements to define OSA on the basis of home testing such as oxygen desaturation index (ODI); developing and implementing predictors to include participants at higher risk for adverse outcomes; limiting exclusion criteria to include more representative patients and promote generalizability; incorporating patient choice and integrating trials within existing clinical pathways and trusted providers; providing behavioral interventions to support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use and creating mechanisms for peer support; exploring active controls and comparative effectiveness with non-CPAP alternatives for treatment of sleepiness and other symptoms; reducing participant burden through fewer surveys/interventions, virtual trial visits, and collecting outcomes from electronic health records (EHRs); and long-term engagement by informing participants of trial results, conducting participant appreciation events, and engaging patient advocacy organizations in dissemination efforts.

### Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty vs CN XII stimulation for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea: a single institution experience [^117DuEyh]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) therapy is an emerging surgical treatment for select patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This study aims to compare outcomes in patients with moderate to severe OSA who underwent HNS surgery (Inspire Medical Systems) and those who underwent traditional airway reconstructive surgery, specifically uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP).

Methods

Patients who underwent HNS implantation (n = 20), all with moderate to severe OSA, inability to adhere to positive pressure therapy, and compliant with previously published inclusion criteria, were compared to a historical cohort that were intolerant of CPAP with similar inclusion criteria who all underwent UPPP (n = 20) with some also undergoing additional procedures such as septoplasty/turbinate reduction. Data including body mass index (BMI), pre- and post-implant apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were assessed.

Results

For patients who underwent HNS, mean preoperative BMI was 28.0. Mean AHI decreased significantly from 38.9 ± 12.5 to 4.5 ± 4.8. All patients achieved an AHI < 20 post implant with 65% (13/20) with an AHI ≤ 5. For patients who underwent traditional airway surgery, mean preoperative BMI was 27.5; mean AHI decreased from 40.3 ± 12.4 to 28.8 ± 25.4.

Conclusion

While both traditional surgery and HNS are effective treatments for patients with moderate to severe OSA with CPAP intolerance, our study demonstrates that HNS is "curative" in normalizing the AHI to < 5 in the majority of patients. For select patients, HNS therapy provides excellent objective improvement in outcome measures.

### Novel and emerging nonpositive airway pressure therapies for sleep apnea [^1178PL8J]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

CPAP therapy has remained the standard of care for the treatment of sleep apnea for nearly 4 decades. Its overall effectiveness, however, has been limited by incomplete adherence despite many efforts to improve comfort. Conventional alternative therapies include oral appliances and upper airway surgeries. Recently, several innovative alternatives to CPAP have been developed. These novel approaches include means to increase arousal thresholds, electrical nerve stimulation, oral vacuum devices, and nasal expiratory resistive devices. We will review the physiologic mechanisms and the current evidence for these novel treatments.

Funding and regulatory enablers for OSA trials — Table 4 requests include developing networks to conduct large clinical trials more efficiently and effectively across specialties with partnerships across funders, funding work to engage historically marginalized and excluded communities, promoting government and industry collaborations to ensure fair and ethical distribution of resources during times of scarcity, supporting observational registries and databases with prospectively collected and cleaned data, and collaborating with electronic medical record databases to improve and standardize collection of OSA-related data (including adherence data and symptoms).

Obstructive sleep apnea randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — barriers and clinician involvement: Randomized trials offer the most reliable approach to accurately assess the causal effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but informative trials can be difficult to complete. Workshop attendees discussed barriers to recruitment and retention at the level of clinicians, regulatory bodies, and patients. Barriers to RCTs include: Funding & regulatory agencies are hesitant to approve and fund trials; Clinicians are hesitant to refer patients to trials and participate in study procedures; Patients do not enroll in trials or discontinue participation once enrolled. Barriers to clinician involvement include concerns regarding symptoms, a lack of equipoise, and financial considerations. Concerns regarding sleepiness and drowsy driving were highlighted, noting "There is strong evidence that CPAP can improve daytime sleepiness (2)", and that clinicians have "ethical and practical concerns about referring patients with sleepiness to trials with a placebo control arm".

Informed consent and adherence support — Ethicists strongly suggested that informed consent procedures should effectively communicate equipoise and carefully consider vulnerable populations and reinforced that consent language must be accessible, consistent over time, and across sites; patients advocated that, if possible, trials be introduced by a member of the patient's care team while addressing conflict of interest and perceived coercion. Participants, trialists, and sleep experts emphasized effective communication and support for trial participants, particularly regarding CPAP adherence. Three key points were raised to best address PAP adherence: design trial protocols that explicitly address CPAP adherence using evidence-based practices, include a behavioral scientist to optimize health behavior changes around adherence, and implement a fidelity monitoring plan of the adherence protocol to allow prespecified sensitivity analyses; patient representatives also advocated considering peer buddies to support trial participation and CPAP adherence.

### Strategies to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term clinically important outcomes among patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113jJkKA]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) prevalence and evidence context — Approximately 425 million individuals are estimated to have moderate-severe OSA, a condition for which continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), including autotitrating CPAP, is the first-line treatment. In randomized trials, CPAP consistently reduces the frequency of obstructive events (i.e., apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and improves daytime sleepiness, sleep-related quality of life, and blood pressure, yet although observational studies suggest that CPAP can prevent certain long-term outcomes such as cardiovascular events, randomized trials powered to detect moderate to large effect sizes have not replicated these findings. Citing these negative trials, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for "long-term clinically important outcomes". Prior trials tended to exclude patients with symptomatic OSA; among patients receiving care for OSA, roughly half have excessive daytime sleepiness and up to three-fourths have at least one attributable symptom, reinforcing the stated need for additional evidence.

### Upper airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea: results from the ADHERE registry [^11668yof]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is an alternative treatment option for patients unable to tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Studies support the safety and efficacy of this therapy. The aim of this registry is to collect retrospective and prospective objective and subjective outcome measures across multiple institutions in the United States and Germany. To date, it represents the largest cohort of patients studied with this therapy. Study Design Retrospective and prospective registry study. Setting Ten tertiary care hospitals in the United States and Germany. Subjects and Methods Patients were included who had moderate to severe OSA, were intolerant to CPAP, and were undergoing UAS implantation. Baseline demographic and sleep study data were collected. Objective and subjective treatment outcomes, adverse events, and patient and physician satisfaction were reviewed. Results The registry enrolled 301 patients between October 2016 and September 2017. Mean ± SD AHI decreased from 35.6 ± 15.3 to 10.2 ± 12.9 events per hour (P < .0001), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores decreased from 11.9 ± 5.5 to 7.5 ± 4.7 (P < .0001) from baseline to the posttitration visit. Patients utilized therapy for 6.5 hours per night. There were low rates of procedure- and device-related complications. Clinical global impression scores demonstrated that the majority of physicians (94%) saw improvement in their patients' symptoms with therapy. The majority of patients (90%) were more satisfied with UAS than CPAP. Conclusions Across a multi-institutional registry, UAS therapy demonstrates significant improvement in subjective and objective OSA outcomes, good therapy adherence, and high patient satisfaction.

### Clinical characteristics of older adults seeking hypoglossal nerve stimulation for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^112TQN7c]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple strategies exist for the management and treatment of OSA symptoms. Currently, CPAP is one of the most successful and commonly employed strategies. Continuous positive airway pressure adherence is an important component of the overall therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure adherence generally translates into improved sleep quality, increased daytime alertness, reduced daytime sleepiness, and improved overall mood/attitude. Medically, treatment adherence often translates into decreases in blood pressure and improvements in cardiovascular abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Continuous positive airway pressure adherence is often defined as utilization of therapy for an average of 4 hours a night for at least 70% of the nights. Studies have shown a wide range of CPAP compliance, ranging between 29% and 83% compliance. Given the low adherence, alternative OSA treatments are needed.

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is an FDA-approved implantable neurostimulation system (Inspire Medical Systems) used to treat select CPAP-intolerant patients with OSA by stimulating the distal branches of the hypoglossal nerve. The stimulation leads to selective activation of the genioglossus muscle, resulting in airway enlargement at the level of the palate and tongue base. – Large multicenter trials have demonstrated the efficacy of this therapy showing improvement in AHI and quality-of-life measures. Furthermore, this therapy has a durable response with studies showing stable outcomes at 60 months postprocedure. Although patients undergoing HNS are intolerant of CPAP, adherence, even among this difficult group, is excellent with an average of 6.5 hours of use per night. Despite this, some individuals struggle to maintain good adherence due to a variety of issues including stimulation discomfort, insomnia, and cognitive impairment limiting proper use of the device. Currently, the clinical characteristics of patients seeking HNS therapy are unknown. Additionally, the effect of HNS on daytime functioning is largely unknown. To work toward answering these important questions, it is necessary to first establish baseline characteristics for this population.

The aim of the present investigation was to begin to fill this void by characterizing the functioning of older adults seeking consultation for HNS for the treatment of OSA. Specifically, we aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of these patients across the domains of insomnia symptoms, physical functioning, cognitive abilities, depression and anxiety symptoms, and anger. We hypothesized that the current patient sample would display higher rates of dysfunction across these domains compared to the general population.

### Implanted upper airway stimulation device for obstructive sleep apnea [^113Akqvv]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Previous feasibility studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve can improve obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The current study examined the safety and preliminary effectiveness of a second generation device, the Upper Airway Stimulation (UAS) system, and identified baseline predictors for therapy success.

Study Design

Two consecutive open prospective studies.

Methods

UAS systems were implanted in patients with moderate to severe OSA who failed or were intolerant of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The study was conducted in 2 parts. In part 1, patients were enrolled with broad selection criteria. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was collected using laboratory-based polysomnography at preimplant and postimplant visits. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) were also collected. In part 2, patients were enrolled using selection criteria derived from the experience in part 1.

Results

In part 1, 20 of 22 enrolled patients (two exited the study) were examined for factors predictive of therapy response. Responders had both a body mass index ≤ 32 and AHI ≤ 50 (P < .05) and did not have complete concentric palatal collapse. Part 2 patients (n = 8) were selected using responder criteria and showed an improvement on AHI from baseline, from 38.9 ± 9.8 to 10.0 ± 11.0 (P < .01) at 6 months postimplant. Both ESS and FOSQ improved significantly in part 1 and 2 subjects.

Conclusions

The current study has demonstrated that therapy with upper airway stimulation is safe and efficacious in a select group of patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot or will not use CPAP as primary treatment.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1176sgW1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) treatment evidence — overall conclusions emphasize that CSA treatment studies have received substantially less attention than obstructive sleep apnea, with positive airway pressure having the lion's share of research, yet whether long-term, clinically important outcomes are improved remains an open question. The introduction of transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (TPNS) is promising but awaits long-term outcome data, and the guidelines are based on relatively small studies that do not address real-world barriers such as diagnostic variability, device access, and insurance hurdles. Overall, limitations in existing studies precluded strong recommendations for any intervention and highlight the need for mechanistic studies to identify and test optimal interventions for CSA treatment.

If CPAP cannot be used, patients "may be able to continue using your CPAP but with a different mask", or consider positional strategies such as "avoiding sleeping on your back… and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated", as well as devices "using a mouth piece designed to thrust the lower jaw forward or an implanted stimulator"; "While some patients may use oxygen alone, this may not be appropriate for most patients with sleep apnea". Surgery "may improve slightly" the severity of sleep apnea and CPAP pressure "may be reduced, but this is not consistently the case".

### The role of upper airway stimulation therapy in the multidisciplinary management approach of obstructive sleep apnea in the adult patient [^111HPScY]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

Upper airway stimulation therapy (UAS) is a novel and effective treatment modality for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It is indicated for patients who are intolerant to traditional forms of therapy such as CPAP, and who have moderate to severe disease. Its success also relies upon the absence of certain upper airway structural and functional abnormalities. Therefore, the implementation of UAS necessitates a comprehensive evaluation with the coordinated efforts of otolaryngologist and sleep specialist, utilizing the consultative input of various other specialists. This same collaborative process also underlies the successful long-term followup care of patients following implantation surgery. Laryngoscope, 126:S9-S11, 2016.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

The review of potentially eligible scientific reports identified by the searches was completed by two authors (Yasha Chen and Yihong Chen) to identify reports for review in full text. Each full‐text article was then reviewed for eligibility and, for each included study, data recorded were (1) study characteristics: first author, year of publication, country, study phase and study design; (2) participants: sample size, age, sex, key inclusion criteria, apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (ESSs); (4) interventions and comparison: CPAP equipment, type of interface, type of control, duration of treatment; and (5) outcomes: follow‐up duration, rate of lost‐to follow‐up and precision of measurements (risk ratios [RRs] or HRs with 95% CI) of each trial. Any disagreements would be resolved by discussion with a third party. Authors were contacted to clarify ambiguities and to request data on outcomes missing in primary reports.

To evaluate risk of bias, we used the individual criteria of the Newcastle‐Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS)(eMethod in Supplement). There were three parts assessed: selection bias (0–4 points), comparability bias (0–2 points), and outcome assessment bias (0–3 points), which were each classified as low, unclear, or high. NOS scores of 6 were assigned as high‐quality studies.

2.4 Outcomes

The primary end point was the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or repeat revascularization at the longest available follow‐up. The secondary end points were individual components of the primary end point. Definitions of events were in accordance to guidelines during each study period.

### Combined deep plane facelift / necklift and inspire hypoglossal nerve stimulator surgery [^1142cEM7]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

A 63 year old female patient presented to our office with two chief complaints, (1) severe OSA with CPAP intolerance and (2) cosmetic face and neck concerns regarding facial rhytids, jowls, and neck laxity. She was evaluated for Inspire candidacy and found to be an appropriate candidate. She underwent a combined Inspire hypoglossal nerve stimulator implant and deep plane facelift and necklift surgery to address her sleep apnea and her cosmetic concerns. Through the combined approach, we were able to provide appropriate exposure for the hypoglossal nerve implant and achieve excellent cosmetic results. Techniques utilized that contributed to her superior cosmetic results include gonion augmentation, partial submandibular gland resection, anterior belly of the digastric resection, and extended platysmal myotomy and plication. We demonstrate through this case that deep plane facelift/necklift and Inspire hypoglossal nerve stimulator implant can be performed together safely and with successful sleep and cosmetic outcomes.

### Upper airway stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea: 5-year outcomes [^1134hGPz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective To present 5-year outcomes from a prospective cohort of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who were treated with upper airway stimulation (UAS) via a unilateral hypoglossal nerve implant. Study Design A multicenter prospective cohort study. Setting Industry-supported multicenter academic and clinical trial. Methods From a cohort of 126 patients, 97 completed protocol, and 71 consented to a voluntary polysomnogram. Those having continuous positive airway pressure failure with moderate to severe OSA, body mass index < 32 kg/m 2, and no unfavorable collapse on drug-induced sleep endoscopy were enrolled in a phase 3 trial. Prospective outcomes included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index, and adverse events, as well as measures of sleepiness, quality of life, and snoring. Results Patients who did and did not complete the protocol differed in baseline AHI, oxygen desaturation index, and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire scores but not in any other demographics or treatment response measures. Improvement in sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and quality of life was observed, with normalization of scores increasing from 33% to 78% and 15% to 67%, respectively. AHI response rate (AHI < 20 events per hour and > 50% reduction) was 75% (n = 71). When a last observation carried forward analysis was applied, the responder rate was 63% at 5 years. Serious device-related events all related to lead/device adjustments were reported in 6% of patients. Conclusions Improvements in sleepiness, quality of life, and respiratory outcomes are observed with 5 years of UAS. Serious adverse events are uncommon. UAS is a nonanatomic surgical treatment with long-term benefit for individuals with moderate to severe OSA who have failed nasal continuous positive airway pressure.

### Impact of nasal pathology on efficacy of hypoglossal nerve stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea [^112jbpAA]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep and intermittent hypoxia. Untreated OSA leads to associated health issues like cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and decreased health‐related quality of life (QoL). The current gold standard and primary treatment for OSA remain continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). However, a significant proportion of patients are unable or unwilling to adhere to this therapy either due to discomfort, intolerance, or other reasons. An alternative intervention that has emerged is hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), particularly in patients with moderate to severe OSA who are CPAP‐intolerant.

HNS activates the genioglossus muscle via the stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve, resulting in airway enlargement at the level of the palate and tongue base. The Inspire device is the first and only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved HNS system. This device utilizes a respiratory sensing lead and a stimulation lead to provide respiratory synchronized stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve. Clinical trials such as the STAR trial have illustrated the benefits of improving both objective measures like apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and subjective measures like the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ). This makes HNS a promising alternative for patients with moderate to severe OSA who struggle with CPAP therapy.

Sinonasal pathology (i.e. septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, and chronic rhinosinusitis) is frequently observed and self‐reported in patients with OSA. It has been shown that patients with nasal obstruction or nasal pathology concurrent with OSA have lower compliance with CPAP, and worse ESS and FOSQ scores. One study illustrated that high nasal airway resistance in patients with allergic rhinitis can lead to longer OSAs. Nasal surgery has been illustrated to improve ESS in patients with nasal pathology and OSA. Despite the common occurrence of nasal pathology and OSA, the impact of these nasal conditions on the effectiveness of HNS has not been thoroughly investigated. This study seeks to address this gap in the literature by evaluating whether the presence of nasal pathology alters both the objective and subjective efficacy of treating OSA.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111zTYfe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndromes in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with CSA. The optimal approach to CSA treatment should incorporate clinical features, co-morbid conditions, and polysomnographic findings in an individualized manner. Specifically, clinicians must prioritize optimizing therapy for the conditions contributing to central apneas and improving patient-reported outcomes rather than solely focusing on eliminating disordered breathing events. Once therapy for CSA has been initiated, persistence of central respiratory events should prompt re-evaluation of the underlying risk factors and consideration of alternative treatment options.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for adults with CSA. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("Strong" or "Conditional"). A "Strong" recommendation (i.e., "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "Conditional" recommendation (i.e., "We suggest… ") is one that clinicians should offer to most patients if clinically appropriate. Some recommendations include remarks that provide additional context to guide clinicians with the implementation of this recommendation.

1. The AASM suggests using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over no CPAP in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA, CSA due to heart failure, CSA due to medication or substance use, treatment-emergent CSA, and CSA due to a medical condition or disorder. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty.).

2. The AASM suggests using bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) with a backup rate over no BPAP with a backup rate in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA, CSA due to medication or substance use, treatment-emergent CSA, and CSA due to a medical condition or disorder. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

3. The AASM suggests against the use of BPAP without a backup rate in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA, CSA due to heart failure, CSA due to medication or substance use, treatment-emergent CSA, and CSA due to a medical condition or disorder. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

4. The AASM suggests using adaptive servo ventilation (ASV) over no ASV in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA, CSA due to heart failure, CSA due to medication or substance use, treatment-emergent CSA, and CSA due to a medical condition or disorder. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Remarks: Prior to initiation of ASV, patient-provider shared decision-making is recommended, and treatment decisions should be based on expectations of symptomatic or quality-of-life improvement. Treatment with ASV in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) should be limited to centers with experience, along with close monitoring and follow-up.

5. The AASM suggests using low-flow oxygen over no low-flow oxygen in adults with CSA due to heart failure. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty).

6. The AASM suggests using low-flow oxygen over no low-flow oxygen in adults with CSA due to high altitude. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

Remarks: Patients with transient and mild CSA symptoms at high altitude may reasonably decline treatment with low-flow oxygen.

7. The AASM suggests using oral acetazolamide over no acetazolamide in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA, CSA due to heart failure, CSA due to medication or substance use, treatment-emergent CSA, and CSA due to a medical condition or disorder. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty).

8. The AASM suggests using oral acetazolamide over no acetazolamide in adults with CSA due to high altitude. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

9. The AASM suggests using transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (TPNS) over no TPNS in adults with CSA due to the following etiologies: primary CSA and CSA due to heart failure. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty).

Remark: Given that TPNS requires an invasive procedure, is not universally accessible, and is associated with high costs, it may be more appropriate to consider other treatments first.

Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — endogeneity in observational assessments of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effects is defined in the relationship between treatment and outcome as an association between the treatment and error term (ε), expressed as Y = βT + ε; randomized trials avoid endogeneity because random allocation is not associated with the error term. The workshop focused on four methods to address endogeneity — propensity score, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences — and described propensity-based designs that calculate an individual's probability of treatment by incorporating confounders and precision variables.

### Effect of sleep apnoea interventions on multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114NLKyo]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent chronic disease affecting nearly one billion people aged 30–69 years worldwide.OSA is characterised by the repetitive occurrence of partial (hypopnoeas) or complete (apnoeas) pharyngeal collapses during sleep. In addition to causing symptoms such as sleepiness, fatigue and impaired mood, untreated OSA is associated with serious health consequences including cardiometabolic diseases, neurocognitive dysfunction, and early mortality. The substantial individual, societal and health systems burden of OSA mean that it is essential to provide effective therapies to mitigate the condition's overall impact on both individual quality of life (QoL) and health-related costs.

According to current guidelines, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) represents the first-line therapy for moderate to severe OSA. The efficacy of CPAP is well established in terms of improvement in symptoms and quality of life. However, the real-world effectiveness of CPAP is reduced by challenges in maintaining long-term adherence and high rates of therapy termination. Recent approaches to improving the treatment of OSA include the identification of specific disease phenotypes and endotypes, which have highlighted the importance of holistic and personalised approaches to OSA management. A key feature of these approaches is the incorporation of alternatives to CPAP therapy that may be more effective in some specific OSA subtypes due to greater patient acceptance.

The most widely used alternative interventions include mandibular advancement devices (MADs), positional therapy, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oropharyngeal myofunctional therapy (OMT), different approaches to weight loss, physical activity, hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS)and, more recently, wakefulness-promoting agentsand glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. Furthermore, there is growing awareness of the need to combine intervention modalities.

The effectiveness of treatment for OSA is primarily evaluated by assessment of sleep study data, including parameters such as the apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI), which reflects the number of abnormal respiratory events during sleep. Other important study endpoints include daytime sleepiness (evaluated using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), quality of life (QoL), and intermediate and objective cardiovascular outcomes such as blood pressure (BP).

Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

CPAP trial safety strategies and exclusion thresholds — prior long-term trials (PREDICT, BestAIR, SAVE) "excluded patients at high risk for harm related to pathologic sleepiness", and BestAIR and SAVE "excluded those with severe excessive daytime sleepiness, defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score greater than 14 or 15"; these exclusions "were met by 13.4%, 9.0%, and 1.5% of screened individuals in PREDICT, BestAIR, and SAVE, respectively", with staff following patients "at regular intervals", and "after at least 1 year of follow-up" accident rates did not differ between CPAP and control; in APPLES, "none of the 542 participants… experienced a motor vehicle accident over the course of 6 months", and in SAVE, participants developing "Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 15" often had non-OSA causes that "could be mitigated", with digital technologies noted as an opportunity to streamline surveillance.

### Alternatives to continuous positive airway pressure 2: mandibular advancement devices compared [^111pU4Em]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although mandibular advancement devices (MADs) provide an alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), their effectiveness and role remain unclear. Several recent studies and an updated meta-analysis have attempted to address these uncertainties. This review examines their contribution to the existing evidence and discusses the future priorities for MAD research.

Recent Findings

Recent work has examined the impact of MAD design on clinical and cost-effectiveness in milder disease. A robust comparison of CPAP and MADs in more severe OSA has reported equivalent improvements in several important health outcomes. Other notable contributions have examined compliance, definitions of treatment success and longer term outcomes of MAD therapy.

Summary

There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that MADs are a clinically and cost-effective treatment for OSA; and in some cases, patient preference may make them a better option than CPAP. Further work needs to continue to refine MAD therapy in order to optimize treatment response and compliance, whilst retaining a pragmatic and cost-effective approach that is relevant to clinical practice and sustainable in the longer term.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) trial-based cost-effectiveness design should include important elements: treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction with the care path should be considered, relative wait times and the number of lost, technically unsatisfactory, and/or equivocal studies should be recorded with criteria, objective measures of treatment response should include change in AHI/respiratory disturbance index (RDI), oxygenation and, when available, changes in measures of sleep structure, and objective adherence to CPAP treatment is an essential outcome measure with the software and thresholds used to determine adequate adherence clearly specified. The design of clinical trials should include plans for robust follow-up of participants to minimize missing data due to the loss to follow-up, it is also important to continue data collection and follow-up until the end of the study period and not discontinue data collection because a subject reaches a clinical or treatment stage such as failure to respond, and trial-based cost-effectiveness analyses should adopt an intent-to-treat design.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: a review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^111z5rAJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Upper airway surgery is designed to address anatomic airway obstruction in the upper airway and consists of a variety of different techniques. Individual surgical procedures may be classified as nasal, upper pharyngeal, lower pharyngeal, or global upper airway depending on the anatomic level at which obstruction is targeted. Many patients have obstructive anatomy at multiple sites and require multilevel surgical correction, in which several procedures are performed either simultaneously or in a staged manner. Surgery can be considered as primary therapy for patients with primary snoring with OSA, in patients with mild‐to‐moderate OSA where they may supersede oral appliances, and in cases of obstructive anatomy where surgery would be considered highly effective, and as secondary therapy for patients with OSA who experience inadequate response to or cannot tolerate PAP therapy. 39

Surgery is an effective management option for the treatment of OSA, with reported polysomnographic success rates (generally defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in AHI to an AHI value ≤ 20) of 35% to 83% in the literature. 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 Limitations of the reported efficacy in the literature include significant heterogeneity of surgical technique as well as patient selection based on individual anatomic characteristics and surgeon preference. An overview of the different types of surgical procedures used to treat OSA along with reported efficacy of each technique is presented in Table 4. 50 One particular form of surgery, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, has a growing body of literature supporting its efficacy. The STAR (Stimulation Treatment for Apnea Reduction) trial enrolled 126 patients with moderate‐to‐severe OSA who had difficulty adhering to CPAP and surgically implanted hypoglossal simulators. 51 After 18 months, there was a 68% reduction in median AHI as well as improved scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire with only 2 serious adverse events reported throughout the trial. 52

Risks of upper airway surgery include those inherent to any surgical procedure such as bleeding, infection, and complications related to anesthesia. The latter category as well as perioperative cardiovascular complications are known to be higher in patients with OSA as compared with the general surgical population. 53, 54 Additional risks vary according to the specific procedural technique utilized and include, but are not limited to, airway compromise, dysphagia, local anesthesia or paresis, vocal changes, globus sensation, and taste changes. 55

### Three-year outcomes of cranial nerve stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea: the STAR trial [^116dpGrE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the 36-month clinical and polysomnography (PSG) outcomes in an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cohort treated with hypoglossal cranial nerve upper airway stimulation (UAS).

Study Design

A multicenter prospective cohort study.

Setting

Industry-supported multicenter academic and clinical setting.

Subjects

Participants (n = 116) at 36 months from a cohort of 126 implanted participants.

Methods

Participants were enrolled in a prospective phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of UAS for moderated to severe OSA. Prospective outcomes included apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, other PSG measures, self-reported measures of sleepiness, sleep-related quality of life, and snoring.

Results

Of 126 enrolled participants, 116 (92%) completed 36-month follow-up evaluation per protocol; 98 participants additionally agreed to a voluntary 36-month PSG. Self-report daily device usage was 81%. In the PSG group, 74% met the a priori definition of success with the primary outcomes of apnea-hypopnea index, reduced from the median value of 28.2 events per hour at baseline to 8.7 and 6.2 at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Similarly, self-reported outcomes improved from baseline to 12 months and were maintained at 36 months. Soft or no snoring reported by bed partner increased from 17% at baseline to 80% at 36 months. Serious device-related adverse events were rare, with 1 elective device explantation from 12 to 36 months.

Conclusion

Long-term 3-year improvements in objective respiratory and subjective quality-of-life outcome measures are maintained. Adverse events are uncommon. UAS is a successful and appropriate long-term treatment for individuals with moderate to severe OSA.

### Hypoglossal nerve stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JBYwe]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Apnex, Inspire, and ImThera hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) devices in changing the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Method

ology: A systematic search was conducted across the databases to collect baseline and postoperative outcome measures. Articles were then filtered and data from post-filtration was extracted. The efficacy of each device was assessed individually, and the reported outcomes were analyzed at short-term (≤ 1 year) and long-term (> 1 year) intervals.

Results

A total of 30 papers were included; 26 were single-arm studies encompassing 549 middle-aged overweight patients. Four RCTs included 273 participants. Results show that HGNS is an effective and safe treatment option. The Inspire device significantly improved, reducing the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by -20.14 events/h in the short term and -15.91 events/h in the long term. It also decreased the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) by -14.16 events/h (short term) and -12.95 events/h (long term). Patient-reported outcomes showed decreased Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores by -5.02 (short term) and -4.90 (long term) and improved Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) scores by 3.58 (short term) and 3.28 (long term). The Apnex and the ImThera devices featured similar improvements but to a lesser extent.

Conclusion

Hypoglossal nerve stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with OSA, exhibiting high adherence and satisfaction rates. However, it is important to note the potential for refining selection criteria to include a wider spectrum of patients with OSA.

### Effect of sleep apnoea interventions on multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^117M3qse]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent chronic condition that is associated with cardiometabolic and neurocognitive complications. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the first-line therapy, suboptimal adherence limits its effectiveness, highlighting the need to evaluate alternatives such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs), hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), physical activity, different modalities of weight loss management including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and combination therapies.

Methods

We conducted an umbrella review to synthesise high-level evidence from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy, adherence, and safety of therapies used in patients with OSA. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews covering the period from January 1, 2017, to July 5, 2025. Eligible studies were meta-analyses published in English assessing interventions targeting key OSA outcomes, including changes in apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life (QoL), blood pressure (BP), treatment adherence, and safety. When multiple meta-analyses addressed the same intervention-outcome pair, the one including the highest number of RCTs was retained. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Meta-analyses published in languages other than English, those focusing on paediatric populations or interventions outside the scope of conventional OSA management, and meta-analyses that did not report any of the pre-specified outcomes/interventions of interest were excluded. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420729) and the Open Science Framework.

Findings

A total of 5571 meta-analyses were identified. Of these, 34 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 230 RCTs and 36,353 participants (n = 26,058 [72.3%] male). GRADE assessment showed that 12 meta-analyses (35%) had evidence that was of low certainty, 23 (68%) provided moderate-certainty evidence, and only one (3%) provided evidence that was of high certainty. CPAP was the most effective treatment for reducing AHI (mean difference [MD] −30.7 events/h; standardised mean difference [SMD] −1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.87 to −1.43; low-certainty evidence), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (tirzepatide: MD –21.86 events/h; SMD –0.84, 95% CI –1.01 to −0.68; moderate-certainty evidence) and MADs (MD –11.91 events/h; SMD –0.73, 95% CI –14.25 to −9.75; low-certainty evidence). CPAP, wake stimulants, HNS, and myofunctional therapy significantly reduced daytime sleepiness (ESS score SMDs of −0.80 to −0.88; moderate-certainty evidence except for pitolisant and solriamfetol, which were supported by high-certainty evidence). Physical activity led to the greatest improvements in QoL (SMD 1.3, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.02; moderate-certainty evidence), while CPAP also showed modest benefits (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.21; critically low-certainty evidence).

Interpretation

This umbrella review identified CPAP as the most effective intervention for reducing AHI and daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA, while physical activity yielded the greatest improvements in quality of life. Data on safety, long-term adherence, and combination therapies remain scarce, underscoring the need for more comparative and longitudinal research to support personalised treatment strategies. Data need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations, including those relating to the meta-analysis inclusion criteria and the quality of data in the meta-analyses themselves.

### Obstructive sleep apnea therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction-time for a rethink? [^111aD6qo]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by repetitive upper airway collapse. In recent years, the prevalence of OSA has increased due to the obesity epidemic and population aging. It is estimated that up to 36% of the general population and 40%–80% of patients with cardiovascular disease have moderate‐to‐severe OSA (apnea‐hypopnea index ≥ 15 events/h).OSA is an important public health challenge due to its association with excessive daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and various manifestations of metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), with positive airway pressure applied through a nasal or oronasal interface to splint the upper airway open, is the mainstay of therapy for OSA. CPAP is effective in ameliorating OSA‐associated sleepiness. Moreover, epidemiological data have demonstrated that patients with OSA who use CPAP have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events than nonusers. Similarly, randomized trials have shown the benefits of CPAP in improving surrogate markers such as blood pressure (BP), inflammation, and endothelial function. However, randomized controlled trials have failed to verify the benefits of CPAP in reducing cardiovascular events.

Various explanations for these conflicting findings have been proposed. These include poor CPAP adherence among trial participants who did not experience excessive daytime sleepiness, limited ability of the apnea–hypopnea index (the conventional measure of OSA severity) to risk‐stratify patients with OSA, and the trials being underpowered. Consequently, a panel discussion on long‐term outcome research in OSA was held during the SLEEP 2021 meeting, in which many suggestions were proposed; these included (i) adopting different study designs, (ii) replacing the apnea–hypopnea index with novel indexes to better identify at‐risk individuals, and (iii) exploring alternative therapies, such as a mandibular advancement device (MAD) (Figure 1). In this review article, we summarize the impact of OSA on cardiovascular disease and the potential of MADs in improving cardiovascular outcomes. Our narrative review complements recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses and provides a comprehensive overview on MADs for cardiologists who do not have practical experience with the device.

### Sleep apnea: state of the art [^112HXYQs]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Many patient with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease have sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which can be either obstructive (with intermittent collapse of the upper airway) or central (episodic loss of respiratory drive). SDB is associated with sleep disturbance, hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes, and sympathetic activation. Such patients have a worse prognosis than those without SDB. Mask-based therapies of positive airway pressure targeted at SDB can improve measures of sleep quality and partially normalize the sleep and respiratory physiology, but recent randomized trials of cardiovascular outcomes in SDB have either been neutral (obstructive sleep apnea) or suggested the possibility of harm, likely from increased sudden death, in central sleep apnea. Alternative methods for the treatment of SDB are being explored, including implantable technologies, but these have not been studied in adequately powered randomized controlled studies. International guidelines recommend screening for SDB, which can be done easily in clinical practice, as there may be a role for the treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, or resistant hypertension, or atrial fibrillation. Further randomised outcome studies are required to determine whether mask-based treatment for SDB is appropriate for patients with chronic systolic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea; for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and for those with decompensated heart failure. The case is made that no longer can the surrogate endpoints of improvement in respiratory and sleep metrics be taken as adequate therapeutic outcome measures in patients with sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.

Recommendations

Question 1: Should children with persistent OSA be treated with CPAP?

Background

CPAP has traditionally been the default treatment option for pediatric OSA (both surgically naive and after AT). When used appropriately and consistently, it is effective in improving OSA-related symptoms, disease severity (as measured by the oAHI), sleep architecture, and sleep quality, and mitigating neurocognitive and behavioral sequelae. The impact of treatment on blood pressure, cardiovascular stress, and metabolic dysfunction is less certain.

Barriers to CPAP include poor adherence due to mask fit/side effects from wear, and intolerance to pressure. Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of persistent OSA as alternate treatment options have emerged and gained favor in children who do not tolerate or are not ideal candidates for CPAP. For children with persistent OSA who have surgically modifiable sites of upper airway obstruction, surgery may improve or resolve OSA — an appealing tradeoff to CPAP, which is often a long-term or lifelong commitment to therapy. However, long-term data regarding surgical outcomes, as well as ongoing CPAP compliance, are needed to best inform these decisions. Considering this, we focused on the use of CPAP, to determine whether therapy impacts critical and important outcomes.

### Telemedicine interventions for CPAP adherence in obstructive sleep apnea patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NSfet]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the preferred therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, data suggests treatment adherence is low. In recent years, telemedicine-based intervention (TM) has been evaluated to increase adherence. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we evaluated the efficacy of TM on CPAP adherence in patients with OSA. Two independent reviewers explored five databases; the risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Cochrane tool. Outcomes were defined as the mean difference (MD) in CPAP use per night and the proportion of patients with increased CPAP adherence of ≥ 4 h/night. The meta-analysis was conducted following the DerSimonian-Laird method, and the certainty of the evidence was rated according to GRADE. We included 16 RCTs including 3039 participants. The RoB was low in 12/16 studies. TM was associated with an increase in CPAP adherence of 29.2 min/night, I² = 75% (p < 0.01), and CPAP adherence ≧4 h/night, RR: 1.09 (1.02–1.17), I² = 22%. Subgroup analyses reported better results between three and 6 months, in the sleepy subgroup. Finally, based on the results obtained in this systematic review, there is favorable evidence regarding the treatment with TM in patients with OSA using CPAP.

ACP high-value care for adult OSA emphasizes targeting and assessing treatment by symptoms and avoiding low-value options: "Clinicians should target evaluation and treatment of OSA to patients with unexplained daytime sleepiness". "Assessment of effectiveness is based primarily on improvement of daytime sleepiness; however, the effect on other clinical outcomes, including hypertension, cardiovascular events, and deaths, is uncertain". "Adherence to therapies, especially CPAP, is important for effective OSA treatment". "Clinicians should keep patient preferences and adherence, specific reasons for nonadherence, and costs in mind before initiating CPAP". "They should encourage weight loss in obese patients because obesity is associated with increased OSA risk and has many other health benefits". "Pharmacologic therapy is not currently supported by evidence and should not be prescribed for OSA treatment". For surgery, "Current evidence evaluating surgery was limited and insufficient to show the benefits of surgery as treatment of OSA and thus should not be used as initial treatment".

Split-night study — CPAP outcomes — Across three studies comparing split-night versus full-night continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration, one study in upper airway resistance syndrome found no difference in CPAP titration success defined as respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA) index < 5 on final CPAP settings; a cross-over study showed no significant difference in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), arousal index, and percentage of sleep time with oxygen saturation below 90% on CPAP, though final CPAP pressure was lower with split-night titration (8.8 versus 10.3 cm H2O); and another study found no clinically significant difference in CPAP adherence (78.7%) versus full-night with follow-up titration (77.5%). A meta-analysis of two studies performed by the task force comparing reduction of AHI after CPAP with split-night PSG versus full-night PSG found no clinically significant difference, and the quality of evidence for CPAP outcomes was downgraded to low due to imprecision and small sample size.

### Results of the ADHERE upper airway stimulation registry and predictors of therapy efficacy [^116WAxFi]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

The ADHERE Registry is a multicenter prospective observational study following outcomes of upper airway stimulation (UAS) therapy in patients who have failed continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of this registry and purpose of this article were to examine the outcomes of patients receiving UAS for treatment of OSA.

Study Design

Cohort Study.

Methods

Demographic and sleep study data collection occurred at baseline, implantation visit, post‐titration (6 months), and final visit (12 months). Patient and physician reported outcomes were also collected. Post hoc univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of therapy response, defined as ≥ 50% decrease in Apnea‐Hypopnea Index (AHI) and AHI ≤ 20 at the 12‐month visit.

Results

The registry has enrolled 1,017 patients from October 2016 through February 2019. Thus far, 640 patients have completed their 6‐month follow‐up and 382 have completed the 12‐month follow‐up. After 12 months, median AHI was reduced from 32.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 23.6–45.0) to 9.5 (IQR, 4.0–18.5); mean, 35.8 ± 15.4 to 14.2 ± 15.0, P < .0001. Epworth Sleepiness Scale was similarly improved from 11.0 (IQR, 7–16) to 7.0 (IQR, 4–11); mean, 11.4 ± 5.6 to 7.2 ± 4.8, P < .0001. Therapy usage was 5.6 ± 2.1 hours per night after 12 months. In a multivariate model, only female sex and lower baseline body mass index remained as significant predictors of therapy response.

Conclusions

Across a multi‐institutional study, UAS therapy continues to show significant improvement in subjective and objective OSA outcomes. This analysis shows that the therapy effect is durable and adherence is high.

### What are the predictors of success with hypoglossal nerve stimulation? [^111Xhr53]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects up to 4% of the adult population. Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) was approved by the FDA in 2014 as a treatment option for patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP and, since that time, studies have focused on predicting response to this therapy. This review summarizes the relevant literature assessing factors that predict HNS success including therapeutic response and device adherence.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116qGjpJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) guideline background — classification and evidence limitations highlights that current CSA classification relies on clinical presentation rather than underlying pathophysiology, with polysomnographic criteria, particularly hypopnea scoring, inconsistently applied and seldom utilized in reviewed studies. Treatment options targeting specific mechanistic pathways are limited, and these challenges have impeded progress for decades, narrowing treatment options. The guideline notes limitations in the quantity, quality, and variability of available studies because CSA is less common and less well understood than obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and recent clinical trials in both CSA and OSA failed to demonstrate survival benefits, although intermediate outcomes such as quality of life and sleepiness improved with treatment. To address limited evidence and shared mechanisms, the task force aimed to group studies evaluating similar treatments across CSA subtypes and reviewed both individual and grouped data to strengthen assessment of treatment effectiveness. The guideline and its accompanying systematic review provide a comprehensive update intended to optimize patient-centric care.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^113Ta2sb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of positive airway pressure therapies (PAP), non-PAP therapies, and pharmacological treatment to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical meaningfulness of using various interventions to treat CSA in adults. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

Results

The literature search resulted in 6,701 articles out of which 103 articles provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy benefit patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129jmUF]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The use of CPAP, compared to usual care, was associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or death in patients with OSA and CAD, particularly in the subgroup with AHI less than 30 events/h. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of CPAP for prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

Data Collection

The registry enrolls adult participants who meet the approved indications of UAS including AHI between 15 to 65 events per hour inclusive, who are intolerant to CPAP, and who are free of complete concentric collapse during sedated endoscopy. Following baseline and implant data collection, the registry collects information from two clinical visits during post‐implantation follow‐up: the post‐titration visit, approximately 6 months post‐implantation, and the final visit, approximately 12 months post‐implantation.

During the post‐implantation visits, study investigators determine OSA severity by AHI via either an in‐lab attended polysomnography or a type 3 home sleep apnea test, daytime sleepiness as reported by participants using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and objective therapy use of hours per night from data stored in the IPG.

Data Analysis

The AHI and ESS distributions were tested for normality using the Shapiro‐Wilk test, with a significance level of 0.05. We compared outcome measures of AHI and ESS from the final visit with the baseline using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test with continuity correction, with a type I error rate of > 0.05. Results are presented as median and mean ± standard deviation. Post hoc logistic regression analyses included a model of all potential predictors of treatment success using Sher criteria, 9 defined as ≥ 50% reduction to AHI ≤ 20. Sensitivity analysis to two other definitions of AHI therapy success, defined ≥ 50% reduction to AHI < 10, and AHI < 10, was performed to confirm the robustness of the predictor findings. Age, sex, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline AHI, therapy usage per week per week at 6 and 12 months, binary therapy use (< 28 hours vs. ≥ 28 hours) at 6 and 12 months, and tongue‐motion phenotype at implantation were entered into the model as potential predictors. An additional multivariate model with stepwise selection was used to reduce the model to retain only significant parameters to assess for predictors of the therapy. Sex, baseline BMI, and binary therapy use (< 28 hours vs ≥ 28 hours) at final follow‐up were entered into the model in the first, second, and third step. No other variable met the χ 2 score of 0.2 significance level for entry into the model. The significance level of the Wald χ 2 for an effect to stay in the model is 0.05. An odds ratio (OR) < 1 indicates success is less likely, whereas an OR > 1 indicates success is more likely. A P value < .05 is considered statistically significant.

### Clinical practice guideline for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring with oral appliance therapy: an update for 2015 [^113HYGFd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

4.2b recommendation — oral appliances as an option when CPAP is not tolerated or an alternative is preferred: We recommend that sleep physicians consider prescription of oral appliances, rather than no treatment, for adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea who are intolerant of CPAP therapy or prefer alternate therapy. Values and trade-offs note that CPAP is superior to OAs in the measured outcomes and, therefore, should be the first-line option for treating OSA, although a review of the evidence suggests that adherence rates using OAs are greater than those observed with CPAP and no randomized controlled trials have assessed objective OA adherence rate as compared with CPAP. OAs reduce AHI, arousal index, oxygen desaturation index, and increase oxygen saturation; however, OAs have no significant effect on sleep architecture and sleep efficiency, and the use of OAs in adult patients with OSA should result in an improvement in daily function and quality of life. Although OAs improve physiologic sleep parameters, CPAP appears, in both meta-analyses, to be superior to OAs in reducing the AHI, arousal index, and oxygen desaturation index and in improving oxygen saturation, and therefore should still generally be the first-line option for treating OSA. The available data regarding the impact of OAs on blood pressure are more limited than with CPAP, yet available data suggest that OAs may be as effective as CPAP in at least select patient populations to lower blood pressure.

Treatment Effects

After receiving the implant, AHI was reduced from 32.8 (interquartile range [IQR], 23.6–45.0) at baseline to 6.3 (IQR, 2–14.8) at 6 months, and 9.5 (IQR, 4.0–18.5) at 12 months (mean, 35.8 ± 15.4 at baseline to 11.0 ± 13.5 at 6 months and 14.2 ± 15.0 at 12 months, P < .001; Fig. 2). Using Sher criteria 9 on patients with baseline and follow‐up AHI data, 83% (n = 485/582) and 69% (n = 265/381) participants met treatment success after 6 and 12 months, respectively.

Similarly, participants reported reduced daytime sleepiness with ESS of 11.0 (IQR, 7.0–16.0) at baseline to 7.0 (IQR, 4.0–11.0) at 6 months and 6.0 (IQR, 3.0–10.0) at 12 months (mean, 11.4 ± 5.6 at baseline to 7.7 ± 4.8 at 6 months and 7.2 ± 4.8 at 12 months, P < .0001 comparing with baseline; Fig. 3). Using the normalizing threshold of ESS < 10, 10 37%, 67%, and 74% had normal daytime sleepiness at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post‐implantation.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The numbers of dichotomous outcomes were summarized and mean values with standard deviations were collated for continuous outcomes. For every included trial, we retrieved or calculated the RRs and HRs with 95% CIs for the assessed outcomes. Fixed‐effects models assume that there is a common underlying effect and the variability observed is attributed to chance alone; random‐effects models acknowledge that true between‐study heterogeneity exists and take into account the presence of heterogeneity into their calculations. In the absence of heterogeneity, fixed‐ and random‐effects models yield the same results. We summarized RR or HR with a random‐effects model first and changed to a fixed‐effects model if no between study heterogeneity was found for the random‐effects model. And I 2 statistic and was distinguished as low (I 2 less than or equal to 25%), moderate (I 2 less than 25% and more than 75%), or high (I 2 equal to or more than 75%), as was a p value of less than or equal to.05 for heterogeneity. Where there was a substantial heterogeneity (I 2 more than 50%), subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses was conducted for heterogeneity assessment. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to mean age, mean body mass index (BMI), mean AHI, OSA assessment, which might be potential mediators. In sensitivity analyses, we also excluded the following characteristics: (1) observational studies, (2) number of patients less than 200, (3) NOS score less than 9, (4) follow‐up duration no more than 36 months, and (5) lost to follow‐up rate more than 5%.

Funnel plots using the Egger test were visually assessed for publication bias. All tests were two‐tailed; p no more than.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata/SE version 15.1.

### Effect of sleep apnoea interventions on multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^11532UB2]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent chronic condition that is associated with cardiometabolic and neurocognitive complications. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the first-line therapy, suboptimal adherence limits its effectiveness, highlighting the need to evaluate alternatives such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs), hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), physical activity, different modalities of weight loss management including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and combination therapies.

Methods

We conducted an umbrella review to synthesise high-level evidence from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy, adherence, and safety of therapies used in patients with OSA. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews covering the period from January 1, 2017, to July 5, 2025. Eligible studies were meta-analyses published in English assessing interventions targeting key OSA outcomes, including changes in apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life (QoL), blood pressure (BP), treatment adherence, and safety. When multiple meta-analyses addressed the same intervention-outcome pair, the one including the highest number of RCTs was retained. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Meta-analyses published in languages other than English, those focusing on paediatric populations or interventions outside the scope of conventional OSA management, and meta-analyses that did not report any of the pre-specified outcomes/interventions of interest were excluded. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420729) and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2jvsx).

Findings

A total of 5571 meta-analyses were identified. Of these, 34 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 230 RCTs and 36,353 participants (n = 26,058 [72.3%] male). GRADE assessment showed that 12 meta-analyses (35%) had evidence that was of low certainty, 23 (68%) provided moderate-certainty evidence, and only one (3%) provided evidence that was of high certainty. CPAP was the most effective treatment for reducing AHI (mean difference [MD] -30.7 events/h; standardised mean difference [SMD] -1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.87 to -1.43; low-certainty evidence), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (tirzepatide: MD -21.86 events/h; SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.68; moderate-certainty evidence) and MADs (MD -11.91 events/h; SMD -0.73, 95% CI -14.25 to -9.75; low-certainty evidence). CPAP, wake stimulants, HNS, and myofunctional therapy significantly reduced daytime sleepiness (ESS score SMDs of -0.80 to -0.88; moderate-certainty evidence except for pitolisant and solriamfetol, which were supported by high-certainty evidence). Physical activity led to the greatest improvements in QoL (SMD 1.3, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.02; moderate-certainty evidence), while CPAP also showed modest benefits (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.21; critically low-certainty evidence).

Interpretation

This umbrella review identified CPAP as the most effective intervention for reducing AHI and daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA, while physical activity yielded the greatest improvements in quality of life. Data on safety, long-term adherence, and combination therapies remain scarce, underscoring the need for more comparative and longitudinal research to support personalised treatment strategies. Data need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations, including those relating to the meta-analysis inclusion criteria and the quality of data in the meta-analyses themselves.

Funding

None.

### Continuous positive airway pressure treatment of sleepy patients with milder obstructive sleep apnea: results of the CPAP apnea trial north American program (CATNAP) randomized clinical trial [^112DPmH6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Twenty-eight percent of people with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea experience daytime sleepiness, which interferes with daily functioning. It remains unclear whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure improves daytime function in these patients.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure treatment to improve functional status in sleepy patients with mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

Methods

Patients with self-reported daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 10) and an apnea-hypopnea index with 3% desaturation and from 5 to 30 events per hour were randomized to 8 weeks of active or sham continuous positive airway pressure treatment. After the 8-week intervention, participants in the sham arm received 8 weeks of active continuous positive airway pressure treatment.

Measurements and Main Results

The Total score on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire was the primary outcome measure. The adjusted mean change in the Total score after the first 8-week intervention was 0.89 for the active group (n = 113) and -0.06 for the placebo group (n = 110) (P = 0.006). The group difference in mean change corresponded to an effect size of 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.67). The mean (SD) improvement in Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire Total score from the beginning to the end of the crossover phase (n = 91) was 1.73 ± 2.50 (t[90] = 6.59; P < 0.00001) with an effect size of 0.69.

Conclusions

Continuous positive airway pressure treatment improves the functional outcome of sleepy patients with mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

### Clinical foundation for efficient treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111FLFUa]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Only a few decades ago, the entity known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was unknown and untreated. Now, there is a rush to put literally millions of Americans on continuous positive airway pressure devices. Community practice standards are changing yearly under pressure from strong forces based on economic incentives for industry, government, and physicians, independent of the actual medical evidence supporting treatment and efficacy. Medicare has lowered the diagnostic threshold for diagnosis and reimbursement; the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revision 2 (2005) has allowed OSA to be diagnosed exclusively by a laboratory test without the patient having clinical symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness; and industry is poised to have the public buy computer-assisted continuous positive airway pressure machines without need of a physician prescription. Because of this paradigm shift away from physician-directed diagnosis and treatment, this article will critically evaluate the present state of medical evidence regarding the clinical foundation for treatment of OSA.
