## Question

Frequency labs after gastric bypass

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended frequency of laboratory testing after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline sources to anchor the schedule. Then, I should verify the specific nutrients and tests that require monitoring and how often. Next, I will consider procedure-specific nuances and whether schedules differ by risk or stability. After that, I should review real-world adherence data to contextualize feasibility. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified schedule and note exceptions and special populations, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative sources so I don't jump to conclusions. The most recent ASMBS postoperative care pathway for RYGB provides explicit laboratory monitoring recommendations, and the VA/DoD guideline offers a structured timeline that many systems adopt, while the AACE/ASMBS 2019 update details micronutrient surveillance and iron monitoring cadence; these will be my primary anchors for frequency and content of labs [^fc398686] [^586d08ff] [^acb5299d].

> I should confirm the core principle before detailing tests. All major guidelines converge on lifelong, structured biochemical monitoring after RYGB to detect deficiencies early, with more frequent testing early postoperatively and spacing out once stable; this is because RYGB creates malabsorption and shifts in intake that evolve over time, so surveillance must be proactive and longitudinal [^fc398686] [^586d08ff] [^acb5299d].

> Now, let me verify the first-year cadence. ASMBS recommends that vitamin B12, folate, iron studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone be checked every 3 months until values are stable, which typically spans the first postoperative year; copper, zinc, selenium, and thiamine are added to that every-3-month schedule until stable, aligning with the higher malabsorption risk after RYGB [^fc398686] [^e3a802c7]. Wait, I initially thought "every 3 months for the entire first year regardless", but I should correct that: the intent is every 3 months until stable, which often means 3–4 checks in year 1, not necessarily 12 months of quarterly testing if stability is achieved earlier, though many programs continue quarterly through 12 months as a conservative approach [^fc398686].

> Next, I should review the long-term cadence once stable. After stability is achieved, ASMBS advises transitioning to every 6–12 months for the same micronutrients, with many clinicians defaulting to annual testing in routine follow-up; the VA/DoD schedule operationalizes labs at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months and then annually thereafter, which is consistent with this phased approach [^fc398686] [^586d08ff]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies broadly: yes, these timelines are for RYGB and reflect the malabsorptive component, whereas purely restrictive procedures may allow less frequent testing once stable, though many programs still use annual surveillance as standard [^fc398686] [^586d08ff].

> I will now examine the specific tests that must be included and why. Essential first-line monitoring after RYGB includes vitamin B12 with methylmalonic acid if needed, folate, a full iron panel (ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation, TIBC, and consider soluble transferrin receptor), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH to assess secondary hyperparathyroidism risk; CBC is used to screen for anemia and guide iron/B12 workups, and metabolic panels can be added as indicated for comorbidity surveillance [^fc398686] [^acb5299d] [^8ed08376]. Let me double-check the rationale for PTH: duodenal bypass reduces calcium absorption and, with low vitamin D, can drive secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone loss, so PTH and periodic DXA are part of long-term care [^8ed08376] [^97e01d0b].

> But wait, what about additional micronutrients that some guidelines mention. ASMBS includes copper, zinc, selenium, and thiamine in the early frequent schedule, and AACE advises annual screening for copper and zinc after RYGB; thiamine is particularly important if there is persistent vomiting or poor intake, given risk of Wernicke's, so I should flag that for symptomatic patients or those with poor dietary tolerance [^e3a802c7] [^a9ce6069] [^f4d83e4b]. I need to ensure I'm not over-ordering in stable, asymptomatic patients; indeed, some data suggest that in well-supplemented, low-risk patients, routine annual testing of every micronutrient may be low yield, but guidelines still endorse periodic surveillance given the consequences of missed deficiency [^d305168d] [^a9ce6069].

> Next, I should review real-world adherence to contextualize feasibility. Long-term data show that even in integrated systems, many patients do not receive recommended labs; at 5 years, large proportions lack vitamin D, PTH, and B12 testing, whether follow-up is in bariatric clinics or primary care, underscoring the need for embedded prompts and care pathways [^cc484628]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cost driving nonadherence; while cost and access contribute, system-level reminders and standardized orders can mitigate gaps, which is why many programs adopt order sets tied to visit schedules [^cc484628].

> I should confirm special populations and exceptions. Patients with preoperative deficiencies, poor adherence, chronic diarrhea, or high-risk anatomy (e.g., distal RYGB) warrant more frequent monitoring; pregnancy planning or pregnancy itself requires intensified surveillance given increased demands; and patients on medications that affect absorption or renal function may need individualized schedules and additional tests such as magnesium if clinically indicated [^b570cf85] [^8ed08376] [^8cf054ed]. Let me reconsider whether routine magnesium is needed; evidence does not support routine magnesium screening in asymptomatic RYGB patients on PPIs, so I should avoid reflex testing unless there are symptoms or interacting drugs [^04d845b7].

> I will now synthesize a practical, risk-stratified schedule. For a typical RYGB patient without major comorbidities, I recommend: every 3 months until stable in year 1 for B12, folate, iron panel, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, CBC, and add copper, zinc, selenium, and thiamine if symptomatic or if not already included; once stable, transition to every 6–12 months, with many programs choosing annually, alongside annual clinical review of symptoms, weight, and adherence; reserve more frequent checks for those with prior deficiencies, poor adherence, or symptoms [^fc398686] [^586d08ff]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "mandatory every 3 months for 12 months", but I should correct that to "until stable", which may be achieved before 12 months in some patients, though many centers continue quarterly through 12 months as a safeguard [^fc398686].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is actionable and communicated. Programs should standardize order sets aligned to visit schedules, embed prompts in the EMR, and provide patients with a written schedule and education on symptoms of deficiency; coordination with primary care and explicit handoffs improve long-term adherence and early detection of problems, which is repeatedly emphasized in multidisciplinary guidance [^cbfc3491] [^ed66e9cc]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with value-based care themes; yes, structured surveillance is associated with better outcomes and can be implemented efficiently to balance cost and safety when guided by risk-stratified testing rather than indiscriminate panels [^f5f12b29].

After gastric bypass, **labs every 3 months for the first year** [^fc398686] are recommended to detect and treat deficiencies early, then **every 6–12 months lifelong** [^e3a802c7] once stable. Early testing should include CBC, iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and selective micronutrients (copper, zinc, selenium, thiamine) [^fc398686] [^e3a802c7]. Frequency should be **individualized** for high-risk patients (e.g. preoperative deficiency, poor adherence, pregnancy, chronic diarrhea) [^b570cf85] [^2d71b547]. Routine labs are often missed in practice [^cc484628], so embedding a standardized schedule and patient education are essential [^cbfc3491].

## Recommended laboratory monitoring schedule

| **Timeframe** | **Recommended laboratory tests** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| First postoperative year | - Complete blood count (CBC) <br/> - Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, TIBC) <br/> - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate <br/> - 25-hydroxyvitamin D <br/> - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) <br/> - Copper <br/> - Zinc <br/> - Selenium <br/> - Thiamine (vitamin B1) | Every 3 months until stable [^fc398686] [^e3a802c7] |
| After first year (stable patients) | - CBC <br/> - Iron studies <br/> - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate <br/> - 25-hydroxyvitamin D <br/> - PTH <br/> - Copper <br/> - Zinc <br/> - Selenium <br/> - Thiamine | Every 6–12 months [^fc398686] [^e3a802c7] |
| High-risk patients (preoperative deficiency, poor adherence, pregnancy, chronic diarrhea) | - CBC <br/> - Iron studies <br/> - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate <br/> - 25-hydroxyvitamin D <br/> - PTH <br/> - Copper <br/> - Zinc <br/> - Selenium <br/> - Thiamine | More frequent (every 3–6 months) [^b570cf85] [^2d71b547] |

## Rationale for frequent laboratory monitoring

Frequent monitoring is necessary because gastric bypass alters gastrointestinal anatomy, reducing absorption of micronutrients and increasing deficiency risk [^2bf33057]. Early detection enables timely supplementation and prevents complications such as anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological deficits [^2bf33057].

---

## Specific nutritional deficiencies monitored

- **Iron deficiency**: Common after gastric bypass due to reduced absorption; monitored via CBC and iron studies [^acb5299d].
- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Occurs due to reduced intrinsic factor; monitored via serum B12 and methylmalonic acid [^99d5dfac].
- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Common due to reduced intake and absorption; monitored via 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH [^8ed08376].
- **Folate deficiency**: Monitored via serum folate [^fc398686].
- **Copper, zinc, selenium, and thiamine deficiencies**: Monitored selectively based on clinical presentation and risk factors [^e3a802c7] [^a9ce6069].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting monitoring frequency

Evidence supports frequent early monitoring to detect and treat deficiencies promptly [^d8ff72cc]. However, some studies suggest that routine testing may be excessive in stable, asymptomatic patients, supporting individualized approaches [^b570cf85] [^2d71b547].

---

## Challenges and adherence issues

Despite recommendations, adherence to scheduled lab monitoring is often poor, with many patients missing recommended tests [^cc484628]. This underscores the need for **patient education**, **reminder systems**, and **coordinated care** to improve adherence [^cbfc3491].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First year**: Labs every 3 months until stable [^fc398686].
- **After first year**: Labs every 6–12 months lifelong [^e3a802c7].
- **High-risk patients**: More frequent monitoring (every 3–6 months) [^b570cf85].
- **Essential tests**: CBC, iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, copper, zinc, selenium, thiamine [^fc398686] [^e3a802c7].

---

Regular laboratory monitoring after gastric bypass is essential to detect and manage nutritional deficiencies. The recommended frequency is **every 3 months in the first year**, then **every 6–12 months lifelong**, with individualized adjustments for high-risk patients.

### Frequency of laboratory testing among gastric bypass patients [^59e4fbca]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term laboratory monitoring is recommended after gastric bypass surgery to prevent the development of micronutrient deficiencies. The objective of this study was to characterize patterns of laboratory monitoring after surgery.

Methods

We used a large insurance claims database to assess the frequency of laboratory testing after gastric bypass surgery. We assessed the tests recommended by an expert panel on bariatric surgery, including tests recommended routinely as well as second-line tests for specific clinical scenarios (e.g., tests for anemia when iron deficiency is not present).

Results

With the exception of testing for diabetes, most gastric bypass patients did not undergo routine laboratory testing in the first year after their surgery, ranging from 54% (electrolytes) to 95% (zinc). However, for first-line tests, significantly more gastric bypass patients underwent testing in the first year,compared with gastric banding patients. Differences in testing frequency between gastric bypass and gastric banding patients were larger for tests of micronutrient deficiency than for common metabolic panels and complete blood counts. For second-line tests, much smaller percentages of both groups of patients underwent testing, either in the first year or after year 1.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing gastric bypass do not routinely undergo recommended laboratory tests, although they are undergoing more monitoring than gastric banding patients. Efforts must be made by patients, surgeons, and primary care providers to ensure that routine testing is done to lower the risk of adverse health outcomes.

Postoperative laboratory monitoring after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass—laboratory monitoring and micronutrient surveillance are recommended. Early postoperative labs (within 5 days) should include creatine kinase if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Vitamin B12, folic acid, iron studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone are evaluated every 3 months until stable, then every 6–12 months after.

### Monitoring of liver function tests after roux-en-Y gastric bypass: an examination of evidence base [^5571a37e]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the monitoring of liver function tests after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Since the main objective of such monitoring would be to diagnose early those who will eventually develop liver failure after RYGB, we performed a systematic review on this topic. An extensive search of literature revealed only 10 such cases in 6 published articles. It would hence appear that liver failure is a rare problem after RYGB. Routine lifelong monitoring of liver function tests is therefore unnecessary for otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Such monitoring should hence be reserved for high-risk groups, such as patients with liver cirrhosis, those undergoing extended limb/distal RYGB, patients with new illnesses, those abusing alcohol, those on hepatotoxic drugs and those presenting with a surgical complication.

Discussion

Laboratory testing is expensive. Reducing unnecessary lab tests is a potential mechanism for decreasing unnecessary and low-value expenditures in a healthcare environment that is focused on value-based care and cost containment. Our findings show that having one or more preoperative nutritional deficiencies is associated with an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies post bariatric surgery, consistent with prior research supporting the rule, “Preoperative deficiencies are prone to postoperative deficiency”. The initial step in determining the benefit and necessity of laboratory testing is an examination of lab results as per the recommended frequency/gold standard. Nationally there is an emphasis on value-based care, making it imperative that we try to identify which patients are at highest risk for nutritional abnormalities. This information would provide the basis to stratify the frequency of postoperative laboratory testing based on relevant risk factors, potentially adjusting current guidelines for nutritional testing post-bariatric procedures. The cost savings from decreasing the frequency of lab tests can be substantial and should be carefully examined if indeed lab results are providing limited actionable information.

Cost data in health care are largely variable and opaque. Understanding that reimbursement will vary and be less than total charges, the expense for laboratory testing following bariatric surgery is still substantial even if only a fraction of the total charge is realized at four time points for the initial postoperative year. Given the prevalence of obesity in the USA and the growing utilization of bariatric surgery as a treatment option, eliminating even one time point in the first year of follow-up could potentially result in millions of dollars of savings to the heath care system over time for this high volume procedure.

Our cohort of patients showed no significant difference in nutritional deficiencies between sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y. This suggests that the low incidence of nutrient deficiency is not attributed to the operation but more likely should be attributed to pre-existing comorbidities and medical history, specifically renal disease and prior surgery, and possibly to compliance with diet and vitamin supplementation postoperatively. There is also the question of the clinical relevance of these abnormalities and the potential undue burden being placed on patients in terms of both time and cost if the current level of postoperative lab testing is truly redundant. The level of nutritional deficiency in patients was often just below the threshold level, which likely yields no overt clinical manifestations or relevance. Therefore, many patients are likely to undergo unnecessary laboratory testing, thus expending unnecessary time and resources that do not benefit them, likely resulting in time off work and potentially lost income.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) postoperative radiology and laboratory studies—Programs should standardize postoperative laboratory testing based on patient condition, and no specific laboratory tests have been recommended. UGI X-ray series are advised based primarily on symptoms; despite high specificity and negative predictive value, sensitivity and positive predictive value are reportedly less than 50%, and routine use may delay treatment with a false negative. Selective CT scanning based on the clinical picture is supported, with meta-analysis showing higher sensitivity 91%–94% versus 49%–54% and positive predictive value 100% versus 54% compared to UGI series.

### Long-term micronutrient surveillance after gastric bypass surgery in an integrated healthcare system [^cc484628]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the United States is growing. While gastric bypass surgery is an important tool in the management of obesity, it requires lifelong metabolic monitoring and medical management. Data describing compliance with recommended laboratory follow-up are limited, particularly in long-term and primary care settings.

Objectives

To evaluate postoperative follow-up laboratory testing for patients after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).

Setting

Academic-affiliated community hospital.

Methods

A review of patients who underwent LRYGB from 2001 to 2016 was performed. The location of patients' follow-up care and compliance with recommended laboratory testing were determined from patient records. Compliance was analyzed at 1-year intervals.

Results

One thousand four hundred ninety patients underwent LRYGB. Five years after their surgical date, patients were more likely to follow-up with primary care than bariatric surgery clinic (369 versus 159 patients). At 5 years postoperative, 82%, 85%, and 68% of patients that followed-up with primary care did not have a vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or vitamin B12 test, respectively. Patients that followed-up in bariatric clinic were slightly more likely to have recommended labs completed. At 5 years postprocedure, 81%, 55%, and 48% did not have a vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or vitamin B12 test, respectively.

Conclusion

Most patients do not have the recommended laboratory testing completed, regardless of where their follow-up care occurred. This study identified a gap in long-term postoperative care for patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Further studies will be necessary to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence to recommended monitoring after LRYGB.

### Post-bariatric surgery lab tests: are they excessive and redundant? [^9169891c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) guidelines for postsurgical tests following bariatric procedures in the USA have remained unchanged for the last decade. The guidelines call for frequent and comprehensive labs that can equate to significant costs. While bariatric surgical procedures are able to effectively reduce the amount of caloric consumption through anatomic and physiologic alteration, nutritional deficiency can be an additional unintended result. To remedy the latter, patients are prescribed nutritional supplements and undergo a series of follow-up blood tests following bariatric surgery to detect potential nutritional deficiencies. It is also established that “Low vitamin concentrations can be caused by dietary and lifestyle habits, abnormal body composition, systematic inflammation, and chronic disease”, so detailed plans are available to guide vitamin and mineral supplementation post bariatric surgery, and regular blood testing for nutritional deficiencies is the standard of care.

The ASMBS guidelines recommend postoperative blood testing every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and annually thereafter regardless of the type of bariatric procedure performed. Despite procedural changes in bariatric procedures in recent decades, and other bariatric guidelines that recommend less frequent postoperative lab testing, the recommended testing frequencies have not changed in the USA. With 228,000 bariatric surgeries occurring annually in the USA, and with bariatric follow-up laboratory tests estimated to be roughly $1600, the value of frequent postoperative laboratory testing relative to cost is an appropriate question. A systematic review of micronutrient deficiencies following bariatric surgery found inconsistent results in the percentage deficit by nutritional lab. A recent study examined an algorithm that identified less frequent moderate deficiencies post bariatric surgery; the use of the algorithm was estimated to have a minimum cost saving of 14%.

Studies examining the appropriateness and effectiveness of specific laboratory tests for a defined population are increasingly common in the era of both patient-centered care and population health. The purpose of our study was to better understand the rate of nutritional deficiencies post bariatric surgery as the initial step in evaluating the current postsurgical lab guidelines. It is also important to examine how postsurgical nutritional status may differ for patients by bariatric procedure type.

### Interpretation of laboratory results after gastric bypass surgery: the effects of weight loss and time on 30 blood tests in a 5-year follow-up program [^d8ff72cc]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term follow-up with blood tests is essential for bariatric surgery to be a successful treatment for obesity and related co-morbidities. Adverse effects, deficiencies, and metabolic improvements need to be controlled.

Objective

We investigated the effects of time and weight loss on laboratory results in each postoperative phase after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB).

Setting

Bariatric center of excellence, general hospital, Netherlands.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated results of 30 blood tests, preoperatively and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after LRYGB. The 2019 Dutch bariatric chart was used to define weight loss responses as outstanding (>p[percentile curve]+1 SD), average (p+1 SD to p-1 SD), and poor (<p-1 SD). Results are presented with fifth and 95th percentile cutoff values per blood test for each of these 3 weight loss responses at each of the 4 postoperative time intervals. We used ANOVA to determine mutual relations.

Results

Results of 4835 patients were analyzed. Five-year follow-up was 58%. Blood levels of ferritin, mean-corpuscular-volume, thrombocytes, vitamin D, parathyroid-hormone, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), triglyceride, total-cholesterol, C-reactive-protein, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, alkaline-phosphatase, creatinine, vitamin B1, and total protein were related with weight loss response. All 30 blood tests were also related with time. For several blood tests, weight loss and time did not only influence median results, but also fifth and 95th percentile cutoff values. Many patients had better vitamin levels after the operation. We observed an increase of parathyroid-hormone and ongoing iron depletion up to 5 years post surgery.

Conclusions

Presenting results of 30 routine blood tests, including cutoff values based on fifth and 95th percentile, grouped by weight loss response and postoperative time interval after gastric bypass surgery is new. The elaborate tables and graphs could serve as practical guide for proper interpretation of laboratory results in postbariatric surveillance. Results underline the need for long-term follow-up, including blood tests.

### How sustained is roux-en-Y gastric bypass long-term efficacy?: roux-en-Y gastric bypass efficacy [^35032702]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients’ and methods

This was a retrospective observational cohort study. Data concerning patients (n = 601) submitted to bariatric surgery for obesity treatment with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m 2 with or without comorbidities, between January of 2003 and December of 2009, in a single centre based at a public hospital, who completed 10 years or more after surgery, was retrieved for analysis from our bariatric patients cohort. After excluding patients that died during follow-up time (n = 16) from the total number of patients with that underwent bariatric surgery, the remaining patients (n = 585) were invited to attend an outpatient in-hospital visit during the year of 2019. Clinical reassessment included a full medical history, physical examination and fasting blood collection for laboratory analysis. Patients that refused to come for an in-person office visit were excluded from the study. Among the eligible patients that attended the clinic (n = 313), only those submitted to RYGB surgery as primary intervention (n = 281) were considered for statistical analysis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Patient selection flowchart

This study was approved by the institutional ethical review board and all patients signed an informed consent document before conducting any study assessment and enrolment.

Surgical technique

The surgical procedure consisted of performing a standard RYGB with a variable biliopancreatic limb length (50–200) and a constant 120 cm alimentary limb length as previous reported.

Routine post-operative follow-up

After bariatric surgery, all patients were instructed to maintain lifelong multivitamin and vitamin D supplements. Post-operative follow-up consisted of multidisciplinary office visits until the 3rd year after surgery, followed by management by the general practitioner thereafter. Standard post-RYGB supplementation protocol consisted of multivitamin/mineral preparation chewable tablets according to the ASMBS Guidelines recommendations, for lifelong and vitamin D doses adapted to individual patient needs.

### Post-bariatric surgery lab tests: are they excessive and redundant? [^13bb558f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Following bariatric surgery, ongoing postoperative testing is required to measure nutritional deficiencies; the purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of these nutritional deficiencies based on two-year follow-up tests at recommended time points.

Methods and Procedures

A retrospective data analysis was conducted of all laboratory tests for bariatric patients who underwent surgery between May 2016 and January 2018 with available lab data (n=397). Results for nine different nutritional labs were categorized into six recommended postoperative time periods based on time elapsed since the procedure date. Binary variables were created for each laboratory result to calculate descriptive statistics of abnormalities for each lab test over time and used in the individual GEE logistic regression models. Grouped logistic regression examined the total nutritional deficiencies of the nine combined nutrients considering total available labs.

Results

Multiple lab tests indicated a very low frequency of abnormalities (e.g., Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Copper, and Folate). Many of the nine included nutritional labs had an average deficiency of less than 10% across all time points. The grouped logistic model found preoperative nutritional deficiency to be predictive of postoperative nutritional deficiency (OR 3.70, p <0.001).

Conclusions

We found the vast majority of routine lab test results to be normal at multiple time points. Current practice can add up to significant lab expenses over time. The frequency of postoperative testing in this population may be redundant and of very little value. Unnecessary follow-up laboratory testing costs the patients and the health care system in both time and resources. Patients with preoperative deficiencies appear to be at higher risk for nutritional deficiencies when compared to bariatric surgery patients that did not have preoperative nutritional deficiencies. Future research should focus on defining cost effective postoperative lab testing guidelines for at risk bariatric patients.

### SAGES guideline for clinical application of laparoscopic bariatric surgery [^d7cfa25f]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Preoperative medical evaluation for bariatric surgery—assessment components include history, laboratory testing, and organ-specific evaluations: medical assessment prior to bariatric surgery is similar to abdominal operations of the same magnitude, with thorough history and physical examination used to identify comorbidities and consultation with a medical subspecialist often necessary to optimize conditions to reduce perioperative risk. Routine laboratory evaluation typically includes complete blood count, metabolic profile, coagulation profile, lipid profile, thyroid function tests, and ferritin, and vitamin B12 and fat-soluble vitamin levels may be evaluated if considering a malabsorptive procedure. Cardiovascular evaluation includes electrocardiogram and possible stress test to identify occult coronary artery disease, respiratory evaluation may include chest X-ray, arterial blood gas, and pulmonary function tests, sleep apnea may be diagnosed by sleep study with the patient started on continuous positive airway pressure prior to surgery, and upper endoscopy may be used if suspicion of gastric pathology exists.

### Nutritional deficiencies after bariatric surgery [^2bf33057]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle intervention programmes often produce insufficient weight loss and poor weight loss maintenance. As a result, an increasing number of patients with obesity and related comorbidities undergo bariatric surgery, which includes approaches such as the adjustable gastric band or the 'divided' Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This Review summarizes the current knowledge on nutrient deficiencies that can develop after bariatric surgery and highlights follow-up and treatment options for bariatric surgery patients who develop a micronutrient deficiency. The major macronutrient deficiency after bariatric surgery is protein malnutrition. Deficiencies in micronutrients, which include trace elements, essential minerals, and water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, are common before bariatric surgery and often persist postoperatively, despite universal recommendations on multivitamin and mineral supplements. Other disorders, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, can promote micronutrient deficiencies, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. Recognition of the clinical presentations of micronutrient deficiencies is important, both to enable early intervention and to minimize long-term adverse effects. A major clinical concern is the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the development of metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis or osteomalacia; metabolic bone diseases may explain the increased risk of hip fracture in patients after RYGB. Further studies are required to determine the optimal levels of nutrient supplementation and whether postoperative laboratory monitoring effectively detects nutrient deficiencies. In the absence of such data, clinicians should inquire about and treat symptoms that suggest nutrient deficiencies.

### Importance of nutrition visits after gastric bypass surgery for American veterans, san francisco, 2004-2010 (...) [^731ce9f9]. CDC (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Introduction Nutrition counseling is important for veterans undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the number of nutrition visits a patient attended and change in body mass index after gastric bypass surgery for the veteran population. Methods A retrospective study examined veterans who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery from June 2004 through July 2010. Spearman’s correlation and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze data. Surgical treatment of obesity is more effective and produces longer lasting outcomes than medication therapy or counseling. More than 250, 000 bariatric procedures were performed in the United States in 2008, and that number will continue to increase.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery has become the gold standard among bariatric surgeries, and it is the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States and all over the world. Nutrition care before surgery, during the hospital stay, and after surgery is important for the quality of life of the patient and the success of the surgery. There are no set evidence-based guidelines on the postsurgery nutrition follow-up schedule, which differs from institution to institution. Current VA guidelines recommend that patients have 2 to 4 nutrition visits presurgery and 2 to 3 visits during hospital stay. Furthermore, nutrition appointments should be scheduled at 1 to 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery, and then annually afterwards.

Patients require a lifetime of nutritional follow-up to have a good quality of life, because bariatric surgery patients are at risk of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies following surgery.
- During the 2 years after surgery, the mean number of nutrition encounters was 3 visits
- According to other recent studies, which of the following statements about the association between the number of nutrition visits that a patient attended and change in BMI after gastric bypass surgery is. correct.
- Current Veterans Affairs guidelines recommend nutrition visits at 1 to 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery, and annually thereafter
- Bariatric surgery patients are not at increased risk for malnutrition after surgery
- Bariatric surgery patients are not at increased risk for micronutrient deficiencies after surgery.

### Morbid obesity and gastric bypass surgery: biochemical profile [^dada92ae]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Morbid obesity (MO) and the pathologies associated with it constitute an important public health problem, accounting for 7% of the health expenditure in industrialized countries. An important percentage of this expense is attributed to the different biochemical tests performed in these patients, who suffer from several metabolic derangements. We evaluated the basic biochemical abnormalities in MO patients and their reversibility by weight loss after gastric bypass, to standardize the surveillance of the different metabolic abnormalities in obese patients.

Methods

By a retrospective analysis on 125 patients operated in our hospital, we evaluated anthropometric and biochemical data before and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after gastric bypass.

Results

Preoperatively hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertensive disease were present, and began to improve 1 and 3 months after surgery (although not significantly) and significantly at 6, 12 and 24 months after it. We also observed deficient protein nutrition and a deficiency of micronutrients both before bypass and during the follow-up.

Conclusion

After gastric bypass, a marked decrease in insulin occurred, with normalization of blood pressure and the biochemical parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome. We propose a biochemical follow-up protocol for MO patients.

### Iron deficiency-not only a premenopausal topic after bariatric surgery? [^ef74d331]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Iron deficiency after gastric bypass surgery is very common highlighting that optimized protocols for iron supplementation are needed. Also men and women before and after menopause differ in terms of their iron needs. The high prevalence of iron deficiency in postmenopausal women in this study that is similar to the one of the premenopausal women indicates that there should be put greater focus on this former cohort.

The prevalence of excess ferritin levels is very small at all observed time points and groups and decreases over time, even when getting high amounts of iron; therefore, iron over-supplementation does not appear to be a major problem after gastric bypass surgery. However, further randomized studies on dosing regimens of iron supplementation should be conducted to develop exact recommendations for men and women before and after menopause.

### Obesity surgery: evidence-based guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) [^99acd383]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity together with the development of laparoscopic approaches has led to a steep rise in the number of bariatric operations. These guidelines intend to define the comparative effectiveness and surrounding circumstances of the various types of obesity surgery.

Methods

A consensus panel representing the fields of general/endoscopic surgery, nutrition and epidemiology convened to agree on specific questions in obesity surgery. Databases were systematically searched for clinical trial results in order to produce evidence-based recommendations. Following two days of discussion by the experts and a plenary discussion, the final statements were issued.

Recommendations

After the patient's multidisciplinary evaluation, obesity surgery should be considered in adults with a documented BMI greater than or equal to 35 and related comorbidity, or a BMI of at least 40. In addition to standard laboratory testing, chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, and abdominal ultrasonography, the preoperative evaluation of obesity surgery patients also includes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or radiologic evaluation with a barium meal. Psychiatric consultation and polysomnography can safely be restricted to patients with clinical symptoms on preoperative screening. Adjustable gastric banding (GB), vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) are all effective in the treatment of morbid obesity, but differ in degree of weight loss and range of complications. The choice of procedure therefore should be tailored to the individual situation. There is evidence that a laparoscopic approach is advantageous for LAGB, VBG, and GB (and probably also for BPD). Antibiotic and antithromboembolic prophylaxis should be used routinely. Patients should be seen 3 to 8 times during the first postoperative year, 1 to 4 times during the second year and once or twice a year thereafter. Outcome assessment after surgery should include weight loss and maintainance, nutritional status, comorbidities and quality-of-life.

### Comparison of ambulatory health care costs and use associated with roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs sleeve gastrectomy [^f5f12b29]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the comparative associations of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) vs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with patients’ ambulatory health care use and costs?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study that included 6300 patients, total ambulatory costs were similar for as long as 4 years following SG and RYGB. However, RYGB was associated with greater reductions in prescriptions for cardiometabolic disease, while SG was associated with fewer specialist visits and laboratory tests after surgery.

Meaning

These findings suggest that lesser need for cardiometabolic medications following RYGB vs SG may be counterbalanced by a greater need for postsurgical monitoring after this more invasive procedure.

### Pramlintide (symlin) for the treatment of hypoglycemia following gastric bypass surgery (...) [^e31a2b5a]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study is an open-label short-term proof of concept study. The investigators will administer pramlintide to patients with severe post-prandial hypoglycemia following gastric bypass, in order to determine whether pramlintide is effective in reducing the frequency or severity of hypoglycemia. Pramlintide will be prescribed for 8 weeks. The study will utilize an open label design to evaluate the efficacy of pramlintide in patients who have had gastric bypass and have severe postprandial hypoglycemia. The study will not be randomized or blinded. The investigators will recruit 26 participants from Joslin Diabetes Center. Briefly, participants in this study will be asked to complete 4 study visits. The first visit will be for screening. They will then be asked to keep a 3-day log in which they record food intake, blood glucoses eight times daily, as well as any hypoglycemic symptoms, before they initiate treatment.

Concurrently participants will wear a professional continuous glucose monitoring device for 3 days. At a second study visit, they will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test, which will serve as a baseline evaluation. Patterns of glucose excursions, and hormonal responses will be assessed. At the end of the mixed meal, satiety will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Baseline hypoglycemia frequency and severity will be assessed by reviewing patient glucose and hypoglycemia symptom log recorded prior to the visit. At the completion of visit 2, pramlintide will be prescribed, with instructions for titration of the drug from minimal to maximal dose to help reduce the incidence of side effects.

During the treatment period, the participants will keep a record of all hypoglycemic symptoms and blood glucose measurements at those times. There will be one follow-up visit in the middle of the treatment period for evaluation of symptoms and tolerance of medication. During the last week of treatment, for comparison with pre-treatment glycemia, participants will again complete a food diary, and measure and record blood glucoses eight times daily for 3 days, while also wearing a professional CGM.

### How sustained is roux-en-Y gastric bypass long-term efficacy?: roux-en-Y gastric bypass efficacy [^d7872334]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Demographic data. Analytical profiles of patients who underwent RYGB before surgery and at 10 or more years of follow-up. Rates of comorbidities remission, relapse, and new diagnosis

Early complications occurred in 13.2% (n = 37) of patients, 6.5% classified as Clavien-Dindo I or II. The most prevalent complications were gastrojejunal anastomosis related (n = 14) and surgical wound infection (n = 10). Reoperation within the first 90 days after surgery was needed in 8 patients (2.8%) (Table 2).

Table 2 
Early and Long-term complications in patients after RYGB

(*This values refer to percentage of patients with anaemia secondary to iron deficiency that required each of the following treatment interventions: oral iron, intravenous iron or blood transfusion)

Long-term complications were reported in 201 patients (71.5%). Iron deficiency, the most frequent long-term complication occurred in 170 patients (60.5%), of which only 80 patients (47.1%) were under mineral/multivitamin supplementation after surgery. At the time of the revaluation visit, only 43.4% (n = 122) of the patients were under mineral or multivitamin supplementation.

Anterior abdominal wall hernias (n = 24) and post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (n = 13) were the other most common long-term complications observed. Two or more long-term complications occurred in 38 patients (Table 2).

After the primary bariatric intervention, 2.8% (n = 8) of the patients needed revision surgery for secondary weight loss failure. None of the revision surgery interventions was performed due to excessive weight loss or severe malnutrition, intractable dumping syndrome or chronic abdominal pain.

To identify the factors associated with weight loss failure, defined as not reaching the TWL ≥ 20%, a univariate and multivariate analysis comparing the patients with a successful versus non-successful weight loss, including age, initial BMI, T2D, hypertension, dyslipidemia, OSA, depression, smoking and laboratory parameters comprising glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin and C-Peptide. None of the evaluated parameters was found to be associated with higher probability of weight loss failure.

From the initial cohort of 601 patients, 4 patients submitted to RYGB, died within the first 90 days after surgery: 3 patients from septic shock after gastrojejunal anastomosis leak and 1 patient from acute kidney injury.

### Monitoring for micronutrient deficiency after bariatric surgery-what is the risk? [^2d71b547]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

These results may also inform rationalising the testing frequency of some nutrients in the first postoperative year. American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery practice guidelines recommend testing up to 10 nutrients, up to four times within the first post-operative year. However, more recent British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society guidelines, have moved towards a more individualised testing schedule, and suggest only five nutrients up to three times in the first year, with other nutrients be tested as required or annually. This study found that after SG, only folate and potentially iron, appeared vulnerable to deficiency 6 months after surgery. Additionally, after GB only vitamin B1 and folate appeared vulnerable to deficiency due to surgery, with uncertainty remaining about the potential risk vitamin D deficiency. While low plGPx and vitamin A deficiency prevalence did increase after surgery, both were independently related to inflammation and/or glycaemic control, not time since surgery, suggesting mechanisms other than surgically induced malabsorption are playing a role. Therefore, this study supports the notion of a more individualised approach to micronutrient monitoring in the first 12 months after surgery, in the context of an uncomplicated post-operative course, the absence of pre-operative micronutrient deficiencies, and care including regular dietitian involvement. This approach may reduce testing costs and burden on the individual and health service, while also maintaining safety. Further research is recommended to investigate this further, in the short and long term.

It is acknowledged that access to multidisciplinary post-surgical support may be heterogeneous in other hospital settings and therefore the results of this study may not be generalisable to all surgical units. While the biochemical analysis of serum micronutrient levels were performed by more than one laboratory, and at times by more than one type of assay, this is reflective of real world practice. Clinical interpretation of results took a conservative approach with consideration of the width and lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals to determine whether the risk of micronutrient deficiency is great enough to support broad protocol driven postoperative monitoring of individual nutrients. Furthermore, although detailed information was collected on supplementation dose, timing of dose in relation to the biochemical micronutrient test was not recorded and may confound some nutrient results. Additionally, dietary intake was not collected to the detail required to accurately assess micronutrient intake, thus supplement intake does not reflect total overall intake of each nutrient but rather that consumed via supplements only. In the context of vastly reduced oral intake after surgery, an investigation of food contribution to micronutrients in combination with supplements is warranted for future research

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass long-term surveillance—recommended and selective care includes the following: Recommended measures list frequent, early, and long-term follow-up, physical activity with a target of moderate aerobic activity as soon as clinically able, laboratory monitoring and micronutrient surveillance, regular supplementation, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for long-term surveillance of bone health, and body contouring surgery deferred for at least 18 mo or until achieving stable weight loss; monitoring of alcohol or substance use is advised, and on suspicion of alcohol use disorder, the American Psychiatric Association recommends referral for evaluation and comprehensive and patient-centered treatment. Selective measures state that increased attention to facilitating follow-up should be given to patients at risk for follow-up noncompliance; virtual visits should be considered to facilitate follow-up for at-risk patient populations; the amount of exercise recommended should take each patient’s physical condition, limitations, and lifestyle into account; administration of supplements should be considered during any subsequent admission; body contouring surgery should be considered for patients with body mass index <30 kg/m2; recreational marijuana should be avoided; and AUDIT screening questions should be utilized in conjunction with AUDIT consumption for better sensitivity and specificity for detection of alcohol use disorder (AUDIT = alcohol use disorder identification test).

### Monitoring for micronutrient deficiency after bariatric surgery-what is the risk? [^e1357d48]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bariatric surgery may increase the risk of micronutrient deficiencies; however, confounders including preoperative deficiency, supplementation and inflammation are rarely considered.

Objective

To examine the impact of bariatric surgeries, supplementation and inflammation on micronutrient deficiency.

Setting

Two public hospitals, Australia.

Methods

Participants were recruited to an observational study monitoring biochemical micronutrient outcomes, supplementation dose, inflammation and glycaemic control, pre-operatively and at 1–3, 6 and 12 months after gastric bypass (GB; Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Single Anastomosis Gastric Bypass; N = 66) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG; N = 144). Participant retention at 12 months was 81%.

Results

Pre-operative micronutrient deficiency was common, for vitamin D (29–30%), iron (13–22%) and selenium (39% GB cohort). Supplement intake increased after surgery; however, dose was <50% of target for most nutrients. After SG, folate was vulnerable to deficiency at 6 months (OR 13 [95% CI 2, 84]; p = 0.007), with folic acid supplementation being independently associated with reduced risk. Within 1–3 months of GB, three nutrients had higher deficiency rates compared to pre-operative levels; vitamin B1 (21% vs. 6%, p < 0.01), vitamin A (21% vs. 3%, p < 0.01) and selenium (59% vs. 39%, p < 0.05). Vitamin B1 deficiency was independently associated with surgery and inflammation, selenium deficiency with improved glycaemic control after surgery and inflammation, whilst vitamin A deficiency was associated with inflammation only.

Conclusion

In the setting of prophylactic post-surgical micronutrient prescription, few nutrients are at risk of de novo deficiency. Although micronutrient supplementation and monitoring remains important, rationalising high-frequency biochemical testing protocols in the first year after surgery may be warranted.

### Postprandial normoglycemic hypokalemia-an overlooked complication to gastric bypass surgery? [^fc7e8730]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is one of the major health problems of the world, and bariatric surgery continues to be its most effective treatment. One of the most commonly performed surgeries is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, but it is however not free from complications. One major complication is the problem with postprandial hypoglycemia—occurring in up to 1/3 of patients. The hypoglycemia typically occur about 1–3h post-meal, and present with typical hypoglycemic symptoms as altered cognition, weakness, seizures, tremor, and ultimately loss of consciousness. Many studies have described a fast occurring hyperglycemic peak after ingestion of carbohydrates, followed by a disproportionately exaggerated insulin response that lingers on longer than the hyperglycemia—leading to postprandial hypoglycemia. This can be tested by a provocative high carbohydrate test meal. Sometimes however, the test meal does not provoke hypoglycemia, but rather postprandial hypokalemia, leading to the suspicion that the patient more likely suffers from postprandial normoglycemic hypokalemia evoking similar symptoms as hypoglycemia. Here, 3 cases are presented that have displayed this supposedly more uncommon but nonetheless important and hard-to-treat clinical feature.

### Anemia after roux-en-Y gastric bypass. how feasible to eliminate the risk by proper supplementation? [^53e1d70e]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has been reported in 5 to 64 % of patients. Since absorption of specific elements is reduced, proper supplementation is mandatory. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of anemia, its causes, and the related deficiencies during the 1st postoperative year after RYGB.

Methods

A retrospective review of our prospectively collected database was performed. A total of 486 patients who underwent RYGB in a 5-year period and completed at least 1-year follow-up were included. Daily supplements as suggested by the AACE/TOS/ASMBS guidelines were routinely prescribed. Blood count, iron profile, folic acid, and B12 measurements 1 year after surgery were reviewed.

Results

One hundred ninety-five males and 291 females were included, with a mean age of 39.9±11.6 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 42.4±6.3 kg/m(2). Anemia 1 year after surgery was found in 19 patients (4 %), 6 males and 13 females. In seven women, it was related to iron deficiency. Two additional women had iron deficiency combined with low vitamin B12. Anemia was secondary to inflammation in two and indeterminate in two. In the six males, the cause of anemia was inflammation in three and indeterminate in three. Abnormal bleeding was found in five of these patients.

Conclusions

Frequency of anemia 1 year after RYGB in our population was low (4 %). Anemia non-attributable to malabsorption was frequently present (n=9/19). Iron deficiency was found exclusively in women. The most common non-malabsorptive types of anemia were inflammation and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

Material

This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 644 patients who underwent RYGB as a primary treatment for severe obesity at a public hospital from 2004 to 2013 with a postoperative follow-up of more than 5 years.

The RYGB procedure was performed with laparoscopic antecolic, antegastric technique, using a biliopancreatic limb of 40–60 cm and an alimentary limb of 100 cm or 150 cm, depending on BMI below or above 50 kg/m 2.

The patients were enrolled in a local quality registry and followed a standardized clinical pathway according to international guidelines at the time. A standardized set of lab tests was taken 1 year before the RYGB procedure and at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the operation.

Data on weight, comorbidity, complications and other relevant events in the postoperative period were registered. In addition to information from planned visits in the follow-up program of 5 years, information on intravenous iron treatment was recorded until 14 years after RYGB. Results from laboratory tests related to the 5-year outpatient follow-up program were added to the quality registry by collecting data directly from the hospital’s laboratory data system. The registry was last updated January 2019. Laboratory results were available in the registry for 544 (84%) patients at baseline and 428 (66%) after 5 years.

The over-the-counter multivitamin-mineral product most commonly used in this cohort contained 15 mg iron (II) fumarate and 400 μg folate per unit. In general, the patients were advised to use additional per oral iron supplements with ascorbic acid for 1 month twice a year if ferritin was > 50 μg/L, or more often if the ferritin values were lower. Patients with ferritin levels above the normal range were advised not to take iron supplements. The patients were also recommended supplemental vitamin B 12 and calcium with vitamin D, and they were offered intravenous iron treatment if the iron stores were depleted, defined as ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L.

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: postoperative care pathway guidelines for roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^733aaa3e]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) body contouring surgery (BCS)—BCS assessment at 18 months following RYGB or later once stable weight loss is achieved is described, with maximum weight loss often achieved during the first year after surgery and most patients having weight stability by 18 months postoperative. Selective: BCS after RYGB should be considered for patients with BMIs of 30 kg/m^2 or less; it is performed in approximately 19% of patients after bariatric surgery, and complications after BCS are about 30%, with an increased risk if performed in patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m^2. Not recommended: BCS should not be considered in patients post-RYGB with untreated nutritional deficiencies; protein malnutrition and vitamin and mineral deficiencies may impair wound healing, increase wound complications, and result in impaired immune function and increased complications after BCS.

### Copper deficiency after gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review [^d305168d]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A large number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery are deficient in copper, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can further aggravate it. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of copper deficiency can leave patients with residual neurological disability. This has led to recommendation from the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society that copper levels should be monitored annually after gastric bypass. This review concludes that copper deficiency in adequately supplemented patients is rare and can be adequately treated if a related haematological or neurological disorder is diagnosed. The cost of routine monitoring may therefore not be justified for adequately supplemented, asymptomatic patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The screening may however be necessary for high-risk patient groups to prevent severe complications and permanent disability.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^585118b5]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery—iron deficiency—In the recent American Society for Metabolic & Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) clinical practice guidelines (CPG), iron deficiency was as high as 45% of patients with obesity prior to bariatric surgery and therefore justifies a pre-operative aggressive case-finding approach, which may include ferritin levels. Key clinical features of iron deficiency prompting suspicion include fatigue, microcytic anemia, glossitis, and nail dystrophy. Postoperatively, iron status should continue to be monitored, but measurement of ferritin alone is less helpful, since ferritin is increased by inflammation, age, and infection. Moreover, postoperatively, iron deficiency is 14% after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), 20 to 55% after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 8 to 62% after biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch (BPD/DS), and can occur despite routine supplementation, again justifying routine testing. Oral supplementation should be in divided doses, since malabsorption can be exacerbated with calcium supplements, decreased gastric acid, and phytate- or polyphenol-rich foods, and vitamin C can be provided with iron supplementation to both improve iron absorption and also decrease the risk of iron overload.

Results

The 490 patients had a mean ± SD age at surgery of 40.1 ± 9.0 years and 51.8 ± 9.0 years at follow-up, after 11.7 ± 1.6 years. Three-hundred and ninety-three (80%) were women. Body mass index (BMI) changed from 44.4 ± 5.4 kg/m 2 to 35.0 ± 7.0 kg/m 2 (Table 2). A total of 361 (74%) patients reported being adherent to multivitamin-mineral supplements at follow-up, adherence to vitamin B 12 was 466 (95%), and calcium with vitamin D was 336 (69%). Among adherent patients, 319/361 (83%) used the same multivitamin-mineral supplement (see Table 1). Per oral vitamin B 12 was used in 110/466 (25%) of the adherent patients, while 356/466 (75%) used hydroxocobalamin injections. The recommended calcium with vitamin D (1000 mg/20 µg) was used in 305/336 (91%) adherent patients.

### Revisional roux-en-Y gastric bypass versus revisional one-anastomosis gastric bypass after failed sleeve gastrectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^05e492e1]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

High rates of revision surgery have been reported for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), with weight regain (WR) as the most frequently reported cause. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed revision procedure, whereas one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is a less popular approach.

Methods

A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred seventy-six patients were enrolled and randomized. After loss to follow-up, 80 patients for RYGB and 80 patients for OAGB were analyzed, with a 2-year follow-up. Patients with grade B or higher gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were excluded. Early and late postoperative complications were recorded. Body mass index (BMI), percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL), nutritional laboratory test results, and the resolution of associated medical problems were assessed after revision surgery.

Results

After 2 years, both groups achieved significantly lower BMI than their post-LSG nadir BMI (p < 0.001). The %EBMIL changes showed significantly faster weight loss in the OAGB group than in the RYGB at the 6-month follow-up (mean difference: 8.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 16.9%). However, at 1-year and 2-year follow-ups, the differences were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Early and late complications were similar between two groups. Both groups showed improvement or resolution of associated medical problems, with no statistically significant differences after 2 years (p = 1.00).

Conclusion

Both revisional RYGB and OAGB have comparable significant weight loss effects when performed for WR after LSG. After a 2-year follow-up, both procedures were safe, with no significant differences in the occurrence of complications and nutritional deficits.

### Redefining the role of routine postoperative bloodwork following uncomplicated bariatric surgery [^2f8811e3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A quality improvement opportunity was identified to de-adopt the low-value care practice of routinely performing bloodwork for all patients undergoing elective bariatric surgery. While these patients are typically discharged on postoperative day 1 (POD1) after bloodwork is performed, it is uncommon for the discharge plan to change due to unexpected laboratory abnormalities alone.

Methods

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery between September 2020 and April 2021 only had POD1 bloodwork if there were perioperative clinical concerns, they had insulin-dependent diabetes, or they were therapeutically anticoagulated. Thirty-day Emergency Department (ED) visits and readmissions were monitored as balancing measures. Outcomes were compared to a control group that underwent bariatric surgery prior to September 2020 when POD1 laboratory testing was routinely performed. Financial and environmental costs were estimated based our institutional standards.

Results

The intervention group consisted of 303 patients: 248 (82%) Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 55 (18%) sleeve gastrectomies. Most patients (n=256, 84.5%) did not have POD1 bloodwork. Twelve (3.9%) had bloodwork performed in violation of our protocol, of which none had a change in management based on the results. Of the 35 (12%) who had appropriately ordered bloodwork, 6 (2%) required a transfusion and 2 (0.7%) required a second surgery on the same admission for hemorrhage. Forty-four (14.5%) had 30-day ED visits of which 17 (5.6%) were within 7 days. Sixteen (5.3%) were readmitted. There were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in the rate of transfusion, second surgery, or 30-day ED visits. The avoidance of POD1 bloodwork saved approximately $6602.24 in lab processing fees alone and 512 test tubes.

Conclusion

POD1 bloodwork can be safely avoided in the absence of clinical concerns. In addition to not significantly increasing postoperative complications, there were benefits from a financial cost, environmental impact, and patient discomfort perspective.

### Management of iron deficiency and anemia after roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery: an observational study [^0c30ddcb]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Optimal iron management in this population is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess our management of RYGB patients with ID and anemia.

Methods

Clinic visit records of RYGB patients with ID or anemia from January 1, 2008, to February 1, 2010 were evaluated. Demographic characteristics, postsurgery iron and anemia indices, and prescribed treatments were recorded. Three separate definitions for ID and anemia were used (standard textbook, ASBMS, and recent literature). An intravenous iron protocol was later implemented, and follow-up laboratory values were obtained.

Results

A total of 125 with ID or anemia (89% female, 86% Caucasian), mean (SD) age 44.7 (8.6) years, and BMI 47.3 (10.8) kg/m(2) at time of RYGB, were included. Proportion of values meeting criteria for ID or anemia at first follow-up: standard textbook, hemoglobin (Hb, 35%), transferrin saturation (Tsat, 48%), ferritin (28%); ASBMS, ferritin (43%); recent literature, ferritin (58%), serum iron (21%). At mean follow-up of 45.7 (43) months, oral iron (n = 49) or intravenous iron (n = 4) had been prescribed for 53 (42.4%) patients, and 32 (25.6%) patients received multiple blood transfusions. Nine patients received intravenous iron using the new protocol (400-1400 mg), resulting in increases in Hb (1.8 g/dL; P<.05) and ferritin (31.8 ng/mL; P< .002).

Conclusion

Iron management was inadequate. Hematologic values often were deficient for sustained periods. Initially, few patients received intravenous iron after oral iron failure, many received no iron supplementation, and there was high use of blood transfusions. Subsequently, administration of intravenous iron was beneficial.

### Vitamin D metabolism in bariatric surgery [^3f52a36e]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is common in obese patients and persists after roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Several societies recommend screening for vitamin D deficiency before bariatric surgery, and replacement doses of 3000 IU/d and up to 50,000 IU 1 to 3 times per week, in case of deficiency, with periodic monitoring. These regimens are mostly based on expert opinion. Large trials are needed to assess the vitamin D dose response, by type of bariatric surgery, and evaluate the effect on surrogate markers of skeletal outcomes. Such data are essential to derive desirable vitamin D levels in this population.

### Effects of roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy on β-cell function at 1 year after surgery: a systematic review [^92522daf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Bariatric surgery is a highly effective obesity treatment resulting in substantial weight loss and improved glucose metabolism. We hereby aimed to summarize available evidence of the effect of the 2 most common bariatric surgery procedures, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), on dynamic measures of β-cell function (BCF). A systematic search of the literature was conducted in 3 bibliographic databases for studies reporting effects of RYGB and/or SG on BCF assessed using dynamic metabolic perturbation (oral or intravenous bolus stimulation), performed before and 1 year (±3 months) after surgery. Twenty-seven unique studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies), involving a total of 1856 obese adults, were included for final analysis. Twenty-five and 9 studies report effects of RYGB and SG on BCF, respectively (7 studies compared the 2 procedures). Seven studies report results according to presurgical diabetes status. Owing to variable testing procedures and BCF indices reported, no meta-analysis was feasible, and data were summarized qualitatively. For both surgical procedures, most studies suggest an increase in BCF and disposition index, particularly when using oral stimulation, with a more pronounced increase in diabetic than nondiabetic individuals. Additionally, limited indications for greater effects after RYGB versus SG were found. The quality of the included studies was, in general, satisfactory. The considerable heterogeneity of test protocols and outcome measures underscore the need for a harmonization of BCF testing in future research.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^99d5dfac]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery—vitamin B12—In the recent ASMBS CPG, B12 deficiency was found in 2 to 18% of patients with obesity (6 to 30% in those on proton-pump inhibitors) prior to bariatric surgery and justifies pre-operative aggressive case finding with biochemical testing, specifically using methylmalonic acid. Two to 5 years after bariatric surgery, B12 deficiency is <20% in RYGB and 4 to 20% after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). However, in a meta-analysis directly examining the two procedures, there was a decreased risk for B12 deficiency (but not anemia or iron deficiency) after SG compared with RYGB. Notwithstanding the paucity of information about vitamin B12 status after LAGB, global recommendations for ongoing biochemical testing and appropriate B12 supplementation in all patients undergoing bariatric surgery, especially those on folic acid supplementation, may be reasonable, since there is virtually no risk from B12 dosing.

### Bariatric nutrition and evaluation of the metabolic surgical patient: update to the 2022 Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome clinical practice statement (CPS) [^8ed08376]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Calcium deficiency after bariatric surgery—pathophysiology, formulation choice, and monitoring are outlined as follows: Calcium deficiency is frequent after procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass due to impaired absorption from duodenal bypass and reduced gastric acid, with secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone resorption risk; concurrent vitamin D deficiency worsens malabsorption, so lifelong supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is necessary. Calcium citrate is the preferred form of calcium in bariatric patients due to superior absorption without gastric acid, and regular monitoring of serum calcium, vitamin D, and PTH with bone density assessment is recommended, with calcium and vitamin D levels evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery and yearly thereafter.

Bariatric surgery—evaluation of persistent or severe gastrointestinal symptoms: Persistent and severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms warrant evaluation utilizing a pertinent history and physical exam, appropriate laboratory testing, and imaging (most commonly computerized tomography and/or upper GI series) (Grade C; BEL 3). Upper endoscopy with small-bowel biopsies and aspirates remains the gold standard and should be part of the evaluation of celiac disease and bacterial overgrowth in patients who have had a bariatric procedure (Grade C; BEL 3). Screening with a stool specimen should be obtained if the presence of Clostridium difficile colitis is suspected (Grade C; BEL 3), and persistent steatorrhea after BPD with/without DS should prompt evaluation for nutrient deficiencies (Grade C; BEL 3).

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: postoperative care pathway guidelines for roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^97e01d0b]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) postoperative radiology—Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for long-term surveillance of bone health is described, and recent position statements recommend interval post-RYGB bone mineral density assessments with DXA. Metabolic changes after RYGB include increasing bone loss, starting as early as the first year following RYGB, supporting the need for regular long-term postoperative bone health assessment.

### Post-bariatric surgery lab tests: are they excessive and redundant? [^ab2300fa]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We examined 9 different lab values at 6 different postoperative time periods to describe the prevalence of out-of-range clinical labs and deficiency for nutritional labs (see Table 1). These labs were nutritionally related, which guided the decision to focus on nutritional deficiencies in the grouped logistic regression. It is notable that Vitamin A was deficient in 1.77%, Vitamin B12 was deficient in 1.05%, and copper in 1.51%.

Table 1 
Total average nutritional deficiencies across six time points

Patients who underwent bariatric surgery revisions were not included in the analysis in order to be able to compare only primary sleeve gastrectomies and Roux-en-Y procedures. Additionally, if included demographic information were unavailable, those patients were omitted (n = 61), resulting in a final sample of 397. The patient characteristics from this final sample are displayed in Table 2.

Table 2 
Baseline characteristics

In an effort to understand how patient characteristics, comorbidities, medical history, and procedure type may affect postoperative nutritional deficiencies, the grouped logit model was used (Table 3) as this model allowed for adding additional covariates. Preoperative nutritional deficiency is associated with an increased risk of nutritional deficiencies being observed in the post-procedure period (OR 3.70, p < 0.001). There is a statistically significant protective association for patients with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.70, p < 0.006). Other factors that were found to be significantly associated with postoperative nutritional deficiencies include age, renal disease, and previous surgery.

Table 3 
Grouped logistic regression examining the nutritional deficiencies post bariatric surgery

*Statistically significant

Assessing the nutrients individually allowed examination of how preoperative deficiency was related to postoperative deficiency for that same nutrient. We did include time to gain a sense of which of the recommended testing points were statistically significant in our patient population. However, we were not able to estimate a model for either copper or Vitamin A given the lack of variability in deficiency status for these nutrients. A summary of the results of the seven GEE models are displayed in Table 4. In each of the models, preoperative nutritional deficiency predicts postoperative deficiency at a statistically significant level with odds ratios ranging from 2.78 to 29.76. Procedure type was included in these models to understand if the surgery type was, itself, predictive of postoperative nutritional deficiency.

Each model was adjusted for preoperative deficiency, procedure type, and time at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Only statistically significant results are listed

### Gastric bypass surgery has a weight-loss independent effect on post-challenge serum glucose levels [^763bc91d]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric bypass surgery seems to have an effect on glucose metabolism beyond what is mediated through weight reduction. The magnitude of this effect on fasting and post-challenge glucose levels remains unknown.

Results

Morbidly obese subjects without known diabetes performed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test before and after either gastric bypass surgery (n = 64) or an intensive lifestyle intervention programme (n = 55), ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104. The age-adjusted effects of the therapeutic procedures and percentage weight change on fasting and 2-h glucose levels at 1 year were explored using multiple linear regression analysis. Mean (SD) serum fasting and 2-h glucose levels at baseline did not differ between the surgery and lifestyle groups. Weight-loss after surgical treatment and lifestyle intervention was 30 (8) and 9 (10) % (p < 0.001). At 1 year, fasting and 2-h glucose levels were significantly lower in the surgery group than in the lifestyle group, 4.7 (0.4) versus 5.4 (0.7) mmol/l and 3.4 (0.8) versus 6.0 (2.4) mmol/l, respectively (both p < 0.001). Gastric bypass and weight-loss had both independent glucose-lowering effects on 2-h glucose levels [B (95 % CI) 1.4 (0.6-2.3) mmol/l and 0.4 (0.1-0.7) mmol/l per 10 % weight-loss, respectively]. Fasting glucose levels were determined by weight change [0.2 (0.1-0.3) mmol/l per 10 % weight-loss] and not by type of treatment.

Conclusions

Gastric bypass surgery has a clinically relevant glucose-lowering effect on post-challenge glucose levels which is seemingly not mediated through weight-loss alone.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery—anemia prevalence and evaluation are summarized as follows: About 10 to 12% of patients with obesity have anemia before bariatric surgery, rising to 33 to 49% within 2 years postoperatively, with prevalence 17% after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and 45 to 50% after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch (BPD/DS); expansion of nutritional anemia work-up and supplementation depends on clinical judgement based on other specific signs or symptoms, and low protein levels may be contributory after bariatric surgery.

### Predicting the glycemic response to gastric bypass surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes [^83a31775]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Data extraction

HbA 1c at 12 months after surgery was the primary outcome variable of interest. The preoperative variables listed were extracted from the database, in line with our aims and inferred hypotheses. They were then grouped in clinically relevant blocks to build the hierarchical logistic regression model. Block 1 consisted of age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. Block 2 consisted of duration of diabetes, family history of diabetes, use of oral hypoglycemic agents, and use of insulin. Block 3 consisted of HbA 1c, C-peptide, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA), HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and uric acid. We also extracted the type of gastric bypass performed (block 4), and percentage weight loss at 12 months after surgery (block 5).

Baseline biochemical measures were assessed in the fasting state immediately before surgery, and assays were performed in a single accredited laboratory. The laboratory C-peptide reference range was 0.9–4.0 ng/mL. Postsurgical diabetes care management was performed by one of the hospital endocrinologists (L.-M.C. or K.C.) and the diabetes educator (S.-C.C.).

### Intravenous iron treatment in the prevention of iron deficiency and anaemia after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^a9b3cc16]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron absorption is disturbed after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and iron deficiency with or without anaemia affects almost half of all patients. Intravenous iron is an option when per oral iron is insufficient or not tolerated. This study explores whether routinely offering intravenous iron treatment when iron stores are empty can prevent anaemia and iron deficiency after RYGB.

Methods

This is a study of prospectively registered data on clinical information, haematological tests and intravenous iron treatment from 644 RYGB patients who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2013, postoperatively followed more than 5 years. Intravenous iron treatment was offered to patients with ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L.

Results

Clinical information was available for all patients at baseline and for 553/644 patients at 5 years; laboratory results were available for 540/644 patients at baseline and 411/644 patients after 5 years. The mean age was 39.8 (± 9.7) years. Overall, 187/483 (38.7%) women and 9/161 (5.6%) men were given intravenous iron treatment in the observation period. From baseline to 5 years, mean haemoglobin decreased by 0.3 g/dL in both men and women. Anaemia occurred in 18/311 (5.8%) women and 9/100 (9%) men at 5 years. Depleted iron stores (ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L) were seen among 44/323(13.6%) women and 3/102 (2.9%) men, and low iron stores (ferritin 16–50 μg/L) occurred in 144/326 (44.6%) women and 38/102 (37.3%) men 5 years after RYGB.

Conclusion

By routinely offering intravenous iron treatment to patients with depleted iron stores after RYGB, haemoglobin levels were preserved. Half of the patients experienced low or depleted iron stores at 5 years.

### Zinc deficiency after gastric bypass for morbid obesity: a systematic review [^6bebd9b8]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Up to 50% of patients have zinc deficiency before bariatric surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide. It can further exacerbate zinc deficiency by reducing intake as well as absorption. The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society, therefore, recommends that zinc level should be monitored routinely following gastric bypass. However, the American guidance does not recommend such monitoring for all RYGB patients and reserves it for patients with 'specific findings'. This review concludes that clinically relevant Zn deficiency is rare after RYGB. Routine monitoring of zinc levels is hence unnecessary for asymptomatic patients after RYGB and should be reserved for patients with skin lesions, hair loss, pica, dysgeusia, hypogonadism or erectile dysfunction in male patients, and unexplained iron deficiency anaemia.

### Vitamin and mineral deficiency 12 years after roux-en-Y gastric bypass a cross-sectional multicenter study [^2e31c243]. Obesity Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The main strengths of the BAROBS study are a long-term follow-up (mean 11.7 years), the high number of comparable surgical patients (n = 490) and data reflecting a real-time follow-up of patients after obesity surgery. The recommendations for supplements and the follow-up program have been similar in the region. However, the self-reported use of supplements might be overestimated. At time of surgery in 2003–2009 and during the two-to-five-year postoperative follow-up, the patients were recommended an over-the-counter multivitamin-mineral supplement, calcium/vitamin D (1000 mg/20 µg) and vitamin B 12 injections. Only vitamin B 12 was reimbursed. Bariatric supplements became available in Norway in 2017 but were more expensive and not easily accessible. It is also considered a limitation that we do not know the daily/weekly number of multivitamin-mineral or calcium/vitamin D tablets the patients took. We assume that most patients followed the recommendations given at the time of surgery; however, some patients may have increased their supplements according to updated guidelines after advice from health professionals, or on their own initiative.

Laboratory tests on vitamins have some limitations on individual levels as the values are snapshots of the patient’s status, and the water-soluble vitamins fluctuate with intake. However, this is not considered a limitation with the high number of patients in the BAROBS study. The BAROBS study may underestimate the general deficiency rate in a post-RYGB population. We may assume that patients (384/930) lost to follow-up may be less adherent to the lifestyle changes and multivitamin-mineral use than patients participating.

Continuous improvement in patient education programs either in-person or digitally with a multidisciplinary team, emphasizing life-long supplementation, the first few years after surgery empowers the patient’s ability to take healthy choices. Updated information on follow-up after obesity surgery should be easily available to general practitioners responsible for the long-term care for these patients. The advice regarding supplements must be easy to follow and the supplements affordable.

### Nutritional deficiencies in gastric bypass patients ; incidence, time of occurrence and implications for post-operative surveillance [^01b20cb1]. Obesity Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Post-operative nutritional deficiencies are a common complication following bariatric surgery. The incidence and time of occurrence are not clear, and the efficacy of supplementation remains questionable. Clear guidelines for nutritional follow-up and counselling are needed.

Methods

Preoperative and post-operative deficiencies were determined in a group of 427 gastric bypass patients. The predictive value of preoperative laboratory findings for the development of post-operative deficiencies, the time of occurrence and the effect of supplementation of common deficiencies was studied.

Results

Most common preoperative deficiencies were of folic acid (21.3%), vitamin D3 (17.5%) and iron (21.8%). Post-operative, a significant increase in the number of patients with anaemia and deficiencies of ferritin and vitamin B12 was found. Most deficiencies occur between 12 and 15 months post-operatively, but vitamin D3 deficiency occurs significantly earlier at 9.7 months. A preoperative iron, folic acid or ferritin deficiency results in a significant higher risk for developing a post-operative deficiency despite supplementation, and ferritin deficiency occurs significantly earlier in these patients. Oral treatment of post-operative vitamin B12 and vitamin D3 deficiencies was successful in more than 80% of the patients in contrast to oral treatment of anaemia which was only successful in 62.5% of the patients.

Conclusion

Our study emphasizes the importance of preoperative assessment and treatment of nutritional deficiencies in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Despite limited efficacy, post-operative oral supplementation should be encouraged as it decreases the incidence of deficiencies.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to patients after bariatric surgery (vitamin B1), EASO 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate prompt oral or parenteral thiamine supplementation in all bariatric patients experiencing persistent vomiting severe enough to interfere with regular nutrition, even in the absence or before confirmatory laboratory data.

### Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis after gastric bypass does not cause hypomagnesemia [^04d845b7]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-induced hypomagnesemia is currently a major topic. Patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are generally prescribed PPI prophylaxis after surgery. We investigated the prevalence of hypomagnesemia in our bariatric population. We reviewed the files of 1000 postoperative patients for serum magnesium level during PPI use. We found only five cases of hypomagnesemia, none of which was evidently related to PPI use. We conclude that the risk of hypomagnesemia during 1 year of prophylactic PPI use after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is minimal and laboratory screening is probably not necessary.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Study participants

Morbidly obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m 2) subjects planning to undergo RYGB surgery were referred to our department for precise preoperative examination, as described in detail elsewhere. Our diagnostics also included an OGTT to avoid underdiagnosing diabetes, unless already known or diagnosable from fasting glucose concentrations according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. In addition, patients were tested for Cushing syndrome and thyroid dysfunction. Additional exclusion criteria for this study were current or former medication known to influence glucose homeostasis, severe (chronic) disease, pregnancy, and/or breastfeeding.

Finally, six nondiabetic, morbidly obese patients agreed to participate in the entire study program, which included both an OGTT and a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp test both before (pre-OP) and ∼6 months after (post-OP) RYGB surgery. Two control groups, who only once underwent OGTTs and clamp tests, were enrolled: a lean control group (CON lean ; n = 6), matched for age and sex to pre-OP and post-OP, and another obese control group (CON ob ; n = 6), with age, sex, and BMI comparable to post-OP (Table 1). The study was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the local ethical board. All study participants gave written informed consent.

OGTT

After an overnight fast for at least 10 h, a 75-g OGTT (Gluco-Drink75; Roche Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) was performed for 3 h with frequent blood sampling (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) for instant determination of plasma glucose and subsequent analysis of plasma hormones (,,–).

### Summarizing consensus guidelines on obesity management: a joint, multidisciplinary venture of the international federation for the surgery of obesity&metabolic disorders (IFSO) and world gastroenterology organisation (WGO) [^cbfc3491]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Also as stated above, UGI endoscopic evaluation is recommended in patients with a history of reflux disease and in those undergoing gastric bypass surgery, both preoperatively and every 5 years postoperatively. Since obesity is a risk factor for 13 different types of cancer, MBS patients also must continue to be screened for cancer postoperatively, in accordance with national guidelines. Nutritional intake, activity levels, adherence with multivitamin and mineral supplements, current weight, and both comorbidity assessments and blood tests should be done annually by the obesity management team.

Once a patient has undergone MBS, the center where the surgery was conducted needs to, thus, relay a comprehensive postoperative health management plan to primary care providers,which must include which procedures, blood tests, and long-term vitamin supplements are required, any medication changes and/or monitoring that may be necessary, and when patients should be referred back to the MBS center. Reasons for referral back to the MBS center or to a local specialist include persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional issues, pregnancy, a need for psychological support, appreciable weight regain, and other medical issues requiring bariatric care.

With respect to weight regain, it is crucial that patients and their primary health care providers understand that some degree of weight regain is typical,especially after 2 years postoperatively, and that even appreciable weight regain must never be considered treatment “failure,” as such a perception can exert detrimental effects on patients’ self-perception, motivation to continue treatment, compliance with further monitoring and treatment and, ultimately, their health outcomes. Instead, just like patients who experience disease recurrence after cancer therapy, patients presenting with significant weight regain after MBS require an extensive evaluation, including anatomical studies (eg, UGI endoscopy, UGI barium studies) and being assessed by the multidisciplinary team.

Finally, weight regain is not the only clinical outcome that can warrant investigation after MBS. For example, patients presenting with GERD symptoms, with or without weight regain after MBS, also require an objective assessment to identify or rule out GERD, including pH studies with or without manometry.

### Acute kidney injury after gastric bypass surgery [^93809f5a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastric bypass surgery is a common treatment for morbid obesity. The presence of comorbid conditions and drugs that are used to treat them can adversely influence kidney function. Risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) after gastric bypass surgery are not well understood, however. A total of 504 patients underwent gastric bypass between January 2003 and 2005. Primary outcome was AKI, defined as a > or =50% increase in serum creatinine relative to baseline or requirement of dialysis. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, all-cause hospital mortality, and readmissions within 30 d after surgery. Demographic, comorbid, and laboratory variables and preoperative medication use were examined as potential risk factors for AKI. A total of 42 (8.5%) patients developed postoperative AKI. Hyperlipidemia, preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), intraoperative hypotension, and higher body mass index were associated with increased frequency of AKI. By multivariable analyses, the independent risk factors for AKI were body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.06), hyperlipidemia (OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.28), and preoperative use of ACE-I or ARB (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.05 to 4.04). The postoperative mortality was 0.45% (n = 2), both of whom had AKI. Duration of hospitalization was greater in patients with AKI versus no AKI (4.0 versus 2.7 d; P = 0.0003). Postoperative AKI is not infrequent after gastric bypass surgery. Certain comorbid conditions and their commonly prescribed treatments, ACE-I or ARB, are independently associated with increased risk for postoperative AKI.

### Elevated serum parathormone after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^ae8952d5]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormalities in calcium and vitamin D metabolism are observed early after gastric bypass, whereas clinical or biochemical evidence of metabolic bone disease might not be detected until many years after the procedure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on bone metabolism determined on the basis of postoperative laboratory changes in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone (PTH) levels.

Methods

110 patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) were followed after surgery, and the following parameters were determined: intact PTH molecule (PTHi; chemiluminescence), alkaline phosphatase (colorimetric method), ionic calcium (selective electrode), phosphorus and magnesium (colorimetric method).

Results

Elevated serum PTHi levels were observed in 29% of the patients and hypocalcemia in 0.9% from the 3rd postoperative month and afterwards (3 to 80 months after surgery).

Conclusion

There is a need for careful evaluation of bone metabolism and for routine calcium replacement after RYGBP.

### Screening and diagnosis of micronutrient deficiencies before and after bariatric surgery [^6f35f9ec]. Obesity Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Micronutrient deficiencies are key concerns after bariatric surgery. We describe the prevalence of perioperative testing and diagnosis of micronutrient deficiencies among a cohort of insured bariatric surgery patients.

Methods

We used claims data from seven health insurers to identify bariatric surgery patients from 2002-2008. Our outcomes were perioperative claims for vitamin D, B12, folate, and iron testing and diagnosed deficiencies. We analyzed results by bariatric surgery type: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), restrictive, and malabsorptive. We calculated the prevalence of testing and deficiency diagnosis, and performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the association with surgery type.

Results

Of 21,345 eligible patients, 84% underwent RYGB. The pre-surgical testing prevalence for all micronutrients was <25%. The testing prevalence during the first 12 months after surgery varied: vitamin D (12%), vitamin B12 (60%), folate (47%) and iron (49%), and declined during 13-24 and 25-36 months. The deficiency prevalence during 0-12 months post-survey varied: vitamin D (34%), vitamin B12 (20%), folate (13%), and iron (10%). The odds of vitamin B12, folate, and iron deficiency during 0-12 months were significantly lower for restrictive as compared to RYGB, but were not different during 13-24 and 25-36 months post-surgery. The odds of vitamin D deficiency were significantly greater for malabsorptive as compared to RYGB during all post-surgical periods.

Conclusion

Many patients did not receive micronutrient testing pre- or post-surgery, yet deficiencies were relatively common among those tested. These results highlight the need for surgeons and primary care providers to test all bariatric surgery patients for micronutrient deficiencies.

### Bowel gangrene from strangulated petersen's space hernia after gastric bypass [^8e73812f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with internal herniation after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass might present with normal laboratory values, minimal physical examination findings, and nonspecific radiographic results, making early diagnosis difficult and resulting in catastrophic bowel necrosis.

Objective

Our purpose is to increase awareness so physicians of all specialties caring for these patients have a heightened suspicion and low threshold to obtain early surgical consultation in bypass patients with unexplained abdominal pain.

Case Report

A 36-year-old female had a delayed presentation of internal herniation 4 years after laparoscopic retrocolic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. Initially, she had unremarkable physical examination, laboratory results, and plain x-ray findings, which made diagnosis challenging. During emergent exploratory laparotomy, she was found to have a strangulated Petersen's space hernia with volvulus, necessitating extensive gastric, small bowel, and colonic resection. She was referred for small bowel transplantation and has survived more than 8 years.

Conclusions

The occurrence of Petersen's hernias has increased with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass due to less postoperative adhesions. Whether days or several years after gastric bypass, patients with intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting need to be carefully evaluated. These herald signs of internal herniation should prompt early surgical consultation. Pain out of proportion to physical examination often indicates need for urgent surgical intervention. Physicians need to be educated about this potentially life-threatening complication so early diagnosis and treatment can avoid catastrophic bowel gangrene.

### International consensus on the diagnosis and management of dumping syndrome [^0496390f]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

The reproducibility of the modified OGTT has not been studied separately. However, data from a phase II clinical trial involving pasireotide in patients with dumping syndrome, where progressively increasing doses of pasireotide were added with repeated OGTT testing, show that up to 50% of patients continued to display hypoglycaemia during treatment. This observation supports the concept that the test might be reproducible for the occurrence of hypoglycaemia. In these studies, at OGTT testing, the persistence of a rise in pulse rate or a rise in haematocrit level at 30 min with treatment was lower than the persistence of hypoglycaemia, suggesting that either this aspect is less reproducible, or that pasireotide is more effective in treating early dumping syndrome (pulse rate rise and haematocrit rise) than in treating late dumping syndrome (hypoglycaemia).

The OGTT might demonstrate hypoglycaemia after gastric bypass surgery even in the absence of symptoms suggestive of late dumping syndrome. The diagnostic accuracy of this test is therefore likely to be low. When patients without diabetes mellitus were tested before and after a bariatric procedure, predominantly gastric bypass, half of all patients developed hypoglycaemia; however, none had hypoglycaemic symptoms, which suggests the test has low specificity. For this reason, it has been suggested that measured hypoglycaemia in patients after bariatric surgery is only relevant when associated with symptoms that are relieved by ingestion of carbohydrates (Whipple’s triad). On the basis of these considerations, the guideline for evaluation and management of adult hypoglycaemic disorders from the Endocrine Society that was published in 2009 rejected the use of the OGTT for testing postprandial hypoglycaemia, but this guideline did not mention or consider dumping syndrome. Whether the accuracy or sensitivity of the OGTT for dumping syndrome can be improved by adding questionnaires (such as Sigstad’s, Arts or Mine questionnaires) has not been evaluated.

As an alternative, the mixed meal tolerance test has been recommended to confirm the diagnosis of symptomatic hypoglycaemia after gastric bypass. In this test, patients with suspected dumping syndrome ingest a mixed meal containing carbohydrates, fat and proteins after an overnight fast, and blood samples are collected prior to the meal and at 30-min intervals for up to 2 h afterwards to measure glycaemic and insulin profiles. Compared to the OGTT, only a limited number of studies have reported on the mixed meal test,. No head-to-head comparisons are available, and hence evaluating respective sensitivities for the tests cannot be done reliably. However, this test was claimed to have a lower rate of hypoglycaemia occurrence than OGTT,,.

### Bone mineral density, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D after gastric bypass surgery: a 10-year longitudinal follow-up [^8e78baba]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

At the time our patients were operated (2004–2005), vitamin D/calcium supplementation was not routinely prescribed postoperatively. European recommendations for such supplementation came several years later and formal guidelines for the Nordic countries were published as late as 2017. Awareness of these recommendations in Swedish primary healthcare has slowly grown over the last years and this is reflected in the number of patients prescribed vitamin D/calcium outside our study. This study was not designed to compare groups with or without vitamin D supplementation, such a study would need larger groups of patients, probably larger doses of supplementation, and well-controlled compliance.

Even though low vitamin D and high PTH levels have been reported after gastric bypass, it is also known that obesity itself is associated with increased PTH levels as well as low levels of vitamin D. In the present study, half of the patients had vitamin D deficiency preoperatively and a similar number was seen at 10 years in the non-supplemented group. Elevated PTH levels were seen in approximately 25% of patients preoperatively and this remained at 10 years. Considering the great SD for PTH values, we cannot draw certain conclusions from the differences in mean values at the different time points. The changes in PTH do not seem to explain the considerable changes in BMD. Present guidelines have focused on vitamin D/calcium supplementation, but there could well be physiological reasons for the fall in BMD other than lack of vitamin D and secondary hyperparathyroidism, such as changes in gastrointestinal peptides and hormone levels and uptake of protein and other nutrients. In fact, current guidelines are not evidence-based but rather the opinion of experts. We could only find one randomized controlled study addressing this subject in which vitamin D, calcium, and protein supplementation together with physical exercise modified the fall in BMD but did not prevent it.

GI surgery

36. IDA is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery (evidence quality—high, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).

37. In new presentations of IDA, we recommend that a history of GI or bariatric surgery should not preclude a search for other causes of IDA (evidence quality—low, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).

Resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel generally predisposes to IDA.This includes the expanding population with a history of bariatric surgery, including sleeve gastrectomy. Reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption are probably the major underlying mechanisms,and therefore IDA in this situation may occur in the context of other nutritional deficiencies—in particular of vitamin B12.

The prevalence of IDA depends on the specific diagnostic criteria employed, but it is found in approximately a quarter of subjects 2 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and is markedly commoner in women,and in those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores.The figure for sleeve gastrectomy is probably lower.

Predictably, the yield of other causative lesions on BDE is lower in individuals with IDA and a history of GI surgery than in those without.Nevertheless, it is unsafe to automatically attribute IDA to previous surgery without excluding other possibilities, particularly in those at risk of underlying GI malignancy—bearing in mind that partial gastrectomy may predispose to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.

Without supplementation, the percentage prevalence of IDA tends to increase over the first 10 postoperative years.Long-term oral IRT is often effective, though because of underlying malabsorption this is not always the case, and intravenous therapy may be required.

### Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis after gastric bypass does not cause hypomagnesemia [^b7af53f6]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We reviewed the files of 1000 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in our high-volume bariatric center between December 2012 and February 2014. Prior to surgery, patients underwent a screening program with laboratory testing, including serum magnesium levels. These same tests were routinely performed at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Patients receive lifelong supplementation with a daily multivitamin tablet, containing 125 mg magnesium.

Data were collected from the patient records. For this type of study, formal consent was not required. Serum magnesium level for all postoperative measurements was determined with the Architect ci8200 (Abbott diagnostics, IL, USA). Hypomagnesemia was defined as a magnesium level below the locally established lower reference value of 0.65 millimole per liter (mmol/L). In some of the cases, the preoperative magnesium level was determined with a different analyzer (Beckman Coulter LX-20 chemistry analyzer). This does not influence the results of this study as this concerns only preoperative measurements and the reference values are similar. However, a comparison of pre- and postoperative means could not be done.

### Postoperative metabolic and nutritional complications of bariatric surgery [^cc391866]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery has become an increasingly important method for management of medically complicated obesity. In patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, up to 87% with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop improvement or resolution of their disease postoperatively. Bariatric surgery can reduce the number of absorbed calories through performance of either a restrictive or a malabsorptive procedure. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery require indefinite, regular follow-up care by physicians who need to follow laboratory parameters of macronutrient as well as micronutrient malnutrition. Physicians who care for patients after bariatric surgery need to be familiar with common postoperative syndromes that result from specific nutrient deficiencies.

### After bariatric surgery, what vitamins should be measured and what supplements should be given? [^4beba1af]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. Although calorie malabsorption does not occur in most bariatric procedures, micronutrient deficiencies are possible. Multivitamin supplementation is essential following bariatric surgery. The recommendation would be to screen for multivitamin deficiencies prior to surgery and to monitor vitamin levels postoperatively at regular intervals. In this paper, we review the data for screening and supplementation after bariatric procedures for different vitamins.

### The impact of a clinical pathway for gastric bypass surgery on resource utilization [^a758bf5c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are believed to improve patient care and reduce costs. Our hypothesis was that a gastric bypass pathway would decrease hospital resource utilization and cost of care without adversely affecting patient care.

Methods

The prepathway (Pre) group consisted of 16 gastric bypasses (6/98 to 3/99). The postpathway (Post) group includes 12 gastric bypass procedures performed after institution of the clinical pathway (4/99 to 12/99). The impact of the clinical pathway on hospital length of stay (LOS) and resource utilization was investigated. A comparison of costs was performed using cost/charge ratios. Hospital readmissions and postoperative complications were also examined.

Results

Despite increased obesity/medical acuity of the Post group, hospital LOS decreased by 3 days (P < 0.0001). Total hospital costs decreased by over $1600/case (>15%). Postpathway savings were greatest for room and board (34%), supplies (41%), and lab/radiology costs (50%). An increase in OR costs (22%) was observed in the Post group. This was due to an increase in anesthesia time (epidural catheter placement) and equipment costs (ultrasonic shears). Despite reductions in hospital LOS and resource utilization, the complication rate (Pre 12%, Post 16%) was similar and two patients in each group required brief readmission.

Conclusions

A pathway for gastric bypass decreased hospital LOS and resource utilization. OR-related expenses account for 34-50% of total costs and must be monitored closely for surgical patients. The reduction in costs observed with this clinical pathway was not associated with an increase in postoperative complications or hospital readmission.

For zinc, up to 70% of patients post-BPD/DS, up to 40% of patients post-RYGB, up to 19% of patients post-SG, and up to 34% of patients post-AGB are noted; zinc deficiency is possible, even during zinc supplementation and especially if primary sites of absorption are bypassed, screening should be performed at least annually post-RYGB and post-BPD/DS, and serum and plasma zinc are the preferred biomarkers for screening in post-bariatric patients. For copper, up to 90% in patients post-BPD/DS, 10-20% in patients post-RYGB, 1 case report for patients post-SG, and no data for patients post-AGB are listed; screening is recommended at least annually after BPD/DS and RYGB, even in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, and serum copper and ceruloplasmin are recommended biomarkers for determining copper status.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)—immunosuppressive medication management is characterized by limited and mixed evidence; there is little evidence and conflicting results about immunosuppressive medication management after RYGB, and weight loss associated with bariatric surgery results in decreased serum inflammatory markers and a decreased need for some immunosuppressive medications. In the postorgan transplant population following RYGB, medication management may require special attention due to changes in pharmacokinetics, and current literature suggests that patients with prior transplants may require no or minor changes in immunosuppressive medication dosing after bariatric surgery.

A, Results of random-effects meta-analysis using the frequentist approach for ΔBMI for observational studies. Marker size is proportional to the number of study arms included in each analysis. B, Mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis results for ΔBMI for randomized clinical trials. Estimates of model 1 are presented in the format of a forest plot; each estimate is the relative surgery effect compared with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Body mass index loss at 5 years postsurgery was 12 to 17. The complication rate was 17%, and the reoperation rate was 7%. Gastric bypass was more effective in weight loss but associated with more complications. Adjustable gastric banding had lower mortality and complication rates; yet, the reoperation rate was higher and weight loss was less substantial than gastric bypass.

Sleeve gastrectomy appeared to be more effective in weight loss than adjustable gastric banding and comparable with gastric bypass. To make use of the information on repeated measurements of ∆BMI at different study points in the trials and to compare and contrast the findings in Padwal et al, 31 we conducted mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis that allows for repeated measurements using a Bayesian approach, 51 targeting all RCTs from which we extracted data. In RCTs, GB appeared to have the lowest reoperation rate, followed by SG, while in OBSs, SG had the lowest reoperation rate, followed by GB. Adjustable GB appeared to have the highest reoperation rate. Our findings are consistent with previous literature that AGB has lower mortality and complication rates than GB, 38, 39 but not a decreased reoperation rate.

Sleeve gastrectomy was positioned between AGB and GB58 in terms of mortality and complication rates in OBSs and postsurgery ΔBMI in MTC meta-analysis of RCTs.

### Seven-year weight trajectories and health outcomes in the longitudinal assessment of bariatric surgery (LABS) study [^f2826b55]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

More information is needed about the durability of weight loss and health improvements after bariatric surgical procedures.

Objective

To examine long-term weight change and health status following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 geographically diverse clinical centers. Adults undergoing bariatric surgical procedures as part of clinical care between 2006 and 2009 were recruited and followed up until January 31, 2015. Participants completed presurgery, 6-month, and annual research assessments for up to 7 years.

Main Outcome and Measures

Percentage of weight change from baseline, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, determined by physical measures, laboratory testing, and medication use.

Results

Of 2348 participants, 1738 underwent RYGB (74%) and 610 underwent LAGB (26%). For RYBG, the median age was 45 years (range, 19-75 years), the median body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 47 (range, 34-81), 1389 participants (80%) were women, and 257 participants (15%) were nonwhite. For LAGB, the median age was 48 years (range, 18-78), the body mass index was 44 (range, 33-87), 465 participants (76%) were women, and 63 participants (10%) were nonwhite. Follow-up weights were obtained in 1300 of 1569 (83%) eligible for a year-7 visit. Seven years following RYGB, mean weight loss was 38.2 kg (95% CI, 36.9-39.5), or 28.4% (95% CI, 27.6-29.2) of baseline weight; between years 3 and 7 mean weight regain was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4-4.4) of baseline weight. Seven years after LAGB, mean weight loss was 18.8 kg (95% CI, 16.3-21.3) or 14.9% (95% CI, 13.1-16.7), with 1.4% (95% CI, 0.4-2.4) regain. Six distinct weight change trajectory patterns for RYGB and 7 for LAGB were identified. Most participants followed trajectories in which weight regain from 3 to 7 years was small relative to year-3 weight loss, but patterns were variable. Compared with baseline, dyslipidemia prevalence was lower 7 years following both procedures; diabetes and hypertension prevalence were lower following RYGB only. Among those with diabetes at baseline (488 of 1723 with RYGB [28%]; 175 of 604 with LAGB [29%]), the proportion in remission at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 71.2% (95% CI, 67.0-75.4), 69.4% (95% CI, 65.0-73.8), 64.6% (95% CI, 60.0-69.2), and 60.2% (95% CI, 54.7-65.6), respectively, for RYGB and 30.7% (95% CI, 22.8-38.7), 29.3% (95% CI, 21.6-37.1), 29.2% (95% CI, 21.0-37.4), and 20.3% (95% CI, 9.7-30.9) for LAGB. The incidence of diabetes at all follow-up assessments was less than 1.5% for RYGB. Bariatric reoperations occurred in 14 RYGB and 160 LAGB participants.

Conclusions and Relevance

Following bariatric surgery, different weight loss patterns were observed, but most participants maintained much of their weight loss with variable fluctuations over the long term. There was some decline in diabetes remission over time, but the incidence of new cases is low following RYGB.

### Metabolic implications of obesity: before and after gastric bypass [^8fc55a20]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Obesity is recognized as an inherited disease state, and attributes of modern civilization have enhanced its phenotypic penetrance greatly. Two thirds or more of obese persons suffer comorbidities,many of which are characteristic of (dys)metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance. Unfortunately patients with body mass index over 35 infrequently can achieve or maintain weight loss adequate to resolve these metabolic (and anatomic) issues by lifestyle or pharmacologic strategies and are served better by gastric bypass, in spite of its attendant risks, both surgical and nutritional. This article evaluates the metabolic consequences of obesity and highlights which of these are amenable to correction with weight reduction achieved by gastric bypass.

### Iron deficiency-not only a premenopausal topic after bariatric surgery? [^1208220e]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, premenopausal women are at higher risk of developing iron deficiency and subsequently iron deficiency anaemia due to menstrual blood losses, with women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding having an even higher risk. It has been reported that premenopausal women develop iron deficiency more often during postoperative follow-up compared to postmenopausal women and men. This was found to be true in our investigation, too; however, the present study surprisingly indicates a similar prevalence of iron deficiency in pre- and postmenopausal women that differed significantly from the prevalence in men.

In the general population, the mean values of ferritin in women strongly increase after the cessation of menstrual periods. But the accumulation of iron happens gradually with iron-levels of postmenopausal women being still lower than those of men even decades after menopause; therefore, not completely replenished iron stores might be the reason for the higher prevalence of iron deficiency in postmenopausal women compared to men. Figure 2 reveals a comparable relative decrease of the mean ferritin values over time for the three groups. However, men started at a higher level than both pre- and postmenopausal women preoperatively, and 36 months post surgery, the mean ferritin value remained well within the reference range. Although many studies show women to be more iron deficient than men after bariatric surgery, the focus in most studies lies mainly on the high prevalence of iron deficiency in premenopausal women. The fact that men and postmenopausal women are often classified as having a “low risk” of developing iron deficiency in the normal population might be the reason for the assumption that these cohorts are not at high risk of developing iron deficiency after gastric bypass surgery as well.

Bariatric surgery nutrition—zinc (R64) states zinc supplementation should be included in a routine multivitamin–multimineral preparation with 8 to 22 mg/day, with greater amounts required for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion without/with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) (Grade C; BEL 3). Routine aggressive case finding for zinc deficiency using serum and plasma zinc determinations should be performed after malabsorptive procedures (RYGB and BPD/DS) (Grade C; BEL 3), and deficiency should also be considered after bariatric procedures in patients with chronic diarrhea, hair loss, pica, significant dysgeusia, or in males with unexplained hypogonadism or erectile dysfunction (Grade D). Treatment should target normal biochemical levels and include 1 mg/day copper supplementation for every 8 to 15 mg/day elemental zinc provided (Grade D).

Bariatric surgery—role of endoscopy for postoperative symptoms: Endoscopy is safe and should be the preferred procedure to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms suggestive of stricture or foreign body, as it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic (Grade C; BEL 3). Endoscopy may also be used for Helicobacter pylori testing as a possible contributor to persistent GI symptoms after bariatric procedures (Grade D).

Initial evaluation—cytopenia(s), suspect myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): evaluation includes history and physical; complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, differential, and reticulocyte count; examination of the peripheral blood smear; bone marrow aspiration with iron stain plus biopsy and cytogenetics by standard karyotyping, with “Recommend testing bone marrow sample with reticulin stain for fibrosis. Genetic testing for somatic mutations (ie, acquired mutations) in genes associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)”; serum erythropoietin (EPO) obtained prior to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion; serum or RBC folate and vitamin B12 evaluation; serum ferritin, iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC); documentation of transfusion history; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and “Recommend additional molecular and genetic testing for heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition in a subset of patients, particularly in patients <50 y.” When clinically indicated, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing may be performed; consider evaluation of copper deficiency in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malabsorption, severe malnutrition, gastric bypass surgery, or on zinc supplementation; and consider distinction from congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Nutritional monitoring and supplementation after metabolic/bariatric surgery—all patients should be followed regularly and closely for potential nutritional deficiencies, and the Endocrine Society has provided a strong recommendation for periodic clinical and biochemical monitoring for micro- and macro- nutritional deficiencies. Metabolic procedures have the greatest risk for nutritional deficiency, especially the biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). All bariatric surgery patients should receive an average of 60 – 120 g of protein daily, and those with mal-absorptive components require a low carbohydrate diet to avoid “dumping”. Typical doses of elemental calcium are 1,200 – 2,000 mg daily, preferably as calcium citrate; if the duodenum is bypassed, sub-lingual vitamin B12 is recommended. Iron deficiency is common and prophylactic therapy is typically given with vitamin C; women with ongoing menstrual losses should receive a higher dose. Fat-soluble vitamin (K, A, D, and E) status should be monitored; calcium and vitamin D deficiencies contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism and may require higher than typical replacement dosing of vitamin D (taken with food for best absorption) and elemental calcium, ideally as calcium citrate. Thiamine deficiency can also occasionally occur, typically associated with intractable vomiting after surgery.

Bariatric procedure follow-up and weight regain—postoperative care time frame: Follow-up should be scheduled depending on the bariatric procedure performed and the severity of comorbidities (Table 9) (Grade D). Following laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedures, frequent nutritional follow-up and band adjustments are recommended (Grade C; BEL 3). For significant weight regain or failure to lose weight, interventions should first include dietary change, physical activity, behavioral modification with frequent follow-up, and then, if appropriate, pharmacologic therapy and/or surgical revision (Grade B; BEL 2). Routine metabolic and nutritional monitoring is recommended after all bariatric procedures (Grade A; BEL 1).

Pre-bariatric insurance processes—insurance requirements and documentation of medical necessity can be onerous without evidence they improve outcomes; during this process, surgical dropout was associated with factors including a longer diet requirement (OR, 0.88; P<0.0001), primary-care physician letter (OR, 0.33; P<0.0001), cardiology evaluation (OR, 0.22; P<0.038), and advanced laboratory testing (OR, 5.75; P<0.019).

R32. Nutritional evaluation—all patients must undergo an appropriate nutritional evaluation, including micronutrient measurements, before any bariatric procedure (Grade A; BEL 1), and more extensive nutritional evaluations are required for malabsorptive procedures (Grade A; BEL 1). Whole-blood thiamine levels may be considered in patients prior to bypass procedures (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and biliary pancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) (Grade C; BEL 3).
