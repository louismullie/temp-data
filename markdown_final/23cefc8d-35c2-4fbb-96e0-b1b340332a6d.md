## Question

An investigator is developing a drug that selectively inhibits the retrograde axonal transport of rabies virus towards the central nervous system. To achieve this effect, this drug must target which of the following?
A. Tubulin
B. Kinesin
C. Dynein
D. Acetylcholine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which molecular target would best enable a drug to selectively inhibit the retrograde axonal transport of rabies virus to the CNS, and to choose among tubulin, kinesin, dynein, and acetylcholine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the directionality of axonal transport and which motor drives retrograde movement. Then, I should verify whether rabies virus specifically relies on that retrograde motor. Next, I will examine the roles of tubulin and kinesin to ensure I'm not conflating tracks with motors. Finally, I will consider acetylcholine as a distractor and synthesize the most selective and mechanistically sound answer.

> Let me first confirm the directionality and motors involved in axonal transport. Retrograde transport moves cargo from axon terminals toward the cell body along microtubules, and it is powered by cytoplasmic dynein, the minus-end–directed motor, whereas anterograde transport is powered by kinesins toward the plus ends of microtubules.

> Wait, let me verify the specific motor that rabies virus hijacks. Rabies is a neurotropic virus that invades peripheral nerves and travels retrogradely to the CNS; mechanistically, this retrograde trafficking depends on dynein-driven transport along microtubules, consistent with its known path to the CNS via retrograde axonal transport [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tubulin. Tubulin forms the microtubule tracks on which motors move; disrupting microtubules would broadly impair both anterograde and retrograde transport and is not selective for retrograde movement, so targeting tubulin would be mechanistically nonselective and likely toxic to neuronal function.

> I should double-check the role of kinesin. Kinesins are the anterograde motors; inhibiting kinesin would primarily impair outward transport from soma to axon terminal and would not be expected to block retrograde viral movement toward the CNS, so kinesin is the wrong directionality for this therapeutic goal.

> Let me consider acetylcholine as a potential distractor. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in synaptic transmission and neuromuscular junction physiology; it is not a component of the axonal transport machinery, so targeting acetylcholine would not interrupt retrograde microtubule-based trafficking of viral particles.

> I will now examine why dynein is the most selective and mechanistically coherent target. Dynein is the principal retrograde motor; experimental perturbation of dynein or its cofactor dynactin impairs retrograde transport and causes axonal transport failure in neurons, reinforcing that dynein is both necessary and sufficient for retrograde trafficking in this context [^111hStbh] [^115CKWE1].

> But wait, what if the virus uses alternative pathways? Even though some viruses show nuanced trafficking details, the convergent evidence for rabies indicates reliance on retrograde dynein-dependent transport to reach the CNS, and mechanistic studies of related neurotropic viruses similarly demonstrate dynein engagement for retrograde movement, supporting the centrality of dynein as the target for selective inhibition in this scenario [^116Zv6AX].

> Putting this together, the most selective and mechanistically appropriate target to inhibit rabies virus retrograde axonal transport to the CNS is dynein, the retrograde motor protein that powers minus-end–directed movement along microtubules.

> Final answer: C. Dynein.

---

The correct answer is **C. Dynein**. Rabies virus uses retrograde axonal transport to reach the CNS, a process driven by **dynein motors** along microtubules [^notfound]. Inhibiting dynein would block this retrograde transport and prevent CNS invasion [^111hStbh]. Tubulin is the track, not the motor; kinesin drives anterograde transport; and acetylcholine is unrelated to axonal transport.

## Axonal transport mechanisms

Axonal transport is essential for neuronal function, delivering cargoes between the soma and axon terminals [^116oXjRe]. There are two main types: **anterograde transport** (soma to terminal), driven by kinesin motors toward microtubule plus ends, and **retrograde transport** (terminal to soma), driven by dynein motors toward microtubule minus ends [^115CKWE1].

## Rabies virus and retrograde axonal transport

Rabies virus is a neurotropic virus that **invades the CNS via retrograde axonal transport** from peripheral nerves [^113Rdcvj]. After entry at peripheral nerve endings, virions are transported retrogradely to the CNS, a process critical for pathogenesis [^112xN6P7].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of rabies virus retrograde transport

Rabies virus **hijacks the dynein motor complex** for retrograde transport [^notfound]. Dynein, with its cofactor dynactin, mediates minus-end–directed movement along microtubules, delivering viral particles to the soma [^115CKWE1]. Dynein is the primary motor for retrograde transport; inhibiting it would block rabies virus transport to the CNS [^113LXAj6].

---

## Role of dynein in retrograde transport

Dynein is a **minus-end–directed motor** that transports cargoes from axon terminals to the soma [^115CKWE1]. It is essential for **retrograde transport** of viruses, including rabies, to the CNS [^116Zv6AX] [^112xN6P7]. Disrupting dynein or its cofactor dynactin impairs retrograde transport and causes **neurodegeneration**, underscoring its central role [^111hStbh] [^115CKWE1].

---

## Other options analysis

- **A. Tubulin**: Microtubule polymer forming the track for motor proteins; inhibiting tubulin would disrupt both anterograde and retrograde transport nonspecifically, causing broad neuronal dysfunction [^1169VjFk].

- **B. Kinesin**: Plus-end–directed motor for anterograde transport; inhibiting kinesin would not block retrograde transport of rabies virus [^113LXAj6].

- **D. Acetylcholine**: A neurotransmitter unrelated to axonal transport; inhibiting it would not affect viral transport [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Dynein**. Rabies virus relies on dynein-driven retrograde transport to reach the CNS; inhibiting dynein would selectively block this pathway and prevent CNS invasion [^notfound].

### Replication strategies of rabies virus [^112xN6P7]. Virus Research (2005). Low credibility.

Rabies virus (RV) is a prototype neurotropic virus that causes fatal disease in human and animals. RV infects hosts at the periphery, enters motoneurons or sensory nerves and moves to the central nervous system (CNS) via retrograde axonal transport. At later stages, there is also centrifugal spread to major exit portals, such as the salivary glands. Transmission to other hosts is facilitated by behavioral changes related to the CNS infection. Successful accomplishment of the RV infectious cycle depends on multiple functions of the virus, and of individual virus proteins, all together defining the typical pathogenicity and virulence, i.e. the biological fitness of this virus. In particular, it appears important for RV to sneak into the host without causing pronounced host responses and to preserve, at least for some time, the integrity of infected cells and of the neuronal network. The availability of reverse genetics systems that allow generation of engineered recombinant RV has provided tools for a more detailed analysis of viral functions relevant to the typical RV pathogenesis. Novel developments such as tracking of live fluorescent RV are further increasing the opportunities to decipher RV pathogenicity factors. In this review, we describe different aspects of the molecular biology of RV that are relevant to pathogenesis, with a particular emphasis on the accurate control of RV transcription, gene expression, and replication. In addition, the role of individual virus proteins in maintaining host cell integrity and supporting retrograde transport is discussed. The potential of recombinant RVs with single or multiple pathogenicity factors eliminated is being discussed in terms of vaccine and virus vector development.

### G gene-deficient single-round rabies viruses for neuronal circuit analysis [^114AhZVN]. Virus Research (2016). Low credibility.

Rhabdoviruses like the neurotropic rabies virus are fully amenable to pseudotyping with homologous and heterologous membrane proteins, which is being harnessed for the study of viral envelope proteins, viral retargeting, or immunization purposes. Particularly, pseudotyped delta G rabies viruses are emerging as safe and superb tools for mapping direct synaptic connections and analyzing neuronal circuits in the central and peripheral nervous system, which is a fundamental pillar of modern neuroscience. Such retrograde rabies mono-transsynaptic tracers in combination with optogenetics and modern in vivo imaging methods are opening entirely new avenues of investigation in neuroscience and help in answering major outstanding questions of connectivity and function of the nervous system. Here, we provide a brief overview on the biology and life cycle of rabies virus with emphasis on neuronal infection via axon ends, transport, and transsynaptic transmission of the virus. Pseudotyping of single-round, G-deleted virus with foreign glycoproteins allows to determine tropism and entry route, resulting in either retro- or anterograde labeling of neurons. Pseudotyping in vitro also allows specific targeting of cells that serve as starter cells for transsynaptic tracing, and pseudotyping in situ for a single (mono-transsynaptic) step of transmission to presynaptic neurons. We describe principle and experimental variations for defining "starter" cells for mono-transsynaptic tracing with ΔG rabies virus and outline open questions and limitations of the approach.

### Nontoxic, double-deletion-mutant rabies viral vectors for retrograde targeting of projection neurons [^111Kzshx]. Nature Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

Recombinant rabies viral vectors have proven useful for applications including retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing, but their cytotoxicity has limited their use to short-term experiments. Here we introduce a new class of double-deletion-mutant rabies viral vectors that left transduced cells alive and healthy indefinitely. Deletion of the viral polymerase gene abolished cytotoxicity and reduced transgene expression to trace levels but left vectors still able to retrogradely infect projection neurons and express recombinases, allowing downstream expression of other transgene products such as fluorophores and calcium indicators. The morphology of retrogradely targeted cells appeared unperturbed at 1 year postinjection. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed no physiological abnormalities at 8 weeks. Longitudinal two-photon structural and functional imaging in vivo, tracking thousands of individual neurons for up to 4 months, showed that transduced neurons did not die but retained stable visual response properties even at the longest time points imaged.

### Rabies virus glycoprotein pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors enables retrograde axonal transport and access to the nervous system after peripheral delivery [^115iLg8c]. Human Molecular Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

In this report it is demonstrated for the first time that rabies-G envelope of the rabies virus is sufficient to confer retrograde axonal transport to a heterologous virus/vector. After delivery of rabies-G pseudotyped equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) based vectors encoding a marker gene to the rat striatum, neurons in regions distal from but projecting to the injection site, such as the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, become transduced. This retrograde transport to appropriate distal neurons was also demonstrated after delivery to substantia nigra, hippocampus and spinal cord and did not occur when vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped vectors were delivered to these sites. In addition, peripheral administration of rabies-G pseudotyped vectors to the rat gastrocnemius muscle leads to gene transfer in motoneurons of lumbar spinal cord. In contrast the same vector pseudotyped with VSV-G transduced muscle cells surrounding the injection site, but did not result in expression in any cells in the spinal cord. Long-term expression was observed after gene transfer in the nervous system and a minimal immune response which, together with the possibility of non-invasive administration, greatly extends the utility of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of human neurological disease.

### Novel approaches and challenges to treatment of central nervous system viral infections [^112n41sN]. Annals of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Existing and emerging viral central nervous system (CNS) infections are major sources of human morbidity and mortality. Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence. Nonetheless, many novel approaches to antiviral therapy are available, including candidate thiazolide and pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. New herpesvirus drugs include viral helicase-primase and terminase inhibitors. The use of antisense oligonucleotides and other strategies to interfere with viral RNA translation has shown efficacy in experimental models of CNS viral disease. Identifying specific molecular targets within viral replication cycles has led to many existing antiviral agents and will undoubtedly continue to be the basis of future drug design. A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses. Toll-like receptor agonists and drugs that inhibit specific cytokines as well as interferon preparations have all shown potential therapeutic efficacy. Passive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes has been used in humans and may provide an effective therapy for some herpesvirus infections and potentially for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against specific viral proteins have been developed and in several cases evaluated in humans in settings including West Nile virus and HIV infection and in pre-exposure prophylaxis for rabies.

### Retrograde axonal transport property of adeno-associated virus and its possible application in future [^116MKvyP]. Microbes and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Gene therapy has become a treatment method for many diseases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is one of the most common virus vectors, is also widely used in the gene therapy field. During the past two decades, the retrograde axonal transportability of AAV has been discovered and utilized. Many studies have worked on the retrograde axonal transportability of AAV, and more and more people are interested in this field. This review describes the current application, influence factors, and mechanism of retrograde axonal transportability of AAV and predicted its potential use in disease treatment in near future.

### Long-distance axonal transport of AAV9 is driven by dynein and kinesin-2 and is trafficked in a highly motile rab7-positive compartment [^115snHMb]. Molecular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can move along axonal pathways after brain injection, resulting in transduction of distal brain regions. This can enhance the spread of therapeutic gene transfer and improve treatment of neurogenetic disorders that require global correction. To better understand the underlying cellular mechanisms that drive AAV trafficking in neurons, we investigated the axonal transport of dye-conjugated AAV9, utilizing microfluidic primary neuron cultures that isolate cell bodies from axon termini and permit independent analysis of retrograde and anterograde axonal transport. After entry, AAV was trafficked into nonmotile early and recycling endosomes, exocytic vesicles, and a retrograde-directed late endosome/lysosome compartment. Rab7-positive late endosomes/lysosomes that contained AAV were highly motile, exhibiting faster retrograde velocities and less pausing than Rab7-positive endosomes without virus. Inhibitor experiments indicated that the retrograde transport of AAV within these endosomes is driven by cytoplasmic dynein and requires Rab7 function, whereas anterograde transport of AAV is driven by kinesin-2 and exhibits unusually rapid velocities. Furthermore, increasing AAV9 uptake by neuraminidase treatment significantly enhanced virus transport in both directions. These findings provide novel insights into AAV trafficking within neurons, which should enhance progress toward the utilization of AAV for improved distribution of transgene delivery within the brain.

### Early events in rabies virus infection-attachment, entry, and intracellular trafficking [^111xCtnk]. Virus Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Rabies virus (RABV), an enveloped virus with a single-stranded and negative-sense RNA genome, is the type species of the Lyssavirus Genus within the Rhabdoviridae family. As the causative agent of rabies with a nearly 100% fatality, the neurotropic RABV pose a serious threat to the global public health. Though a great effort has been made toward understanding the molecular mechanism underlying virus infection cycle, there are still many aspects need to be elucidated, especially on the early events during virus replication cycle. With the application of the multiple advanced technologies, much progress has been made on these aspects. To date, multiple receptors, such as nAChR, NCAM, p75NTR, mGluR2, carbohydrates, and gangliosides, have been identified. Following initial attachment, RABV internalization occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) with the help of actin. After viral entry, intracellular trafficking occurs. Two retrograde trafficking models, stating that either whole virions are parceled into vesicles or only the viral capsids are transported, have been proposed. Moreover, complete enveloped virions or G-containing vesicle-associated ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) may be formed during anterograde transport, which remains poorly characterized but is important for viral budding. Combining the data elucidating the molecular mechanisms of RABV attachment, entry, and intracellular trafficking, this review provides an integrated view of the early events in the viral life cycle.

### Rabies and other lyssavirus diseases [^113Rdcvj]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The full scale of the global burden of human rabies is unknown, owing to inadequate surveillance of this fatal disease. However, the terror of hydrophobia, a cardinal symptom of rabies encephalitis, is suffered by tens of thousands of people each year. The recent discovery of enzootic European bat lyssavirus infection in the UK is indicative of our expanding awareness of the Lyssavirus genus. The main mammalian vector species vary geographically, so the health problems created by the lyssaviruses and their management differ throughout the world. The methods by which these neurotropic viruses hijack neurophysiological mechanisms while evading immune surveillance is beginning to be unravelled by, for example, studies of molecular motor transport systems. Meanwhile, enormous challenges remain in the control of animal rabies and the provision of accessible, appropriate human prophylaxis worldwide.

### Enhanced pseudotyping efficiency of HIV-1 lentiviral vectors by a rabies / vesicular stomatitis virus chimeric envelope glycoprotein [^111shT8T]. Gene Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) can pseudotype lentiviral vectors, although at a lower efficiency to that of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Transduction with VSVG-pseudotyped vectors of rodent central nervous system (CNS) leads to local neurotropic gene transfer, whereas with RVG-pseudotyped vectors additional disperse transduction of neurons located at distal efferent sites occurs via axonal retrograde transport. Attempts to produce high-titre RVG-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for preclinical and clinical trials has to date been problematic. We have constructed several chimeric RVG/VSVG glycoproteins and found that a construct bearing the external/transmembrane domain of RVG and the cytoplasmic domain of VSVG shows increased incorporation onto HIV-1 lentiviral particles and has increased infectivity in vitro in 293T cells and in differentiated neuronal cell lines of human, rat and murine origin. Stereotactic application of vector pseudotyped with this RVG/VSVG chimera in the rat striatum resulted in efficient gene transfer at the site of injection showing both neuronal and glial tropism. Distal neuronal transduction in the substantia nigra, thalamus and olfactory bulb via retrograde axonal transport also occurs after intrastriatal administration of chimera-pseudotyped vectors at similar levels to that observed with a RVG-pseudotyped vector. This is the first report of distal transduction in the olfactory bulb. The enhanced pseudotyping with this envelope should enable easier production of higher-titre pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that exhibit efficient local and dispersed neuronal transduction in the CNS.

### A means for targeting therapeutics to peripheral nervous system neurons with axonal damage [^111sHw8i]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Delivery of biological therapeutics to motor and dorsal root ganglion neurons remains a major hurdle in the development of treatments for a variety of neurological processes, including peripheral nerve injury, pain, and motor neuron diseases. Because nerve cell bodies are important in initiating and controlling axonal regeneration, targeted delivery is an appealing strategy to deliver therapeutic proteins after peripheral nerve injury.

Methods

Tet1 is a 12-aa peptide, isolated through phage display that is selected for tetanus toxin C fragment-like binding properties. In this study, we surveyed its uptake and retrograde transport using compartmented cultures and sciatic nerve injections. We then characterized the time course of this delivery. Finally, to confirm the retrograde transport involvement, a colchicine pretreatment was performed. We also performed competitive binding studies between Tet1 and a recombinant tetanus toxin C fragment using recombinant tetanus toxin C fragment enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

We were able to demonstrate efficient uptake and retrograde axonal transport of the Tet1 peptide in vitro and in vivo. Intraneural colchicine pretreatment partially blocked fluorescence detection in the spinal cord, revealing a retrograde axonal transport mechanism. Finally, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiment revealed Tet1-specific binding to the recombinant tetanus toxin C fragment axon terminal trisialogangliosides receptor.

Conclusion

These properties of Tet1 can be applied to the development of therapeutic viral vectors and fusion proteins for neuronal targeting and enhanced spinal cord delivery in the treatment of nerve regeneration, neuroprotection, analgesia, and spasticity. Small peptides can be easily fused to larger proteins without significantly modifying their function and can be used to alter the binding and uptake properties of these proteins.

### Axonal transport of recombinant baculovirus vectors [^113TLy6a]. Molecular Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Targeted gene delivery to neurons is crucial to effective gene therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Several types of viral gene vectors may target neurons through retrograde axonal transport to somas of projection neurons after viral internalization at axon terminal fields. In this report we demonstrate for the first time that recombinant baculovirus vectors could migrate by axonal transport to cell bodies, resulting in transgene expression in projection neurons. After stereotaxic injection of Cy3-labeled baculovirus vectors into the rat striatum, retrograde axonal transport of the baculovirus vectors was observed along the corticostriatal pathway and nigrostriatal pathway. Furthermore, after intra-vitreous body injection, anterograde axonal transport and transsynaptic transport of the virus particles were observed in defined connections of the visual system, from the retina to the optic nerve, the lateral geniculate body, the superior colliculus, and the primary visual cortex. PCR analysis confirmed the existence of transported viral DNA in the tissue samples collected from projection fields. Driven by a neuron-specific promoter, transgene expression from the recombinant baculovirus vectors was detectable in target regions remote from injection sites. The attributes of baculovirus vectors in the bidirectional axonal transport and transneuronal transport in neural circuits of the central nervous system could be utilized for targeted gene delivery.

### A viral receptor complementation strategy to overcome CAV-2 tropism for efficient retrograde targeting of neurons [^116zdFZk]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Retrogradely transported neurotropic viruses enable genetic access to neurons based on their long-range projections and have become indispensable tools for linking neural connectivity with function. A major limitation of viral techniques is that they rely on cell-type-specific molecules for uptake and transport. Consequently, viruses fail to infect variable subsets of neurons depending on the complement of surface receptors expressed (viral tropism). We report a receptor complementation strategy to overcome this by potentiating neurons for the infection of the virus of interest-in this case, canine adenovirus type-2 (CAV-2). We designed AAV vectors for expressing the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) throughout candidate projection neurons. CAR expression greatly increased retrograde-labeling rates, which we demonstrate for several long-range projections, including some resistant to other retrograde-labeling techniques. Our results demonstrate a receptor complementation strategy to abrogate endogenous viral tropism and thereby facilitate efficient retrograde targeting for functional analysis of neural circuits.

### Projection-specific circuits of retrosplenial cortex with differential contributions to spatial cognition [^111rvpug]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. It has reciprocal connections with a diverse set of cortical and subcortical brain regions, but the afferent structure and behavioral function of circuits defined by its projection-specific sub-populations have yet to be determined. The corticocortical connections between RSC and secondary motor cortex (M2), as well as corticothalamic connections between RSC and anterodorsal thalamus (AD) have been hypothesized to function as semi-independent, but parallel pathways that impact spatial information processing in distinct ways. We used retrograde and anterograde viral tracers and monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus to quantitatively characterize and compare the afferent and efferent distributions of retrosplenial neuron sub-populations projecting to M2 and AD. AD-projecting and M2-projecting RSC neurons overlap in their collateral projections to other brain regions, but not in their projections to M2 and AD, respectively. Compared with AD-projecting RSC neurons, M2-projecting RSC neurons received much greater afferent input from the dorsal subiculum, AD, lateral dorsal and lateral posterior thalamus, and somatosensory cortex. AD-projecting RSC neurons received greater input from the anterior cingulate cortex and medial septum. We performed chemogenetic inhibition of M2- and AD-projecting RSC neurons and examined its impact on object-location memory, object-recognition, open-field exploration, and place-action association. Our findings indicate that inhibition of M2-projecting RSC neurons impairs object location memory as well as place-action association, while the RSC to AD pathway impacts only object-location memory. The findings indicate that RSC is composed of semi-independent circuits distinguishable by their afferent/efferent distributions and differing in the cognitive functions to which they contribute.

### Targeting axonal protein synthesis in neuroregeneration and degeneration [^116Ymuoq]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Localized protein synthesis is a mechanism by which morphologically polarized cells react in a spatially confined and temporally acute manner to changes in their environment. During the development of the nervous system intra-axonal protein synthesis is crucial for the establishment of neuronal connections. In contrast, mature axons have long been considered as translationally inactive but upon nerve injury or under neurodegenerative conditions specific subsets of mRNAs are recruited into axons and locally translated. Intra-axonally synthesized proteins can have pathogenic or restorative and regenerative functions, and thus targeting the axonal translatome might have therapeutic value, for example in the treatment of spinal cord injury or Alzheimer's disease. In the case of Alzheimer's disease the local synthesis of the stress response transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 mediates the long-range retrograde spread of pathology across the brain, and inhibition of local Atf4 translation downstream of the integrated stress response might interfere with this spread. Several molecular tools and approaches have been developed to target specifically the axonal translatome by either overexposing proteins locally in axons or, conversely, knocking down selectively axonally localized mRNAs. Many questions about axonal translation remain to be answered, especially with regard to the mechanisms establishing specificity but, nevertheless, targeting the axonal translatome is a promising novel avenue to pursue in the development for future therapies for various neurological conditions.

### Transduction patterns of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in the nervous system [^112gCM7G]. Molecular Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

We have developed a non-primate-based lentiviral vector based on the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) for efficient gene transfer to the central and peripheral nervous systems. Previously we have demonstrated that pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the rabies virus glycoprotein confers retrograde axonal transport to these vectors. In the present study we have successfully produced high-titer EIAV vectors pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins from Rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes (Indiana and Chandipura strains); rabies virus [various Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth ERA strains and challenge virus standard (CVS)]; Lyssavirus Mokola virus, a rabies-related virus; and Arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These vectors were delivered to the striatum or spinal cord of adult rats or muscle of neonatal mice by direct injection. We report that the lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with envelopes from the VSV Indiana strain, wild-type ERA, and CVS strains resulted in strong transduction in the striatum, while Mokola- and LCMV-pseudotyped vectors exhibited moderate and weak transduction, respectively. Furthermore ERA- and CVS-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors demonstrated retrograde transport and expression in distal neurons after injection in brain, spinal cord, and muscle. The differences in transduction efficiencies and retrograde transport conferred by these envelope glycoproteins present novel opportunities in designing therapeutic strategies for different neurological diseases.

### Efficient retrograde neuronal transduction utilizing self-complementary AAV1 [^112uBo5x]. Molecular Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is frequently used for gene transfer into the central nervous system (CNS). Similar to adenovirus and rabies virus, AAV can be taken up by axons and retrogradely transported, resulting in neuronal gene expression distant from the injection site. We investigated the retrograde transport properties of self-complementary AAV (scAAV) serotypes 1–6 following peripheral injection. Injection of scAAV into either rat extensor carpi muscle or sciatic nerve resulted in detectable retrograde vector transport and reporter gene expression in spinal cord motor neurons (MNs). Serotype 1 resulted in the highest level of retrograde transport, with 4.1 ± 0.3% of cervical MNs projecting to the extensor carpi transduced following intramuscular injection, and 7.5 ± 3.1% of lumbar MNs transduced after sciatic nerve injection. In contrast to scAAV1, retrograde transduction with scAAV2 was undetectable following intramuscular injection, and was detected in only 0.81 ± 0.15% of MNs projecting to the sciatic nerve following intranerve injection. Furthermore, sciatic injection of single-stranded AAV1 required injection of tenfold higher numbers of viral particles for detectable transgene expression compared to scAAV1, and then only 0.91 ± 0.24% of lumbar MNs were transduced. Our data provide the basis for increased retrograde transduction efficiency using peripheral injections of scAAV1 vectors for therapeutic gene delivery to the spinal cord.

### Axonal transport: cargo-specific mechanisms of motility and regulation [^116oXjRe]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Axonal transport is essential for neuronal function, and many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases result from mutations in the axonal transport machinery. Anterograde transport supplies distal axons with newly synthesized proteins and lipids, including synaptic components required to maintain presynaptic activity. Retrograde transport is required to maintain homeostasis by removing aging proteins and organelles from the distal axon for degradation and recycling of components. Retrograde axonal transport also plays a major role in neurotrophic and injury response signaling. This review provides an overview of axonal transport pathways and discusses their role in neuronal function.

### HSV trafficking and development of gene therapy vectors with applications in the nervous system [^111bBz7d]. Gene Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic double-stranded DNA virus that causes cold sores, keratitis, and rarely encephalitis in humans. Nonpathogenic HSV-1 gene transfer vectors have been generated by elimination of viral functions necessary for replication. The life cycle of the native virus includes replication in epithelial cells at the site of initial inoculation followed by retrograde axonal transport to the nuclei of sensory neurons innervating the area of cutaneous primary infection. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular basis for HSV cell entry, nuclear transport of the genome, virion egress following replication, and retrograde and anterograde axonal transport in neurons. We discuss how each of these properties has been exploited or modified to allow the generation of gene transfer vectors with particular utility for neurological applications. Recent advances in engineering virus entry have provided proof of principle that vector targeting is possible. Furthermore, significant and potentially therapeutic modifications to the pathological responses to various noxious insults have been demonstrated in models of peripheral nerve disease. These applications exploit the natural axonal transport mechanism of HSV, allowing transgene expression in the cell nucleus within the inaccessible trigeminal ganglion or dorsal root ganglion, following the noninvasive procedure of subcutaneous vector inoculation. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding basic virology in the design of vector systems and the powerful approach of exploiting favorable properties of the parent virus in the generation of gene transfer vectors.

### Transport and egress of herpes simplex virus in neurons [^116Zv6AX]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of axonal transport of the alphaherpesviruses, HSV and pseudorabies virus (PrV), in neuronal axons are of fundamental interest, particularly in comparison with other viruses, and offer potential sites for antiviral intervention or development of gene therapy vectors. These herpesviruses are transported rapidly along microtubules (MTs) in the retrograde direction from the axon terminus to the dorsal root ganglion and then anterogradely in the opposite direction. Retrograde transport follows fusion and deenvelopment of the viral capsid at the axonal membrane followed by loss of most of the tegument proteins and then binding of the capsid via one or more viral proteins (VPs) to the retrograde molecular motor dynein. The HSV capsid protein pUL35 has been shown to bind to the dynein light chain Tctex1 but is likely to be accompanied by additional dynein binding of an inner tegument protein. The mechanism of anterograde transport is much more controversial with different processes being claimed for PrV and HSV: separate transport of HSV capsid/tegument and glycoproteins versus PrV transport as an enveloped virion. The controversy has not been resolved despite application, in several laboratories, of confocal microscopy (CFM), real-time fluorescence with viruses dual labelled on capsid and glycoprotein, electron microscopy in situ and immuno-electron microscopy. Different processes for each virus seem counterintuitive although they are the most divergent in the alphaherpesvirus subfamily. Current hypotheses suggest that unenveloped HSV capsids complete assembly in the axonal growth cones and varicosities, whereas with PrV unenveloped capsids are only found travelling in a retrograde direction.

The olfactory nerve consists mainly of olfactory receptor neurons and directly connects the nasal cavity with the central nervous system (CNS). Each olfactory receptor neuron projects a dendrite into the nasal cavity on the apical side, and on the basal side extends its axon through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain. Viruses that can use the olfactory nerve as a shortcut into the CNS include influenza A virus, herpesviruses, poliovirus, paramyxoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, La Crosse virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and bunyaviruses. However, mechanisms of transport via the olfactory nerve and subsequent spread through the CNS are poorly understood. Proposed mechanisms are either infection of olfactory receptor neurons themselves or diffusion through channels formed by olfactory ensheathing cells. Subsequent virus spread through the CNS could occur by multiple mechanisms, including trans-synaptic transport and microfusion. Viral infection of the CNS can lead to damage from infection of nerve cells per se, from the immune response, or from a combination of both. Clinical consequences range from nervous dysfunction in the absence of histopathological changes to severe meningoencephalitis and neurodegenerative disease.

### The dynamic localization of cytoplasmic dynein in neurons is driven by kinesin-1 [^113LXAj6]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Cytoplasmic dynein, the major motor driving retrograde axonal transport, must be actively localized to axon terminals. This localization is critical as dynein powers essential retrograde trafficking events required for neuronal survival, such as neurotrophic signaling. Here, we demonstrate that the outward transport of dynein from soma to axon terminal is driven by direct interactions with the anterograde motor kinesin-1. In developing neurons, we find that dynein dynamically cycles between neurites, following kinesin-1 and accumulating in the nascent axon coincident with axon specification. In established axons, dynein is constantly transported down the axon at slow axonal transport speeds; inhibition of the kinesin-1-dynein interaction effectively blocks this process. In vitro and live-imaging assays to investigate the underlying mechanism lead us to propose a new model for the slow axonal transport of cytosolic cargos, based on short-lived direct interactions of cargo with a highly processive anterograde motor.

### Axonal transport and neurological disease [^1169VjFk]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Axonal transport is the process whereby motor proteins actively navigate microtubules to deliver diverse cargoes, such as organelles, from one end of the axon to the other, and is widely regarded as essential for nerve development, function and survival. Mutations in genes encoding key components of the transport machinery, including motor proteins, motor adaptors and microtubules, have been discovered to cause neurological disease. Moreover, disruptions in axonal cargo trafficking have been extensively reported across a wide range of nervous system disorders. However, whether these impairments have a major causative role in, are contributing to or are simply a consequence of neuronal degeneration remains unclear. Therefore, the fundamental relevance of defective trafficking along axons to nerve dysfunction and pathology is often debated. In this article, we review the latest evidence emerging from human and in vivo studies on whether perturbations in axonal transport are indeed integral to the pathogenesis of neurological disease.

### Injury-related dynamic myelin / oligodendrocyte axon-outgrowth inhibition in the central nervous system [^112cnZsf]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

By contrast with the glial scar, myelin was considered a constitutive static inhibitory barrier unreactive to lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). However, recent results suggest considerable add-on inhibition of myelin as a result of CNS injury. Furthermore, catastrophic events cause morphological and biochemical changes in the axon itself. This results in the accumulation of cytoskeleton components and intraaxonal transported proteins paralleled by extensive membrane remodelling at the axonal tip (a process called axotomy) which might modify the axonal response to its inhibitory environment.

Starting Point

Ji-Eun Kim and colleagues recently reported an axonal subpopulation with a different capacity to respond to myelin inhibitors (Neuron 2004; 44: 439–51). Axonal specificity but also evidence for injury reactivity summarised here challenges our understanding of axon-growth inhibition in the injured CNS. This might be due to (i) qualitative and quantitative enrichment of the periaxonal environment by myelin/oligodendrocytes, (ii) increased axonal sensitivity to its inhibitory environment, and (iii) axons and lesion-induced, altered axonal signalling. WHERE NEXT? Postlesional reactive inhibition of myelin or the oligodendrocyte necessitates the development of novel screening approaches and therapeutic agents to promote axonal regeneration. Moreover, we need to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of the lesion to find more efficient experimental strategies to restore neurological function.

### Dynactin is required for transport initiation from the distal axon [^115CKWE1]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

Dynactin is a required cofactor for the minus-end-directed microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein. Mutations within the highly conserved CAP-Gly domain of dynactin cause neurodegenerative disease. Here, we show that the CAP-Gly domain is necessary to enrich dynactin at the distal end of primary neurons. While the CAP-Gly domain is not required for sustained transport along the axon, we find that the distal accumulation facilitates the efficient initiation of retrograde vesicular transport from the neurite tip. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in the CAP-Gly domain prevent the distal enrichment of dynactin thereby inhibiting the initiation of retrograde transport. Thus, we propose a model in which distal dynactin is a key mediator in promoting the interaction among the microtubule, dynein motor, and cargo for the efficient initiation of transport. Mutations in the CAP-Gly domain disrupt the formation of the motor-cargo complex, highlighting the specific defects in axonal transport that may lead to neurodegeneration.

### Clathrin packets move in slow axonal transport and deliver functional payloads to synapses [^1122Ut9Q]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

In non-neuronal cells, clathrin has established roles in endocytosis, with clathrin cages enclosing plasma membrane infoldings, followed by rapid disassembly and reuse of monomers. However, in neurons, clathrin is conveyed in slow axonal transport over days to weeks, and the underlying transport/targeting mechanisms, mobile cargo structures, and even its precise presynaptic localization and physiologic role are unclear. Combining live imaging, photobleaching/conversion, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and super-resolution imaging, we found that unlike in dendrites, where clathrin cages rapidly assemble and disassemble, in axons, clathrin and related proteins organize into stable "transport packets" that are unrelated to endocytosis and move intermittently on microtubules, generating an overall slow anterograde flow. At synapses, multiple clathrin packets abut synaptic vesicle (SV) clusters, and clathrin packets also exchange between synaptic boutons in a microtubule-dependent "superpool". Within synaptic boundaries, clathrin is surprisingly dynamic, continuously exchanging between local clathrin assemblies, and its depletion impairs SV recycling. Our data provide a conceptual framework for understanding clathrin trafficking and presynaptic targeting that has functional implications.

### Double viral vector technology for selective manipulation of neural pathways with higher level of efficiency and safety [^114mjzxU]. Gene Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Pathway-selective gene delivery would be critical for future gene therapy against neuropsychiatric disorders, traumatic neuronal injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases, because the impaired functions depend on neural circuits affected by the insults. Pathway-selective gene delivery can be achieved by double viral vector techniques, which combine an injection of a retrograde transport viral vector into the projection area of the target neurons and that of an anterograde viral vector into their somas. In this study, we tested the efficiency of gene delivery with different combinations of viral vectors to the pathway extending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the cortical motor regions in rats, considered to be critical in the promotion of motor recovery from neural injuries. It was found that retrograde recombinant adeno-associated virus 2-retro (rAAV2reto) combined with anterograde AAVDJ (type2/type4/type5/type8/type9/avian/bovine/caprine chimera) exhibited the highest transduction efficiency in the short term (3–6 weeks) but high toxicity in the long term (3 months). In contrast, the same rAAV2reto combined with anterograde AAV5 displayed moderate transduction efficiency in the short term but low toxicity in the long term. These data suggest that the combination of anterograde AAV5 and retrograde rAAV2retro is suitable for safe and efficient gene delivery to the VTA-cortical pathway.

### Morphological and biochemical characterisation of sensory neurons infected in vitro with rabies virus [^111k3TP2]. Acta Neuropathologica (2007). Low credibility.

This work was aimed at the morphological and biochemical characterisation of the most susceptible neuronal subpopulation to rabies virus (RABV) infection. Adult mouse DRG cultures were infected with RABV and double-processed for viral antigen detection and neuropeptides: calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), galanin (GAL), substance P (SP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It was found that 56% of the neurons in culture were small (diameter < 20 microm) but, in spite of this, 69% of the infected neurons had intermediate and large diameters (≥ 20 microm). More than 50% of infected neurons expressed NPY, VIP or SP, whereas no association was found between infected neurons and the presence of CGRP or GAL. Despite SP having been shown to be a small neuron marker, it was found that RABV infects medium and large-sized SP positive cells. RABV preference for larger neurons could explain part of the neuropathogenesis since it can be suggested that, following a rabid accident, the virus uses large neurons (mainly innervating muscle and joints) in vivo to be transported later on to the central nervous system.

### Current chemical, biological, and physiological views in the development of successful brain-targeted pharmaceutics [^114WFTnz]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the greatest challenges with successful pharmaceutical treatments of central nervous system (CNS) diseases is the delivery of drugs into their target sites with appropriate concentrations. For example, the physically tight blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively blocks compounds from penetrating into the brain, also by the action of metabolizing enzymes and efflux transport mechanisms. However, many endogenous compounds, including both smaller compounds and macromolecules, like amino acids, sugars, vitamins, nucleosides, hormones, steroids, and electrolytes, have their peculiar internalization routes across the BBB. These delivery mechanisms, namely carrier-mediated transport and receptor-mediated transcytosis have been utilized to some extent in brain-targeted drug development. The incomplete knowledge of the BBB and the smaller than a desirable number of chemical tools have hindered the development of successful brain-targeted pharmaceutics. This review discusses the recent advancements achieved in the field from the point of medicinal chemistry view and discusses how brain drug delivery can be improved in the future.

### A radical form of nitric oxide suppresses RNA synthesis of rabies virus [^117TNcjo]. Virus Research (2001). Low credibility.

Hydrophobia is an incurable disease of the central nervous system. Therefore, every mode of the immune response is important to inhibit and clear infection. Innate immunity such as nitric oxide is significantly upregulated during rabies virus infection in vivo. In this report, the possible role of nitric oxide in inhibition of rabies virus replication was studied. Rabies virus infected neuroblastoma cells were treated with nitric oxide generated from SNP or SNP in the presence of ascorbate. SNP-ascorbate generates mainly NO* in culture medium while NO(+) is the major product of SNP alone. Treatment with SNP-ascorbate resulted in delay and suppression of infectious viral particle production. In contrast, treatment with SNP alone did not interfere with multiplication of this virus. The mechanism of inhibition by NO was at the level of gene expression, which was demonstrated by reduction in the level of N, G and L gene expression. The effect of SNP-ascorbate generated NO on rabies virus protein synthesis was also investigated. Synthesis of N protein in the presence of NO was suppressed which correlated to down regulation of N gene expression. We hypothesize that one of the roles of NO in the central nervous system during rabies virus infection is to limit viral dissemination by down-regulating rabies virus production through transcription inhibition.

### Herpesviruses assimilate kinesin to produce motorized viral particles [^115f8kji]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Neurotropic alphaherpesviruses initiate infection in exposed mucosal tissues and, unlike most viruses, spread rapidly to sensory and autonomic nerves where life-long latency is established 1. Recurrent infections arise sporadically from the peripheral nervous system throughout the life of the host, and invasion of the central nervous system may occur, with severe outcomes 2. These viruses directly recruit cellular motors for transport along microtubules in nerve axons, but how the motors are manipulated to deliver the virus to neuronal nuclei is not understood. Here, using herpes simplex virus type I and pseudorabies virus as model alphaherpesviruses, we show that a cellular kinesin motor is captured by virions in epithelial cells, carried between cells, and subsequently used in neurons to traffic to nuclei. Viruses assembled in the absence of kinesin are not neuroinvasive. The findings explain a critical component of the alphaherpesvirus neuroinvasive mechanism and demonstrate that these viruses assimilate a cellular protein as an essential proviral structural component. This principle of viral assimilation may prove relevant to other virus families and offers new strategies to combat infection.

### Molecular motors and mechanisms of directional transport in neurons [^113hbpWc]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

Intracellular transport is fundamental for neuronal morphogenesis, function and survival. Many proteins are selectively transported to either axons or dendrites. In addition, some specific mRNAs are transported to dendrites for local translation. Proteins of the kinesin superfamily participate in selective transport by using adaptor or scaffolding proteins to recognize and bind cargoes. The molecular components of RNA-transporting granules have been identified, and it is becoming clear how cargoes are directed to axons and dendrites by kinesin superfamily proteins. Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms of directional axonal and dendritic transport with specific emphasis on the role of motor proteins and their mechanisms of cargo recognition.

### Rab6a releases LIS1 from a dynein idling complex and activates dynein for retrograde movement [^1146YH6X]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Cytoplasmic dynein drives the movement of a wide range of cargoes towards the minus ends of microtubules. We previously demonstrated that LIS1 forms an idling complex with dynein, which is transported to the plus ends of microtubules by kinesin motors. Here we report that the small GTPase Rab6a is essential for activation of idling dynein. Immunoprecipitation and microtubule pull-down assays reveal that the GTP bound mutant, Rab6a(Q72L), dissociates LIS1 from a LIS1-dynein complex, activating dynein movement in in vitro microtubule gliding assays. We monitor transient interaction between Rab6a(Q72L) and dynein in vivo using dual-colour fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab6a(Q72L) mediates LIS1 release from a LIS1-dynein complex followed by dynein activation through an in vitro single-molecule assay using triple-colour quantum dots. Our findings reveal a surprising function for GTP bound Rab6a as an activator of idling dynein.

### The cycle of human herpes simplex virus infection: virus transport and immune control [^114Qc9do]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

After infection of skin or mucosa, herpes simplex virus enters the sensory nerve endings and is conveyed by retrograde axonal transport to the dorsal root ganglion, where the virus develops lifelong latency. Intermittent reactivation, which is spontaneous in humans, leads to anterograde transport of virus particles and proteins to the skin or mucosa, where the virus is shed and/or causes disease. Immune control of viral infection and replication occurs at the level of skin or mucosa during initial or recurrent infection and also within the dorsal root ganglion, where immune mechanisms control latency and reactivation. This article examines current views on the mechanisms of retrograde and anterograde transport of the virus in axons and the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity that control infection in the skin or mucosa and in the dorsal root ganglion — in particular, the role of interferons, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and interferon- gamma and other cytokines, including their significance in the development of vaccines for genital herpes.

### Pathogenesis of neurotropic herpesviruses: role of viral glycoproteins in neuroinvasion and transneuronal spread [^114S8CLx]. Virus Research (2003). Low credibility.

Neuroinvasion by herpesviruses requires entry into nerve endings in the periphery, transport to the cell body, replication in the cell body, axonal transport to the synapse and transneuronal viral spread. Entry occurs after receptor binding by fusion of virion envelope and cellular plasma membrane followed by microtubuli-assisted transport of capsids to the nuclear pore. By transneuronal spread, the virus gains access to synaptically linked neuronal circuits. A common set of herpesvirus glycoproteins is involved in entry and direct viral cell-cell spread. However, both processes can be distinguished by involvement of additional viral components. Interestingly, transneuronal spread appears to be functionally linked to intracytoplasmic formation of mature virions. This review will focus on the importance of herpesvirus envelope glycoproteins for infection of neurons and transneuronal spread, and their influence on viral pathogenesis.

### Myosin-dependent targeting of transmembrane proteins to neuronal dendrites [^115ZyUm2]. Nature Neuroscience (2009). Medium credibility.

The distinct electrical properties of axonal and dendritic membranes are largely a result of specific transport of vesicle-bound membrane proteins to each compartment. How this specificity arises is unclear because kinesin motors that transport vesicles cannot autonomously distinguish dendritically projecting microtubules from those projecting axonally. We hypothesized that interaction with a second motor might enable vesicles containing dendritic proteins to preferentially associate with dendritically projecting microtubules and avoid those that project to the axon. Here we show that in rat cortical neurons, localization of several distinct transmembrane proteins to dendrites is dependent on specific myosin motors and an intact actin network. Moreover, fusion with a myosin-binding domain from Melanophilin targeted Channelrhodopsin-2 specifically to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons in mice in vivo. Together, our results suggest that dendritic transmembrane proteins direct the vesicles in which they are transported to avoid the axonal compartment through interaction with myosin motors.

### Disruption of dynein / dynactin inhibits axonal transport in motor neurons causing late-onset progressive degeneration [^111hStbh]. Neuron (2002). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that inhibition of axonal transport is sufficient to cause motor neuron degeneration such as that observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we engineered a targeted disruption of the dynein-dynactin complex in postnatal motor neurons of transgenic mice. Dynamitin overexpression was found to disassemble dynactin, a required activator of cytoplasmic dynein, resulting in an inhibition of retrograde axonal transport. Mice overexpressing dynamitin demonstrate a late-onset progressive motor neuron degenerative disease characterized by decreased strength and endurance, motor neuron degeneration and loss, and denervation of muscle. Previous transgenic mouse models of ALS have shown abnormalities in microtubule-based axonal transport. In this report, we describe a mouse model that confirms the critical role of disrupted axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degenerative disease.

### Rimabotulinumtoxinb (Myobloc) [^111f7eVJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

MYOBLOC blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular and salivary neuroglandular junction by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from peripheral cholinergic nerved terminals. This inhibition occurs according to the following sequence: neurotoxin binding to cholinergic nerve terminals, internalization of the neurotoxin into the nerve terminal, translocation of the light-chain part of the molecule into the cytosol of the nerve terminal, and enzymatic cleavage of synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin), a presynaptic target protein essential for the release of acetylcholine. In both muscles and glands, impulse transmission is re-established by the formation of new nerve endings.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In responders, the return of increased muscle tone or saliva production typically starts within 3 to 4 months after injection.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Using currently available analytical technology, it is not possible to detect MYOBLOC in the peripheral blood following intramuscular or intraglandular injection at the recommended doses.

### Axon-soma communication in neuronal injury [^115Da2Lp]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

The extensive lengths of neuronal processes necessitate efficient mechanisms for communication with the cell body. Neuronal regeneration after nerve injury requires new transcription; thus, long-distance retrograde signalling from axonal lesion sites to the soma and nucleus is required. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mechanistic basis of this system. This has included the discovery of a priming role for early calcium waves; confirmation of central roles for mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling effectors, the importin family of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors and molecular motors such as dynein; and demonstration of the importance of local translation as a key regulatory mechanism. These recent findings provide a coherent mechanistic framework for axon-soma communication in the injured nerve and shed light on the integration of cytoplasmic and nuclear transport in all eukaryotic cells.
