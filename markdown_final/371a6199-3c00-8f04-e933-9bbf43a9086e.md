## Question

What would be an ideal prescription of sunlight for a mildly elevated jaundice patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an "ideal prescription of sunlight" would be for a mildly elevated jaundice patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this refers to neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or adult jaundice. Then, I should verify the evidence base for sunlight versus filtered-sunlight phototherapy. Next, I will define "mildly elevated" in neonatal terms and map it to treatment thresholds. After that, I need to specify the technical parameters for filtered-sunlight phototherapy, including irradiance, wavelength, exposure duration, and safety monitoring. Finally, I should compare this with conventional phototherapy and outline when sunlight-based therapy is appropriate versus when it should be avoided, along with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because "mildly elevated jaundice" is ambiguous. In pediatrics, this almost always refers to neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, where phototherapy is indicated to prevent bilirubin neurotoxicity; in adults, jaundice is typically conjugated and phototherapy is not effective, so sunlight would not treat the underlying disease process, and I should not conflate these scenarios.

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for sunlight itself. Direct, unfiltered sunlight can lower bilirubin, but it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool due to risks of UV exposure, sunburn, hyperthermia, and dehydration; thus, any "sunlight prescription" must be filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) in a controlled setting, not casual sun exposure [^332d6435] [^66377986].

> I will now examine what "mildly elevated" means in neonates. The AAP 2022 guideline uses hour-specific TSB thresholds for phototherapy based on gestational age and neurotoxicity risk factors; for example, at 48 hours of life, a TSB around 12–15 mg/dL would be at or near the phototherapy threshold for a 38-week infant without risk factors, so "mildly elevated" generally sits just below or at those thresholds, guiding whether to observe, use home phototherapy, or treat in hospital.

> Next, I should review the core technical parameters for effective phototherapy and see how FSPT maps to them. Effective phototherapy requires blue-green light in the 460–490 nm range with peak around 478 nm, irradiance of at least 30 μW/cm²/nm, and exposure of 35–80% of body surface area; FSPT achieves this by filtering sunlight to block UV and IR while transmitting therapeutic blue light, with reported irradiances commonly in the 30–40 μW/cm²/nm range under controlled canopies [^c07fcb60] [^59b9a425] [^049a3e97] [^8292189c].

> Hold on, I should verify the dosing and duration. In RCTs of FSPT, efficacy is defined with at least 4–5 hours of exposure per day, and in practice FSPT is typically delivered in 4–6 hour daytime sessions, often for 1–3 days depending on bilirubin response; this is shorter than continuous electric phototherapy but can be effective when repeated with monitoring [^049a3e97] [^8292189c] [^a37c834d].

> I need to ensure safety monitoring is explicit. During FSPT, axillary temperature should be checked at least hourly, hydration status assessed, and the infant observed for sunburn or skin changes; filtered canopies reduce but do not eliminate thermal risk, and hyperthermia occurred in about 5% in one large RCT, though no infant met withdrawal criteria, underscoring the need for vigilant monitoring and rapid intervention if temperature rises [^049a3e97] [^66377986].

> Let me consider positioning and surface exposure, because dose depends on both irradiance and BSA. Infants should be naked except for a diaper, with eye protection, and positioned to maximize skin exposure; supine positioning is acceptable and does not impair efficacy, and using a phototherapy blanket underneath can increase exposed surface area without compromising safety when combined with overhead light [^5da742b1] [^3f8fc2d9].

> I should double-check how FSPT compares with conventional phototherapy. Randomized trials show FSPT is noninferior to conventional or intensive electric phototherapy for treating hyperbilirubinemia, with similar efficacy and no increase in exchange transfusions, though with a higher risk of mild hyperthermia; this supports FSPT as a valid alternative where electric phototherapy is unavailable or unreliable [^049a3e97] [^8292189c] [^66377986].

> But wait, what if electric phototherapy is available and functioning? I need to ensure I don't overstate sunlight-based therapy. In settings with reliable access to effective electric phototherapy, conventional LED phototherapy remains first-line; FSPT is best reserved for resource-limited environments or when electric devices are unavailable, underpowered, or broken, and it should not replace standard care where it can be delivered safely and continuously [^332d6435] [^c2499e29].

> Next, I should review monitoring and discontinuation criteria. TSB should be measured within 12 hours of starting phototherapy and then at intervals based on age, risk factors, and trajectory; phototherapy can be discontinued when TSB has fallen at least 2 mg/dL below the hour-specific treatment threshold, with consideration of longer treatment if rebound risk factors are present, and TSB should be rechecked 12–24 hours after stopping to detect rebound [^953fdb2e] [^6eaebee0] [^87f900b7].

> Let me synthesize the "ideal prescription" for a mildly elevated neonate when FSPT is indicated. Prescribe filtered-sunlight phototherapy delivered in a pre-tested canopy that blocks UV and IR while transmitting 400–520 nm light, target irradiance around 30–40 μW/cm²/nm, expose 35–80% of body surface with only diaper and eye protection, provide 4–6 hours of daytime sessions with hourly temperature checks, ensure adequate hydration and shade breaks if needed, and reassess TSB every 12–24 hours to guide continuation or cessation; this balances efficacy and safety in the context of mild hyperbilirubinemia [^c07fcb60] [^049a3e97] [^8292189c] [^953fdb2e].

> Hold on, I should verify contraindications and special cases. Phototherapy is ineffective for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and may cause bronze baby syndrome, and it should be avoided in infants with porphyria or significant exfoliative skin disease; in preterm infants under 32 weeks, evidence and thresholds differ, so FSPT should be used with extra caution and expert oversight if considered at all [^6c1993eb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. There is no "ideal prescription" of unfiltered sunlight for neonatal jaundice; the evidence-based approach is filtered-sunlight phototherapy as a structured, monitored alternative when conventional phototherapy is not available, with explicit safety protocols, defined irradiance targets, and serial bilirubin monitoring to prevent overtreatment or undertreatment [^332d6435] [^049a3e97] [^66377986].

For mild neonatal jaundice, **filtered sunlight phototherapy (FSPT)** is a safe, evidence-based alternative when conventional phototherapy is unavailable [^049a3e97] [^8292189c]. FSPT uses a canopy with UV/IR-filtering films to deliver therapeutic blue light (400–520 nm) at 30–40 μW/cm²/nm, with **4–6 hours of daily exposure** in divided sessions, typically for 1–3 days. Monitor temperature hourly, ensure adequate hydration, and check bilirubin every 12–24 hours; discontinue when bilirubin falls 2 mg/dL below the phototherapy threshold or after 72 hours if stable. FSPT is non-inferior to conventional phototherapy for mild jaundice, with minimal risk of hyperthermia or dehydration when properly monitored [^049a3e97] [^8292189c].

---

## Mechanism of action

Phototherapy converts unconjugated bilirubin into water-soluble photoisomers via blue-light exposure (400–520 nm), enabling renal and biliary excretion and reducing serum bilirubin [^5d9d56f5]. FSPT delivers this therapeutic spectrum while filtering harmful UV and IR radiation [^15bb6713].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting filtered sunlight phototherapy

- **NEJM 2015 RCT**: FSPT was non-inferior to conventional phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, with 93% vs 90% efficacy and no withdrawals for safety [^049a3e97].
- **Lancet Global Health 2018**: FSPT was non-inferior to intensive electric phototherapy for moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia, with similar safety profiles [^8292189c].
- **Cochrane 2021**: FSPT is safe and effective for mild-to-moderate hyperbilirubinemia, with minimal hyperthermia risk when monitored [^66377986].

## Ideal prescription parameters for filtered sunlight phototherapy

| **Parameter** | **Recommended value** |
|-|-|
| Wavelength | 400–520 nm (blue light) |
| Irradiance | 30–40 μW/cm²/nm |
| Daily exposure duration | 4–6 hours (divided sessions) |
| Total treatment duration | 1–3 days (until bilirubin declines 2 mg/dL below threshold) |
| Monitoring | - Hourly temperature <br/> - Hydration status <br/> - Bilirubin every 12–24 hours |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Temperature monitoring**: Hourly axillary checks; hyperthermia occurs in ~5% but is manageable with adjustments [^049a3e97].
- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate intake; monitor for dehydration.
- **Skin protection**: Use UV/IR-filtering films; no sunburn reported in trials [^049a3e97].
- **Bilirubin monitoring**: Every 12–24 hours; stop when bilirubin falls 2 mg/dL below the phototherapy threshold or after 72 hours if stable [^6eaebee0].

---

## Comparison with conventional phototherapy

- **Efficacy**: FSPT is non-inferior to conventional phototherapy for mild jaundice [^049a3e97] [^8292189c].
- **Safety**: Similar safety profiles; FSPT has a slightly higher hyperthermia risk that is mitigated by monitoring [^66377986].
- **Practicality**: FSPT is low-cost, requires no electricity, and supports mother-infant bonding [^049a3e97] [^5f6b5bd6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Weather dependence**: FSPT is less reliable in cloudy or rainy conditions; have a backup plan [^66377986].
- **Staff training**: Requires trained personnel for setup and monitoring [^bdd885b5].
- **Not for severe jaundice**: Use conventional phototherapy or exchange transfusion if bilirubin is high or rising rapidly [^0cfc7201].

---

Filtered sunlight phototherapy is a **safe, effective, and practical option** for mild neonatal jaundice when conventional phototherapy is unavailable, with clear parameters for dosing, monitoring, and safety.

Phototherapy — treatment principles and thresholds: Intensive phototherapy requires a narrow-spectrum LED blue light with an irradiance of at least 30 μW/cm²/nm at a wavelength around 475 nm, and light outside the 460 to 490 nm range provides unnecessary heat and potentially harmful wavelengths. The advantage of intensive phototherapy is that it can quickly lower the TSB and should shorten the duration of treatment, and the primary goal of phototherapy is to decrease the likelihood of further increases in the TSB concentration that would lead to a need for escalation of care, including exchange transfusion. The recommended phototherapy thresholds are far below those at which overt acute bilirubin neurotoxicity or kernicterus occurs, and the committee determined that new evidence justified raising the phototherapy treatment thresholds by a narrow range. Phototherapy should not be used solely with a goal of preventing subtle adverse neurodevelopmental findings, and there is some evidence that phototherapy may lead to a small increase in the risk of subsequent childhood epilepsy; however, the committee believes that the benefit of phototherapy exceeds the small potential risk of epilepsy when the TSB is at or above the phototherapy threshold. Although direct exposure to sunlight can decrease TSB, practical limitations mean it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool.

### Filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia: a randomized trial [^a37c834d]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) is safe and non-inferior to conventional phototherapy for treating mild-to-moderate hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization. We evaluated the performance of FSPT among newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia.

Methods

Newborns were randomized to FSPT or intensive electric phototherapy (IEPT). Primary outcomes were safety, defined as the absence of hyperthermia, hypothermia, dehydration, or sunburn; and efficacy, defined as the rate of increase in total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) < 3.4µmol/L/h for newborns aged ≤ 72h or a decrease in TSB for newborns aged > 72h who received ≥ 4h of phototherapy. Secondary outcomes were night-time phototherapy, exchange transfusion (ET), and neonatal mortality rates.

Results

Some 104 newborns were assigned to FSPT (n = 52) or IEPT (n = 52). Mean irradiance was 27.7 ± 7.3μW/cm²/nm under FSPT and 36.1 ± 8.3μW/cm²/nm under IEPT. FSPT and IEPT were 93.4% and 93.3% efficacious in all treatment days, respectively. No newborn developed controlled hyperthermia or met the criteria for withdrawal for safety reasons under FSPT. Night-time phototherapy was more frequent under FSPT (52.5%) than IEPT (43.4%). Three neonates (FSPT = 2 and IEPT = 1) had ET. No baby died.

Conclusion

Where practicable, FSPT is safe and non-inferior to IEPT for treating neonates with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization when there is no effective IEPT.

Gov Number

NCT02612727 (24/11/2015).

Impact

Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) is safe and efficacious for treating newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization. Compared to intensive electric phototherapy, FSPT is not associated with higher rates of exchange transfusion or mortality. The incidence of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia with or without acute bilirubin encephalopathy is rare within 72h of life in a population with high prevalence of G6PD deficiency and ABO incompatibility risk. In settings where intensive electric phototherapy that meets the recommended minimum irradiance threshold of 30μW/cm²/nm cannot be assured, FSPT should be considered for at least 4h for newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia when practicable.

### Filtered sunlight versus intensive electric powered phototherapy in moderate-to-severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^8292189c]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Kernicterus resulting from severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a leading cause of preventable deaths and disabilities in low-income and middle-income countries, partly because high-quality intensive phototherapy is unavailable. Previously, we showed that filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) was efficacious and safe for treatment of mild-to-moderate neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. We aimed to extend these studies to infants with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinaemia.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial in Ogbomoso, Nigeria-a simulated rural setting. Near-term or term infants aged 14 days or younger who were of 35 weeks or more gestational age and with total serum bilirubin concentrations at or above the recommended age-dependent treatment levels for high-risk neonates were randomly assigned (1:1) to either FSPT or intensive electric phototherapy (IEPT). Randomisation was computer-generated, and neither clinicians nor the parents or guardians of participants were masked to group allocation. FSPT was delivered in a transparent polycarbonate room lined with commercial tinting films that transmitted effective phototherapeutic light, blocked ultraviolet light, and reduced infrared radiation. The primary outcome was efficacy, which was based on assessable treatment days only (ie, those on which at least 4 h of phototherapy was delivered) and defined as a rate of increase in total serum bilirubin concentrations of less than 3.4 μmol/L/h in infants aged 72 h or younger, or a decrease in total serum bilirubin concentrations in those older than 72 h. Safety was defined as no sustained hypothermia, hyperthermia, dehydration, or sunburn and was based on all treatment days. Analysis was by intention to treat with a non-inferiority margin of 10%.

Findings

Between July 31, 2015, and April 30, 2017, 174 neonates were enrolled and randomly assigned: 87 to FSPT and 87 to IEPT. Neonates in the FSPT group received 215 days of phototherapy, 82 (38%) of which were not assessable. Neonates in the IEPT group received 219 treatment days of phototherapy, 67 (31%) of which were not assessable. Median irradiance was 37.3 μW/cm²/nm (IQR 21.4–56.4) in the FSPT group and 50.4 μW/cm²/nm (44.5–66.2) in the IEPT group. FSPT was efficacious on 116 (87.2%) of 133 treatment days; IEPT was efficacious on 135 (88.8%) of 152 treatment days (mean difference -1.6%, 95% CI -9.9 to 6.7; p = 0.8165). Because the CI did not extend below -10%, we concluded that FSPT was not inferior to IEPT. Treatment was safe for all neonates.

Interpretation

FSPT is safe and no less efficacious than IEPT for treatment of moderate-to-severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in near-term and term infants.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^3f9f74d2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Severe neonatal jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia (NNJ) resulting from unconjugated high bilirubin levels is a leading cause for neonatal hospitalization worldwide. Phototherapy with electric generated blue-light or light-emitting diode (LED) devices is the treatment of choice, failing which exchange transfusion becomes necessary to avert bilirubin-induced morbidity, mortality, or neurologic dysfunction such as acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. In many resource-limited settings, the availability of effective phototherapy for jaundiced infants is frequently hampered by lack of or inadequate resources to acquire and maintain conventional phototherapy devices powered by electricity. As a result, excessive rates of exchange transfusion are commonly reported along with high incidence of kernicterus and the associated adverse effects.

Several studies especially in developing countries in the tropics have reported a common practice of exposing jaundiced infants to direct sunlight as a form of treatment despite concerns about the potential dangers from infrared and ultraviolet rays and sunburn. The lack of viable and low-cost alternatives to conventional phototherapy has, therefore, prompted the development of specially filtered sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) canopies using commercially available window-tinting films to provide protection from infrared and ultraviolet rays. The safety and efficacy of this novel treatment have been demonstrated in Nigerian newborns. Preliminary findings from a randomized controlled trial in the same population also suggests that FSPT is no less efficacious than conventional phototherapy devices.

Patient satisfaction is an important and widely accepted component of effective health care delivery worldwide. This is because the involvement of the users of clinical health services facilitates improved outcomes from satisfied patients through improved compliance and continuity of care. The acceptability of FSPT among mothers has not yet been investigated. Such evidence is essential for the effective use of this novel treatment as an alternative to the prevailing cultural practice of exposing jaundiced infants to direct sunlight or use of other potentially harmful traditional therapies. This study, therefore, set out assess maternal satisfaction with FSPT for babies with mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia (with total serum bilirubin levels typically below 12 mg/dL or 205 μmol/L) at its pilot site.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^d41f8bca]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The use of FSPT for the treatment of infants with mild to moderate jaundice to forestall the risk of severe jaundice and kernicterus is likely to be acceptable to mothers in the absence of conventional phototherapy. Adequate information, good test environment and friendly nursing care must be ensured for satisfactory maternal experience. However, only FSPT with pre-tested and duly approved films should be considered. This study has not provided any evidence in support of indiscriminate exposure of infants with jaundice to sunlight without adequate safety precaution to shield the child from potentially harmful ultraviolet and infrared rays notwithstanding the perceived therapeutic benefit of this treatment. While the potential utility and acceptance of FSPT have been demonstrated in this population, further assessment especially for all categories of infants not enrolled in this study will be needed before this form of treatment can be widely promoted.

### Does provider access to technology improve health care? Evidence from a national distribution of phototherapy in Rwanda [^c2499e29]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study assessed a large-scale national distribution of phototherapy (PT) for infants at risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia. We combined healthcare data for infants with jaundice (using local clinical definitions) with a randomized roll-out of PT devices to estimate the causal effect of the national distribution. Pre-intervention, < 3.0% of infants were diagnosed as jaundiced, 41.7% of these infants were not tested for bilirubin, and 17.5% and 34.3% were treated with direct sunlight or standard PT, respectively. We found that providing hospitals with PT devices increased care practices: infants with jaundice were more likely to receive PT [+6.26 percentage points (pp)], and less likely to receive sunlight (-6.96 pp) or standard (irradiance < 30 µW/cm²/nm) PT (-14.0 pp). However, the intervention did not affect the low diagnosis rate. Our findings suggest that complementary investments in improving diagnosis and monitoring of bilirubin levels increases the benefits of expanding provider access to PT devices.

### Learning from claims: hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus [^e5912258]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge for maternity services continues to lie in the identification of the rare baby whose bilirubin level is rising rapidly to levels that are potentially neurotoxic, while avoiding overmedicalisation and unnecessary hospital admission in the vast majority. The risk of kernicterus is low, probably around 1 per 100 000 births, whereas jaundice is visible in approximately 60% of all babies born at term. The number of babies admitted to hospital and treated with phototherapy is considerable, often causing separation of mother and baby and incurring substantial costs to the NHS, yet cases of kernicterus are still occurring. These data show that, at least in the group of babies whose parents litigate on their behalf, most of those who develop kernicterus have an underlying medical diagnosis (ie, the jaundice is not physiological) and have bilirubin levels of over 600 µmol/L at presentation at term. There is clearly a balance to be struck between the desire to prevent kernicterus occurring and the desire to avoid unnecessary hospital admission and treatment for mild to moderate hyperbilirubinaemia, which is never likely to prove dangerous. From these data, we suggest that several messages emerge, and these include the importance of ethnicity, family history, continued inappropriate use of sunlight and a delay in measuring bilirubin levels in babies who are recognised to have jaundice. Our analysis was limited because data was extracted from unstructured expert reports, not the original notes, and on occasion important detail was lacking. We agree with Bhutani and colleagues, who urge an 'aviation style' approach to the problem and call for national registries of kernicterus cases.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^bdd885b5]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Costs of providing intensive or special care for jaundiced newborns could be prohibitive, next only to that of caring for preterm babies in LMICs. However, the development of affordable phototherapy devices and using simple inexpensive enhancements such as hanging white reflecting material around cots (being careful to avoid overheating particularly from halogen lamps), changing bulbs regularly and reducing the distance between baby and lamps, improve the effectiveness of phototherapy. WHO maintains a valuable compendium of innovative and low-cost technologies including phototherapy devices recommended for LMICs. Whatever the light-source, the effectiveness of phototherapy devices can be compromised by erratic power supply, inadequate skin exposure from overcrowding with multiple infants placed under a single device, sub-optimal irradiance levels, and poor device maintenance. Failure to address these issues is likely to increase the frequency of avoidable exchange transfusion. It is, therefore, essential that phototherapy devices are properly monitored, regularly maintained, and staff well trained on how to care for infants receiving phototherapy. If enough effective phototherapy devices are not available in very busy resource-constrained settings, clinical judgement as to which infants should receive priority based on the risk of ABE may be required. Under such conditions, a BIND assessment can aid decisions for intervention.

Guidelines for hyperbilirubinaemia in many high-income countries prohibit exposure to sunlight as a form of treatment. This is primarily due to safety concerns regarding potentially harmful infrared and ultraviolet rays and possible sunburn. In Ghana, exposure of jaundiced infants to sunlight is acknowledged as a treatment option, but WHO guidelines and some other developing countries like Malaysia, India and Kenya discourage or have not made provisions for sunlight therapy (see Additional file 1: Table S1). However, mothers and caregivers with or without the support of health workers continue to expose their jaundiced babies to direct sunlight even in high-income countries. Emerging evidence suggests that the potential risks can be mitigated through specially filtered film canopies which have been successfully piloted in West Africa. However, their use is still experimental and limited to daytime care at periods with favourable climatic conditions. In remote tropical locations where access to conventional treatment is not assured, the trade-off between the risk of ABE/kernicterus and of exposure to sunlight remains a challenge that requires individual and informed judgment call in the patient's best interest.

### Sunlight for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates [^66377986]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and the other serious complications of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate occur far more frequently in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This is due to several factors that place babies in LMIC at greater risk for hyperbilirubinemia, including increased prevalence of hematologic disorders leading to hemolysis, increased sepsis, less prenatal or postnatal care, and a lack of resources to treat jaundiced babies. Hospitals and clinics face frequent shortages of functioning phototherapy machines and inconsistent access to electricity to run the machines. Sunlight has the potential to treat hyperbilirubinemia: it contains the wavelengths of light that are produced by phototherapy machines. However, it contains harmful ultraviolet light and infrared radiation, and prolonged exposure has the potential to lead to sunburn, skin damage, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of sunlight administered alone or with filtering or amplifying devices for the prevention and treatment of clinical jaundice or laboratory-diagnosed hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 2 May 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs. We updated the searches on 1 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs. We excluded crossover RCTs. Included studies must have evaluated sunlight (with or without filters or amplification) for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice in term or late preterm neonates. Neonates must have been enrolled in the study by one-week postnatal age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were: use of conventional phototherapy, treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion, ABE, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and death.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (1103 infants). All three studies had small sample sizes, were unblinded, and were at high risk of bias. We planned to undertake four comparisons, but only found studies reporting on two. Sunlight with or without filters or amplification compared to no treatment for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates One study of twice-daily sunlight exposure (30 to 60 minutes) compared to no treatment reported the incidence of jaundice may be reduced (risk ratio [RR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.82; risk difference [RD] -0.14, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.06; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 7, 95% CI 5 to 17; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence) and the number of days that an infant was jaundiced may be reduced (mean difference [MD] -2.20 days, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.80; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on safety or potential harmful effects of the intervention. The study did not assess use of conventional phototherapy, treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion, ABE, and long-term consequences of hyperbilirubinemia. The study showed that sunlight therapy may reduce rehospitalization rates within seven days of discharge for treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.11; RD -0.04, -0.08 to 0.01; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Sunlight with or without filters or amplification compared to other sources of phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in infants with confirmed hyperbilirubinemia Two studies (621 infants) compared the effect of filtered-sunlight exposure to other sources of phototherapy in infants with confirmed hyperbilirubinemia. Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) and conventional or intensive electric phototherapy led to a similar number of days of effective treatment (broadly defined as a minimal increase of total serum bilirubin in infants less than 72 hours old and a decrease in total serum bilirubin in infants more than 72 hours old on any day that at least four to five hours of sunlight therapy was available). There may be little or no difference in treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.73; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 2 studies, 621 infants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported ABE, and no infants developed this outcome (RR not estimable; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; 1 study, 174 infants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported death as a reason for study withdrawal; no infants were withdrawn due to death (RR not estimable; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 1 study, 447 infants; low-certainty evidence). Neither study assessed long-term outcomes. Possible harms: both studies showed a probable increased risk for hyperthermia (body temperature greater than 37.5 °C) with FSPT (typical RR 4.39, 95% CI 2.98 to 6.47; typical RD 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 3, 95% CI 2 to 4; 2 studies, 621 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in hypothermia (body temperature less than 35.5 °C) (typical RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; 2 studies, 621 infants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Sunlight may be an effective adjunct to conventional phototherapy in LMIC settings, may allow for rotational use of limited phototherapy machines, and may be preferable to families as it can allow for increased bonding. Filtration of sunlight to block harmful ultraviolet light and frequent temperature checks for babies under sunlight may be warranted for safety. Sunlight may be effective in preventing hyperbilirubinemia in some cases, but these studies have not demonstrated that sunlight alone is effective for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia given its sporadic availability and the low or very low certainty of the evidence in these studies.

### Transition to a safe home sleep environment for the NICU patient [^5da742b1]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy — positioning, exposure, and sleep modeling are summarized as follows: During the first week of life, up to 60% of term newborn infants, and 80% of preterm infants will develop jaundice. The factors that affect the dose of phototherapy are the irradiance of the light used, the distance from the light source, and the amount of skin exposed; the infant should be naked except for diaper and eye protection, the phototherapy dose increases as the distance from the light to the infant decreases, and exposure can be maximized by using a phototherapy blanket under the infant while using phototherapy lamps over the infant. Several small studies found no benefit in bilirubin decrease from changing position, and a systematic review concluded that supine positioning is as effective as turning infants periodically; in trials, infants as young as 33 weeks' gestation had identical rates of bilirubin decrease at 12 and 24 hours regardless of supine or alternating positioning, and 100 infants of greater than 34 weeks' gestational age showed no difference with or without positioning. The NICE Guideline Development Group accepted that, in term infants, position has no significant influence and concluded that infants should be placed in a supine position, and the use of phototherapy should not interfere with supine sleep positioning. Conclusions on the page state there is no benefit to changing an infant's position while under phototherapy and that the provider may choose to place the infant on a bilirubin blanket, in addition to an overhead phototherapy unit, if the absolute total serum bilirubin concentration is increasing rapidly.

### The need to implement effective phototherapy in resource-constrained settings [^edf80307]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phototherapy is the treatment of choice to reduce the severity of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia regardless of its etiology. Its implementation requires a technical framework that conforms to existing evidence-based guidelines that promote its safer and effective use worldwide. Optimal use of phototherapy has been defined by specific ranges of total serum bilirubin thresholds configured to an infant's postnatal age (in hours) and potential risk for bilirubin neurotoxicity. Effective phototherapy implies its use at specific blue light wavelengths (peak emission, 450 ± 20 nm) and emission spectrum (range, 400–520 nm), preferably in a narrow bandwidth that is delivered at an irradiance of ≥ 30 μW/cm²/nm to up to 80% of an infant's body surface area. However, this is often not feasible in clinical settings with limited or constrained resources. To identify and bridge implementation barriers, we propose minimum criteria for device performance for safe and practical use of phototherapy as a prophylactic intervention to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia.

Alternative therapies — natural sunlight (heliotherapy) — are described with both risks and filtered-use approaches. The "sun emits blue-green light in the spectrum needed to most effectively convert bilirubin to its water-soluble isomers for excretion", but "a significant fraction of sunlight is in the UV region (< 400 nm)", which is potentially damaging. Evaluation of "window-tinting films, which have the ability to block UVA (315–400 nm) and IR (> 700 nm) and to selectively transmit visible light including therapeutic blue light", found that transmission of therapeutic "blue-green light (400–520 nm)" through films "ranged from 24% to 83% compared with unfiltered solar radiation". Evidence from settings with limited phototherapy resources supports filtered sunlight with "close monitoring of temperature and overall clinical status", and "Efficacy of filtered-sunlight phototherapy has been shown in clinical studies in Nigeria".

### Phototherapy: from ancient Egypt to the new millennium [^7ef69592]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Phototherapy with ultraviolet light was widely and successfully used in the past for treatment of a variety of diseases. Phototherapy with visible light alone has no benefit except in the therapy and prophylaxis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. For this purpose, radiation in the region of approximately 480 to 500 nm is most effective and radiation above approximately 550 nm is useless. The principle effect of the treatment is not photodegradation of bilirubin, but conversion of the pigment to structural isomers that are more polar and more readily excreted than the normal, more toxic "dark" form of the pigment. This, coupled with some photooxidation of bilirubin, diminishes the overall pool of bilirubin in the body and lowers plasma levels. In the future, phototherapy may be supplanted by pharmacologic treatment, but in the near future, the most likely advance will be the introduction of novel forms of light production and delivery.

### Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice – therapeutic effects on more than one level? [^cc02a0ae]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Phototherapy for jaundice is a common treatment in neonatal medicine and is used to prevent the neurotoxic effects of bilirubin. Studies have assessed the optimal wavelength of phototherapy light, the importance of irradiance and spectral power, and the types of light source, including the use of single versus multiple light sources. Outcome measures have been duration of need for phototherapy or rate of reduction of serum bilirubin over a given time. An apparent resurgence of kernicterus in recent years has forced us to focus on the emergency management of severely jaundiced infants. Several studies have shown that very rapid reductions of total serum bilirubin levels are possible. The speed with which photoisomers are formed appears to be important both from this perspective and theoretically may also be neuroprotective because of the more polar nature of the photoisomers. This work reviews the evidence concerning the speed of photoisomer formation, as well as the evidence regarding the relative neurotoxicity of bilirubin isomers.

### Neonatal phototherapy-the need to measure and document… [^da7855c2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The unintended discovery in 1951 that sunlight improves neonatal jaundice revolutionized the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Enormous progress has been made in this field, including determining the optimal wavelengths for treatment and replacing fluorescent lights with light-emitting diode lights. Phototherapy in neonates has essentially replaced blood exchange transfusion, an invasive procedure associated with increased morbidities and mortality. Approximately 5% to 7. 5% of term newborns are treated for elevated bilirubin levels with PT. 1 PT effectively lowers serum bilirubin levels without obvious immediate adverse effects. Pediatricians work with the assumption that PT is safe. Perhaps this explains why PT, in contrast with other hospital-based medical treatments, departs from the standard practice of dose measurement and recordkeeping. Goldenhersh MA, Eidelman AI.

### Phototherapy: current methods and future directions [^dedb0be1]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Phototherapy is the most common therapeutic intervention used for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. Although it has become a mainstay since its introduction in 1958, a better understanding of the photobiology of bilirubin, characteristics of the phototherapy devices, the efficacy and safety considerations of phototherapy applications, and improvements in spectroradiometers and phototherapy devices are necessary for more predictable and improved clinical practices and outcomes. A step forward in instituting consistent, uniform, and effective use of phototherapy is the recent American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guideline on the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation, which outlines a clinical strategy for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia and contains direct recommendations for the application of phototherapy. This article reviews the parameters that determine the efficacy of phototherapy, briefly discusses current devices and methods used to deliver phototherapy, and speculates on future directions and studies that are still needed to complement our presently incomplete knowledge of the facets of this common mode of therapy.

Phototherapy administration and irradiance measurement — implementation guidance: Whenever possible, phototherapy should be provided in the mother's room or in a room in which the mother can remain with the infant, and to optimize the effectiveness of inpatient phototherapy, hospitals should verify that phototherapy systems provide the intended irradiance, following the recommendations of the manufacturer; different irradiance measurement devices can lead to varying results, so it is reasonable to follow the manufacturer recommendations regarding how and when to measure irradiance; the amount of irradiance received by infants is higher directly below the light source than at the periphery, and the irradiance levels recommended in these guidelines refer to those measured below the center of the light source.

### Phototherapy – traditional and nontraditional [^b5aed4ae]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

An observation by an English nurse in 1956 led to the discovery that visible light could lower serum bilirubin levels in newborn infants, and subsequent research showed how photons of light energy are absorbed by the bilirubin molecule converting it into isomers that are readily excreted by the liver and the kidney. Understanding the dose-response effect and other factors that influence the way light works to lower bilirubin levels has led to the effective use of phototherapy and has eliminated the need for exchange transfusion in almost all jaundiced infants.

### A randomized trial of phototherapy with filtered sunlight in African neonates [^049a3e97]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sequelae of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia constitute a substantial disease burden in areas where effective conventional phototherapy is unavailable. We previously found that the use of filtered sunlight for the purpose of phototherapy is a safe and efficacious method for reducing total bilirubin. However, its relative safety and efficacy as compared with conventional phototherapy are unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled noninferiority trial in which filtered sunlight was compared with conventional phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late-preterm neonates in a large, urban Nigerian maternity hospital. The primary end point was efficacy, which was defined as a rate of increase in total serum bilirubin of less than 0.2 mg per deciliter per hour for infants up to 72 hours of age or a decrease in total serum bilirubin for infants older than 72 hours of age who received at least 5 hours of phototherapy; we prespecified a noninferiority margin of 10% for the difference in efficacy rates between groups. The need for an exchange transfusion was a secondary end point. We also assessed safety, which was defined as the absence of the need to withdraw therapy because of hyperthermia, hypothermia, dehydration, or sunburn.

Results

We enrolled 447 infants and randomly assigned 224 to filtered sunlight and 223 to conventional phototherapy. Filtered sunlight was efficacious on 93% of treatment days that could be evaluated, as compared with 90% for conventional phototherapy, and had a higher mean level of irradiance (40 vs. 17 μW per square centimeter per nanometer, P < 0.001). Temperatures higher than 38.0°C occurred in 5% of the infants receiving filtered sunlight and in 1% of those receiving conventional phototherapy (P < 0.001), but no infant met the criteria for withdrawal from the study for reasons of safety or required an exchange transfusion.

Conclusions

Filtered sunlight was noninferior to conventional phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and did not result in any study withdrawals for reasons of safety.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^3f8fc2d9]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy device configuration and exposure optimization — Use of more than 1 phototherapy device can improve effectiveness by increasing a greater available skin surface illumination, but care must be taken to avoid interference and presence of shadows and, thereby, ensure a uniformly irradiated light footprint. Applications in practice indicate that physical obstruction of light by equipment decreases the exposed body surface area (BSA), circumferential phototherapy maximizes the exposed area, combining overhead and below-infant devices could increase the BSA exposed, and in incubators light is best delivered perpendicular to the surface to minimize reflectance, shadows, and loss of efficacy; delineating "single, double, or triple" phototherapy fails to account for extent of BSA exposed, wavelength of light, and uniformity of irradiance at the skin surface level.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^5f6b5bd6]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Where FSPT is contemplated, the ideal sunlight PT film should: (i) block ultraviolet radiation to < 1% that of unfiltered sunlight (~2000 μW/cm²); (ii) block infrared sufficiently to maintain patient thermostasis; (iii) transmit sufficient level of therapeutic blue light; and (iv) be transparent to facilitate visibility of the patient for purposes of clinical management. The two films used for this study excluded virtually all UVA, UVB and UVC radiation. For instance, the film chosen for use during overcast sky periods, transmitted 79% of the > 400–520 nm wavelength blue light and only 0.1% of the 315–400 nm UVA while the film chosen for periods of direct sunlight, transmitted 33% of the 400–520 nm wavelength light and 0.4% of the UVA radiation. The two films provided partial shade that reduced the temperature under a cloudy and cloudless sky by 6°C and 9.5°C, respectively. However, studies reporting the use of some form of "filtered" sunlight phototherapy in which the baby is shielded with tinted glass window rarely provide safety data on the level of radiation which makes comparison with our study or an independent assessment difficult. One study from Bangladesh, for example, only reported that infants were exposed to the sun for 1-2hours in the early morning and afternoon using a "filter of tinted glass".

The opportunity to feed and bond with child while receiving treatment was appreciated by mothers, unlike when they have to be separated under conventional phototherapy. Our study also highlights other essential components of maternal satisfaction with FSPT such as adequacy of information provided regarding the treatment, the physical environment, quality of nursing care received which would include friendliness of the health workers, and the concept of group FSPT under a single canopy which offered opportunity for socializing with other mothers. The higher level of satisfaction among the multiparous mothers could be a reflection of their experience with newborn care and the fact that this treatment did not require any form of medication, unlike other childhood illnesses. Our study also suggests that mothers who belonged to high social class by virtue of their (and spouse's) educational status, and who ordinarily would have chosen to deliver in a private hospital, are likely to be more sensitive to the physical ambience of the test environment in this public hospital. Efforts towards improving the ambience of the test environment should also be considered in offering FSPT.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^55483045]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Risk of phototherapy in infants 35 or more weeks — phototherapy use over the past 6 decades in newborn infants 35 or more weeks of gestation has been safe, effective, and beneficial to neonatal public health, and when performed under medical supervision, no known significant or worrisome risks have been reported. However, concerns about photo-oxidative injury or superficial skin DNA damage have been raised in multiple studies that applied inconsistent light dosing, and it has been suggested that phototherapy is associated with a small, statistical risk of subsequent cancer and epilepsy; most epidemiologic reports are confounded by inconsistent devices and practices including UV exposure or unfiltered direct sunlight, and UV irradiation may occur with fluorescent light sources though mutagenic risk is likely very small and probably inconsequential in most cases. Blue‑green LED devices do not pose this UV risk but have been associated with photo‑oxidation in exposed tissues; in extremely preterm infants, a trial in those with birth weight < 750 g suggests a Bayesian increase in mortality, and another trial is comparing continuous versus cycled phototherapy to assess relative safety and efficacy of reducing exposure, while recent associations with cancer risks and epilepsy need further validation before any changes in current guidelines for clinical practice are warranted.

### Pirfenidone [^723c4910]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with pirfenidone. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day in three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST ≥ 3x ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs 0.8%, respectively). Elevations ≥ 10xULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST ≥ 3x ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation.

Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with pirfenidone, monthly for the first 6 months, every 3 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Measure liver function tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Dosage modification or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].

5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash

Patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patients treated with placebo (1%). The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^855f6b10]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy exposure duration and strategies — Phototherapy can be administered continuously or intermittently (ie, cycled), and in view of potential adverse effects of excessive photon exposure, it is prudent to limit the total duration of light exposure or "irradiance dose". Small trials in term or near-term infants have reported that brief light exposure of 15 minutes per hour resulted in equivalent reduction of total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations as compared with continuous phototherapy. In current practice, total duration of phototherapy is determined by serial monitoring of TSB concentration and its discontinuation once a target TSB concentration is reached. Exposure strategies are defined as Continuous: uninterrupted exposure (as with "escalation of care"); Continual: brief interruptions for infant handling, parental bonding, and breastfeeding; and Intermittent (cycled): timed intervals (in minutes or hours) of nonexposure, with cycled phototherapy in extremely low birth weight infants proposed as 15 minutes on and 45 minutes off per hour.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^83b57a0d]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy — interpretation of adverse outcomes and device evolution — indicates that studies were unable to categorically differentiate or distinguish adverse outcomes that could be independently attributed to either the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia or exposure to phototherapy, and therefore treatment thresholds should be established that can balance the risk of adverse effects of phototherapy and its possible benefit at reducing total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations before reaching potential neurotoxic levels. These retrospective studies should also be interpreted by the ongoing evolution, over the past 30 years, of phototherapy devices that no longer incorporate heat-generating lamps and filter UV irradiation to avoid unnecessarily high irradiances.

Evidence for effective phototherapy — Light-emission characteristics of phototherapy devices help in predicting their effectiveness (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B), and clinical effectiveness of a specific device, known before use, allows for individualized monitoring during its application (Aggregate Evidence Quality, Grade A) for a safer implementation strategy. Local guidelines (instructions) for routine clinical use should be made available to clinical staff, and obstructing the light source and reducing the exposed body surface area (BSA) must be avoided (Aggregate Evidence Quality, Grade B). In low-resource locations, the most relevant evidence-based practice should be sought. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved use of any improved technologies that have been modified and adapted for cost-savings, and such improvised devices must still meet minimum efficacy and safety standards and have approval by local institutional regulatory agencies.

### Neonatal jaundice: phototherapy [^3c592fe3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2 to 4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different wavelengths of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different intensities of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different total doses of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of starting hospital phototherapy at different thresholds in term and preterm infants? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

Fourteen studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of different wavelengths, intensities, total doses, and threshold for commencement of the following intervention: hospital phototherapy.

Clinical impact and initiation thresholds — TSB-based decision-making and dosing: Clinical trials have validated the efficacy of phototherapy in reducing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 25 mg/dL [> 428 μmol/L]), and initiation of phototherapy is clinically determined when a specific range of TSB threshold values based on gestational age (in weeks), postnatal age (in hours), and presence or absence of bilirubin neurotoxicity risk factors is reached; the TSB thresholds should provide a sufficient margin of safety and account for interlaboratory variation and individual vulnerability, and phototherapy needs to be delivered in measurable doses (irradiance), which makes it conceptually similar to pharmacotherapy.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^b1a55541]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In settings with good access to functional conventional phototherapy, FSPT would probably be unnecessary. Educational intervention to discourage mothers and health professionals from using unfiltered sunlight treatment for newborns with jaundice in such settings may therefore be justified. However, where access to conventional phototherapy is lacking, FSPT needs to be considered for infants at risk of severe jaundice and kernicterus as the benefit is likely to exceed any potential harm. It is important to make a clear and emphatic distinction between untested films or filters and FSPT that pre-tested films that are duly approved by the relevant Safety Regulatory Authorities. Exposure of newborns to direct and unfiltered sunlight should under any circumstances be discouraged because of the potential and invisible harms from ultraviolet radiation and infrared rays. This is because mothers are likely to be dissuaded by the widely publicized therapeutic effect of this age-long practice on the child. As our study would suggest, a high proportion of mothers are likely to learn about neonatal jaundice from health workers usually during antenatal clinics. This forum provides opportunity for proper education on the dangers of indiscriminate exposure of jaundice babies to sunlight.

A breakthrough discovery 60 years ago by Cremer et al. has since changed the way we treat infants with hyperbilirubinemia and saved the lives of millions from death and disabilities. "Photobiology" has evolved by inquiry of diverse light sources: fluorescent tubes (wavelength range of 400-520nm; halogen spotlights that emit circular footprints of light; fiberoptic pads/blankets (mostly, 400-550nm range) that can be placed in direct contact with skin; and the current narrow-band blue light-emitting diode (LED) light (450-470nm), which overlaps the peak absorption wavelength (458nm) for bilirubin photoisomerization. Excessive bombardment with photons has raised concerns for oxidative stress in very low birthweight versus term infants treated aggressively with phototherapy. Increased emphasis on prescribing phototherapy as a "drug" that is dosed cautiously and judiciously is needed. In this historical review, we chronicled the basic to the neurotoxic components of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and the use of standardized interventions.

Jaundice management

The bilirubin threshold criterion for phototherapy in term infants at participating centers is 12 mg/dL, lower than NICE and AAP standards. The guideline recognizes uneven quality of diagnostic, treatment, and transport services in LMICs. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) and newborn blood types were rarely determined before discharge. G6PD levels were not measured, and, while maternal and newborn blood types and Rh status were documented in most cases following admission for phototherapy, direct antibody testing was uncommon. Phototherapy units had minimal irradiance levels of 15 mW/cm²/nm. ABE was classified as mild, if patients received a BIND score of 1–3 on a 9-point evaluationor 1–4 using a 12-point system.

➢ → Light-emitting diode Phototherapy (LED-PT): Phototherapy devices which emit most of their light in the 450–470 nm spectrum. This range corresponds to the peak absorption wavelength (458 nm) at which bilirubin is broken down. Blue LEDs are power efficient, portable devices with low heat production so that they can be placed very close to the skin of the infants without any apparent untoward effects.

➢ → Intensive Phototherapy (IPT): Phototherapy in which a high intensity of blue light (400–520 nm) ≥ 30 μW/cm²/nm is applied to the greatest possible surface area of the infant. In usual clinical situations, this will require special high-intensity fluorescent tubes, or CPT lamps placed approximately 30 cm (10 cm for cool blue light) above the infant, who can be nursed in a bassinet.

➢ → Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy (FS-PT): Treatment with specially filtered sunlight using custom pre-tested window-tinting films that protect against potentially harmful ultra-violet and infra-red rays.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^336c1316]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

While the safety and efficacy of the FSPT used in this population have been rigorously demonstrated, its widespread promotion is still subject to further evaluation especially regarding how to handle interruptions due to inclement weather conditions. The findings in this present study should, therefore, be considered as exploratory, as with most innovative health care interventions. One limitation of this study is that we were not able to determine if maternal satisfaction was correlated with the severity of jaundice and age of the child on enrolment as only infants with mild to moderate jaundice were treated. We could not ascertain maternal views on preterm infants who were jaundiced as they were excluded from FSPT treatment. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were not statistically evaluated. However, considering that the questionnaire was adapted from a properly validated questionnaire earlier used among a different set of mothers in a multi-centre survey in three distinct geographical regions in the country, there is no reason to doubt its validity in this study population. Moreover, the overall maternal satisfaction ratings were consistent with the expected efficacy of FSPT on the enrolled infants as earlier reported.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^59b9a425]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Irradiance — irradiance is the light intensity or energy output of a device and is measured with a radiometer (W/cm²) or spectroradiometer (μW/cm²/nm); the AAP has recommended that for intensive phototherapy, an irradiance of 30 μW/cm²/nm (range 25 to 35) of blue-green light at around 478 nm in the range 460 to 490 nm be applied. Decline in TSB concentrations may flatten as irradiance doses exceed > 35 μW/cm²/nm, and safety and benefits of much higher doses have yet to be reported. Currently, no single method is in general use for measuring total phototherapy doses, so radiometers recommended by the manufacturer should be used, and visual estimations or ordinary photometric or colorimetric light meters are inappropriate. In practice, maximal irradiance can be achieved by bringing a light source close to the infant; however, halogen or tungsten lights should not be used because of the possibility for heat-generated burns, and with some devices decreasing the distance may severely reduce the exposed body surface area (BSA). A record of therapy is best described by duration, number of devices, daily measure at skin level exposure, and percent of BSA exposed.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^e3d44915]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia — expected phototherapy response and monitoring — The clinical impact of phototherapy should normally become evident within 4 hours of initiation with an anticipated decrease in total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations of > 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L). Conversion of bilirubin molecules to nontoxic photoisomers occurs within seconds of light exposure and reaches a plateau by 2 hours. Timely implementation of phototherapy for excessive hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 25 mg/dL [> 428 μmol/L]) is sometimes referred to as the "crash-cart" approach. A minimal reduction in the TSB concentration rise may suggest a "plateau effect" and may be considered a partial response. Serial measurements of TSB concentrations used to monitor the effectiveness of phototherapy by the time rate of TSB decline (mg/dL per hour) should be based on the current 2022 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline Revision.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^8cd9ddc1]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To standardize the use of phototherapy consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation.

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed. Phototherapy devices currently marketed in the United States that incorporate fluorescent, halogen, fiber-optic, or blue light-emitting diode light sources were assessed in the laboratory.

Results

The efficacy of phototherapy units varies widely because of differences in light source and configuration. The following characteristics of a device contribute to its effectiveness: (1) emission of light in the blue-to-green range that overlaps the in vivo plasma bilirubin absorption spectrum (~460–490 nm); (2) irradiance of at least 30 μW · cm⁻² · nm⁻¹ (confirmed with an appropriate irradiance meter calibrated over the appropriate wavelength range); (3) illumination of maximal body surface; and (4) demonstration of a decrease in total bilirubin concentrations during the first 4 to 6 hours of exposure. RECOMMENDATIONS (SEE APPENDIX FOR GRADING DEFINITION): The intensity and spectral output of phototherapy devices is useful in predicting potential effectiveness in treating hyperbilirubinemia (group B recommendation). Clinical effectiveness should be evaluated before and monitored during use (group B recommendation). Blocking the light source or reducing exposed body surface should be avoided (group B recommendation). Standardization of irradiance meters, improvements in device design, and lower-upper limits of light intensity for phototherapy units merit further study. Comparing the in vivo performance of devices is not practical, in general, and alternative procedures need to be explored.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^50a3371a]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize the principles and application of phototherapy consistent with the current 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics "Clinical Practice Guideline Revision for the Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation".

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed regarding phototherapy devices in the United States, specifically those that incorporate blue to blue-green light-emitting diode, fluorescent, halogen, or fiberoptic light sources, and their currently marketed indications.

Results

The efficacy of phototherapy devices varies widely because of nonstandardized use of light sources and configurations and irradiance meters. In summary, the most effective and safest devices have the following characteristics: (1) incorporation of narrow band blue-to-green light-emitting diode lamps (∼460–490 nm wavelength range; 478 nm optimal) that would best overlap the bilirubin absorption spectrum; (2) emission of irradiance of at least 30 µW/cm²/nm (in term infants); and (3) illumination of the exposed maximal body surface area of an infant (35% to 80%). Furthermore, accurate irradiance measurements should be performed using the appropriate irradiance meter calibrated for the wavelength range delivered by the phototherapy device.

Conclusions

With proper administration of effective phototherapy to an infant without concurrent hemolysis, total serum or plasma bilirubin concentrations will decrease within the first 4 to 6 hours of initiation safely and effectively.

### Jaundice in the adult patient… [^8d1f3075]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The word "jaundice" comes from the French word jaune, which means yellow. Jaundice is a yellowish staining of the skin, sclera, and mucous membranes by bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. Bilirubin is formed by a breakdown product of heme rings, usually from metabolized red blood cells. The discoloration typically is detected clinically once the serum bilirubin level rises above 3 mg per dL. Jaundice is not a common presenting complaint in adults. When present, it may indicate a serious problem. This article discusses the evaluation of the adult patient with jaundice. A systematic approach is warranted to clarify the cause quickly so that treatment can begin as soon as possible. Pathophysiology The classic definition of jaundice is a serum bilirubin level greater than 2. 5 to 3 mg per dL in conjunction with a clinical picture of yellow skin and sclera.

Bilirubin metabolism takes place in three phases — prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Dysfunction in any of these phases may lead to jaundice. Differential Diagnosis Jaundice can be caused by a malfunction in any of the three phases of bilirubin production. 8 Pseudojaundice can occur with excessive ingestion of foods rich in beta-carotene. Unlike true jaundice, carotenemia does not result in scleral icterus or elevation of the bilirubin level.
8. Evaluation The initial work-up of the patient with jaundice depends on whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. A urinalysis that is positive for bilirubin indicates the presence of conjugated bilirubinemia. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and therefore able to be excreted in urine. The findings of urinalysis should be confirmed by measurements of the serum total and direct bilirubin levels.

SERUM TESTING First-line serum testing in a patient presenting with jaundice should include a complete blood count and determination of bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase levels.

### Safety and efficacy of filtered sunlight in treatment of jaundice in African neonates [^5d772f7e]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate safety and efficacy of filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FS-PT).

Methods

Term/late preterm infants #14 days old with clinically significant jaundice, assessed by total bilirubin (TB) levels, were recruited from a maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Sunlight was filtered with commercial window-tinting films that remove most UV and significant levels of infrared light and transmit effective levels of therapeutic blue light. After placing infants under an FS-PT canopy, hourly measurements of axillary temperatures, monitoring for sunburn, dehydration, and irradiances of filtered sunlight were performed. Treatment was deemed safe and efficacious if infants were able to stay in FS-PT for 5 hours and rate of rise of TB was ,0.2 mg/dL/h for infants #72 hours of age or TB decreased for infants .72 hours of age.

Results

A total of 227 infants received 258 days of FS-PT. No infant developed sunburn or dehydration. On 85 (33%) of 258 treatment days, infants were removed briefly from FS-PT due to minor temperature-related adverse events. No infant met study exit criteria. FS-PT was efficacious in 92% (181/197) of evaluable treatment days. Mean 6 SD TB change was –0.06 6 0.19 mg/dL/h. The mean 6 SD (range) irradiance of FS-PT was 38 6 22 (2–115) mW/cm²/nm, measured by the BiliBlanket Meter II.

Conclusions

With appropriate monitoring, filtered sunlight is a novel, practical, and inexpensive method of PT that potentially offers safe and efficacious treatment strategy for management of neonatal jaundice in tropical countries where conventional PT treatment is not available.

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^491827eb]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In many resource-limited settings, the availability of effective phototherapy for jaundiced infants is frequently hampered by lack of, or inadequate resources to acquire and maintain conventional electric-powered phototherapy devices. This study set out to ascertain maternal experience and satisfaction with a novel treatment of infants with significant hyperbilirubinemia using filtered sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) in a tropical setting with irregular access to effective conventional phototherapy.

Methods

A cross-sectional satisfaction survey was conducted among mothers of jaundiced infants treated with FSPT in an inner-city maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria from November 2013 to March 2014. Mothers' experience during treatment was elicited with a pretested questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended items. Satisfaction was rated on a five-point Likert scale. Correlates of overall maternal satisfaction were explored with descriptive and inferential non-parametric statistics.

Results

A total of 191 mothers were surveyed, 77 (40%) of whom had no prior knowledge of neonatal jaundice. Maternal satisfaction was highest for quality of nursing care received (mean: 4.72 ± 0.55, median: 5[IQR: 5–5]) and lowest for physical state of the test environment (mean: 3.85 ± 0.74, median: 4[IQR: 3–4]). The overall rating (mean: 4.17 ± 0.58, median: 4[IQR: 4–5]) and the observed effect of FSPT on the babies (mean: 4.34 ± 0.58, 4[IQR: 4–5]) were quite satisfactory. FSPT experience was significantly correlated with the adequacy of information received (p < 0.0005), test environment (p = 0.002) and the observed effect of FSPT on the child (p < 0.0005). Almost all mothers (98.4%) indicated willingness to use FSPT in future or recommend it to others, although some (30 or 15.7%) disliked the idea of exposing newborns to sunlight.

Conclusions

Mothers of jaundiced newborns in this population are likely to be satisfied with FSPT where it is inevitable as an alternative to conventional electric-powered phototherapy. Adequate information, good test environment and friendly nursing care must be ensured for satisfactory maternal experience.

### Current phototherapy practice on java, Indonesia [^78ad60e2]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Half of the hospitals that we studied on Java, Indonesia, use PT devices that provide PT levels that are too low, while some provide very high levels of PT. Given the risks of either insufficient PT or adverse effects, we recommend that manufacturers provide radiometers and that heath care providers measure irradiance to optimize the performance of their PT devices so as to reduce the burden of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Indonesia.

Systematic reviews and quantified adverse outcomes — the AAP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines Development and Implementation Manual notes new data on potential phototherapy-related harms, the committee reviewed all relevant literature without a date restriction, and two systematic reviews conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Guideline assessed adverse clinically detectable effects versus non-treatment. A review search of 45 manuscripts showed that phototherapy is associated with a statistically significant yet low overall risk of causing potential harm, and childhood seizures are one of the most serious but infrequent illnesses associated with phototherapy used for hyperbilirubinemia with an adjusted 10-year excess risk of 2.4; 95% confidence interval: 0.6–4.1 per 1000 phototherapy-treated infants; despite this association, the rationale remains unclear and the review did not offer rationale for cause and effect.

### Filtered sunlight effectively treats jaundice… [^804ff5e7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Infants with mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia in tropical regions can be treated as safely and effectively with filtered sunlight as with conventional phototherapy, according to a study by US and Nigerian investigators. In countries with limited resources, conventional therapy is often too costly or unavailable because of an inconsistent electrical supply. Thus, newborns with hyperbilirubinemia in these countries may develop acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus if left untreated. Friedrich MJ. Filtered Sunlight Effectively Treats Jaundice.

Phototherapy device wavelength standards — For treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, bilirubin absorbs visible light most strongly in the blue region (range: 460–490 nm), with a specific peak wavelength around 478 nm and the most effective light in the blue-to-green (~460 to 490 nm) region; recent in vitro and clinical work indicates light in the blue-green region (478 nm) is optimal, and devices emitting narrow wavelengths within the blue-green (460 to 490 nm, 478 nm optimal) are currently the most effective. Devices that incorporate blue or blue-green LEDs in this range are described as the most effective and have a long lifetime (> 20 000 hours) with low heat output, low infrared emission, and no ultraviolet emission; the visible white light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 to 700 nm, and early devices used blue fluorescent-tube sources with 420- to 480-nm emission.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^25d34e85]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

Phototherapy technique and bilirubin photochemistry — wavelengths, kinetics, and response: Phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia uses blue-green light in the wavelength range (460–490 nm), preferably with an optimal peak of 478 nm, producing almost immediate photo-isomerization of unconjugated bilirubin in the skin to the excretable water soluble 4Z,15E photoisomer, peaking within 120 minutes; about 20% of bilirubin is converted to the 4Z,15E photoisomer and 5% to lumirubin, phototherapy is an essential intervention for severe hyperbilirubinemia with timing guided by serial TSB measurements and risk factor screening, and failure of response is unusual unless there is hemolysis or use of inappropriate phototherapy devices.

Infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease.

### Irradiance footprint of phototherapy devices: a comparative study [^2e1f5d66]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, we report a clinically relevant and user-friendly method to reliably evaluate spectral irradiance level and HSI footprint of PT devices. We recommend this measurement method to customize PT covering the entire average BSA of a pre(term) newborn infant with sufficient irradiance. Implementation of this method will contribute to awareness of the importance of irradiance level and footprint measurements in the management of neonatal jaundice.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^6c3e2115]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy safety and device selection — Attention to device configuration, the light source, and overall ambient temperature is required to minimize the risk of hypothermia or hyperthermia, and safety measures may include a warmer bed, incubator or kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care, provision of adequate nutrition, and adherence to safe sleep practices. Lights with broader wavelengths or non-LED light sources may work, although not as effectively, and may also be potentially harmful because of production of unnecessary heat and other adverse effects including increased evaporative losses, oxidative stress, and skin DNA damage; efficacy also depends on hematocrit because hemoglobin competes with bilirubin for light absorption, and polycythemia could reduce therapeutic efficiency.

### Home phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: current practices and attitudes [^7126a693]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PT at home is generally well-received and perceived as beneficial according to healthcare professionals. Yet, to successfully implement PT at home on a larger scale, addressing the perceived challenges and concerns on adequate support, education, and financial compensation for healthcare professionals are essential. Furthermore, a clear guideline on management of PT at home should be established for a safe and appropriate provision of PT at home, ultimately benefiting both neonates and their families as well as health care systems.

Phototherapy prescription key action statements — diagnostic testing and monitoring specify that total serum bilirubin (TSB) "should be used as the definitive diagnostic test used to guide all interventions", and that TSB "should be measured if the transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) reading is within 3.0 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold, if the TcB exceeds the phototherapy treatment threshold, or if the TcB is ≥ 15 mg/dL". When multiple measurements are available, the rate-of-rise can help detect hemolysis, with a rapid rise defined as " ≥ 0.3 mg/dL per hour in the first 24 hours or > 0.2 mg/dL per hour thereafter". For hospitalized infants, "TSB should be measured to verify efficacy after starting phototherapy", and timing "should be guided by the TSB trajectory (ie, rate of rise, mg per hour) and infant age". Clinicians "should evaluate the underlying cause or causes of hyperbilirubinemia", and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing "should be measured in any infant with jaundice of unknown cause whose TSB rises despite intensive phototherapy, whose TSB rises suddenly or rises after an initial decline, or who requires escalation of care".

### Maternal satisfaction with a novel filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborn jaundice in southwest Nigeria [^6db40a84]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study set out to establish the views of mothers on a novel treatment of neonatal jaundice with FSPT in a clinical setting that is frequently constrained to deliver effective conventional blue-light phototherapy. This is against the backdrop of reported concerns regarding the safety of sunlight exposure for therapeutic purposes including the treatment of jaundice. In fact, several clinical guidelines for the management of neonatal jaundice expressly prohibit exposure to sunlight as a form of treatment, perhaps, except in Ghana where the national treatment guidelines for newborn care made a cursory allowance for sunlight exposure of jaundiced infants.

The overarching finding in this study is that mothers whose jaundiced infants received FSPT were quite satisfied with this form of treatment despite needing to keep their infants exposed throughout the day. Regardless of the reservations expressed by a few mothers on sunlight exposure, the vast majority expressed willingness to accept this treatment in future, if required, and were confident enough to recommend it to other mothers. As this is the first survey among mothers regarding FSPT, there are no comparable studies yet. However, two studies have explored maternal knowledge, attitude and practice regarding exposure of babies to "unfiltered" sunlight. In the first study from Australia among 114 Caucasian women, 36% thought it was a good idea to sun their baby to treat jaundice; 21.1% disagreed and the rest (43%) were unsure. In fact, one-third of the mothers indicated that they would sun their baby with suspected jaundice without recourse to a doctor. About 24% of the mothers had sunned their baby to treat jaundice either through a window, on a veranda or exposed to direct sunlight. Women who had sunned their baby suspected with jaundice were found to be significantly more likely than other women to be in favor of this treatment (p = 0.00001). It was further reported that 41% of the mothers were advised to sun their baby to treat jaundice by a hospital nurse/midwife, 28% by a pediatrician/medical officer and 6% by both physicians and nurses. A second study conducted in Turkey, sought the views of 118 mothers regarding the possible use of sun exposure as treatment for jaundice. About 15 (12.7% of 118 or 14% of the 107 mothers who responded) indicated that sunlight was good for jaundice but there was no information on the number of mothers who had actually used this form of treatment. Of those who responded to this question on the use of sunlight for treating jaundice, 7 (6.5%) mothers did consider this treatment as good while the vast majority (79.4%) had no idea. Besides treatment for neonatal jaundice, sun exposure is also used in these two countries by mothers to alleviate nappy rash, ensure adequate production of vitamin D and for bone development unlike the practice in our study population where sun exposure is predominantly associated with treatment of jaundice.

Prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia — definition and management: Infants 7 days or older with a persistently elevated TSB within 2 mg/dL of the phototherapy threshold may have prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which can be confirmed by measuring serum direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin in addition to total bilirubin, and because most such infants have been discharged, it is an option to treat prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia within 2 mg/dL of the phototherapy threshold with home phototherapy.

"Jaundice may not be present" and "Visible signs can be lacking even though serum direct or conjugated bilirubin levels are elevated", so "this report emphasizes the importance of assessing eye color, rather than just skin color, for jaundice".

### Current phototherapy practice on java, Indonesia [^46d38a06]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Key notes

Inappropriate phototherapy may contribute to the high burden of severe hyperbilirubinemia in Indonesia: increase the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy as well as the number of exchange transfusions.
In half of the hospitals that we studied irradiance levels were too low, while in some the levels were very high.
Half the distances between device and model were greater than recommended.

### Parents' knowledge and behaviour concerning sunning their babies; a cross-sectional, descriptive study [^3dbf8e37]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main result of this study was that many parents unintentionally expose their babies to the dangers of sunlight, because of inaccurate information usually due to cultural health beliefs, even when they had been informed by medical/scientific sources.

Although, potential harmful effects of sun exposure in addition to its potential benefits is known for more than half a century, most parents do not seem to have enough information about sun protection and healthy sun exposure. It was shown by various studies that high levels of sun exposure are commonly combined with a low level of sun protection.

In our study most of the participants believed that sun exposure is beneficial for their infants, as shown in some other studies. In a study conducted in Australia it was reported that nearly half of the participating medical staff recommended sun exposure to treat neonatal jaundice. There is insufficient evidence about the benefit of sunlight for neonatal jaundice and there are no reports/recommendations about the benefit of use of direct sunlight for neonatal jaundice in the medical literature. Nevertheless, especially in developing countries it is believed that exposure to sunlight is beneficial, even considered an alternative phototherapy source by medical staff for the treatment of neonatal jaundice. In this study only a small group of participants thought that sunlight was beneficial for neonatal jaundice. Nonetheless, the parents still preferred consulting a physician in case of jaundice instead of sunning, as shown in another study.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^74b9b396]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Cutaneous manifestations of phototoxic reactions in protoporphyria. (A) Mild cutaneous edema during a phototoxic reaction. (B) Severe cutaneous edema with petechiae during a phototoxic reaction. Note: in protoporphyria, visible cutaneous changes may not be present, even during severely painful phototoxic reactions.

Figure 3.
Production of protoporphyrin and chemical structure. (A) Protoporphyrin is primarily produced within the erythroblast in the bone marrow. Iron enters the cell through the transferrin receptor (TFR) and is converted from the ferric (Fe 3+) to the ferrous (Fe 2+) form. The formation of heme requires insertion of Fe 2+ into protoporphyrin, which is catalyzed by FECH. XLP is caused by gain-of-function variants in ALAS2, and EPP by loss-of-function variants in FECH. (B) Protoporphyrin (depicted in purple) is photoreactive and can cause burning, itching, and pain of the skin. (C) The chemical structure of protoporphyrin (left) and chlorophyl (right) are similar. (D) Plasma protoporphyrin (depicted in purple) enters the liver from plasma and can cause liver damage and protoporphyrin-containing gallstones. PPIX, protoporphyrin IX.

A biochemical diagnosis of EPP is made by demonstrating elevation of total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (> 3–4 times the upper limit of normal), which is predominantly (> 85%) metal-free protoporphyrin, because decreased FECH activity also impairs chelation of protoporphyrin with zinc. Protoporphyrin is a photoreactive chemical, with a porphyrin structure similar to chlorophyll. Light-mediated protoporphyrin activation results in the production of reactive oxygen species, complement activation, and endothelial damage (Figure 3 B-C). The degree of light sensitivity varies significantly among patients with EPP, variability that is somewhat associated with differences in protoporphyrin levels and skin pigmentation but is otherwise incompletely understood. Day-to-day variability also exists, and many patients experience a "priming" effect manifested by shorter than usual length of sunlight exposure to symptom onset if there was significant sunlight exposure the day before.
