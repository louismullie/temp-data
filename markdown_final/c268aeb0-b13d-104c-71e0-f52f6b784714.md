## Question

65. (10–11 grades) Into how many parts do the planes of the faces of a tetrahedron divide space?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many regions the planes of the faces of a tetrahedron divide 3D space into. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic setup: a tetrahedron has four triangular faces, so four planes in general position in 3D. Then, I should verify the general formula for how n planes divide space. Next, I will check whether the tetrahedron's face planes are in "general position" so the formula applies. Finally, I will compute the number of regions and reconcile any edge cases or exceptions that might arise from the specific geometry of a tetrahedron.

> Let me first confirm the setup. A tetrahedron has four faces, each lying on a plane, so we are asking how many regions four planes create in 3D space. I should confirm that these planes are not all parallel and not all intersecting in a single line, because that would reduce the number of regions. Wait, let me verify the configuration: the four face planes of a regular tetrahedron intersect pairwise and triply in a way that is indeed "general position" for the purpose of counting regions, so the standard formula should apply.

> Next, I should review the general formula. For n planes in 3D, the maximum number of regions R(n) is given by R(n) = (n³ + 5n + 6)/6. Hold on, I should verify that expression. Yes, that's correct for n planes in general position, and it simplifies to R(n) = (n³ + 5n + 6)/6. For n = 4, this yields R(4) = (64 + 20 + 6)/6 = 90/6 = 15 regions. So, if the tetrahedron's four face planes are in general position, the answer would be 15 regions.

> But wait, what if the tetrahedron's geometry imposes a special intersection pattern that reduces the count? I need to ensure I'm not overcounting. Let me consider the actual intersections: each pair of face planes intersects in a line, and each triple of face planes intersects at a vertex of the tetrahedron; there is no common intersection of all four planes, which aligns with the "general position" assumption for the formula. Therefore, the formula should hold, and the number of regions is 15.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the answer might be 16 because I recalled a pattern where adding a plane sometimes doubles the count, but that would be misleading here. Let me reconsider: the formula is cubic in n, not simply exponential, and for n = 4 it unequivocally gives 15 regions. I should double-check the arithmetic: (4³ + 5×4 + 6)/6 = (64 + 20 + 6)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Yes, 15 is correct, not 16.

> Final answer: The four planes of the tetrahedron's faces divide 3D space into 15 regions.

---

The four planes of a tetrahedron's faces divide space into **15 regions**: 1 bounded (the tetrahedron itself) and 14 unbounded. This follows from the general formula for the maximum number of regions created by *n* planes in 3D space, which is (n³ + 5n + 6)/6; for n = 4, this equals 15. The tetrahedron's planes are in general position (no two parallel, no three collinear), so the maximum is achieved.

---

## General formula for regions created by planes in 3D space

The maximum number of regions R(n) created by *n* planes in 3D space is given by:

R(n) = (n³ + 5n + 6)/6

This formula assumes the planes are in **general position** (no two parallel, no three intersecting in a line, and no four intersecting at a single point).

---

## Application to a tetrahedron

A tetrahedron has **four triangular faces**, each lying on a distinct plane. These planes are in general position:

- **No two planes are parallel**: Each pair of faces meets at an edge.
- **No three planes intersect in a single line**: Each triple of faces meets at a vertex.
- **No four planes intersect at a single point**: The four vertices are distinct.

Thus, the formula applies directly with n = 4:

R(4) = (4³ + 5×4 + 6)/6 = (64 + 20 + 6)/6 = 90/6 = 15

---

## Breakdown of regions

Of the 15 regions, **1 is bounded** (the interior of the tetrahedron) and **14 are unbounded** (extending infinitely outward).

---

## Verification through geometric reasoning

We can verify this stepwise:

- **1 plane**: Divides space into 2 regions.
- **2 planes**: Divide space into 4 regions (if intersecting).
- **3 planes**: Divide space into 8 regions (if no two parallel and no three collinear).
- **4 planes**: Adds 7 new regions, totaling 15.

Each new plane intersects all previous planes, creating new regions equal to the number of existing regions it cuts through.

---

## Conclusion

The four planes of a tetrahedron's faces divide space into **15 regions**: 1 bounded and 14 unbounded. This result aligns with the general formula for planes in general position and is confirmed by geometric reasoning.

Free energy single-cell occupancy model

An approximate single-cell occupancy model is used to estimate free energy (F) as a function of packing fraction (ϕ) (Fig. 3a). This model is one of the several methods to analytically calculate the free energy of a hard-particle system and has only been used to model hard spheres in different phases –. Other similar cell methods have also been developed to calculate the densest packing states of polygons, and subsequently, the free volume of certain packing structures. Cell models use the phase of interest (for spheres, face-centered cubic or hexagonal closed-packed) at the highest packing fraction and partitions each particle center inside Voronoi polyhedrons, known as cells. For spheres packed in a face-centered cubic or hexagonal closed-packed phase, the corresponding Voronoi polyhedron would be a dodecahedron. This model assumes that each particle is constrained within its own cell and can only access the volume associated with its own cell. The Voronoi cell can then be scaled equally in 3D to decrease the packing fraction, and effectively increase the volume accessible to each particle. The total accessible volume of each cell can then be used to estimate the free energy of the system as a function of packing fraction, ϕ:

Utilizing longitudinal data and the movement on the tetrahedron for early detection of transitions from health to disease state

After finding the tetrahedron and characterizing the archetypes and the tradeoffs in the system, we used longitudinal data to study how individuals move on the tetrahedron over time. Moving towards the unhealthy-archetype is associated with higher levels of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease markers including insulin, glucose, LPIR, triglycerides, LDL. Therefore, advancing towards this archetype indicates possible deteriorating health. In contrast — moving away from the unhealthy-archetype towards the healthy plane suggests improvement in wellness. Indeed, when we correlated the distances between the archetypes and health markers such as weight and BMI, we obtained positive correlation with the older-archetype, and anti-correlation with the unhealthy-archetype (Supplementary Fig. 8).

### The geometry of clinical labs and wellness States from deeply phenotyped humans [^113TkEMy]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Longitudinal multi-omics measurements are highly valuable in studying heterogeneity in health and disease phenotypes. For thousands of people, we have collected longitudinal multi-omics data. To analyze, interpret and visualize this extremely high-dimensional data, we use the Pareto Task Inference (ParTI) method. We find that the clinical labs data fall within a tetrahedron. We then use all other data types to characterize the four archetypes. We find that the tetrahedron comprises three wellness states, defining a wellness triangular plane, and one aberrant health state that captures aspects of commonality in movement away from wellness. We reveal the tradeoffs that shape the data and their hierarchy, and use longitudinal data to observe individual trajectories. We then demonstrate how the movement on the tetrahedron can be used for detecting unexpected trajectories, which might indicate transitions from health to disease and reveal abnormal conditions, even when all individual blood measurements are in the norm.

### Quantitative 3D structural analysis of small colloidal assemblies under native conditions by liquid-cell fast electron tomography [^1149r46t]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantitative indicators

Regarding 3D tomographic imaging of colloidal assemblies of Au NPs within a polymeric shell, surface area, volume, and regularity index serve as vital metrics for characterizing assembly structures. By analyzing the polyhedron formed by the assembled Au NPs inside the polymeric shell, these metrics are calculated.

The surface area measures the combined area of the polyhedron's faces, providing insight into the extent of surface interactions between NPs and the polymeric shell, which can influence the stability of the colloidal assembly. To calculate surface area, the areas of all the polyhedron's faces are summed up:where A i is the area of the i th face of the polyhedron.

The volume quantifies the space enclosed by the polyhedron formed by the Au NPs. This metric offers information about the density and packing of the NPs within the polymeric shell, which can affect the assembly's mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. We calculate the volume (V) by dividing the polyhedron into smaller parts, such as tetrahedrons or cubes, and summing their volumes:where V i is the volume of the i th tetrahedron or cube.

The regularity index measures the polyhedron's regularity. This metric provides information about the degree of order and symmetry in the assembly, which can influence the physical and chemical properties of the colloidal assembly. We calculate the regularity index (R) by comparing the polyhedron to a regular polyhedron with the same number of faces and vertices and measuring the deviation from the regular shape in terms of the angles and lengths of the edges and faces:where θ i and θ r are the angles of the i th and regular faces of the polyhedron, l i and l r are the lengths of the i th and regular edges of the polyhedron, d i is the distance of the i th vertex from the center of the polyhedron, and n is the number of faces of the polyhedron. For reference, the ideal or 'regular' polyhedron considered has identical face and vertex counts as the Au NP-formed polyhedron. The closer the value of R is to zero, the more regular or symmetric the polyhedron. A lower regularity index indicates a structure closely resembling an ideal polyhedron, suggesting high order and symmetry. Conversely, a higher regularity index points to irregularity.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^114eg7uj]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

Introduction

Colloidal particles can self-assemble into ordered crystals with extraordinary nano and mesoscale complexityand unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. These emergent properties depend on the properties of the constituent particle and the crystal phase of the final ordered structures. The phase behavior of self-assembled colloidal structures depend on a variety of factors, such as shape, surface interactions, and external fields. Two-dimensional (2D), hard-particle colloidal systems are of interest because they are entropically driven, and their final assembly state solely depends on the shape and packing fraction of the particles. Previous computationaland experimental studies have shown interesting crystallization behavior (from liquid to solid) and crystal structures in 2D systems consisting of spherical colloids, ellipses, rods and rectangles –, squares, triangles, and hexagons. Hard or nearly hard spheres are commonly observed to form face-centered cubic structures. Complex three-dimensional (3D) structures such as diamond, space-filling polyhedral packing, and porous lattices have been formed by using patchy DNA interactions, shape-dependent entropic forces, or magnetic, gravitational, and capillary forces –. A wide range of hard-particle 3D assemblies have been extensively predicted in simulation, but are challenging to experimentally achieve and image.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^113SY3FU]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The construction of the polyhedral models and their duals is described below.

Construction of polyhedral designs

Consider two lines intersecting at an angle of 60° at the centre of one of the hexagons in the hexagonal (sub)lattice of a given Archimedean lattice. Counting steps between midpoints of adjacent hexagons along these lines via the integer coordinatesand, thencharacterises the positions of other hexagons in the (sub)lattice with respect to the original one, i.e. Using the line connecting the midpoints of these hexagons as the edge of an equilateral triangle of an icosahedral face (Supplementary Fig. 1), the position of the remainder of that surface is uniquely determined, andthus defines a planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the Archimedean lattice (see examples in Fig. 2). The corresponding polyhedral shape in three dimensions is an icosahedron, obtained via identification of edges of the planar embedding. The numbers of pentagonal, hexagonal, triangular and square faces in the Archimedean lattice overlapping with this icosahedral surface for different values ofandare provided in Supplementary Tables 1–4 for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. In particular, an icosahedral face given bycontains either no additional face (hexagonal case), one triangle (trihexagonal case), four triangles (snub hexagonal case), or one triangle and a square (rhombitrihexagonal case), that each form the start of an infinite series of polyhedra.

Construction of the dual lattices

For each polyhedron in the above classification, we construct a dual polyhedron. For this, vertices are positioned at the centres of the polyhedral faces, and vertices associated with adjacent faces connected by straight lines. Since Archimedean lattices have a single type of vertex environment, these dual polyhedra each have a single type of face that corresponds to the fundamental domain of a Laves lattice. These faces are triangles, rhombs, florets and kites for the hexagonal, trihexagonal, snub hexagonal and rhombitrihexagonal lattice, respectively. Using again the planar embedding of an icosahedral surface into the associated Archimedean lattice, we determine the numbers of each such face for polyhedra characterised byandas above; their numbers are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

### The geometry of clinical labs and wellness States from deeply phenotyped humans [^116NvCAh]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Overall, 30 trajectories (2.5%) had a time-point that exceeded the tetrahedron boundaries, but there was only one trajectory that had 3 time-points that were out of the convex hull (described above) and another one that had 5 of 6 timepoints outside the simplex. This trajectory belongs to a 64 years old woman who was diagnosed with stage III bladder cancer, prior to these measurements (Fig. 6). Most cancers are undetectable through typical clinical lab tests. The measurement of specific proteins is usually used as biomarkers for different types of cancers –. Interestingly, all clinical labs measurements for this participant fall in the center of the distribution for all analytes in all visits (Supplementary Fig. 12). However, using longitudinal data and drawing her personal trajectory on the tetrahedron revealed unusual movement, which might indicate an underlying condition. Despite the limitation of the dataset, these few examples demonstrate how personal trajectories and the movement on the tetrahedron can be used to detect transitions from health to disease states, and vice versa, even when other computational and statistical tools show no indication of such a transition.

### Superstructures generated from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots [^1161ZgsN]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The assembly of uniform nanocrystal building blocks into well ordered superstructures is a fundamental strategy for the generation of meso- and macroscale metamaterials with emergent nanoscopic functionalities 1–10. The packing of spherical nanocrystals, which frequently adopt dense, face-centred-cubic or hexagonal-close-packed arrangements at thermodynamic equilibrium, has been much more widely studied than that of non-spherical, polyhedral nanocrystals, despite the fact that the latter have intriguing anisotropic properties resulting from the shapes of the building blocks 11–13. Here we report the packing of truncated tetrahedral quantum dot nanocrystals into three distinct superstructures-one-dimensional chiral tetrahelices, two-dimensional quasicrystal-approximant superlattices and three-dimensional cluster-based body-centred-cubic single supercrystals-by controlling the assembly conditions. Using techniques in real and reciprocal spaces, we successfully characterized the superstructures from their nanocrystal translational orderings down to the atomic-orientation alignments of individual quantum dots. Our packing models showed that formation of the nanocrystal superstructures is dominated by the selective facet-to-facet contact induced by the anisotropic patchiness of the tetrahedra. This study provides information about the packing of non-spherical nanocrystals into complex superstructures, and may enhance the potential of self-assembled nanocrystal metamaterials in practical applications.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^113P1Zbp]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

When calculating subject motion, it is important to be precise about the respective reference frame. If motion is calculated w.r.t. the first image in a timeseries, this measure is known as total displacement (TD). It describes how far away from the original position a subject moved in the course of the session. This, however, is not necessarily the most relevant measure, as slow movements are more easily accounted for than rapid motion spikes (Maknojia et al.). For the latter in particular, scan‐to‐scan displacement (STS) is more relevant, which uses the individually preceding volume as the reference frame. The way these two indicators are calculated is similar, using a 3D expansion of Pythagoras theorem (Wilke) to calculate the joint displacement resulting from all shifts and all rotations.

2.1 Open Questions

While it is trivial to estimate the volumetric effects of simple shifts (see example in the introduction), it is far from trivial to account for rotations as there is a multitude of possible rotatory effects, and their combinations, on a 3D volume. Computing the exact overlap between two arbitrarily‐rotated cubic volumes, therefore, is mathematically highly challenging. However, while no elegant algebraic solution exists, it is possible to assess the overlap by using a geometric approach. Here, the reference voxel is defined as the intersection of six planar boundaries, with each plane dividing space into two categories: "definitely outside" and "potentially inside"; the intersection of all "potentially inside" volumes then unequivocally defines the cube. For example, consider a dice on a table and its top surface showing, for example, "1". Everything above that surface is outside of the dice, while everything below may be inside. The lower (opposite) surface will then be defined by the face of the dice showing "6", which in our example is facing the table. Again, everything below that surface is outside. Repeating this process of exclusion with the "4 & 3" and the "2 & 5" faces will unequivocally define the space, and hence, the volume of the dice. The intersection of a moved cube with a reference cube can therefore be calculated by iteratively looping over all six planes (of the reference cube) and by therewith removing all "definitely outside" sections (of the moved cube). The remaining part constitutes the overlapping remnant of the moved cube, the volume of which can then be computed.

### AAnet resolves a continuum of spatially localized cell States to unveil intratumoral heterogeneity [^117XLfMK]. Cancer Discovery (2025). Medium credibility.

Simulated Datasets

Many datasets naturally exist with archetypal geometry because of trade-offs between different selective pressures. However, due to the high degree of nonlinearity in single-cell data, we do not expect there to be a linear relationship between the feature space and the archetypal space. Thus, to compare AAnet with other unsupervised tasks and AA approaches, we developed an approach to simulate points sampled from a simplex in which we can tune the amount of nonlinearity to test the association between nonlinearity and method performance.

For this approach, we sampled Euclidean points uniformly from an N-dimensional simplex with a specified radius. Then, we computed the inverse of a stereographic projection, mapping points to (N − 1)-dimensional space on the unit hypersphere. This allows us to obtain datasets with ground truth simplicial structure (for any N) and tunable nonlinearity (wherein the higher radius corresponds to more curvature; Supplementary Fig. S1A).

For comparisons in Supplementary Fig. S1, we sample 10,000 points from a three-simplex (a tetrahedron) projected onto a hypersphere. This results in a curved tetrahedron, wherein the ground truth ATs do not correspond to the extrema in the data space (as they would for a classic tetrahedron). We embed the curved tetrahedron with data visualization approach PHATE and visualize the ground truth ATs and archetypal affinity. Additionally, we simulated a signal, defined by the sine of the ground truth affinity between AT4 and all other points in the tetrahedron. This signal is defined by its nonlinear relation to a ground truth AT and is designed to model biological processes that are enriched with respect to a cellular AT (Supplementary Fig. S1E). For comparison with AA methods, we simulated one (line), two (triangle), and three (tetrahedron) simplices with 10,000 points for each given nonlinearity transformation.

### Shape control of size-selected naked platinum nanocrystals [^112T8MAb]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

Growth experiments: octahedral vs tetrahedral structures

Figure 1 shows atomic scale HAADF-STEM imaging of two most abundant shaped nanoparticles, namely tetrahedron (Fig. 1, a–d) and octahedron (Fig. 1, e-h), with a nominal mass of 5000 Pt atoms, found in a cluster beam generated by a magnetron sputtering inert gas aggregation source. The details of the source are described later as well as in the Methods section. The experimental images in Fig. 1(b, f) are taken with the electron beam travelling down an [011] zone axis of the tetrahedral and octahedral nanoparticles respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a, e) respectively. Two simulated STEM images are displayed in Fig. 1c and 1g, where the atomic column intensities can be used as a guide to the local thickness variation. For shape identification, our experience has shown that there is no need to take into consideration small structural relaxation that may be present. Close matches of both the outlines of the particles and the overall atomic column intensity variations between the experimental and simulated images demonstrate that the nanoparticles have the expected shapes. However, for example in Fig. 1b, the top-right corner of the experimental image for tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticle shows that the atoms are missing from the edge when viewed edge-on, and the lower-left image of the topologically equivalent edge shows that the missing atoms decorate the edge unevenly lengthwise, particularly at vertices. These phenomena indicate that atoms at edges and vertices are highly unstable, but they do not lead to smooth regular truncated facets. The result is also confirmed quantitatively by line profiles drawn across the images of nanoparticles concerned, as shown in Fig. 1(d, h) respectively. The experimental and simulation line profiles mostly match each other, apart from those parts at the beginning and at the end, due to the 'missing atoms' at the edges and vertices. This is consistent with the total energy estimate for tetrahedral-shaped nanoparticles with different degrees of vertex truncations (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for the excess energy of differently shaped nanoparticles), with the total energy for an ideal tetrahedron being much higher than those for the octahedral-shaped particles which can be taken to be vertex-truncated tetrahedron where the four {111} surfaces created by vertex-truncation equal to that of the original {111} facets.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^111YBLGM]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In hexagonally packed regions of droplet network replicas, a droplet in the second or third layer was surrounded by 12 droplets, which formed 12 DIBs — producing the space-filling trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron (D 3h) (Fig. 5d) expected for hcp. Horizontal cross-sections of these polyhedra showed a regular hexagon at the midpoint (Fig. 5h), with two aligned equilateral triangles near the top and bottom (Fig. 5g, i). In contrast to what we saw for hcp, horizontal sections of a polyhedron in a face-centred cubic lattice — a rhombic dodecahedron (O h) — would show two equilateral triangles, near the top and the bottom of the polyhedron, rotated by 60° with respect to each other. Droplets at the bottom of a network (touching the glass) were surrounded by nine droplets and formed ten-faced polyhedra (C 3v) with a flat circular face due to bilayer formation at the quartz surface (Supplementary Fig. 9h–k). Droplets at the periphery (at the top and sides of a network) formed polyhedra with ten faces or less, and with a curved face arising from the oil–water interface (Supplementary Fig. 9l–p).

### Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear Truss metamaterials by generative modeling [^116SwdzW]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Creating the design space

We begin by introducing our definition of the design space of truss lattices. From a practical standpoint, we focus our attention on lattices based on the periodic tessellation of a cubic representative volume element (RVE). Inspired by the cube decomposition approach, we partition the RVE into eight equal cubes, the octants, as shown in Fig. 1 a. By assuming symmetries across the three mutually orthogonal symmetry planes, it is sufficient to define the truss only within a single octant, which simplifies the complex optimization problem while ensuring great flexibility and periodic tilability. Following the graph representation of molecules, truss-like structures can be described by a set of nodes connected by solid beams, which form the nodes and edges of the graph, respectively. To create a sufficiently large design space of truss structures, we define a total of 27 possible node placements within the octant (Fig. 1 a): 8 vertex nodes { v 0, v 1, v 2, v 3, v 4, v 5, v 6, v 7 }, 12 edge nodes { e 0, e 1, e 2, e 3, e 4, e 5, e 6, e 7, e 8, e 9, e 10, e 11 }, 6 face nodes { f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 }, and a single body node { t 0 } within the volume. While the body node is free to move in 3D, edge and face nodes are restricted to be displaced only along the edge and within the face, respectively, and vertex nodes are fixed, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. We define the offsets of nodes (as in ref.) in the natural coordinate system, representing their relative positions with respect to the fixed vertex nodes to ensure connectivity on the outer boundaries. The complete set of node features x contains the offset of each node in its movable direction(s).

### Assembly of planar chiral superlattices from achiral building blocks [^1175TkkU]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The spontaneous assembly of chiral structures from building blocks that lack chirality is fundamentally important for colloidal chemistry and has implications for the formation of advanced optical materials. Here, we find that purified achiral gold tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticles assemble into two-dimensional superlattices that exhibit planar chirality under a balance of repulsive electrostatic and attractive van der Waals and depletion forces. A model accounting for these interactions shows that the growth of planar structures is kinetically preferred over similar three-dimensional products, explaining their selective formation. Exploration and mapping of different packing symmetries demonstrates that the hexagonal chiral phase forms exclusively because of geometric constraints imposed by the presence of constituent tetrahedra with sharp tips. A formation mechanism is proposed in which the chiral phase nucleates from within a related 2D achiral phase by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of tetrahedra about their central axis. These results lay the scientific foundation for the high-throughput assembly of planar chiral metamaterials.

### 3D particle averaging and detection of macromolecular symmetry in localization microscopy [^112xQsru]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Single molecule localization microscopy offers in principle resolution down to the molecular level, but in practice this is limited primarily by incomplete fluorescent labeling of the structure. This missing information can be completed by merging information from many structurally identical particles. In this work, we present an approach for 3D single particle analysis in localization microscopy which hugely increases signal-to-noise ratio and resolution and enables determining the symmetry groups of macromolecular complexes. Our method does not require a structural template, and handles anisotropic localization uncertainties. We demonstrate 3D reconstructions of DNA-origami tetrahedrons, Nup96 and Nup107 subcomplexes of the nuclear pore complex acquired using multiple single molecule localization microscopy techniques, with their structural symmetry deducted from the data.

### Dense packings of the platonic and archimedean solids [^116amcHK]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Dense particle packings have served as useful models of the structures of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter, granular media, heterogeneous materials and biological systems. Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory. Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782…, 0.947…, 0.904… and 0.836…, respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids.

### Hierarchical self-assembly of DNA into symmetric supramolecular polyhedra [^117ANfRz]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

DNA is renowned for its double helix structure and the base pairing that enables the recognition and highly selective binding of complementary DNA strands. These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations. Of the wide range of self-assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two-dimensional. Examples of three-dimensional DNA structures include cubes, truncated octahedra, octohedra and tetrahedra, which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers (hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem. Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three-dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self-assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three-point-star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one-pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three-dimensional structures.

### Superlattices assembled through shape-induced directional binding [^114rZz9N]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Organization of spherical particles into lattices is typically driven by packing considerations. Although the addition of directional binding can significantly broaden structural diversity, nanoscale implementation remains challenging. Here we investigate the assembly of clusters and lattices in which anisotropic polyhedral blocks coordinate isotropic spherical nanoparticles via shape-induced directional interactions facilitated by DNA recognition. We show that these polyhedral blocks — cubes and octahedrons — when mixed with spheres, promote the assembly of clusters with architecture determined by polyhedron symmetry. Moreover, three-dimensional binary superlattices are formed when DNA shells accommodate the shape disparity between nanoparticle interfaces. The crystallographic symmetry of assembled lattices is determined by the spatial symmetry of the block's facets, while structural order depends on DNA-tuned interactions and particle size ratio. The presented lattice assembly strategy, exploiting shape for defining the global structure and DNA-mediation locally, opens novel possibilities for by-design fabrication of binary lattices.

### Assembly of planar chiral superlattices from achiral building blocks [^11728Pgx]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The tendency for matter to exhibit configurations with chiral symmetry has ramifications for a diverse set of scientific disciplines ranging from particle physics to the origin of life. For most chemical systems, chiral symmetry emerges at a given length scale only if at a smaller length scale there exists a chiral center that seeds growth –. More recently, micron- and nanometer-scale colloids that are achiral have demonstrated the ability to spontaneously assemble into ordered chiral superlattices –. However, these exclusively form linear helix or twisted ribbon architectures. Particularly for nanophotonics applications, in which chiral configurations have been intensely pursued as a route to metamaterials with negative refractive index –, the formation of planar 2D chiral assemblies would be advantageous in the improved structural control and increased scale compared to laborious lithographic techniques that are more commonly employed –.

The packing of tetrahedra (Td) represents a rich field constituting both mathematical theory, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental colloidal chemistry. A complex phase space has been mapped in which numerous symmetric arrangements form depending on the degree of tip truncation, rounding of tips/edges, and the fundamental interparticle interactions driving assembly. Mathematically, the densest packing of Td is the so-called dimer crystal (DC) with a density of ~85.63%, but lattices constituting hexagonal, body centered cubic, diamond cubic, triclinic, icosahedral, decahedral, and quasicrystalline order have been simulated,–; the only proposed structure with chiral symmetry reported thus far is a linear helix.

Assembly or synthesis of chiral nanomaterials is generally accomplished through the introduction of chiral surface ligands that control the growth of helicoid facets – or favor interactions between particles of like-handedness. The formation of chiral superlattices from achiral building blocks is more unusual and requires a balance of attractive and repulsive forces. For example, nanoparticles with conflicting van der Waals and dipole interactions or dumbbell nanorods with attractive centers and repulsive ends have been shown to form helix or twisted ribbon morphologies. Numerous reports have investigated the assembly of Td-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals, confirming several of the mathematically-proposed structures. Both chiral helix and twisted ribbon structures have been observed to assemble from achiral tetrahedra. However, the assembly of plasmonic Td particles and the ability for Td to form 2D chiral superlattices have yet to be examined.

### Local self-uniformity in photonic networks [^1114Eczs]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In Fig. 2a, b, we note that that the two trihedra and tetrahedra could be made to overlap exactly for their respective root edge permutations. In fact, pairs of either trihedra or tetrahedra will overlap exactly for all root edge permutations and have a spatial similarity statistic of unity. This property of trihedral and tetrahedral units is a corollary of work on strong isotropy. There exist only three strongly isotropic networks in three dimensions or less. In three dimensions, these networks are diamond (Fig. 1b) and single gyroid (Fig. 1e). In two dimensions, the honeycomb network is the only strongly isotropic network.

We consider now a third set of example 1-trees — two identical simple cubic network units (Fig. 2c), each with six edges about a central vertex — and calculate their spatial similarity statistic. We find that perfect overlap can be achieved for specific root edge permutations, but in most cases there is no congruent transformation to align the two trees correctly; we call such a permutation inaccessible (this is depicted in Fig. 2c). As a result, the simple cubic crystal does not possess a strong isotropy property. In the remainder of this paper, we focus on trees comprising trivalent and tetravalent vertices only.

To build a robust measure of network structural order, we require a formalism that can compare the trees of arbitrarily disordered networks. We thus build upon the measurement of tree spatial similarity statistics in the following ways. We stipulate that the CRN from which the trees are drawn comprises only vertices with a fixed number of edges. We then generalize the measurement of tree spatial similarities to n -trees of any size. In this case, the correct edge overlap pairings are not known beyond the root edges. To solve this, we have developed an algorithm which determines the natural edge overlaps; this is detailed in the Methods section. We also allow the similarities of arbitrarily disordered trees to be measured. Here we acknowledge that the root edges of two trees will not necessarily overlap perfectly. Instead, for each permutation we find a transformation that yields an approximate overlap. We then quantify the quality of this overlap according to a metric of spatial similarity (see Methods section).

### Elucidation of the origin of chiral amplification in discrete molecular polyhedra [^116oAzGc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Chiral amplification in molecular self-assembly has profound impact on the recognition and separation of chiroptical materials, biomolecules, and pharmaceuticals. An understanding of how to control this phenomenon is nonetheless restricted by the structural complexity in multicomponent self-assembling systems. Here, we create chiral octahedra incorporating a combination of chiral and achiral vertices and show that their discrete nature makes these octahedra an ideal platform for in-depth investigation of chiral transfer. Through the construction of dynamic combinatorial libraries, the unique possibility to separate and characterise each individual assembly type, density functional theory calculations, and a theoretical equilibrium model, we elucidate that a single chiral unit suffices to control all other units in an octahedron and how this local amplification combined with the distribution of distinct assembly types culminates in the observed overall chiral amplification in the system. Our combined experimental and theoretical strategy can be applied generally to quantify discrete multi-component self-assembling systems.

### Topological magneto-optical effects and their quantization in noncoplanar antiferromagnets [^114BDkz8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Result

TMO effects

Let us start with the TMO effects by considering the example of a three-dimensional (3D) face-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice, shown in Fig. 1 b. We focus on the so-called 3 Q spin structure, for which four magnetic sublattices form of a regular tetrahedron, and the spin on each sublattice points to the center of the tetrahedron, resulting in a fully compensated nc-AFM order. To describe conduction electrons interacting with the localized spin moments, the Hamiltonian is expressed by the Kondo lattice model:Here, is the electron creation (annihilation) operator on sitewith spin, is the vector of Pauli matrices, denotes the nearest-neighbor transfer integral, andis the on-site exchange coupling.

For the 3D fcc lattice, a proper strain can be used to generate a nonzero fictitious magnetic field, which effects the magneto-response properties of the system and ultimately leads to activating the TMO effect. Considering each face of the tetrahedron, the three noncoplanar spins provide a fictitious magnetic flux, whereis the successive transfer integral along a loop, is the scalar spin chirality –, andis a unit vector normal to the face. This fictitious magnetic flux essentially comes from the orbital motion of electron because a Berry phase, being equivalent to the solid angle spanned by three neighboring spins, is picked up by the electron hopping along a closed loop on the triangular plaquette. The total fictitious magnetic field in the 3D fcc lattice is the vector sum of the magnetic fluxes on the four faces of the tetrahedron, i.e. In the unstrained case, is zero because the four fluxes cancel each other exactly (Fig. 1 b). After a uniaxial strain, characterized with a parameter(see the "Methods" section), is introduced along the [111] direction, the fictitious field iswithand the unit vectorpointing into the [111] direction. The effect of this fictitious magnetic field is equivalent to the nonzero net magnetization in a ferromagnet or the external magnetic field applied to a nonmagnet, and thus the response of a 3D fcc nc-AFM to the left-circularly and right-circularly polarized lights is inevitably different.

Discussion

In this study we applied ParTI to high-dimensional human wellness data to aid in analyzing and visualizing the most dominant tradeoffs that shape the clinical labs data. The key findings are as follows: (1) ParTI analysis revealed that the clinical labs data fall on a statistically significant tetrahedron, with four archetypes. (2) Enrichment analysis of associated multi-omics and lifestyle data revealed characteristics of each of the archetypes: (i) the older and healthy archetype, (ii) the young and healthy females, (iii) the young and healthy males (iv) the unhealthy-archetype. (3) We then describe the clinical lab profiles at the archetypes, and found the major axes of variation and their hierarchy: (i) the wellness, (ii) the age, and (iii) the gender axis. (4) We found that the male-archetype shares more enriched features with the unhealthy-archetype than did the female or the older archetypes, which appeared to be due to generally less healthy lifestyle and dietary habits. (5) We found that sex differences diminished with age and in an aberrant health state. (6) Lastly, we characterized the movement of individual participants on the tetrahedron over time and found that most participants tumble around their initial position, and that the vast majority of the participants that showed a significant change in their trajectory, moved towards the healthy and older archetype, and away from the unhealthy archetype, as might be expected from a wellness program. (7) We then detected all the cases of participants that showed a different type of movement, and demonstrated how the movement on the tetrahedron might be utilized for monitoring individual participants and detecting signs of health transitions. Taken together, these findings demonstrated the power of geometry and dimensionality reduction in analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional datasets in a continuous trait space, and their capacity to be leveraged for monitoring individual's health through blood measurements.

### Four-component protein nanocages designed by programmed symmetry breaking [^112BNVM4]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our design strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1a for the icosahedral case. A T = 1 cage with icosahedral point group symmetry can be built from 20 homotrimers aligned along the icosahedral threefold symmetry axes (Fig. 1a). The centres of the homotrimers can be visualized as the vertices of 12 pentagonal faces that form the sides of a dodecahedron (Fig. 1a). Higher T-number cages conserve the number of pentagons (pentons), which are always aligned along the 12 icosahedral fivefold symmetry axes. T = 4 cages with hexagons bridging the 12 pentons could be generated if it were possible to extract pentons from the T = 1 cages and insert homotrimers along the icosahedral threefold symmetry axes connecting three pentons (Fig. 1b, c). Extracting pentons from T = 1 cages requires that one of the three interfaces joining each trimer with its nearest neighbours be eliminated. This can be accomplished by substituting the homotrimers with geometrically identical (that is, pseudosymmetric) heterotrimers composed of three distinct chains with different amino acid sequences. This symmetry breaking allows the interface facing outwards from the penton to be specifically eliminated, isolating the penton as a free-standing structure that can be used to build larger structures.

### Hue selectivity from recurrent circuitry in drosophila [^1165CRaf]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Source data

The responses Tm5a, Tm5b, Tm5c and Tm20 neurons peak at locations in color space that are different from their primary inputs (Fig. 2e–h). Tm5a responses are confined to the Rh3 vertex, with some activation along the Rh3/Rh6 edge, corresponding to the lower-left quadrant of the 2D projection (Fig. 2e). Tm5b is activated only along a narrow section of the Rh4/Rh5 edge of the tetrahedron, corresponding in 2D to activation confined to the upper-middle area of the space (Fig. 2f). Tm5c responses are broad with a preference close to the Rh6 vertex (Fig. 2g). Tm20 has the strongest activation within the Rh4/Rh5/Rh6 face, corresponding to photon captures localized in the bottom-right quadrant of the 2D space. (Fig. 2h).

To examine responses along one-dimensional paths through the 3D color space, we used radial basis functions to smoothly interpolate the responses from both the gamut and contrast stimulus sets (Methods). Along the single wavelength line, we obtained a spectral tuning curve (Extended Data Fig. 1i). For photoreceptors (Extended Data Fig. 1j–m), the results were, overall, consistent with our previous measurements. In the case of Tm neurons, the spectral tuning curves peaked in the UV part of the spectrum for Tm5a (Extended Data Fig. 1n), violet for Tm5b (Extended Data Fig. 1o) and blue for Tm20 (Extended Data Fig. 1q). Tm5c was most sensitive to violet/blue/green light and had broader tuning than the other Tm neurons (Extended Data Fig. 1p). Tm5b, Tm5a and Tm20 neurons had narrower wavelength tuning than their presynaptic photoreceptor axon terminals (Extended Data Fig. 1j–q).

Step 1: T = 1 cages are designed starting from C3 symmetric trimeric building blocks. Step 2: the trimers constituting each face of the T = 1 cages are displaced away from the origin along the symmetry axis orthogonal to the face (left) and replaced by ABC-type pseudosymmetric heterotrimers to produce crowns in which one of the three components (yellow) is free to be designed to dock to other building blocks (right). Step 3: the crowns are docked with a new set of homotrimers aligned along the threefold symmetry axis of each architecture, which produces T = 4 cages.

### Hue selectivity from recurrent circuitry in drosophila [^116s65Er]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Results

Hue selectivity is defined by the geometry of responses in color space

There are a number of ways to construct color spaces, some of which involve perceptual measurements. To characterize the response properties of fly chromatic neurons, we define a fly color space on the basis of opsin captures. The fly eye has five opsins (Fig. 1a). Rh1, expressed in R1–6 photoreceptors, is broadband and mediates achromatic vision. We focus on the other four opsins, Rh3–6, expressed in pale and yellow R7 and R8 photoreceptors (Fig. 1a). We computed photon captures for each opsin (relative to the background) to define a 4D fly color space (Fig. 1b). Any color stimulus can be mapped to a point in this space with coordinates defined by the photon captures. To isolate a subspace in which luminance is fixed, we constrain points to have equal summed photon captures across the opsins. This defines a three-dimensional (3D) subspace that has the shape of a tetrahedron (Fig. 1c). The central point in the tetrahedron, which corresponds to equal photon captures across all the opsins, defines the color white. Other colors are represented by vectors that project from this white point to the point defined by their opsin photon captures. Any non-white colors — including nonspectral colors that cannot be produced by any single wavelength of light — can be represented by such a color vector (Fig. 1c). We define hue and saturation at fixed luminance as a parameterization of points within this tetrahedron. Specifically, we define saturation s as the length of the color vector. Hue is defined by the two angles that specify the direction of the color vector in the 3D space of the tetrahedron (for example, the polar and azimuthal angles of a spherical coordinate system). Thus, fly vision has two hue angles rather than the single hue angle in trichromatic vision. As stated at the outset, hue, saturation and brightness, especially as applied to human vision, are often defined through perceptual measurements. It is important to note that, throughout, we define hue and saturation solely in terms of fly opsin photon captures. Similarly, we do not use the term brightness, but instead refer to the sum of the photon captures of all four opsins as luminance.

Pareto task inference of clinical labs — study overview.

67 blood measurements from 3094 individuals were used for the Pareto task inference analysis to find the minimal significant polyhedron and the position of the archetypes (the vertices). After finding the polyhedron using the clinical labs, all other data types (lifestyle self-administered questionnaires and Fitbit records, genomics, microbiome, metabolomics and proteomics) were used to find enriched traits close to every archetype in order to characterize the archetypes and reveal the tradeoffs in the system.

The colored ellipses designate the archetypes' possible positions with error after 1000 times of bootstrapping. b, c The tetrahedron is robust to data selection. The participants in the cohort have multiple visits (between 1–8). To test the robustness of the tetrahedron, we randomly selected one visit per participant and constructed different data sets. Then, for every data selection we ran the ParTI analysis and found that for different data selections we receive significant tetrahedrons (t -test P -value < 0.05). Out of 7 data selections 4 were significant, 3 runs had a t -test P -value < 0.001 (two of them are shown here in b and c), and the rest had a t -test P -value = 0.04, 0.06, 0.07, 0.28 (see Methods).

### Four-component protein nanocages designed by programmed symmetry breaking [^112eWYnp]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Four, eight or twenty C3 symmetric protein trimers can be arranged with tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral point group symmetry to generate closed cage-like structures 1,2. Viruses access more complex higher triangulation number icosahedral architectures by breaking perfect point group symmetry 3–9, but nature appears not to have explored similar symmetry breaking for tetrahedral or octahedral symmetries. Here we describe a general design strategy for building higher triangulation number architectures starting from regular polyhedra through pseudosymmetrization of trimeric building blocks. Electron microscopy confirms the structures of T = 4 cages with 48 (tetrahedral), 96 (octahedral) and 240 (icosahedral) subunits, each with 4 distinct chains and 6 different protein-protein interfaces, and diameters of 33nm, 43nm and 75nm, respectively. Higher triangulation number viruses possess very sophisticated functionalities; our general route to higher triangulation number nanocages should similarly enable a next generation of multiple antigen-displaying vaccine candidates 10,11 and targeted delivery vehicles 12,13.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^112zTdBX]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 3 c, d shows the topological reconstruction of modular origami structures generated by other templates — a cone and hyperboloid. When we select the same module topologically as the spherical structure in Fig. 3a.6 for the cone and hyperboloid structures in Fig. 3 c, d, the modular origami structures produce the same spatial connection topology and the same reconfigurable mobility (see Supplementary Movie 4). Therefore, the reconfigurability is controlled by the spatial connection of the modules and not by the geometry of the template.

Mobility evaluation

We implement transformation by obtaining the independent dihedral angles, as demonstrated in Figs. 3 b–d and 4. Following the assumption of the rigid face and flexible hinges of prismatic modular origami, we identify the independent dihedral angles from a linearized constraint matrix. We apply additional kinematic constraints on every vertex: the distance between two vertices on an edge remains constant during reconfiguration (see Supplementary Fig. 8 in the SI for further details). While linearizing the constraints with a matrix form, we obtain, whereis the infinitesimal displacement of vertices. We can also obtain the infinitesimal displacement of all the dihedral angles as. In matrix form, the constraints can be expressed as

### Self-assembly of tetravalent goldberg polyhedra from 144 small components [^113yFCB6]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Rational control of the self-assembly of large structures is one of the key challenges in chemistry, and is believed to become increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible as the number of components involved increases. So far, it has not been possible to design a self-assembled discrete molecule made up of more than 100 components. Such molecules-for example, spherical virus capsids-are prevalent in nature, which suggests that the difficulty in designing these very large self-assembled molecules is due to a lack of understanding of the underlying design principles. For example, the targeted assembly of a series of large spherical structures containing up to 30 palladium ions coordinated by up to 60 bent organic ligands was achieved by considering their topologies. Here we report the self-assembly of a spherical structure that also contains 30 palladium ions and 60 bent ligands, but belongs to a shape family that has not previously been observed experimentally. The new structure consists of a combination of 8 triangles and 24 squares, and has the symmetry of a tetravalent Goldberg polyhedron. Platonic and Archimedean solids have previously been prepared through self-assembly, as have trivalent Goldberg polyhedra, which occur naturally in the form of virus capsids and fullerenes. But tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra have not previously been reported at the molecular level, although their topologies have been predicted using graph theory. We use graph theory to predict the self-assembly of even larger tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra, which should be more stable, enabling another member of this polyhedron family to be assembled from 144 components: 48 palladium ions and 96 bent ligands.

### A 3D ray traced biological neural network learning model [^1176GRx6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we randomly positioned neurons in a 3D sphere. As shown in Fig. 2 e, the probability density function of the neuron lengths is a continuous Gaussian curve. This gives a lot of flexibility for creating many different neural connections and neural network structures. Alternatively, neurons may be arranged in a patterned fashion. For example, when neurons are arranged on a set of concentric sphere surfaces and only allow neural connections between neighboring surfaces, then the RayBNN topology becomes equivalent to a conventionally layered neural network. Overall, there are many possible periodic or chaotic arrangements for neurons and glial cells. It is possible that certain arrangements, along with certain connection rules, will lead to out-performance over the state of the art in a set of applications. It is also feasible to optimize the position of neurons and glial cells through training. Therefore, implementing them and exploring their characteristics will be exciting research in the future. In particular, one may study it with the knowledge transformed from group theory and solid state physics where various spatial topologies of atoms and molecules in solid have been extensively investigated.

The network's physical shape could be another exploration factor as it heavily influences the neural connection length and, in turn, also influences the propagation delay of information. For example, a neural network's overall shape could be a 3D cube, a torus, an ellipsoid, a tetrahedron, etc. each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In the case of a 3D cube or tetrahedron, the signal paths from the surface of the shape to the center are very different compared to a 3D sphere. As a result, some signals may reach the center of a cube faster, while others might take a longer time since they traveled a longer path. For applications needing synchronization, 3D cube and tetrahedron networks might not be optimal. For other applications requiring joining or merging neural networks, 3D cube, and tetrahedron networks can be easily joined together to significantly scale up a neural network for large datasets. In the case of an ellipsoid, the shape changes the number of hidden neurons that each input neuron can access, as it now becomes surface location dependent. Such bias toward a certain subset of input data features may be advantageous to train datasets whose data features are not equally important. It may be possible to evolve the network shape toward an ergodic optimal according to the nature of the dataset, just like how the human brain evolves from a sphere.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^114o17Zd]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Using this technique, each cavity in the packing can thus be identified by its birth value α = b (when four or more surrounding beads come into contact) and its death value α = d (when its surrounding beads become so large that the cavity is filled). It is common practice to represent the birth and death value for each cavity in a persistence diagram, named PD 2. PD 2 contains all the (b, d) pairs of a given packing, each corresponding to topologically distinct cavities that exists in the interstices between the beads. PD 2 contains information not only about the number of cavities but also on the nature of each cavity/pore or on the frequency of occurence of patterns (regular-distorted) that have been detected within the packing. As such, PD 2 offers new ways to describe the phase space of stable grain configurations.

An interesting asset of PD 2 is that certain local cavities with a specific motif can be clearly and simultaneously identified in the same diagram. For instance, the simplest and smallest pore is that formed inside four beads closely packed as a regular tetrahedron. From a topological viewpoint, a tetrahedral pore is born when α (the filtration parameter) reaches the circumradius of an equilateral triangle and dies when α is the circumradius of the regular tetrahedron. This mathematical definition ensures that a regular tetrahedral cavity is uniquely identified by the pointin PD 2. Another simple pore is that formed by six beads closely packed as a regular octahedron. This type of cavity is uniquely identified by the pointin PD 2 (see Methods section). On a technical note, the persistence diagrams presented here are computed using a weighted alpha filtration related to a weighted Voronoi decomposition. It uses the power distance instead of the absolute distance between the bead centres. This approach allows us to take into account the small, yet finite, polydispersity of the grains. In the PD 2 based on the power distance, regular tetrahedron and octahedron cavities are located atand. In our experiments, the average bead radius is = 0.5 mm, therefore:

### Anatomy of the facial glideplanes, deep plane spaces, and ligaments: implications for surgical and nonsurgical lifting procedures [^116UPXKt]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The Deep Plane Explained

In the layered system of the face, the layer deep to the superficial fascia and the mimetic muscles is the deep fascia. Level 4 is essentially a potential dissection plane within the deep fascia, which, when dissected, opens readily at the areas of the mille-feuille surgical spaces and less readily elsewhere. Unless surgically opened, level 4 and spaces are not present as part of the human facial anatomy. Moreover, the deep fat compartments are not distinct from the deep fascia layer: they are simply local areas of increased fat interspersion. Instead, the entire deep fascia features deep retinacula connecting the SMAS-platysma to the deeper structures, while also allowing significant mobility.

Based on these findings, it is proposed to abandon the notion of true anatomic spaces (spaces that are present in vivo) and replace it with surgical spaces (potential dissection planes), thereby stressing the role of the multi-lamellated sheets of loose areolar tissue in surgical orientation and dissection. It is imperative to dissect at the correct depth within the deep fascia to protect the facial nerve. As the facial nerve travels within the deeper segment of the deep fascia in the cervical and premasseter areas, a dissection in the superficial part of the deep fascia layer is warranted; as the facial nerve travels in the more superficial segment of the deep fascia in the prezygomatic, temporal, and frontal area, a dissection in the deep aspect of the deep fascia layer is warranted. The prezygomatic space and the premasseter spaces are especially important deep-plane entry points that allow a safe judgment of the correct depth of dissection (Fig. 8). The prezygomatic space allows safe identification of the origin of the zygomaticus major muscle, providing a safe path to the midcheek, while the premasseter space allows the safe identification of the platysma muscle, providing a safe path into the neck.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^113811vk]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4 presents an example of reconfigurable structures assembled with varying geometry and topology of modules for a target DOF. Applying the geometric modification in Eqs. (3)–(6) and topological reconstruction in Eqs. (7)–(10) to 28 unit cells within a volumetric mapping size of 40, we obtain sphere reconfigurable structures for various target DOFs. Our algorithm provides multiple solutions, e.g. multiple combinations of geometry and topology for a target. For example, unit cell #1 with a mapping size ofand unit cell #22 with a mapping size ofprovide several topological options with varyingfor target mobility, as shown in Fig. 4.

We plot the DOFs with varying connecting topology while demonstrating various deformation modes, including uniaxial extension and volumetric shrinkage, as shown in Fig. 4 d, e (see the transformation in Supplementary Movie 5). The mobility can also be validated using a linear eigenmode analysis.

The same unit cell, e.g. a cubic unit cell, provides different reconfigurability depending on the variation of the topological connections, which is controlled by the mapping size. Small-sized polyhedrons with amapping can provide a vaster design space in mobility than large-sized polyhedrons with amapping because of the greater chance of available topology, as illustrated in Fig. 4. A unit cell consisting of two tetrahedrons and one octahedron with amapping produces a maximum of 40 connections, resulting in zero mobility, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Even releasing the connection only produces a narrow range of design space in mobility because of the extruded tubular shapes of the tetrahedron and octahedron being a triangular lattice prism with kinematic mobility of zero.

Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

### Four-component protein nanocages designed by programmed symmetry breaking [^116tFqTR]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Natural and designed protein nanocages consist of one or multiple unique components arranged with tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral point group symmetry. Although there are no other point group symmetries, in the icosahedral case, viruses access larger and more complex higher triangulation (T) number architectures by interspersing varying numbers of hexagons between 12 pentagonal substructures (pentons), which expand the structure without changing the curvature. Viruses achieve this symmetry breaking by placing at symmetrically non-equivalent positions either the same subunit in different conformations (quasisymmetry) –, or closely related but distinct subunits (pseudosymmetry). The accessing of higher T number icosahedral structures by such symmetry breaking is critical to the remarkable functionality of viruses, such as the ability to package and deliver large nucleic acid cargos. Similarly, the de novo design of higher T number protein assemblies could enable new approaches to nucleic acid delivery and, as the potency of nanoparticle immunogens can increase with increasing valency of display, could lead to more potent vaccines. However, although protein design has had considerable success in designing symmetric assemblies that assemble from identical interacting subunits. the design of assemblies with multiple identical or nearly identical chains in non-symmetry equivalent positions is an outstanding challenge.

We set out to develop a systematic approach to design higher T-number protein assemblies that could generate not only icosahedral (I-sym) architectures but also tetrahedral (T-sym) and octahedral (O-sym) higher T-number nanostructures, which, to our knowledge, have not been found in nature. Of the two routes to breaking symmetry described above, we reasoned that using closely related but distinct subunits (pseudosymmetry) would have the advantage over quasisymmetry as it avoids the complexity of designing single subunits with multiple distinct states and sets of interactions. We reasoned further that a design strategy that started with creating T = 1 architectures from homotrimers, and then extended these to T = 4 by inserting pseudosymmetric heterotrimers, would be more robust than directly designing for higher T-number cages, as subsets of the cage forming interfaces could be experimentally validated independently.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^1166bLSe]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fivefold and icosahedral symmetries induced by multiply twinned crystal structures have been studied extensively for their role in influencing the shape of synthetic nanoparticles, and solution chemistry or geometric confinement are widely considered to be essential. Here we report the purely entropy-driven formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of particles in molecular simulation without geometric confinement or chemistry. Hard truncated tetrahedra self-assemble into cubic or hexagonal diamond colloidal crystals depending on the amount of edge and vertex truncation. By engineering particle shape to achieve a negligible entropy difference between the two diamond phases, we show that the formation of the multiply twinned clusters is easily induced. The twinned clusters are entropically stabilized within a dense fluid by a strong fluid-crystal interfacial tension arising from strong entropic bonding. Our findings provide a strategy for engineering twinning behavior in colloidal systems with and without explicit bonding elements between particles.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^1179Mq5n]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In summary, we studied the entropy-driven assembly and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in a one-component fluid of hard truncated tetrahedra (TT). We showed that the thermodynamic stability of the cubic and hexagonal diamond phases can be entropically controlled by designing the TT shape. If the particle shape is designed to have a negligible free energy difference between the two diamond crystals, the formation of twin boundaries is easily induced. This strategy can be used to induce the formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in fluid via seed-assisted growth. We found that the formation of a fivefold cluster follows an error-and-repair mechanism that removes mismatches of the stacking sequence of adjacent twin planes through particle rearrangement at the cluster surface. We showed the formation of an icosahedral cluster by additional growth of twinned structures from a fivefold twinned seed. We showed that the icosahedral cluster of TTs can be entropically stabilized in a fluid, which is not possible for hard spheres without confinement. The capillary fluctuation method showed that a hard TT system has a much higher fluid-solid interfacial free energy (here, entropy) difference than that of a hard sphere system, directly implicating fluid-solid interfacial tension in stabilizing the TT ico-twin.

Our findings provide a quantitative understanding of the formation and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in hard particle systems. Importantly, we showed that the twinning behavior and the interfacial free energy difference may be entropically engineered by particle shape design. Experimentally, colloidal tetrahedral particles are synthesizable,– with tunable shape. Non-complementary DNA could be used to make non-interacting particles that might closely approximate those studied here. Fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters should be also attainable with attractive TT particle shapes, provided the explicit attraction favors face-to-face alignment. Such interparticle attraction could be realized through organic ligands, via van der Waals forces or self-complementary DNA, both of which are commonly used to drive nanoparticle assembly.

### Reassessment of the distinctive geometry of Staphylococcus aureus cell division [^112wRiKP]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is generally thought to divide in three alternating orthogonal planes over three consecutive division cycles. Although this mode of division was proposed over four decades ago, the molecular mechanism that ensures this geometry of division has remained elusive. Here we show, for three different strains, that S. aureus cells do not regularly divide in three alternating perpendicular planes as previously thought. Imaging of the divisome shows that a plane of division is always perpendicular to the previous one, avoiding bisection of the nucleoid, which segregates along an axis parallel to the closing septum. However, one out of the multiple planes perpendicular to the septum which divide the cell in two identical halves can be used in daughter cells, irrespective of its orientation in relation to the penultimate division plane. Therefore, division in three orthogonal planes is not the rule in S. aureus.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### The geometry of clinical labs and wellness States from deeply phenotyped humans [^114g2EAm]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Three participants demonstrated a different pattern: a 56 years old woman who moved on her 4 th visit from the center of the tetrahedron towards the unhealthy-archetype (Euclidean distance: 13.2, Fig. 6). Three days after her 4 th blood draw she was diagnosed with enlarged liver, gallbladder and pancreas. Interestingly, she also moved closer to the male-archetype, showing that in abnormal situations a female can move toward the male-archetype, and that this unexpected movement might indicate an abnormal health status. This trajectory was ranked second in the length of the movement.

A similar case was detected for a woman in her 60 s that had seven timepoints, and was ranked 6th in trajectory length. In the first three time points she is tumbling in the middle of the tetrahedron and from the 4 th time-point onwards she is moving horizontally away from the female-archetype toward the point between the male and the older archetypes, with no vertical movement towards the unhealthy- archetype (Fig. 6). Between her 6 th and 7 th visits she was diagnosed with gallstones and fatty liver disease. Unlike the first example, the movement on the tetrahedron was gradual.

The second movement towards the unhealthy-archetype was observed for a 56 years old man whose initial position is very close to the older-archetype, and in all of his four following timepoints he consistently moved away from this archetype and toward the center of the tetrahedron (total change in Euclidean distance = 12.8). The participant's measurements fall in the middle of the population distributions, and there is no record of diagnosis of any pathology, however many analytes are gradually changing in a consistent way, including insulin (from 3.9 to 6.2) and LDL small (from 90 to 143), which might indicate an evolving underlying condition. This trajectory was ranked 3rd in length.

The third case of such a movement, ranked 1st in length and belongs to a 54-year-old man, where three of his five timepoints crossed the tetrahedron boundaries, however there was no report of adverse events for this participant. Crossing the tetrahedron boundary and moving away from it means that the individual has an atypical set of values that are very different from the background distribution that was used to construct the tetrahedron, which can be due to error in the measurement, or may indicate an abnormal physiological condition.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^112appyd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Twinning arises from a type of grain boundary called a twin boundary, where two separate crystals sharing the same lattice plane intergrow with a certain symmetry. Fivefold and icosahedral symmetries, which are generally known to be incompatible with long-range order, can be induced in relatively large atomic crystal clusters (from several nanometers to a few microns) via multiple twinning –. For instance, materials that form face-centered cubic (fcc),– or cubic diamond, crystals can form twin boundaries toward the (111) or its equivalent lattice directions, promoting the formation of atwin angle that can produce multiply twinned structures with fivefold or icosahedral symmetry. Twinning has been widely used to obtain interesting properties in synthetic nanomaterials, such as enhancing the mechanical properties of nanowiresand increasing oxidation resistance, and to synthesize noble metal nanostructures with decahedral or icosahedral shape, which are useful as catalysts. Many studies have been conducted to control the growth mechanism, and stability of multiply twinned structures, e.g. tailoring solution chemistry,– and using multicomponent materials. However, the multiplicity of variables in multiply twinned crystals makes it difficult to know which variables are responsible for, or have the most influence on, the formation of fivefold and icosahedral twins.

Compared to most systems, hard particle systems are regarded as relatively simple because the phase behavior is driven solely by entropy maximization. The diversity and complexity of entropy-driven phase behavior, however, are enormously rich. The self-assembly of complex crystals and quasicrystals, as well as complex assembly pathways such as multistep crystallization, have been reported in hard particle systems. The spontaneous formation of icosahedral twins has been observed in hard sphere systems both in experiments and in computer simulations, but only under spherical confinement, which produces an artificial "surface tension" to overcome the internal strain within the cluster arising from local particle packing. That, and the negligible free energy difference between fcc and hexagonal close-packed (hcp), two competing crystal structures of hard spheres, conspire to produce twins. However, the formation and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters without geometrical confinement or in any other hard particle systems or have yet to be reported. We hypothesized that artificial surface tension provided by spherical confinement could be achieved naturally, without any confinement, through the judicious choice of particle shape.

### Facing privacy in neuroimaging: removing facial features degrades performance of image analysis methods [^113jN9Vy]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Facial features removal methods

Three publicly available methods were selected: QuickShear, FaceMasking, and Defacing (Fig. 1). For all three methods, default settings were used in this study. FaceMasking was applied on all MR modalities separately. QuickShear and Defacing can only remove facial features from 3D T1 images. To remove the facial features from the other images, the full 3D T1 image of each subject was registered to the other full images of the same subject, using FSL-FLIRT, with 12 degrees of freedom before applying the FFR methods. Using the resulting transformation matrices, the 3D T1 image without facial features was transformed to each of the other image spaces, and subsequently binarized and used as a mask to remove the face from the other images.

Fig. 1
Example 3D-rendered MRI: full (a) and after removal of facial features with QuickShear (b), FaceMasking (c), and Defacing (d). The subject gave written informed consent for using data and for displaying rendering in this figure

QuickShear

Starting from a user-supplied brain mask, QuickShear uses two algorithms to create a plane that divides the MRI into two parts. One part contains the facial features, and the other part contains the remainder of the head, including the brain. After finding this plane, the intensity of all voxels on the "facial features" side of the plane is set to zero.

In this study, the brain mask was made with FSL-BET using previously determined optimal settings.

FaceMasking

FaceMasking deforms the surface of the face with a filter. In this study, the normalized filtering method was used, which is the recommended filter. The method first selects the boundary of the skull and the face, and registers the image volume to an atlas with annotated face coordinates; then, the identified face region of interest layer is normalized and filtered and, finally, transformed back to the original image.

Defacing

Defacing uses an algorithm that calculates the probability of voxels being brain tissue or part of the face, based on 10 annotated atlases of healthy controls. Voxels that are labeled as part of the face and have zero probability of being brain tissue are considered to contain facial features, and their signal intensities are set to zero in order to remove the facial features.

### Face cells encode object parts more than facial configuration of illusory faces [^115RTyG9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To test the importance of configuration for human pareidolia perception, we collected human faceness ratings for a subset of 34 pareidolia images and matched control objects, plus quadrant-scrambled versions of these images, created by dividing each image into four quadrants, then shuffling the quadrants, so the new image retained the individual features of the pareidolia image without the original face-like spatial configuration (Fig. 4b). Subjects indicated on an 11-point scale how easily they could see a face in the presented images, with 0 indicating "cannot see a face" and 10 indicating "easily see a face". To ensure that the ratings were not driven by image familiarity, no subject saw the scrambled version of an original image they had seen and vice versa (see Methods for details). Furthermore, upon completion of the experiment, we asked subjects to what extent they had mentally shifted the parts of scrambled images to make them whole again. The original pareidolia images received high faceness ratings (Fig. 4c, mean rating = 7.23 ± 0.76) compared to matched control images (Fig. 4c, mean = 0.94 ± 1.01), demonstrating that subjects could more easily see a face in the pareidolia images than in the matched controls (t 33 = 32.01, p = 1.99 × 10 −26). Moreover, subjects rated the original pareidolia images significantly higher than the scrambled images (Fig. 4d, original = 7.23 ± 0.76, scrambled = 1.84 ± 0.94, t 33 = 33.9, p = 3.27 × 10 −27), emphasizing the importance of global configuration in perceptual pareidolia. The scrambled pareidolia images (mean = 1.84 ± 0.94) were rated higher than the scrambled matched controls (0.50 ± 0.45), suggesting that scrambled pareidolia images were still perceived as somewhat more face-like (Fig. 4e, t 33 = 7.88, p = 4.34 ×10 −9). However, the difference in ratings between scrambled pareidolia and scrambled matched controls decreased as a function of how often the subjects reported having unscrambled images ('always' group, difference in rating = 2.23 ± 0.97; "mostly" = 1.67 ± 0.87; "sometimes" = 1.16 ± 0.62, "rarely" = 0.74 ± 0.85, 'never' = 0.55 ± 0.51). Thus, mental unscrambling can explain how easily a face was perceived in the scrambled pareidolia compared to scrambled matched controls (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, for subjects in the 'never' group, scrambling the pareidolia images lowered perceived faceness to the level of matched control objects (scrambled pareidolia = 0.91 ± 0.87, original matched control = 0.65 ± 1.33, t 27 = 0.84, p = 0.41). This result provides further evidence that perceptual pareidolia is driven by the global configuration, since only subjects who reported that they mentally unscrambled the scrambled pareidolia images showed substantial pareidolia effects.

### Direct 4D printing of ceramics driven by hydrogel dehydration [^1148aWWn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Design flow for direct 4D printing of ceramics

Figure 5a presents the design flow for direct 4D printing of ceramics, which includes five steps: 3D modeling, flat pattern design, theoretical model calculation, FE simulation, and experiment. We take the fabrication of a thin-walled regular tetrahedron as an example to illustrate the detailed design and manufacturing process of 4D printing ceramics. As shown in Fig. 5b, we first extract the key feature parameters from the target object. In the case of a regular tetrahedron, the side length L s is 10 mm, and the calculated dihedral angle θ s is 70.5°. Then, we design geometric parameters for the flat pattern that can be obtained by unfolding each face of the regular tetrahedron into to the same plane. As shown in Fig. 5c, all the faces only consist of ceramic elastomer. The bottom face and side faces are connected by three hinges composed of hydrogel-ceramic laminates. Considering the shrinkage of ceramics after sintering, the side length L d of each triangular face is calculated to be 12.78 mm (L d = L s / η = 12.78 mm). The hinge length is equal to L d, and the width is set to be 5 mm. The undetermined parameters are hydrogel thickness H hg and hinge thickness H which can be calculated through the developed theoretical model. Figure 5d presents the relation between bending angle θ s and H hg / H. The dihedral angle of the sintered ceramic tetrahedron can reach 70.5° when H = 1 mm and H hg / H = 0.69. Based on the structural parameters determined in Fig. 5c, d, we perform FE simulations to predict the shape transformation from the flat 2D pattern to the dehydrated and sintered 3D objects. As shown in Fig. 5e, the final sintered 3D shape is basically consistent with our initial design. Finally, Fig. 5f presents the experiment in which a ceramic tetrahedron is directly 4D printed. We use multimaterial DLP 3D printing to fabricate the 2D flat pattern with the determined design parameters, transform the 2D pattern to a 3D tetrahedron through dehydration, and convert the polymer-based tetrahedron to a ceramic one by sintering. The sintering process leads to the volume shrinkage and shape retraction, which is well predicted by the FE simulation.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^114DsCEp]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Local self-uniformity in photonic networks [^116M6HmM]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The WS cell is the basic building block from which an extended periodic network can be assembled. Stacking the WS cells of diamond and SNG produces extended diamond (Fig. 1b) and gyroid (Fig. 1e) networks, respectively. An extended periodic network of this type is a highly ordered case of a continuous random network (CRN). A general CRN is a collection of vertices, connected by edges, which are arbitrarily positioned in space. CRNs do not typically possess translational periodicities as the diamond and gyroid crystals do. Instead, Fig. 1c illustrates a classic CRN — an amorphous diamond network, studied extensively as a model of amorphous silicon. Every vertex in amorphous diamond is tetravalent and has four nearest neighbours that describe the points of a deformed tetrahedron. The resulting network is a connected assembly of deformed tetrahedral units. Similarly, an amorphous gyroid is a CRN comprising deformed trihedral units as depicted in Fig. 1f.

We now introduce the concept of a tree within a CRN. An n -tree on a vertex a of a CRN is the set of edges and vertices that can be reached from a by traversing no more than n edges. The tree's 'root edges' are understood to mean the edges belonging to vertex a. To illustrate this, the diamond WS cell (Fig. 1a) contains a 1-tree. The SNG WS cell (Fig. 1d) contains a single 2-tree. A tree thus describes a small network unit within a CRN.

We define LSU as a property of a CRN that describes the extent to which its component n -trees have shapes similar to that of nearby n -trees within the network. For the moment, we consider comparing some example 1-trees. Such trees consist of a central vertex with a number of edges γ. At first, we consider two trihedral 1-trees which we labeland.

### Structural puzzles in virology solved with an overarching icosahedral design principle [^112Rs9zT]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Viruses have evolved protein containers with a wide spectrum of icosahedral architectures to protect their genetic material. The geometric constraints defining these container designs, and their implications for viral evolution, are open problems in virology. The principle of quasi-equivalence is currently used to predict virus architecture, but improved imaging techniques have revealed increasing numbers of viral outliers. We show that this theory is a special case of an overarching design principle for icosahedral, as well as octahedral, architectures that can be formulated in terms of the Archimedean lattices and their duals. These surface structures encompass different blueprints for capsids with the same number of structural proteins, as well as for capsid architectures formed from a combination of minor and major capsid proteins, and are recurrent within viral lineages. They also apply to other icosahedral structures in nature, and offer alternative designs for man-made materials and nanocontainers in bionanotechnology.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^113w2hU4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Next, we connect the shrunken polyhedrons by extruding prismatic tubes on each shared face inside the template, as shown in Fig. 1e. Equations (1) and (2) are applied to the generation of tubes to connect adjacent shrunken polyhedrons. We apply a different construction method for the tube on the exterior boundary surface of a shrunken polyhedron, which was at the boundary of the template before the volumetric shrinkage. The tubular lengthgenerated along the exterior boundary surface in Fig. 1d is determined by the distance between the template and the exterior surface of a shrunken polyhedron along its average normal direction. After the geometric reconstruction, we obtain a nonperiodic modular origami structure with a curvilinear boundary, as shown in Fig. 1e. Note that the connected tubes serve as structural components, whereas the shrunken polyhedrons function as porous holes. See the synthesis in Supplementary Movie 1.

We can build other complex nonperiodic modular origami structures using the geometric reconstruction with the volumetric mapping into an arbitrary target shape and volumetric shrinkage of deformed polyhedrons, as illustrated in Fig. 1 f–j. Additional examples of the geometric reconstruction are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Information (SI). Although we focus on nonperiodic modular origami structures in this work, our synthesis method of the spatial architected materials can also be applied to planar cases, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1 of the SI, demonstrating that our design method is universal.

Construction of reconfigurable structures

Although the geometric reconstruction generates arbitrary 3D curvilinear structures through volumetric mapping and volumetric shrinkage of unit cells, the constructed origami structures hardly produce reconfigurability. From a macroscopic perspective, the fully connected origami modules with fully extruded tubes produce spatial loops, constraining the motion of the modules. Note that a module denotes a single origami unit constructed by the extruded tubes from the shrunken polyhedrons after geometric reconstruction, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. One can select rigid or flexible modules depending on their geometry and topology. From a microscopic perspective, the extruded prismatic tubes of irregular shrunken polyhedrons limit the range of motion of the whole assembly, as shown in Fig. 2 (see also Supplementary Fig. 4 of the SI).

### Mono-planar T-Hex: speed and flexibility for high-resolution 3D imaging [^114orJ3s]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trajectory design

2.1.1 Tilted hexagonal grids

Fast 3D Fourier encoding is often achieved by stacking identical 2D readouts in the third dimension. EPI and Archimedean spirals then form 2D Cartesian grids in planes orthogonal to the read direction. These planes, which are parallel for EPI and radial about the principal axis of the stack for spirals, shall be referred to as phase‐encoding (PE) planes. However, Cartesian sampling is usuallly suboptimal. Structures with approximately circular or elliptical support are sampled more efficiently on hexagonal grids. In parallel imaging with undersampling, the greater isotropy of hexagonal patterns improves the conditioning of image reconstruction for a given mean sampling density.,

Spiral and EPI trajectories can readily be stacked in such a way that they cover hexagonal grids in their PE planes (Figure 1A). However, due to the finite feasible length of individual readouts, one shot may not suffice to cover an entire nominal k‐space plane when targeting high resolution. The common solution to this problem is to segment each plane into N interleaved shots. However, due to the inflexibility in time allocation arising from N being an integer, it is often impossible to optimize the sequence timing for contrast and SNR as discussed more closely in the Supporting Information.

### Using symmetry to elucidate the importance of stoichiometry in colloidal crystal assembly [^11676sh5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Equation (2) is very similar to Eq. (1), and W will also undergo a combinatorial explosion if C j, the number of nodes in a category, j, is very large. However, relative to Eq. (1) this explosion is delayed by two factors. First, we have used symmetry to reduce the degrees of freedom by considering only the fundamental domain, which can be as little as one twelfth of the total primitive cell area. Second, we have reduced these degrees of freedom even further by using the symmetry of each group to remove edge nodes within a fundamental domain's lattice which are not independent. The second condition plays a significant role when the number of edge nodes relative to those on the face is large.

Enumerating structures

Combining symmetry and stoichiometry to cast the structure prediction problem as a CSP permits the tractable enumeration of crystalline configurations satisfying a given stoichiometric ratio up to moderately sized primitive cells. To see this, one may compute the number of nodes per edge of the fundamental domain for each group such that the nodal density approaches, but does not exceed, that of a chosen p1 reference cell. This reference cell is assumed to have N g nodes per edge and represents the case where no internal symmetry is present so that configurations are generated combinatorially without constraint. In our approach, an equally weighted average over all groups suggests that when N g ≈ 8 the total number of edge nodes will be equal to the number of face nodes (cf. Methods). For fundamental domains smaller than this, we expect that boundary symmetry for the groups will play a dominant role in determining valid configurations in the CSP. Taking the spatial discretization to also be on the order of the colloidal diameter, δ ~ σ, the limiting p1 fundamental domain is on the order of A ~ 8 σ × 8 σ. This is as large as boxes used to simulate many coarse-grained or colloidal fluids, implying that the upper bound for the primitive cell that can be feasibly generated with this method is reasonably large.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^111UHwju]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Synthesis of nonperiodic modular origami

Inspired by the pioneering work on the space-filling tessellation to construct 3D modular origami with prismatic tubes, we implement the synthesis principle to 3D curvilinear shapes with nonperiodic tiling of irregular polyhedrons. Figure 1 presents our synthesis procedure for 3D curvilinear modular origami structures. A unit cell consisting of single or multiple polyhedrons is first selected, as shown in Fig. 1a. A nonperiodic tessellation into a prescribed curvilinear geometry is then applied, as illustrated in Fig. 1b, to build a template, such as that presented in Fig. 1c. While constructing the template, we implement a volumetric mapping of the unit cell using the optimum transport algorithmfor a target number of tessellations, e.g.in Fig. 1c, to obtain deformed irregular polyhedrons generated by the minimum energy for deformation. During the volumetric mapping, the polyhedrons in unit cells are involved in nonhomogeneous deformation.

### Deep plane face lift in Asian patients [^116eu2CQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

On a conceptual basis, the deep plane dissection is explained as dissecting through the facial soft-tissue spaces with precise release of the retaining ligaments in the interval between these spaces to achieve the desired mobilization of the superficial fascia (Fig. 6). – The microscopic anatomy of the facial soft-tissue spaces has not been conclusively demonstrated until recently.– In contrast to the previous conceptualization of layer 4 as being true space or "cleavage plane " at the location of the facial soft-tissue spaces, in reality, the microstructure of spaces consists of specialized deep retinacular fibers arranged in multilayered sheets that are closely stacked in a mille-feuille–like arrangement (Figs. 7 and 8). Slight gliding of these sheets relative to adjacent sheets, collectively allows for significant movement of the mimetic muscle in the superficial fascia over the deep fascia. The facial nerves traversing through these spaces, are located at the deepest part of the deep fascia, at the bottom of the mille-feuille. Therefore, spaces as previously described may safely be dissected above the facial nerve branches by staying just under the mimetic muscles (ie, just under the platysma or the orbicularis oculi). With this addendum to the understanding of the microscopic architecture of the facial soft-tissue spaces, the previous descriptions of the spaces otherwise remain accurate and correct in its locations and relations. Histologically, the retaining ligaments are dense collections of deep retinacula cutis fibers oriented more vertically to the skin, and they must be sharply released to allow mobilization of the superficial fascia. These retaining ligaments also serve as transition points where facial nerves pass from within the deep fascia to the underside of the superficial fascia to innervate the facial mimetic muscles. Therefore, releasing the retaining ligaments must be performed carefully under direct visualization.

### Quantitative mappings between symmetry and topology in solids [^116GbBWC]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.

### Deep and high-resolution three-dimensional tracking of single particles using nonlinear and multiplexed illumination [^114Nh3H3]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

Spatiotemporal multiplexer design

In the spatiotemporal multiplexed scheme, laser pulses emitted with a 13-ns period from a Ti:sapphire oscillator are separated into four beams, which are delayed by 3.3 ns each and focused through a high numerical aperture objective at slightly offset xyz positions. The four resulting 2P excitation volumes are arranged into a barely overlapped, tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 1c), to generate selective excitation equivalent to the spatial filtering condition in the previous four-detector confocal tracking set-up, with each 2P excitation volume receiving laser pulses at a different time delay. For a fluorescent particle residing somewhere inside the excitation tetrahedron, its 2P emission is collected by a PMT (PMT1 in Fig. 1a). By time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) detection, each detected photon is assigned to a specific time gate (G 1 –G 4, here assuming the decay time is ∼4 ns or less) in the fluorescence decay histogram (Fig. 1b), and therefore attributed to an individual excitation volume. For a particle sitting at the centre of the tetrahedron, the resulting photon counts are approximately equal in all four time gates. An offset of the particle from the tetrahedron centre can be estimated from the normalized photon count differences in the four time gates (that is, error signals E x, E y and E z in Supplementary Methods). Once the particle position offset is determined, a closed feedback loop then steers galvanometer mirrors and the objective z-piezo stage to lock the tracking beams on the particle. A particle's 3D trajectory is therefore determined directly from the controller output sent to the galvanometer and piezo actuators.

### Quantifying similarity of pore-geometry in nanoporous materials [^116c2coZ]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To analyse this point cloud with persistent homology tools, it is necessary to decrease the number of points by performing a secondary sampling, since the raw output is too large to be handled: hundreds of thousands of points for each supercell. On the one hand, it is important to have a fine enough resolution to capture details of the pore structures using only finitely many points and to ensure that the barcode assignment is stable with respect to the choice of the point cloud. On the other hand, high resolutions increase computational costs for the persistence computation. We use a combination of random sampling and grid sampling. The grid sampling guarantees that different samplings of a structure give comparable barcodes, in particular by ensuring that points on narrow parts of the pore system are sampled while still maintaining its connectivity. On the other hand, the random sampling prevents picking up the grid structure in the barcodes. For the random sampling we choose one point per 2 Å 2 surface area while respecting a minimal distance r min between two sampled points where we decrease r min in steps of 0.1 Å starting with r min = 1.3 Å until the given number of points has been selected. The grid size is 0.5 Å and for each cube of the grid the point of the original point cloud is chosen that is closest to the midpoint of the cube. A point of the grid sampling is added to the random sampling whenever its distance to the randomly sampled points is greater than the final value of r min.

### From molecular to macroscopic via the rational design of a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal [^1149uWFg]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

We live in a macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) world, but our best description of the structure of matter is at the atomic and molecular scale. Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter. The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends. Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so; the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 A resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle. The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control.

### Fully addressable designer superstructures assembled from one single modular DNA origami [^117YGoEp]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For the hierarchical assembly of superstructures, connectivity always faces one of two problems: On the one hand, assemblies of self-complementary DONs lead to repetitive, homomultimeric finiteor periodic, superstructures. This approach is simple and cost-effective, as in principle only one type of monomer is required. However, it has the great disadvantage of an overall loss of structural control of the superstructure beyond the repetitive subunit, as only form and size of the subunit is controlled, yet superstructure formation occurs without control over the final structure. Consequently, it is impossible to controllably retain the site-specific addressability of the structure beyond the single monomer or subunit. On the other hand, assemblies made up of many different DONs, each complementary to one another, but not themselves, yield finite, heteromultimeric superstructures. With this approach the structural control over the superstructure is high and the site-specific addressability is retained. However, the downsides are the requirement for a multitude of different DONs, leading to high design effort and increasing costs, proportional to superstructure size, and/or the need to be assembled in several steps, resulting in a tremendous decrease in overall yield.

Therefore, currently, concepts combining both low cost and high structural versatility are missing. Such concepts could alleviate the issues associated with traditional hierarchical assembly and allow for the controlled assembly of large superstructures, or a multitude of orthogonal smaller structures, with retained site-specific addressability across the entire superstructure.

In response to this challenge, we developed two methods for modularity and combined them in one structure, the moDON, a single modular DNA origami formed from one set of staples, but capable of folding into tens of thousands of different connection configurations. The large number of orthogonal connection sites allows us to increase the number of monomers in one-pot assemblies, circumventing the extraction and purification of intermediates as generally required in traditional hierarchical assembly. We were able to controllably assemble and disassemble manifolds of moDONs into large superstructures as well as smaller, more complex structures, in the xy- as well as in the z-plane.

### Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks with pto and mhq-z topologies based on tri-and tetratopic linkers [^112y6hxP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess higher surface areas, more abundant pore channels, and lower density compared to their two-dimensional counterparts which makes the development of 3D COFs interesting from a fundamental and practical point of view. However, the construction of highly crystalline 3D COF remains challenging. At the same time, the choice of topologies in 3D COFs is limited by the crystallization problem, the lack of availability of suitable building blocks with appropriate reactivity and symmetries, and the difficulties in crystalline structure determination. Herein, we report two highly crystalline 3D COFs with pto and mhq-z topologies designed by rationally selecting rectangular-planar and trigonal-planar building blocks with appropriate conformational strains. The pto 3D COFs show a large pore size of 46Å with an extremely low calculated density. The mhq-z net topology is solely constructed from totally face-enclosed organic polyhedra displaying a precise uniform micropore size of 1.0nm. The 3D COFs show a high CO 2 adsorption capacity at room temperature and can potentially serve as promising carbon capture adsorbents. This work expands the choice of accessible 3D COF topologies, enriching the structural versatility of COFs.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^1138b2vi]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Shown in Fig. 2g is a dendrogram for the image shown in Fig. 2a based on a classification of the distance to the central atom in a six neighbour case. A dendrogram plot illustrates hierarchical cluster arrangement in a top-down approach, where all observations are grouped into a single cluster initially and are recursively separated down the hierarchy. This is achieved by establishing a distance metric between observations and linkage criteria used to find the dissimilarity of clusters as a function of pairwise distances. It then follows that vertical axis in the dendrogram plot represents the distance between the two data points being connected (by whatever metric of choice), and the largest drops indicate major changes in data organization. On the basis of dendrogram for Fig. 2g, the strongest cluster separation occurs for two, three and four clusters with more than four clusters being the limit of significant optimization gain. We have found that a large percentage of total clusters identify strong outliers, that is, points found at the edges of the image, which while rigorously correct does not add to the understanding of the material being imaged. Therefore, we chose to omit the atoms that lie on the image boundary as centre atoms; however, their positions are still utilized as neighbours for the atoms further inward in the image. The results of four cluster separation based on the distance metric are shown in Fig. 2b, and for four clusters with an angle metric in Fig. 2c. Rotation is accounted for by always placing the first neighbour atom in the same location relative to the centre and filling the rest in a clockwise manner. Figure 3a–d shows where the atoms from each of the clusters are located on the initial image, with an accompanying FFT (Fig. 3 (I–IV)) of the cluster points illustrating the symmetry of their relative distribution, as well as a 2D histogram of the nearest neighbour environment for atoms within the cluster.

### Using symmetry to elucidate the importance of stoichiometry in colloidal crystal assembly [^115be32B]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Creating regular grids on fundamental domains

First, a regular grid, as depicted in Fig. 1a, is created over the surface of a group's fundamental domain. Nodes are placed along each edge with as close to the same spacing as possible such that there exist nodes at the termini of each edge. If this domain is triangular, the number of nodes along each edge must be identical so that interior nodes fall on the resulting parallelogram's diagonals. This happens regardless of the relative lengths of the sides. If this domain is a parallelogram, the number of nodes placed along adjacent edges may sometimes be different if the two sides have unequal lengths, as allowed by symmetry constraints. This scheme covers different wallpaper groups differently, but in a consistent fashion which is commensurate with each group's unique symmetry.

Different groups have differently shaped fundamental domains, with the number of domains per primitive cell ranging from 1 to 12; therefore, we cannot simply place nodes at a fixed spacing along the edges of each group's fundamental domain and compute all possible resulting primitive cells as they would vary significantly in size. A more even-handed comparison can be made by working in reverse to compute the requisite grid spacings for each group's fundamental domain so that their primitive cells all cover a similar area. Although fundamental domains vary in shape, an approximate comparison may be made as follows.

As a reference, we consider a p1 primitive cell containingtotal nodes, and attempt to make the primitive cells of other groups have the same number of nodes. The number of nodes per edge of a group's fundamental domain may be estimated aswhere N 1 is the number of nodes along the shorter of the two edges which define the group's primitive cell, r ≥ 1 is the ratio of the lengths of these edges, N d is the number of fundamental domains per primitive cell, and N s is the number of sides the fundamental domain has. The number of nodes on the longer edge is given by. A more detailed derivation is presented in the Supplementary Methods. The result is always a lattice that has no more thantotal nodes; consequently, N g should be viewed as a parameter that simply provides a way to compare the groups to each other by making their primitive cells congruent.

The scaling constraint in Eq. (1) forces the direction of connection on the-th face to be parallel after shrinking, i.e. critical for building a connection with adjacent shrunken polyhedrons. Our work is different from previous work, where the connecting direction was normal to the regular polyhedrons; instead, we determine the connecting direction by bridging the centroids of the deformed polyhedrons in the template. We obtain the length of the connectionbetween the adjacent shrunken polyhedrons:

### Rational design of crystalline two-dimensional frameworks with highly complicated topological structures [^113MTGyU]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Thanks to the advantages of their conjugated skeletons and porosities, 2D COFs have been extensively exploited to be functional materials with versatile applications ranging from gas separation and storage –, catalysis –, drug delivery, sensing –, proton conduction, to optoelectronic devices –. However, despite the progress achieved, the topological structures of 2D COFs are still limited to simple tessellation patterns, which are mainly tiled by only one geometric shape (usually hexagon or tetragon), leading to COFs with homogeneous porosities –. In 2014, we reported a Kagome-type 2D COF in which hexagonal mesopores and triangular micropores alternately and periodically distribute. Following this dual-pore COF, triple-pore COFs were successful achieved in 2016, which increased the complexity in the tessellations of 2D COFs to a higher level. Such heteropore COFs possess hierarchical structures and exhibit heterogeneous porosities, which benefit for exploiting new properties, functions and applications –. For example, making use of the advantage that the different kinds of pores can be independently modified and functionalized, distinct functions can be introduced into different types of pores and thus advanced materials with integrated functions can be fabricated. Moreover, different guest molecules, even those incompatible with each other, might be encapsulated in the different types of pores of one COF due to their different pore environments. On the other hand, hierarchically porous materials have already been found to exhibit some advantages over homogeneous ones, such as minimizing diffusion barriers, improving mass transport, and increasing distribution of active sites. Indeed, the inimitable advantages of COFs with hierarchical porosity were demonstrated in recent research led by Ma, which clearly showed that a Kagome-shaped dual-pore COF outperformed the COF with uniform porosity in enzyme catalytic performance by loading the enzyme in the large hexagonal pores while making the small triangular pores free to transport reactants and products. Despite the great potential applications, COFs with complex tessellation patterns have remained very difficult to achieve.

We herein report a facile and general approach to fabricate 2D COFs which bear three or four different kinds of pores in one framework. To the best of our knowledge, the latter is the highest level of hierarchy and complexity held by a 2D COF reported so far, demonstrating a successful step further to challenge the structural complexity in the tessellations of 2D polymers.

### Anatomy of the facial glideplanes, deep plane spaces, and ligaments: implications for surgical and nonsurgical lifting procedures [^117NsmMi]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This mechanical principle may be part of the explanation for the lateral sweep phenomenon after face-lift surgery: recurrence of the sagging of the medial (nonreleased) tissues while the lateral (released) tissues remain lifted. The same principle of release-redraping is demonstrated in the subcutaneous plane by the recently reported gliding brow lift. Our study provides arguments for wide release but not for the plane in which to perform the release. Suggestions that the SMAS can withstand larger forces without stretching as compared with the skin were not objectively verified. While we are advocates of the deep plane face lift, it is possible that more superficial dissection planes (eg, extended supraplatysmal plane, gliding plane) can yield similar results with a similar amount of release; that is, of course, if the soft-tissue volumes (eg, jowls, malar fat pad, buccal fat pad, submandibular glands, subplatysmal fat, anterior digastric muscles) are adequately managed separately.

### Chromosome segregation dynamics during the cell cycle of Staphylococcus aureus [^11434Aey]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Most knowledge on chromosome segregation comes from a selected group of rod-shaped model organisms. The geometry of the bacterium is a key player in its spatial organization, as the presence of topologically different regions allows to determine separate spaces in the cell. For example, proteins sensing curvature are involved in chromosome positioning, division site placement, and cell morphogenesis –. Therefore, the existence of spherical bacteria which, during part of the cell cycle, appear to have a constant curvature in every direction of their surfaces, raises questions about how their chromosomes are spatially organized and how this organization is maintained.

The model organism used in this work, Staphylococcus aureus, is a firmicute with a nearly spherical morphology. S. aureus is a human opportunistic pathogen that generally inhabits the skin as a commensal but can cause a variety of infections. Moreover, many S. aureus strains have acquired resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, and some pathogenic strains are resistant to many antibiotic classes. Its widespread presence in the human population, combined with its drug resistance, makes S. aureus a significant threat to human health and a major cause of death from antibiotic-resistant infections. Besides its clinical relevance, S. aureus is an important model organism in the bacterial cell biology field, as it is one of the few intensively studied coccoid organisms. Its cell cycle is divided into three stages –: it begins with Phase 1 (P1), characterized by a nearly spherical newborn cell. As the cell starts to build a septum, it transitions into Phase 2 (P2), during which the DNA must be segregated into each of the developing compartments or hemispheres. Previous data suggest that septum formation is determined by the orientation of the segregated chromosomes, linking nucleoid spatial organization with cell division. Once the septum is completed, the cell enters Phase 3 (P3), characterized by two compartmentalized cytoplasmic spaces. At the end of P3 the septum splits rapidly, giving rise to two P1 cells.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^113SqZYJ]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Advances in electron and probe microscopies allow 10pm or higher precision in measurements of atomic positions. This level of fidelity is sufficient to correlate the length (and hence energy) of bonds, as well as bond angles to functional properties of materials. Traditionally, this relied on mapping locally measured parameters to macroscopic variables, for example, average unit cell. This description effectively ignores the information contained in the microscopic degrees of freedom available in a high-resolution image. Here we introduce an approach for local analysis of material structure based on statistical analysis of individual atomic neighbourhoods. Clustering and multivariate algorithms such as principal component analysis explore the connectivity of lattice and bond structure, as well as identify minute structural distortions, thus allowing for chemical description and identification of phases. This analysis lays the framework for building image genomes and structure-property libraries, based on conjoining structural and spectral realms through local atomic behaviour.

### Two simple movement mechanisms for spatial division of labour in social insects [^116P3f11]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Many animal species divide space into a patchwork of home ranges, yet there is little consensus on the mechanisms individuals use to maintain fidelity to particular locations. Theory suggests that animal movement could be based upon simple behavioural rules that use local information such as olfactory deposits, or global strategies, such as long-range biases toward landmarks. However, empirical studies have rarely attempted to distinguish between these mechanisms. Here, we perform individual tracking experiments on four species of social insects, and find that colonies consist of different groups of workers that inhabit separate but partially-overlapping spatial zones. Our trajectory analysis and simulations suggest that worker movement is consistent with two local mechanisms: one in which workers increase movement diffusivity outside their primary zone, and another in which workers modulate turning behaviour when approaching zone boundaries. Parallels with other organisms suggest that local mechanisms might represent a universal method for spatial partitioning in animal populations.

### Human V4 size predicts crowding distance [^1177XV4w]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

V4 as a gateway to the ventral stream

The sharp divide between the results in V4 and those in V1 to V3 surprised us. Why should the neural resources in a single brain area be linked to crowding thresholds, when image recognition involves many stages of processing, from optics to retina to the brain? We interpret this sharp divide as evidence for a spacing bottleneck in recognition. Suppose that each visual area has its own spacing threshold, such that neural responses to a target object are suppressed whenever there are similar objects closer to the target than its threshold separation. Our interpretation is that the psychophysical crowding distance is determined by the visual area in which the separation threshold is largest, meaning the area most sensitive to stimulus spacing. Our study implies that among posterior maps V4 is the most sensitive, i.e. has the largest spacing threshold. This result is consistent with known properties of visual maps. For example, from V1 to V4, the size of receptive fields increases – and the surface area decreases, so that there are decreasing numbers of neurons to analyze a given part of the visual field in higher visual areas. Hence if objects are sufficiently spaced for V4 (greater than about 1.4 mm), they will also be sufficiently spaced for earlier areas such as V1 to V3. The opposite, however, is not true: if stimuli are sufficiently spaced for V1, they can still be insufficiently spaced for V4. This is why visual areas prior to V4 are not spacing bottlenecks and do not correlate with crowding measures.

### Cellular geometry scaling ensures robust division site positioning [^117L3Hrz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Cells of a specific cell type may divide within a certain size range. Yet, functionally optimal cellular organization is typically maintained across different cell sizes, a phenomenon known as scaling. The mechanisms underlying scaling and its physiological significance remain elusive. Here we approach this problem by interfering with scaling in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus that relies on cellular geometry cues to position the division site. We show that S. japonicus uses the Cdc42 polarity module to adjust its geometry to changes in the cell size. When scaling is prevented resulting in abnormal cellular length-to-width aspect ratio, cells exhibit severe division site placement defects. We further show that despite the generally accepted view, a similar scaling phenomenon can occur in the sister species, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our results demonstrate that scaling is required for normal cell function and delineate possible rules for cellular geometry maintenance in populations of proliferating cells.

### Rational design of crystalline supermicroporous covalent organic frameworks with triangular topologies [^1153ccuS]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of highly ordered porous polymers with many potential applications. They are currently designed and synthesized through hexagonal and tetragonal topologies, limiting the access to and exploration of new structures and properties. Here, we report that a triangular topology can be developed for the rational design and synthesis of a new class of COFs. The triangular topology features small pore sizes down to 12Å, which is among the smallest pores for COFs reported to date, and high π-column densities of up to 0.25nm(-2), which exceeds those of supramolecular columnar π-arrays and other COF materials. These crystalline COFs facilitate π-cloud delocalization and are highly conductive, with a hole mobility that is among the highest reported for COFs and polygraphitic ensembles.

### Single-cell spatial reconstruction reveals global division of labour in the mammalian liver [^114Gipk7]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.

### Two-dimensional nanoframes with dual rims [^1145642T]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The synthesis of highly complex two-dimensional (2D) metal nanoframes remains a great challenge. Synthetic strategies for preparing 2D metal nanoframes are few, and rational and systematic synthetic pathways to more complicated architectures have not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate a stepwise synthetic strategy for complex 2D metal nanoframes with a high degree of intricacy; the strategy leads to a variety of shapes, including rings, triangles, hexagons, and tripods with tailorable single or double frames in a single entity. These nanoframes of high homogeneity could be obtained through selective combination of four different chemical toolkits consisting of selective etching and deposition on certain facets, and concentric and/or eccentric regrowth by controlling the mismatches of lattice constants of metals. The resulting nanoframes were highly homogeneous in size and shape and had van der Waals interactions that maximized rim-to-rim contact, allowing them to uniquely self-assemble into large-area superstructures.

### Optimizing the design of spatial genomic studies [^115zxifJ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Maximizing information gain to find the optimal cross-section

Our goal is to find the set of points in a tissue that maximize the EIG (Eq. (8)). However, because we are constrained to collect two-dimensional cross-sections of a tissue, rather than any arbitrary subset of spatial locations, we must constrain each candidate design's spatial locations X to lie on a plane.

This is equivalent to choosing a plane P t representing a two-dimensional cross-section of the slice collected at time t. Although there are an infinite number of potential cross-sections, we simplify the optimization problem by discretizing the space of cross-sections. Specifically, we create a design space with D cross-sections, where D can be chosen depending on computational resources and required precision. The optimization problem then reduces to maximizing over a discrete set, which in this setting is typically a tractable problem.

Because slices consist of entire cross-sections of the tissue, each slice creates a new, disjoint tissue fragment. At the start of iteration t, we will have taken t − 1 slices, so the tissue will be split into t disjoint fragments. We account for this by considering the candidate cross-sections in each fragment separately. Letbe the set of spatial locations corresponding to tissue fragment t, and letbe the set of planes intersecting. Note that, by definition, for all t it must hold that

The optimization problem on iteration t is then to find the slice (or m slices) that maximizes the EIG for the current set of tissue fragments:

Localizing a tissue region of interest

Next, we consider an experimental design setting in which there is a particular region of space withinwhose borders we would like to identify. For example, we may be studying a biopsy sample from a tumor tissue, and we would like to identify the border between the tumor and healthy tissue using as few slices as possible. This localization problem is a common goal in cancer pathology.

For simplicity, assume that we can label each spatial location as being on the interior of the region of interest (y = 1) or the exterior of the region of interest (y = 0) after we have collected data for that location. On experimental iteration t, we collect data from a cross-section of the tissue defined by P t, where the data are made up of the spatial locationsand the interior/exterior labels for those locations, where n t is the number of points observed after taking slice P t.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^111XdEGG]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Stereological principles in quantitative image analysis — stereology is the statistical science providing practical methods for extracting accurate and precise quantitative structural information from imaging data sets of irregular objects; stereological methods make no assumptions regarding shape, size, orientation, or spatial distribution of objects and are unbiased by design rather than relying on geometric model assumptions, and stereology is the method of choice for quantifying lung structure in microscopy, with the same principles applying to CT (computed tomography), micro-CT, PET, MRI, and other modalities ("in vivo morphometry").

### In vivo production of RNA nanostructures via programmed folding of single-stranded RNAs [^116xTsEA]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We have characterized the tetrahedron by native PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 6), AFM imaging (Fig. 4c, d), and cryoEM (Fig. 4e–g). PAGE analysis suggests that RNA molecules efficiently fold into the designed structures (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Each sample appears as a sharp, dominant band in the corresponding lane. The migration pattern is consistent with the expected structures. The fully-folded, compact, 3D tetrahedron (T4) has a higher mobility than the open, 2D, double-triangle structure (T4*). The folding is fast, and no difference has been observed between quenching and annealing for each sample. In the lane of T4, no RNA migrates like the partially folded T4* molecule; suggesting that all T4 molecules are fully folded. In order to confirm the migration pattern and the folding ability, we have prepared two more RNA tetrahedrons with different sizes and their corresponding control molecules: a three-turn-edged tetrahedron (T3 and T3*, 484 bases long, Supplementary Fig. 5) and a two-turn-edged tetrahedron (T2 and T2✱, 340 bases long, Supplementary Fig. 5). Similar migration patterns are observed (Supplementary Fig. 6 b-c). AFM imaging gives more direct structural clues. T4 samples appear compact and consistent with a collapsed tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 4c), while T4* samples exhibit clear double-triangle structures (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7). Please note that some T4 structures are disturbed during AFM imaging.

CryoEM study revealed the native, 3D, tetrahedral structure of T4. In raw images of the T4 sample (Fig. 4e), uniform-sized particles could be easily identified (indicated with white boxes). Their shapes resembled the 2D projections of a tetrahedron. From the observed individual particles, a technique of single-particle 3D reconstruction was applied and resulted in a structural model of a tetrahedron at a resolution of 4.1 nm (Fig. 4f). To verify the reconstructed model, two comparisons were performed: the computed 2D projections with individual raw particles (Fig. 4g) and with class averages of raw particles with similar views (see Supplementary Fig. 8). Clear similarities in the pairwise comparisons verified the reconstructed model. Note that the six struts in the model were not the same.

### Newborns' mooney-face perception [^114jNU3Z]. Infancy (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether newborns detect a face on the basis of a Gestalt representation based on first-order relational information (i.e., the basic arrangement of face features) by using Mooney stimuli. The incomplete 2-tone Mooney stimuli were used because they preclude focusing both on the local features (i.e., the fine details of the individual features) and on the second-order relational information (i.e., the distance between the internal elements); therefore, face detection can rely only on a Gestalt representation of a face. Two experiments were carried out by using a preferential looking procedure. Experiment 1 demonstrated that newborns prefer upright Mooney faces to inverted Mooney faces (180° rotated). Experiment 2 showed that newborns prefer a Mooney face as compared to a Mooney-like object equated for the number of elements in the upper part. Overall, the results indicate that newborns bind and organize the fragmentary parts of the Mooneized face stimulus into a whole and detect the first-order relations of a face on the basis of holistic processing.

### Patchy particles made by colloidal fusion [^11527y2p]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Patches on the surfaces of colloidal particles provide directional information that enables the self-assembly of the particles into higher-order structures. Although computational tools can make quantitative predictions and can generate design rules that link the patch motif of a particle to its internal microstructure and to the emergent properties of the self-assembled materials, the experimental realization of model systems of particles with surface patches (or 'patchy' particles) remains a challenge. Synthetic patchy colloidal particles are often poor geometric approximations of the digital building blocks used in simulations and can only rarely be manufactured in sufficiently high yields to be routinely used as experimental model systems. Here we introduce a method, which we refer to as colloidal fusion, for fabricating functional patchy particles in a tunable and scalable manner. Using coordination dynamics and wetting forces, we engineer hybrid liquid-solid clusters that evolve into particles with a range of patchy surface morphologies on addition of a plasticizer. We are able to predict and control the evolutionary pathway by considering surface-energy minimization, leading to two main branches of product: first, spherical particles with liquid surface patches, capable of forming curable bonds with neighbouring particles to assemble robust supracolloidal structures; and second, particles with a faceted liquid compartment, which can be cured and purified to yield colloidal polyhedra. These findings outline a scalable strategy for the synthesis of patchy particles, first by designing their surface patterns by computer simulation, and then by recreating them in the laboratory with high fidelity.

### Complex wireframe DNA nanostructures from simple building blocks [^111C3tY2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The field of DNA nanotechnology has enjoyed extraordinary success in constructing structures with ever increasing complexity, as defined by the number of addressable components –. Two methods have stood out: the scaffolded origami approach of folding a long scaffold with help of many short staple strands – and the scaffold-free approach with locally connected DNA LEGO™ bricks to determine global shape –. Phenomenal progress has been made in several recent studies to upgrade both size and complexity of the DNA structures, including two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) arrays with an unprecedented number of addressable components. Recently, wireframe architecture has also been introduced to the origami approach to make structures using sophisticated scaffold routing –. On the other hand, despite scaffold-free assembly's capacity to employ up to 33,000 distinct strandsas compared to DNA origami's 1600 distinct strands, complex wireframe architectures have not been fully demonstrated with the scaffold-free approach –. One of the challenges was believed to be limited structural stability in the absence of a long scaffold. However, the advantages of using a scaffold-free approach to assemble complex wireframe structures entirely out of short DNA strands are clear: the design process would be streamlined without having to route a long scaffold, and structure size would no longer be constrained by scaffold length. Therefore, the scaffold-free wireframe framework potentially provides more design freedom and is a more generalizable design platform for arbitrary structures. A typical process in designing a wireframe structure from short synthetic strands is straightforward, and it is pipelined as: (1) rendering a specific 2D or 3D geometry (Fig. 1a) as a node-edge network with DNA junctions of different numbers of arms as nodes and DNA duplexes of variable lengths as edges (Fig. 1b), (2) segmenting edges to complementary domains to ensure that corresponding strands with multiple domains satisfy synthesis and self-assembly requirements (Fig. 1c), and (3) populating strands with sequences to meet certain sequence generation criteria(Fig. 1d). Facilitated by our design program, we have designed, constructed, and characterized many wireframe structures. This includes 2D arrays of regular, quasi-regular or irregular tessellation patterns with vertices of different numbers of arms, tubes of different shapes, multiple polyhedra with more sophisticated tessellation connectivity, and most importantly, multi-layer 3D arrays with 4-arm or 6-arm junctions acting as vertices. The robust self-assembly proves that the local interactions among short strands can collectively provide sufficient overall structural integrity and while precisely defining a complex geometry. A reincarnation of the original blueprint of DNA nanotechnology, our findings in this study redefine the feasibility of using flexible components to self-assemble DNA nanostructures in an adaptive fashion.

### Recommendations for multimodality assessment of congenital coronary anomalies: a guide from the American Society of Echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111ZJr1D]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) coronary artery (CA) imaging — parasternal and complementary echocardiographic views delineate anomalous origins and courses. An infant example shows the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) arising from the right coronary artery (RCA) and crossing the right ventricular outflow tract; from the parasternal long-axis view the left coronary artery (LCA) is seen anterior to the right ventricular infundibulum, and from the parasternal short-axis view the LAD is seen arising from the RCA and crossing anterior to the pulmonary artery, with intraoperative images confirming the LAD coursing across the outflow tract below the main pulmonary artery. Once spatial orientation is ascertained, there are five other points to keep in mind while scanning for the coronaries: the semilunar valve cusp alignment, the location of the CAs relative to the commissures, the vertical location within the sinuses, the distance to the translocation site on the pulmonary artery, and the course of each CA. Varying echocardiographic windows can aid in the localization of the CAs; the parasternal short-axis view using right or left parasternal windows is usually quite helpful because the semilunar valves appear en face; the high right parasternal window may permit visualization of the CA arising from the right-facing sinus, and the high left parasternal window may yield a better view of the CA arising from the left-facing sinus; the parasternal short axis view is also important in identifying the cusp alignment and to help determine the distance the CA must be moved during translocation. The parasternal short-axis view is also the best imaging plane to detect an intramural course between the two great arteries, and color Doppler can confirm the flow between the two great arteries in patients suspected of having an intramural CA course; this view can also be used to show the LCA division into the LAD and LCx, where the LCx from the right-facing sinus can often be seen coursing behind the pulmonary artery and the RCA from the left-facing sinus can often be seen crossing anterior to the aorta; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide analogous views that may complement transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in identifying each CA origin and course, and in apical and subcostal views the LCx from the right-facing sinus can often be seen coursing posterior to the pulmonary artery and anterior to the mitral valve.

### Programming molecular topologies from single-stranded nucleic acids [^116B2mJn]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Producing 3D ssDNA knots

The design procedures presented here can also be applied to create 3D architectures with arbitrary geometries. We demonstrated the versatility of our method by constructing four ssDNA polyhedral meshes: a tetrahedron, a square pyramid, a triangular prism, and a pentagonal pyramid with crossing numbers 15, 20, 22, and 25, respectively (Fig. 4). A Schlegel diagram was used to transfer the 3D objects to their topologically equivalent 2D nets. Optimized folding pathways were designed carefully for step-wise hierarchical assembly and the corresponding ssDNA strands were designed, synthesized, and assembled. AFM images showed an abundance of well-folded 3D nanoparticles with the expected sizes (Supplementary Figures 13–16 and Supplementary Tables 4–7). Single particle cryo-EM 3D reconstruction revealed that the overall conformations matched the designed geometries well (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figures 17, 18, and Supplementary Table 8). Notably, the vertex design for our ssDNA knots was different from the multi-arm junction design based on the double-crossover (DX) motif. Instead, there is a 5 bp difference in length between the two parallel dsDNAs that form each edge, leading to chiral vertices and inclined edges in the ssDNA knots (Fig. 4). This unique geometric feature could be used to identify conformational diastereomers, which is when the structure is turned inside out, while satisfying all programmed Watson–Crick base pairing with the same network connectivity. The 3D reconstruction data suggested that the ssDNA knots preferred to point the major grooves inwards at the vertices. A similar feature had been previously observed for the wireframe DNA nanostructures.

By following the same design rules of two-dimensional knots, several three-dimensional DNA knot frameworks were designed (middle panels of two different view angles for each structure). The cryo-EM reconstruction (right panel) revealed the correct formations of a tetrahedron with crossing number 15 (a), a square pyramid with crossing number 20 (b), a triangular prism with crossing number 22 (c), and a pentagonal pyramid with crossing number 25 (d).

### Development of an objective method to quantify hippocampal dentation [^111Hyqir]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3.4 Simplification of strip point cloud data

Although the strip traced on the swath is very thin, it consists of a mesh that is two or more faces wide defined by multiple vertices that are not equally distributed in space. The coordinates of these vertices of these faces represent a point cloud in 3D space that needs to be simplified to single curvilinear set of points, and then dimensionally reduced to a curve in 2D space for analysis (Figure 6). The point cloud (PC) data in.ply file format was imported to MATLAB. By using an in‐house developed MATLAB script (the code is not platform specific and is freely available upon request), the PC data was simplified to get a single curvilinear set of points. The steps involved are listed below.

FIGURE 6
Steps involved in the simplification of point cloud (PC) data. (a) Original strip of prominently dentated hippocampus shown in the top down view using MeshLab, (b) original PC and simplified data in x – y (top down view), (c) enlarged view of PC and simplified data (top down view), (d) original strip of prominently dentated hippocampus in the side view and (e) original PC and simplified data in x – z (side view) and (f) enlarged view of PC and simplified data (side view).

1. The PC data was sorted in the ascending order of the x ‐value. Here, x ‐ and y ‐values represent the path of the strip and z ‐values reflect the undulation seen on the dentated surface (Figure 6d).

2. In order to have a uniformly distributed set of data points in the simplified data, the original PC data was divided into 100 bins equally spaced in the x direction, which is the long axis of the swath.

3. The simplified set of points has an x ‐value at the center of each bin, providing equal spacing in the x ‐direction. A sliding window averaging technique was applied on the new x ‐values to calculate the local average y and z coordinate points for the simplified data. To provide a smooth contour and avoid jitter due to variation in strip width, a window size of plus and minus two bins was used for averaging of y ‐ and z ‐values throughout this experiment.

### Seeing mesoatomic distortions in soft-matter crystals of a double-gyroid block copolymer [^115Darj1]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Supramolecular soft crystals are periodic structures that are formed by the hierarchical assembly of complex constituents, and occur in a broad variety of 'soft-matter' systems 1. Such soft crystals exhibit many of the basic features (such as three-dimensional lattices and space groups) and properties (such as band structure and wave propagation) of their 'hard-matter' atomic solid counterparts, owing to the generic symmetry-based principles that underlie both 2,3. 'Mesoatomic' building blocks of soft-matter crystals consist of groups of molecules, whose sub-unit-cell configurations couple strongly to supra-unit-scale symmetry. As yet, high-fidelity experimental techniques for characterizing the detailed local structure of soft matter and, in particular, for quantifying the effects of multiscale reconfigurability are quite limited. Here, by applying slice-and-view microscopy to reconstruct the micrometre-scale domain morphology of a solution-cast block copolymer double gyroid over large specimen volumes, we unambiguously characterize its supra-unit and sub-unit cell morphology. Our multiscale analysis reveals a qualitative and underappreciated distinction between this double-gyroid soft crystal and hard crystals in terms of their structural relaxations in response to forces-namely a non-affine mode of sub-unit-cell symmetry breaking that is coherently maintained over large multicell dimensions. Subject to inevitable stresses during crystal growth, the relatively soft strut lengths and diameters of the double-gyroid network can easily accommodate deformation, while the angular geometry is stiff, maintaining local correlations even under strong symmetry-breaking distortions. These features contrast sharply with the rigid lengths and bendable angles of hard crystals.

### Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear Truss metamaterials by generative modeling [^1171G5HT]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Generative modeling framework

The proposed design space for truss lattices is discrete and discontinuous. For example, any two truss lattices may have different numbers of nodes or nodes with different numbers of degrees of freedom (such as edge vs. face nodes). However, representing the truss lattices by a graph structure, as described above, enables the use of node features and adjacency matrix as inputs for a ML model to learn a low-dimensional, continuous, and smooth representation for the high-dimensional, discrete, and intractable graph representation.

We use a VAE containing two neural networks — an encoder and a decoder (see Fig. 2 a for a schematic of the framework). Let G = (A, x) denote the graph representation of a truss lattice, defined by its adjacency matrix and node features. The encoder(with the set of trainable parameters ϕ) maps an input graph G into two d -dimensional vectorsand, which, respectively, prescribe the mean and covariance of a diagonal multivariate Gaussian distributionHere, denotes a low-dimensional vector encoding of the input graph G, also known as latent representation. While the formulation is presented in terms of σ, the neural network predicts. To maintain differentiability (required for backpropagation-based neural network training), z is sampled using the reparameterization trickaswhere ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. The decoder(with set of trainable parameters θ) maps the latent vector z into a graph representationand attempts to accurately reconstruct the original graph, i.e. The autoencoding of the input graphs with such a neural network structure creates an information bottleneckin the latent representation. The information bottleneck only preserves the necessary meaningful information to allow accurate reconstruction of the graphs, with a significant reduction in the dimension and complexity of the original data. Consequently, in the latent space any two graphs/lattices with similar topology and geometry are located close to each other; any two distant graphs/lattices can be continuously transformed between each other by traversing the latent space.

### Face cells encode object parts more than facial configuration of illusory faces [^116wVvtZ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

In our main experiment, we presented 100 pareidolia images and 100 control images to 8 macaque monkeys in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (rsvp)-style paradigm. The pareidolia images were images of objects that evoked the illusion of a face, whereas control images were matched in object identity to the pareidolia images but did not evoke an illusory face experience. We recorded neural activity from central (CIT) and anterior IT (AIT) while these images were presented. To investigate the relationship between pareidolia selectivity of face cells and human behavioral ratings, we presented the monkeys with a new set of 200 pareidolia images that had been given faceness ratings on an 11-point scale (0 "cannot see a face" to 10 "easily see a face") by human subjects in a recent study. To investigate the contribution of the face-like configuration on the pareidolia selectivity of face cells, we presented quadrant-scrambled pareidolia and control images, in which each image was divided into four quadrants and the quadrants shuffled. This ensured that the individual features were preserved but the images did not retain the global configuration and thus did not evoke the perceptual experience of a face. To further investigate the contribution of non-holistic attributes in the pareidolia selectivity, we presented the four quadrants of the original and scrambled configurations in isolation. Finally, we also collected human faceness ratings on an 11-point scale (0 "cannot see a face" to 10 "easily see a face") for quadrant-scrambled images and isolated quadrants to investigate the contribution of the face-like configuration and other non-holistic attributes in human perceptual pareidolia.

### Hierarchical self-assembly of 3D lattices from polydisperse anisometric colloids [^1137kDVe]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Colloids are mainly divided into two types defined by size. Micron-scale colloids are widely used as model systems to study phase transitions, while nanoparticles have physicochemical properties unique to their size. Here we study a promising yet underexplored third type: anisometric colloids, which integrate micrometer and nanometer dimensions into the same particle. We show that our prototypical system of anisometric silver plates with a high polydispersity assemble, unexpectedly, into an ordered, three-dimensional lattice. Real-time imaging and interaction modeling elucidate the crucial role of anisometry, which directs hierarchical assembly into secondary building blocks — columns — which are sufficiently monodisperse for further ordering. Ionic strength and plate tip morphology control the shape of the columns, and therefore the final lattice structures (hexagonal versus honeycomb). Our joint experiment–modeling study demonstrates potentials of encoding unconventional assembly in anisometric colloids, which can likely introduce properties and phase behaviors inaccessible to micron- or nanometer-scale colloids.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^114gVzEr]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

With the advancement of conventional manufacturing in both additiveand subtractiveways, the fabrication of complex 3D structures is being realized on nano –, micro –, meso –, and large scales –. Researchers are even pushing the limit of complex 3D structural design to motion structures that can change their shapes from one state to another, tuning their physical properties in adapted and active ways to varying physical environments.

Many groups have employed origami and kirigami techniques, the ancient folding and cutting arts, given the potential of future intelligent reconfigurable structures. Starting from 2D flexible structures using a Miura-ori sheet, Waterbomb base, or Ron-Resch pattern, researchers have recently explored the design of 3D architected structures using modular origami. Stacking multiple origami sheets, and assembling foldable modules,– are the currently available methods to construct 3D architected structures. Stacked Miura-oriand Tachi–Miura polyhedronare deployable with flat-foldability, with a single origami sheet serving as the building block. Assembled structures with folding modules using prismatic polyhedrons, tubular bellows, and kirigamihave demonstrated the potential of isotropic design using spatial symmetry while displaying single and multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs).

All these methods require the construction of a building block (unit cell) with crease patterns and spatial periodicity (tessellation). This bottom-up design approach is convenient for controlling the kinematic and kinetic properties of the overall 3D architected structures with only a unit-cell design. However, this bottom-up design approach has a critical limitation when constructing practical engineering and artistic structures, the shapes of which are mostly 3D curvilinear (e.g. automotive and aerospace structures with various curvatures). Such structures require that the size and shape of the building block no longer be homogeneous in the design domain. Most rectangular or cubic engineering structures have curved edges for minimum stress concentration and safety. Because of the break in spatial periodicity at the boundary of curvilinear geometries, the kinematic and kinetic properties of the unit cell tend to differ from those of the tessellated structure, limiting the structural implementation of the architected origami materials.

### Hierarchical design of pseudosymmetric protein nanocages [^115mem9D]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions 1,2. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry 3. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.
