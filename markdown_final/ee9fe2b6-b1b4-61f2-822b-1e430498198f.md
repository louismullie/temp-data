## Question

Strep virdians bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about viridans streptococcal bacteremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the microbiology and epidemiology. Then, I should verify risk factors and pathophysiology. Next, I will examine clinical syndromes and severity, followed by diagnostic evaluation including endocarditis risk. After that, I need to review antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance patterns. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, special populations, and prevention, and close with a concise clinical takeaway and key citations.

> Let me first confirm the microbiology and epidemiology. Viridans group streptococci are alpha-hemolytic, catalase-negative Gram-positive cocci that are normal oral and upper respiratory commensals; they include species such as S. mitis, S. sanguinis, S. oralis, S. salivarius, and the Anginosus group, among others, and they are a frequent cause of community-acquired bacteremia in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts [^1617db93] [^46930805] [^3bd073c0].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical significance across settings. In immunocompetent adults, viridans streptococcal bacteremia accounts for a meaningful minority of community-acquired bacteremias and carries a nontrivial risk of infective endocarditis, with reported IE rates around 11.6% in one series and substantial 30-day mortality despite low direct infection-attributable deaths, underscoring the need to evaluate for endocarditis in appropriate patients [^46930805]. In oncology and transplant populations, VGS are a leading cause of bacteremia during neutropenia and are associated with severe sepsis, including VGS shock syndrome, particularly with S. mitis, which is overrepresented and linked to higher severity scores and complications [^5fe84d3d] [^5306f72f] [^ff74348d].

> I need to check the key risk factors. In immunocompetent hosts, poor oral hygiene and dental disease increase the likelihood of transient bacteremia and thus IE risk, while in immunocompromised hosts, severe neutropenia, mucositis, high-dose cytarabine, and fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX prophylaxis are major drivers of VGS bacteremia; central venous catheters can also be sources in some cases, though mucosal barrier injury is often contributory [^d9445147] [^5fe84d3d] [^e92a07e5] [^75a7a051].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathophysiology. Transient bacteremia from oral or gastrointestinal mucosal disruption allows VGS entry into the bloodstream; in the setting of endocarditis, adherence to nonbacterial thrombotic endocardium via adhesins such as FimA and biofilm formation within vegetations drive persistence and therapeutic challenges, while in neutropenic hosts, impaired clearance and mucosal injury amplify invasion and severity, including ARDS and shock [^a794da4b] [^5fe84d3d] [^5306f72f].

> Next, I should review the clinical syndromes and severity. VGS bacteremia spans from low-grade fevers and malaise to fulminant sepsis with shock, ARDS, and multiple organ dysfunction; S. mitis is disproportionately associated with severe disease and VGS shock syndrome in cancer patients, and complications can include endocarditis, myositis, and embolic phenomena, with mortality risk rising in the setting of sepsis and delayed appropriate therapy [^5306f72f] [^ff74348d] [^ca65591c] [^58b92eee].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, especially for endocarditis. I should confirm that all patients with VGS bacteremia warrant evaluation for IE risk using validated tools and echocardiography when indicated; the HANDOC score and the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria improve sensitivity for IE in non–beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, and echocardiography is recommended for patients with high-risk features or persistent bacteremia, with transesophageal echocardiography offering higher sensitivity than transthoracic studies [^b91786ff] [^82442090] [^69134c94].

> Let me think about antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance, because this dictates therapy. Penicillin resistance among VGS is substantial and rising, with reports ranging from roughly 20% to over 30% in some series, and S. mitis consistently shows higher resistance rates; macrolide and clindamycin resistance are also common, whereas vancomycin and linezolid remain broadly active, though clinical trial data for linezolid in VGS are limited and susceptibility should be verified case-by-case [^46930805] [^147f87ae] [^f7d32d5d] [^ebbad74f].

> I should double-check first-line therapy for native valve IE due to penicillin-susceptible VGS. High-dose penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4 weeks is standard, with a 2-week gentamicin add-on reasonable in select uncomplicated cases; for relatively penicillin-resistant strains, extend therapy to 6 weeks and add gentamicin for the first 2 weeks, and for fully resistant strains, use combination therapy guided by susceptibilities, often penicillin or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin, or vancomycin if beta-lactams are not tolerated [^05ba6735] [^82442090] [^36bf8ae6] [^6dae18bc].

> But wait, what if the patient has a prosthetic valve or is beta-lactam allergic. For prosthetic valve IE, extend therapy to 6 weeks and consider adding gentamicin for the first 2 weeks in susceptible cases; for beta-lactam allergy, vancomycin is a reasonable alternative for 4 to 6 weeks depending on native versus prosthetic valve disease, with attention to trough monitoring and nephrotoxicity risk [^5edda63a] [^e729248f] [^d346773d].

> Next, I should review special populations. In febrile neutropenia, empiric coverage should account for VGS risk, particularly with mucositis; risk-stratified addition of vancomycin can be effective, and rapid organism identification systems can shorten time to appropriate therapy; in pediatrics, VGS are a notable cause of bacteremia in oncology and HSCT, with S. mitis predominance and meaningful morbidity, warranting early recognition and targeted therapy [^e836db84] [^c7124156] [^bae6d036] [^be2e39e1].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention strategies. Maintaining excellent oral hygiene and access to dental care reduces VGS bacteremia risk from routine activities more effectively than procedure-only prophylaxis; current AHA guidance restricts antibiotic prophylaxis to patients at highest risk for adverse IE outcomes, emphasizing oral health maintenance rather than blanket prophylaxis for dental procedures [^4bb0cc5a] [^d9445147] [^be38cf70].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical message. Viridans streptococcal bacteremia is common and potentially severe, especially in immunocompromised hosts; always assess for endocarditis using contemporary criteria and echocardiography when risk is present, obtain timely susceptibilities given meaningful penicillin resistance, tailor therapy to MIC and valve status, and prioritize early appropriate antimicrobials and source control to reduce morbidity and mortality [^b91786ff] [^82442090] [^58b92eee] [^3bd073c0].

---

Viridans streptococcal bacteremia is most often **transient and low-grade** [^be38cf70], but it carries a **significant risk of infective endocarditis** [^b91786ff], especially in patients with valvular disease or prosthetic material [^5fa5493f]. Risk is higher with **S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and S. gordonii** [^b91786ff], and with multiple positive blood cultures or persistent bacteremia [^82bed817]. Evaluation should include at least two sets of blood cultures, a focused history for endocarditis risk, and echocardiography when risk is present [^notfound]; transesophageal echocardiography is preferred if suspicion is high or transthoracic views are limited [^notfound]. Empiric therapy is **penicillin G or ceftriaxone** [^notfound], adjusted to susceptibilities; add gentamicin for 2 weeks if relatively penicillin-resistant (MIC 0.12–0.5 µg/mL) [^9e64d040], and use vancomycin if beta-lactam allergy or high resistance [^60361f5c]. Mortality is low overall but higher in immunocompromised or endocarditis patients, so early recognition and targeted therapy are essential [^46930805] [^5fe84d3d].

## Microbiology and epidemiology

- **Microbiology**: Viridans streptococci are alpha-hemolytic, catalase-negative Gram-positive cocci; common species include S. mitis, S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. salivarius, and the Anginosus group [^1617db93].

- **Epidemiology**: VGS are normal oral, upper respiratory, GI, and urogenital commensals; bacteremia arises from mucosal disruption (dental procedures, mucositis, GI/GU procedures) or via catheters [^a794da4b] [^e92a07e5].

- **Incidence**: VGS bacteremia is common in immunocompromised patients, particularly with neutropenia or mucositis, and in those with indwelling devices [^5fe84d3d] [^e92a07e5].

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

- **Clinical significance**: VGS bacteremia ranges from transient, low-grade events to severe infections, including infective endocarditis (IE) [^b91786ff], sepsis, and shock, especially in high-risk hosts [^5306f72f].

- **Risk factors for severe disease**: Immunocompromise (neutropenia, malignancy, transplant), valvular heart disease, prosthetic material, dental disease, and mucositis increase risk [^5fe84d3d] [^75a7a051].

- **Endocarditis risk**: Certain species (S. mitis, S. sanguinis, S. gordonii) and multiple positive cultures or persistent bacteremia heighten IE risk [^b91786ff] [^12034740].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical presentations include **fever, chills, and malaise** [^notfound]; IE features such as new murmur, embolic phenomena, and Osler nodes; and severe sepsis or shock, particularly in neutropenic patients [^5306f72f]. Complications include **endocarditis** [^b91786ff], metastatic infections (brain, bone, joints), and sepsis-related organ dysfunction [^5306f72f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain at least two sets from different venipuncture sites before antibiotics; VGS are often slow-growing, so prolonged incubation may be needed [^a7be0a5c].

- **Echocardiography**: Transthoracic (TTE) is reasonable for all; transesophageal (TEE) is preferred if TTE is nondiagnostic or suspicion for IE is high [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Document risk factors, symptoms, and signs of IE; use validated tools (e.g. HANDOC) to stratify IE risk [^b91786ff].

---

## Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance

Penicillin resistance is **increasing**, with 20–30% of isolates showing intermediate or full resistance, particularly S. mitis [^46930805] [^147f87ae]. Ceftriaxone resistance is also rising, and macrolide and clindamycin resistance are common, limiting options [^f7d32d5d]. Vancomycin remains active against most VGS, though rare resistance is reported [^147f87ae].

---

## Management and treatment

Empiric therapy should start with **penicillin G or ceftriaxone** [^notfound], adding gentamicin for 2 weeks if relatively penicillin-resistant (MIC 0.12–0.5 µg/mL) [^9e64d040]. Definitive therapy should be tailored to **susceptibilities**, extending treatment to 4–6 weeks for IE or persistent bacteremia [^05ba6735] [^e82c3ced]. For beta-lactam allergy or high resistance, use **vancomycin** [^60361f5c] or linezolid [^ebbad74f].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Mortality is **generally low** in immunocompetent patients (≈7–10%) [^46930805] but higher in immunocompromised or IE patients [^notfound]. Recurrence is uncommon with appropriate therapy and source control, though persistent dental or device sources increase risk [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **oral hygiene** — regular dental care and pre-procedural chlorhexidine rinses reduce bacteremia risk [^ad17f275] — and on **antibiotic prophylaxis**, which is reserved for high-risk cardiac patients undergoing procedures involving oral, respiratory, or infected tissue, per AHA/ESC guidance [^4bb0cc5a].

---

Viridans streptococcal bacteremia is common and often indolent, but it carries a **meaningful risk of endocarditis** and severe disease in high-risk patients. Early recognition, appropriate diagnostics (including echocardiography) [^b91786ff], and targeted therapy based on susceptibilities are essential to optimize outcomes [^3bd073c0].

### Hospital-based study of viridans streptococcal bacteraemia in children and adults [^46930805]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the proportion and clinical significance of bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci (VS) in immunocompetent adults and children.

Methods

Over a 25-month period, we collected data on all patients with VS bacteraemia at a UK district general hospital.

Results

VS caused 50/723 (6.9%) adult and 13/106 (12.3%) paediatric community-acquired bacteraemias. Of the 43 adult and 12 paediatric patient notes reviewed, 26 (47.3%) cultures were of 'definite' or 'probable' clinical significance. No patients were neutropenic and overall penicillin resistance was 11/55 (20.0%). Amongst adults, there were five (11.6%) confirmed or suspected cases of infective endocarditis compared to none in the paediatric cohort. Similar proportions of adults (16.3%) and children (16.7%) had lower respiratory tract infections. Among non-significant cultures, a history of seizures was observed in one (1.3%) adult and four (33.3%) children (p = 0.008). Thirty-day mortality was 7.3%. No children and four adults died, one directly attributable to infection. Median adult inpatient stay was 11 days compared to 2 days in the paediatric population (p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Despite cases of infective endocarditis and an incidence of penicillin resistance of 20%, mortality directly attributable to VS infection in immunocompetent adults and children was rare.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^f510ea27]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Viridans group streptococci (VGS), a genetically heterogeneous group of bacteria, are the predominant bacteria in the human oropharynx. VGS cause a wide range of infections in humans, including bacteremia in patients with neutropenia, infective endocarditis, and orbital cellulitis. However, despite the substantial clinical effect of VGS, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these bacteria are minimally understood.

A major impediment to the study of VGS has been the inability to consistently and accurately assign VGS strains to specific species, which has resulted in numerous changes in species designation and classification schemes over time. From a clinical microbiology laboratory standpoint, automated systems have considerable limitations in VGS species identification. The problematic nature of VGS species assignment also extends to16S rRNA sequencing, the most widely used genetic tool for species identification in clinical and research settings.

Outcomes for patients with VGS bacteremia are highly variable: some patients have minimal symptoms, and others have a severe infection characterized by hypotension and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severe infections have been termed VGS shock syndrome. Numerous studies have examined the species distribution of VGS that cause bacteremia (,–). However, these studies have found inconsistent results between a particular VGS species and disease occurrence or clinical severity of infection. Moreover, the recently recognized limitations of previously used techniques of VGS species identification and the low number of clinical cases analyzed preclude definitive conclusions regarding the relationship between VGS species type and clinical disease. Thus, we sought to combine the species identification of a large number of VGS bloodstream isolates, which we typed by using a recently developed multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) technique, with patient-specific clinical data to determine relationships between VGS species and clinical endpoints.

### Viridans streptococci bacteremia in children with malignancy: relevance of species identification and penicillin susceptibility [^22bf2808]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Our aim was to determine the significance of species identification and penicillin susceptibility of viridans streptococci in children with malignancies. Streptococcus mitis accounted for 58% of invasive viridans streptococcal infections of which 51% were penicillin-nonsusceptible. There was no significant association between species or penicillin susceptibility pattern and clinical presentation or outcome.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^2d54ac5a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Cause Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an infection of the oropharynx caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The incubation period of group A strep pharyngitis is approximately 2 to 5 days. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens. Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups.

Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Testing and diagnosis To confirm group A strep pharyngitis, healthcare providers can use either
- A rapid antigen detection test
- Throat culture RADTs have high specificity for group A strep bacteria but varying sensitivities when compared to throat culture. Throat culture is the gold standard diagnostic test. Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics.

Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications. Antibiotic resistance There's never been a report of a clinical isolate of group A strep bacteria that's resistant to penicillin or cephalosporins. However, resistance to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin is well known and varies geographically and temporally.

### Identification and characterization of catheter-related bloodstream infections due to viridans group streptococci in patients with cancer [^e92a07e5]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Viridans group streptococci (VGS), a leading cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in cancer patients, are thought to arise from the gastrointestinal tract. We sought to determine whether central venous catheters may serve as the source of VGS BSI, and to compare the ability of the newly proposed mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed BSI definition to assign a VGS BSI source compared with the catheter-related BSI definition.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^3c341967]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

VGS Species and Clinical Syndromes

Because of the diverse genetic nature of the various VGS species, we next tested the hypothesis that distinct VGS species cause different clinical syndromes. Given the number of strains for each species, we analyzed the Mitis group species (i.e. S. mitis and S. oralis) individually and analyzed species comprising the Sanguinis, Anginosus, and Salivarius groups by group (Table 2). Compared with strains of other VGS species, S. mitis strains were significantly more likely to cause primary bacteremia (p < 0.01) and less likely to cause polymicrobial bacteremia (p = 0.01) and clinically minor bacteremia (p < 0.01). S. oralis strains were more likely to cause polymicrobial infection (p = 0.02), Sanguinis group strains were more likely to cause clinically minor bacteremia (p < 0.01), and Anginosus group strains were significantly associated with bacteremia with a gastrointestinal focus (p < 0.01). When we only considered patients with neutropenia or cases of monomicrobial bacteremia, we observed the same statistically significant species–clinical disease relationships (data not shown).

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^040b671f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In a normal artery, the entry of bacteria is prevented by the innate immune system, including the opsonization of the bacteria by complements and phagocytosis by macrophages. The development of hypoxia inside a growing atheroma signals the formation of new neovascularization channels from the luminal side and adventitia, opening up a direct gateway for bacteria to enter the atheroma during transient bacteremia. In concordance with this, in our study, we often found neovascular vessels not far from the bacterial biofilm.

Bacteremia is common in the course of acute infections, such as pneumonia, a urinary infection, skin infections, or enteric infections. Bacteremia is also a known consequence of dental procedures, such as root canal treatment, tooth extraction, the treatment of periodontitis, and the removal of dental plaque. Previously, we have found that sudden cardiac death victims had suffered from poor dental health. Among clinical patients with MI, we have found a significant association between the presence of periapical abscesses and oral viridans streptococci DNA–positive thrombi aspirates.

### Viridans Streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem [^bae6d036]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. They retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between October 1995 and January 1999. Viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The majority of the isolates were Streptococcus mitis (55%). Others were S. sanguis (25%), S. oralis (12.5%), S. salivarius (5%), and S. acidominimus (2.5%). Twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. Thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest X-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. Initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. This study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. Further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

### Infections caused by viridans streptococci in patients with neutropenia [^5fe84d3d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The frequency of isolation of viridans streptococci from the blood of neutropenic patients with cancer has significantly increased over the course of the last 10–15 years. Risk factors in this patient population include severe neutropenia, oral mucositis, administration of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone. In some patients with cancer and neutropenia who develop viridans streptococcal bacteremia, a toxic shock-like syndrome has been described; Streptococcus mitis has been the causative species in most cases. Because resistance of viridans streptococci to a variety of antimicrobial agents is increasingly recognized, penicillin susceptibility cannot be assumed, and empirical vancomycin therapy should be used to treat neutropenic patients with cancer who have shock or are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given the seriousness of septicemia caused by viridans streptococci and the potential for selection of other resistant microorganisms, the routine practice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for neutropenic patients with cancer should be reconsidered.

### Streptococcal endocarditis: a meta-analysis of species dependant risk [^12034740]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcal bacteraemia is common and forms a large proportion of work for clinical infection specialists and microbiology labs. The major challenge–particularly with the 'oral' streptococci, is identifying the small proportion of patients who have deep infection, particularly infective endocarditis (IE). Investigation for IE often requires transthoracic and/or transoesophageal echocardiography amongst other investigations, therefore determining the risk of IE in any patient with streptococcal bacteraemia is a significant task. Currently, the updated 2023 ISCVID Duke criteria for endocarditis specifies that all streptococci (excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) be considered typical causative pathogens of IE.

Why some species of streptococci seem to cause endocarditis more than others given their genetic homology is an active area of research but likely relates to specific abilities to adhere to and survive on valvular tissue. Virulence factors that associate oral or viridans group streptococci with systemic disease point towards extracellular matrix proteins that bind to glucansand interactions with the host immune response to generate a favourable microenvironment. These phenomena are not known to be linked to predominant genotypes or lineages amongst those diagnosed with streptococcal IE. A seminal paper by Chamat-Hedemand et al. suggested that not all streptococci are equal with respect to the risk of IE. Their national data registry cross-linked endocarditis diagnosis, blood culture data, and demographic data to reveal the proportion of endocarditis per streptococcal species at an unprecedented resolution.

Nonetheless, it is possible that the absolute risks of IE in one setting do not transfer into another due to differing patient populations, different degrees of diagnostic stewardship and culture processing approaches to both species identification, or methods of IE diagnosis. Consequently, we aim to better quantify the risk of IE in all patients with streptococcal bacteraemia by pairing a scoping review of the literature with a meta-analysis across the various methodologies. We also include local data from our four hospital network.

### Clinical significance and characterization of Streptococcus tigurinus isolates in an adult population [^88d3506b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Streptococcus tigurinus is a newly described member of the Streptococcus mitis group. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing viridans group streptococci (VGS) by phenotype, analysis of 16S rRNA sequences is necessary for the accurate identification of most species. Through a laboratory policy of analyzing all clinically significant isolates from the VGS group by16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified 14 S. tigurinus isolates from 11 patients. The Vitek 2 system most commonly gave an excellent rating to an incorrect identification (e.g. Streptococcus mitis), as did matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (e.g. Streptococcus oralis). S. tigurinus strains were recovered from numerous body sites, including the blood, peritoneal fluid, bone, synovial fluid, a perianal abscess, and an arm wound. Retrospective chart review indicated that most isolates were clinically significant, with bacteremia (n = 5), soft tissue infections (n = 3) osteomyelitis (n = 2), infected joint prosthesis (n = 2), and peritonitis (n = 2) being the most common, thus expanding the spectrum of disease associated with S. tigurinus.

### Endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci: 2 cases and controversies in therapy [^120f0b42]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci have been isolated from samples from the mouth, blood, and wounds in increasing numbers, viridans streptococci isolated from patients with endocarditis have remained sensitive to penicillin for the past 5 decades. We report the cases of 2 patients with penicillin-resistant viridans streptococcal endocarditis, review 6 other cases from the literature, and summarize 2 studies that used an animal model of penicillin-resistant viridans streptococcal endocarditis.

### Viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases [^147f87ae]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. The bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. At least nine Streptococcus spp. were found, including S. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed Streptococcus spp. (11 strains); S. parasanguis (five strains); S. anginosus (three strains); S. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, and S. vestibularis. There were no S. oralis strains. Among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. Resistance to penicillin (MIC, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among S. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-S. mitis strains (0/25) (P = 0.004). Significantly more S. mitis strains than non-S. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to ≥ 3 classes of antibiotics. Isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (P = 0.002). Quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. The young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by S. mitis. Septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by S. mitis (P = 0.007). These results suggest that S. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

3. Neonates With CoNS Isolated From Blood Cultures Compared With Neonates With Clinically Significant Isolates in Blood Cultures

Isolation of CoNS in neonates was associated with lower mortality compared to those with a clinically significant blood culture isolates [OR death during admission = 0.3 (0.3–0.4), P < 0.001] and decreased duration of admission in survivors [OR for admission of 7 days or more = 0.3 (0.3–0.4), P < 0.001]. The odds of clinical signs of pSBI were much reduced for all signs except convulsions, for which no difference in association was found and it was not included in the final multivariable model (Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

In neonates with clinically significant bacteremia, compared with all other neonatal admissions, the odds of death were high [OR = 3.1 (2.6–3.7), P < 0.001], and there was a prolonged duration of admission [OR for admission 7 days or more in survivors = 1.7 (1.4–2.0), P < 0.001]. The odds of clinical signs of pSBI were increased for all clinical signs except convulsions, for which no difference in association was found and it was not included in the final multivariable model (Table S4, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

5. Neonates With Clinically Nonsignificant or Uncertain Significance Isolates (Excluding CoNS) Compared with all Other Admissions

In neonates with other presumed clinically nonsignificant pathogens or isolates of unknown significance from blood culture in this context (Streptococcus viridans, Coryneforms, Micrococcos spp. and Bacillus spp.), there was no association with death compared with all other admissions [OR = 1.2 (1.0–1.5), P = 0.1) nor increased duration of admission [OR = 1.1 (0.9–1.3), P = 0.5] nor association with clinical signs of pSBI (Table S5, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

### Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association rheumatic fever, endocarditis and Kawasaki disease committee, council on cardiovascular disease in the young, and the council on clinical cardiology, council on cardiovascular surgery and anesthesia, and the quality of care and outcomes research interdisciplinary working group [^d9445147]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — historical rationale and current emphasis — Viridans group streptococci are noted to cause at least 50 per cent of community-acquired native valve IE not associated with intravenous drug use, and early work reported bacteremia related to oral hygiene and dental extraction. Okell and Elliott in 1935 reported that 11 percent of patients with poor oral hygiene had positive blood cultures with viridans group streptococci, and that 61 percent of patients had viridans group streptococcal bacteremia with dental extraction. As a result of these early and subsequent studies, during the past 50 years the AHA guidelines recommended antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients with underlying cardiac conditions who underwent bacteremia-producing procedures, yet most of these factors remain valid, but collectively they do not compensate for the lack of published data that demonstrate a benefit from prophylaxis. The large majority of published studies have focused on dental procedures as a cause of IE and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent IE in patients at risk, and few data exist on the risk of or prevention of IE associated with a GI or GU tract procedure; accordingly, the Committee undertook a critical analysis of published data in the context of the historical rationale for recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for IE before a dental procedure. Available evidence supports an emphasis on maintaining good oral hygiene and eradicating dental disease to decrease the frequency of bacteremia from routine daily activities.

Background

The Streptococcus genus comprises diverse Gram-positive cocci bacteria with notable medical importance. These bacteria are capable of inducing a spectrum of diseases, ranging from subacute to acute or chronic. Some notable human ailments attributed to Streptococci include rheumatic heart disease, scarlet fever, pneumococcal pneumonia, and glomerulonephritis. Streptococci are classified based on the hemolytic pattern exhibited on blood agar plates, which categorizes them into alpha-hemolytic, beta-hemolytic, and gamma-hemolytic groups. Another classification criterion is based on Lancefield grouping, which involves the identification of specific polysaccharide antigens in the bacterial cell wall.

Among the most clinically important Streptococci spp. S. pyogenes is commonly referred to as Group A streptococci (GAS). S. pyogenes can be classified into over 100 M-serotypes or emm types, determined by their M proteins present on the cell surface. These proteins contribute to their virulence by impeding phagocytosis. S. pyogenes represents a significant source of infections among children in both outpatient and hospital environments. They are known to cause various conditions such as pharyngitis, impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas, and cellulitis, along with severe invasive diseases like necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Another medically important β-hemolytic streptococci, S. agalactiae (group B) causes a wide range of invasive diseases among both infants and adults. In adults, bacteremia is one of the most common syndromes resulting from invasive S. agalactiae that can lead to seeding of the cardiac valves and endocarditis.

S. pneumoniae is an extracellular, opportunistic α-hemolytic streptococcal spp. that colonizes the upper respiratory tract mucosal surfaces. S. pneumoniae is present in the nasopharynx, as between 27 and 65% of children and fewer than 10% of adults are S. pneumoniae carriers. S. pneumoniae dissemination to the bloodstream and lower respiratory tract could lead to invasive inflammatory diseases including otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Viridans streptococci represent another group of clinically significant Streptococci spp. Among the prominent members of the viridans streptococci, which are typically commensal, S. sanguis and S. mutans cause dental caries, S. mitis is associated with meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and periodontal disease, and S. milleri is associated with purulent infections in both children and adults.

### Evaluation of the HANDOC score and the 2023 international society of cardiovascular infectious diseases and European Society of Cardiology Duke clinical criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis among patients with streptococcal bacteremia [^82442090]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we expanded the evaluation of the HANDOC score to include all streptococci, incorporating S pneumoniae and β-hemolytic streptococci (S pyogenes, S agalactiae, and S dysgalactiae) and assigning them −1 point in the Aetiology (A) variable. When applied to the entire cohort, HANDOC performed similarly to its application solely in non-β-hemolytic streptococci, suggesting that the score's scope could be broadened to encompass all streptococci.

Both the ISCVID and the ESC introduced distinct versions of the Duke criteria in 2023, reflecting significant advancements in microbiology and imaging techniques over the past decade. The 2023 Duke-ISCVID made substantial modifications to the microbiological criteria, including the incorporation as typical IE pathogens of S agalactiae and S dysgalactiae alongside S bovis group and viridans streptococci (with the exception of S pneumoniae). In our study, while both 2023 versions of the Duke criteria demonstrated improved sensitivity among episodes of streptococcal bacteremia compared to the 2015 Duke-ESC, the sensitivity of the 2023 Duke-ISCVID (81%) surpassed that of the 2023 Duke-ESC (73%). Although the two 2023 versions differed in other aspects, such as the major imaging criterion (new severe valvular insufficiency in 2023 Duke-ISCVID; leaflet thickening in 2023 Duke-ESC), minor predisposition criterion (moderate/severe valve regurgitation/stenosis in 2023 Duke-ISCVID; heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device in 2023 Duke-ESC), and minor vascular criterion (cerebral and splenic abscess in 2023 Duke-ISCVID; metastatic osteoarticular complication in 2023 Duke-ESC), the changes in the microbiological criterion drove the superior performance of the 2023 Duke-ISCVID. In a previous study on S aureus bacteremia evaluating different versions of the Duke criteria, both 2023 versions resulted in comparable sensitivity; the fact that for streptococci, the 2023 Duke-ISCVID's sensitivity was higher than that of the 2023 Duke-ESC underscores the significance of the inclusion by the former of S agalactiae and S dysgalactiae as typical IE microorganisms. In 2023 Duke-ISCVID, 92% of IE episodes fulfilled the major microbiological criterion, compared to 77% with the 2023 Duke-ESC. However, this enhancement comes at the cost of specificity, as 46% of the episodes without IE were classified as possible IE by the 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria compared to the other 2 versions (31% and 33%).

INTRODUCTION

Microbes that are in constant interaction with the host engage in varied interactions spanning symbiosis, and the outcomes range from damage, benefit, or indifference. The delicate interaction between the body's resident microbiota and the immune system is vital for maintaining homeostatic balance. Disruption in this immune homeostasis due to dysbiosis can be elicited by various lifestyle factors like tobacco consumption, chronic alcohol exposure, inadequate oral hygiene, dietary changes, or antibiotic usage. While host damage is often a requirement for the induction of a pathogen-specific immune response, the extent and nature of the damage incurred during the early stages and/or subsequent phases between host and microbial interactions determine the outcome of the host-microbe relationship. The occurrence of damage isn't solely attributed to the presence and proliferation of pathogens; rather, it can also stem from the deficiency of commensal bacteria that typically inhibit the colonization of these pathogens.

Oral commensal streptococci or viridans group streptococci (VGS) are Gram-positive cocci that are catalase-negative facultative anaerobes. While most exhibit alpha hemolysis, variations exist, with some demonstrating beta hemolysis or displaying no hemolytic activity when cultured on blood agar. Streptococci are the first organisms to colonize oral surfaces, and most of them are typically deemed non-pathogenic due to their lack of virulence factors, like exotoxin production, and due to their non-invasive potential found in other pathogenic organisms. Being early colonizers of the oral cavity, Streptococcus species like Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius play a significant role in maintaining oral homeostasis by establishing a stable multispecies dental biofilm. Despite being traditionally considered non-pathogenic, they can also become opportunistic pathogens, evidenced by their involvement in a diverse range of clinical diseases, including infective endocarditis, bacteremia, and infections related to malignancy.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4bb0cc5a]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only 4 categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcome. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

Methods and Results

A writing group was formed consisting of experts in prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

Conclusions

On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis only for categories of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome while emphasizing the critical role of good oral health and regular access to dental care for all. Randomized controlled studies to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective against VGS IE are needed to further refine recommendations.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prevention — oral flora and bacteremia magnitude/duration after dental procedures: The human mouth contains more than 700 species, with approximately 30 percent of gingival crevice flora being streptococci and more than 100 oral species recovered from blood cultures after dental procedures, predominantly viridans group streptococci; anaerobes rarely cause IE, with fewer than 120 cases reported. The magnitude of bacteremia from dental procedures is relatively low (< 10⁴ CFUs of bacteria per milliliter), similar to routine daily activities and less than that used to cause experimental IE in animals (10⁶–10⁸ CFUs of bacteria/mL), and the vast majority of patients with IE have not had a dental procedure within two weeks before symptom onset. After tooth extraction, sequential blood cultures were positive for up to 10 minutes and dropped sharply after 10 to 30 minutes, with only a small percentage positive from 30 to 60 minutes, and no published studies support that longer bacteremia increases risk; overall, there may not be a clinically significant difference between dental procedures and routine activities. Accordingly, it is stated that it is inconsistent to recommend prophylaxis of IE for dental procedures but not for these same patients during routine daily activities, and that prophylaxis for routine daily activities would be impractical and unwarranted.

### Infectious endocarditis: diagnosis and treatment [^7c203bb3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious endocarditis results from bacterial or fungal infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk factors include the presence of a prosthetic heart valve, structural or congenital heart disease, intravenous drug use, and a recent history of invasive procedures. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with unexplained fevers, night sweats, or signs of systemic illness. Diagnosis is made using the Duke criteria, which include clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings. Antibiotic treatment of infectious endocarditis depends on whether the involved valve is native or prosthetic, as well as the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. Common blood culture isolates include Staphylococcus aureus, viridans Streptococcus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Valvular structural and functional integrity may be adversely affected in infectious endocarditis, and surgical consultation is warranted in patients with aggressive or persistent infections, emboli, and valvular compromise or rupture. After completion of antibiotic therapy, patients should be educated about the importance of daily dental hygiene, regular visits to the dentist, and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis before certain procedures.

### Contemporary experience of abiotrophia, granulicatella and gemella bacteremia [^13482178]. The Journal of Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella are gastrointestinal microbiota, gram-positive cocci that behave like viridans group streptococci. Despite the low incidence of bacteremia from these organisms, they can lead to infective endocarditis (IE) and other clinical syndromes. Due to scant data, we aim to describe detailed clinical features, management, and outcomes of patients with bacteremia from these organisms.

Methods

We reviewed all adult patients who developed Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, or Gemella bacteremia from 2011 to 2020, at Mayo Clinic.

Results

We identified 238 patients with positive blood culture for these organisms. Of those, 161 (67.6%) patients were deemed to have bacteremia of clinical significance; 62 (38.5%) were neutropenic, - none of whom were diagnosed with IE. The primary source of bacteremia for the neutropenic group was the gastrointestinal tract. Among 161 patients, echocardiography was obtained in 88 (54.7%) patients, especially those with unknown sources of bacteremia. A total of 19 cases had IE: 5 (26.3%) Abiotrophia, 11 (57.9%) Granulicatella, and 3 (15.8%) Gemella. Based on known IE scoring systems, the negative predictive value at established cutoffs for these scores, performed with our cohort were 95.9%, 100% and 97.9% for NOVA, HANDOC and DENOVA scores, respectively. We also found that the penicillin-non-susceptible rate was high in Abiotrophia (66.7%) and Granulicatella (53.7%).

Conclusions

We described unique characteristics of Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, and Gemella bacteremia at our institution. Clinical significance, clinical syndrome, their proclivity of endocarditis, and susceptibility pattern should be thoroughly reviewed when encountering these organisms.

Cumulative incidences of bacteremia.

We estimated cumulative incidences of bacteremia to compare the most common causes of septic arthritis and bacteremia in the same setting. The overall cumulative incidence was estimated by the total number of new bacteremia cases divided by the total population of Ubon Ratchathani at the beginning of the study period. The total number of new bacteremia cases from January 2012 to December 2014 was estimated from the microbiological laboratory database. Ubon Ratchathani province had an estimated population in 2012 of 1.86 million. Because of the difficulty in establishing their clinical significance, organisms frequently associated with contamination including coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, Corynebacterium spp. Bacillus spp. Diptheroid spp. Micrococcus spp. and Propionibacterium spp. were excluded from the analysis for cumulative incidences of bacteremia. Only the first episode of bacteremia for each patient was included in the analysis.

Statistical analysis.

Categorical variables were compared using χ² test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared using Mann–Whitney U test. Interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as 25th and 75th percentiles. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios. All analyses were performed using STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College station, TX). Because the cumulative incidences of Streptococcus septic arthritis was much higher than S. aureus arthritis in our setting during the study period, we conducted additional analysis by comparing clinical manifestations between septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus spp. and S. aureus.

Ethics statement.

Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital (059/2014).

### Review of streptococcal bloodstream infections at a comprehensive cancer care center, 2000–2011 [^ce268688]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the comparative rates, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of invasive infections due to specific streptococcal types in patients with cancer.

Methods

Review of electronic medical records of patients with non-viridans group streptococcal bloodstream infection (BSI) at the MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2000 to 2011.

Results

550 streptococcal BSI were identified. The largest number of cases were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (251), group B Streptococcus (147), and gamma-hemolytic streptococci (55). Risk factors for developing a severe streptococcal infection included older age, being neutropenic at onset of BSI, and having a respiratory source of infection. Between 2000–2001 and 2010–2011, the rates of S. pneumoniae BSI and penicillin non-susceptibility decreased by 55% and 100%. In contrast the rate of group B streptococcal (GBS) BSI increased 34% over the same time period. GBS accounted for > 80% of the recurrent infections following streptococcal BSI. Patients with breast cancer and those with soft-tissue/bone BSI sources were at increased risk for recurrent GBS infection but had lower rates of severe GBS disease.

Conclusions

From 2000 to 2011, our comprehensive cancer center observed a significant decrease in the rates of S. pneumoniae BSI and a significant increase in the rates of GBS BSI.

### Predictors of mortality of streptococcal bacteremia and the role of infectious diseases consultation: a retrospective cohort study [^58b92eee]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococci, a diverse class of bacteria, are a frequent etiological agent of bacteremia, particularly in the case of community-acquired infections. This class encompasses more than 100 identified species, each categorized into distinct groups based on unique characteristics such as hemolysis type, antigens, and virulence factors. These groups are associated with various types of infections, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, for instance, standing as a prominent cause of community-acquired pneumonia, whereas species within the Mitis and Bovis groups are commonly linked to infective endocarditis.

Streptococcal bacteremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, with several factors being associated with worse outcome, including advanced age, the presence of comorbidities, and the onset of sepsis. Although the importance of promptly initiating appropriate antimicrobial treatment has been previously emphasized, the potential influence of infectious diseases consultation and early source control has remained relatively unexplored within the context of streptococcal bacteremia.

This study aims to identify predictors of mortality in patients with streptococcal bacteremia and address this knowledge gap by focusing on the role of early management strategies, including infectious diseases consultation, the administration of appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and the consideration of source control.

### Viridans streptococcal septicaemia in neutropenic patients: role of proinflammatory cytokines [^5b4bda16]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

The immunostimulatory activity of viridans streptococcal strains isolated from neutropenic patients with severe sepsis (n = 9) or uncomplicated bacteraemia (n = 10) was compared. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals were stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or culture supernatants, and cytokine production assessed. All strains were potent inducers of IL1beta, IL8, and TNFalpha production. Heat-killed bacteria induced consistently higher IL1beta and TNFalpha production than did the cell-free bacterial supernatants (P < 0.01). The strains did not induce any proliferative response, nor any significant TNFbeta or IFNgamma production. No difference in cytokine-inducing capacity could be detected between the cohorts of severe and nonsevere isolates. Comparison of strains causing severe and nonsevere episodes in the same patient (n = 2) revealed a significantly higher induction of IL1beta by the severe episodes associated isolates as compared to the nonsevere (P < 0.04). The study underscores the importance of the host-pathogen interplay in determining the level of inflammation, and hence the severity of disease.

### Viridans Streptococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: clinical characteristics and comparison with concurrent polymicrobial infection [^8986cacf]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Viridans streptococci refer to a group of Streptococcus species that are nutritionally fastidious and mainly alpha-hemolytic on sheep blood agar; these gram-positive cocci are commensals of the oral cavity, upper airway, and the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. The major portals of entry for VS are damaged epithelial barriers of a patient's mucosa.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis is a common complication in patients undergoing regular PD. Clinical courses of PD-related peritonitis vary from mild to severe forms, depending on the causative organisms and clinical conditions. The remarkable consequences of PD-related peritonitis are technique failure leading to PD catheter removal. Although gram-negative organisms have been increasingly detected in PD-related peritonitis in recent years, gram-positive organisms remain major pathogens for this infection entity. Gram-positive cocci constitute around 43–64% of all PD peritonitis episodes, and Streptococcal species account for about 10–15% of them. VS are the majority of Streptococcus species. The incidence of VS peritonitis in several reports from different regions was similar. The entry pathway of VS into the peritoneal cavity includes contamination during the exchange procedure, gastrointestinal bacterial translocation, haematological dissemination with oral and dental procedures and catheter related. Of note, among PD-related peritonitis cases caused by gram-positive cocci, those caused by viridans streptococcus (VS) were reported to have a lower risk of PD catheter removal and chances of relapsing episodes but a higher incidence of clinically refractory course.

Although mono-VS peritonitis in patients undergoing PD in general has a favorable outcome, little is known about the clinical outcomes of VS-included polymicrobial peritonitis (mixed-VS peritonitis) in this patient population. The aim of this retrospective study was to better understand the differences between mono-VS peritonitis and mixed-VS peritonitis in patients undergoing PD.

### Empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients with mucositis: challenge of risk-based therapy [^19768668]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Nowadays Gram-positive cocci, especially oral viridans streptococci (OVS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), are the most common bloodstream isolates in febrile neutropenic patients. Although in general these cocci are quite indolent, Streptococcus mitis is associated with serious complications such as sepsis and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome. Neutropenia is the most significant predisposing factor but the impact of mucositis, i.e. damage to the mucosal barrier of mouth and intestines (mucosal barrier injury, MBI), is very much greatly underestimated. Oral mucositis is a strong predictor of OVS bacteremia and simultaneously CoNS bacteremia is clearly associated with mucositis. Treatment with especially high dose cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and idarubicin, when given to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, predictably results in mucositis. Hence, the occurrence of mucositis should have implications for complementing empirical therapy with specific drugs such as glycopeptides, because risk patients can be selected based upon the chemotherapeutic therapy administered. An algorithm is presented for dealing with patients at high risk of mucositis and bacteremia due to Gram-positive cocci.

### Dental health and viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^be2e39e1]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Viridans streptococci were the most common cause of bacteremia in 61 consecutive myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, occurring in 19 of 31 bacteremic patients (61%) during the period of post-transplant neutropenia. Seven of the 19 had more than one viridans streptococcus in the same blood culture. Twenty isolates from 15 patients were Streptococcus mitis. Most viridans streptococci were resistant to norfloxacin, used routinely for prophylaxis. Comparison of the 19 patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia with a contemporaneous group of 23 allogeneic HSCT recipients with fever and neutropenia but no identified focus of infection found that patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia were more likely to have severe intraoral pathology while neutropenic (26% vs 0%) and slightly shorter interval between the last dental procedure and the onset of neutropenia (11 vs 14 days). Poor underlying dental health and the use of norfloxacin thus appear to predispose to viridans streptococcal bacteremia.

Study Cohort

A total of 118 consecutive patients with VGS-positive blood cultures were included in the study cohort; ≈80% of the patients had neutropenia and hematologic malignancies (Table 1). Most patients had bacteremia without a defined focus, but several other clinical scenarios were observed, including skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal infections, and infective endocarditis. Most patients had clinically mild infections (Pitt bacteremia score of 0 or 1), but 25% of patients had moderate to severe infections (Pitt bacteremia scores of > 2), including 12 patients who had VGS shock syndrome.

We reviewed three very similar cases of acute-onset heart failure in children with acute myeloid leukemia who received anthracyclines during their treatment. All three children were diagnosed with recent Streptococcus viridans bacteremia and had persistent tachycardia prior to acute-onset heart failure with near-complete resolution within weeks. We hypothesize their heart failure was secondary to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy with anthracycline-induced cardiac myocyte damage as a predisposing factor. We suggest prophylaxis and methods of early detection to prevent and better treat acute heart failure in pediatric oncology patients receiving anthracyclines.

### Testing… [^0b46093e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Why get tested Testing for group A strep bacteria helps healthcare providers diagnose and treat the illness. Strep throat and scarlet fever are treated with antibiotics to
- Decrease how long someone is sick
- Decrease symptoms
- Prevent the bacteria from spreading to others
- Prevent serious complications like rheumatic fever Keep ReadingAbout Rheumatic Fever. How testing works If healthcare providers suspect strep throat or scarlet fever, they will test for group A strep. Generally, healthcare providers will do a rapid strep test first, then decide if a throat culture is needed. Rapid strep test A rapid strep test involves swabbing the throat and running a test on the swab. The test quickly shows if group A strep bacteria are likely causing the illness. Throat culture A throat culture takes time to see if group A strep bacteria grow from the swab. While it takes more time, a throat culture sometimes finds infections that the rapid strep test misses.

Testing results Positive test A positive result means group A strep bacteria are likely causing the sore throat or rash. The healthcare provider will usually prescribe antibiotics. Negative rapid strep test The healthcare provider may want to take a throat culture swab. For children and teens Culture is important after a negative rapid strep test. For adults It's usually not necessary to do a throat culture following a negative rapid strep test. Negative culture test Antibiotics aren't needed since group A strep bacteria aren't causing the sore throat or rash. What to do if you've tested positive Healthcare providers treat strep throat and scarlet fever with antibiotics. Call a healthcare provider if you or your child aren't feeling better after taking antibiotics for 48 hours. Strep carriers A carrier is someone who tests positive but has no symptoms. Generally, carriers don't need antibiotics.

They're less likely to spread the bacteria to others and very unlikely to get complications. If a carrier gets a viral sore throat, a strep test can be positive. In these cases, it's hard to know what's causing the sore throat. Talk to a healthcare provider if you think you or your child may be a strep carrier.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^ff74348d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

VGS Species and Disease Severity

We next sought to determine if there was a relationship between VGS species and disease severity (as determined by Pitt bacteremia score). Organ dysfunction, such as hypotension, begins to occur at Pitt bacteremia scores of > 2. The distribution of Pitt bacteremia score by infecting species is shown in Figure 2, panel A. Patients infected with S. mitis were significantly more likely to have a higher Pitt bacteremia score (p < 0.01). One possible explanation for this observation is that S. mitis strains mainly caused infections in patients with neutropenia who, compared with patients without neutropenia, might be more likely to have serious infections. Thus, we repeated the analysis, including only patients with neutropenia. Again, the Pitt bacteremia scores were significantly higher for patients infected with S. mitis (p < 0.01; Figure 2, panel B). Of the 12 cases of VGS shock syndrome, 11 were caused by S. mitis strains and 1 was caused by an S. constellatus strain (Anginosus group).

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of infective endocarditis — Infective endocarditis (IE) is the net result of interaction between the bloodstream pathogen, matrix molecules, and platelets at sites of endocardial damage, and the following sequence is thought to result in IE: formation of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), bacteremia, adherence of bacteria in the bloodstream to NBTE, and proliferation within a vegetation. Turbulent blood flow from congenital or acquired heart disease traumatizes endothelium, creating a predisposition for deposition of platelets and fibrin that results in NBTE. Mucosal surfaces populated by dense endogenous microflora can release many different microbial species transiently into the bloodstream after trauma to sites such as the gingival crevice, oropharynx, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, urethra, or vagina; transient bacteremia caused by viridans group streptococci and other oral microflora occurs commonly with dental extractions, other dental procedures, or routine daily activities, and the microbial species entering the circulation depends on the endogenous microflora at the traumatized site. Modes of bacterial adherence serve as virulence factors in the pathogenesis of IE, with bacterial surface components in streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci functioning as critical adhesins; some viridans group streptococci contain a fimbrial adhesion protein (FimA), a lipoprotein receptor antigen I that serves as a major adhesin to the fibrin platelet matrix of NBTE. Staphylococcal adhesins function in at least two ways: microbial surface components facilitate attachment to human extracellular matrix proteins and to medical devices that become coated with matrix proteins after implantation, and bacterial extracellular structures contribute to the formation of biofilm on the surface of implanted medical devices. Both FimA and staphylococcal adhesins are immunogenic in experimental infections, and vaccines prepared against them provide some protective effect in experimental endocarditis. Within vegetations, buried microorganisms can multiply to reach maximal microbial densities of 10⁸ to 10¹¹ colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of vegetation on the left side of the heart.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis.

Resistance

Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibacterials.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus gallolyticus (previously known as Streptococcus bovis), Enterococcus spp, and the viridans group streptococci.

Antimicrobial Activity

Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Aerobic Gram-Positive Bacteria

Corynebacterium spp.

Enterococcu s spp. (including Enterococcus faecalis)

Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible isolates)

### Factors contributing to delayed initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment in patients with streptococcal bacteremia [^8d775bcb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, we concur that results from observational studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly regarding parameters reflecting medical decisions, such as antimicrobial treatment or source control interventions, as these decisions are based on complex evaluations not fully captured during data collection. However, the effect of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on the mortality of various infections and pathogens has consistently been shown to be one of the most important interventions for improving outcomes. Nonetheless, as noted by Dequidt et al, in patients with suspected infection and in the absence of an evident site of infection, sepsis, and neutropenia, antimicrobial treatment can be safely withheld, as initiating antimicrobial treatment in all such patients could lead to unnecessary consequences at both the individual and society levels, including gut microbiota dysregulation, antimicrobial-associated side effects, and increase in antimicrobial resistance.

### Thrombus aspirates from patients with acute ischemic stroke are infiltrated by viridans streptococci [^0c51ac56]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral bacteria can enter the bloodstream after dental procedures (eg, root canal treatment or tooth extraction) causing transient bacteremia. In tooth extraction, most bacteria translocated into the circulation have been found to be viridans streptococci. Koren et al found that the abundance of viridans streptococcal DNA in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with their abundance in the oral cavity. After accessing systemic circulation, bacteria might end up in an atherosclerotic lesion via a circulating macrophage or directly through neovasculature developing inside the carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Viridans streptococci can directly interact with platelets, causing their activation. Activated platelets (ie, platelet‐derived growth factor) induce the recruitment of proatherosclerotic cells, which speeds up the atherosclerotic processes. Following bacteremia, bacteria‐induced thrombi might thus also be trapped in the left atrial appendage, causing a cardioembolic stroke in patients with altered hemodynamics, such as in atrial fibrillation. In our BMG series, 63.9% of the patients had atrial fibrillation. However, despite that, 62% of the cases were considered to be due to atherosclerosis, suggesting uncertainty in determining the cause.

Oral bacteria are known to form biofilms on hard tooth surfaces but also on soft epithelial tissue. Viridans streptococci are the initial colonizers in the development of a dental plaque. It has been suggested that bacteria form biofilm‐like structures in the atherosclerotic plaque. This could contribute to the persistent inflammation associated with atherosclerosis. Biofilm‐phenotype bacteria are much more resistant to antibiotics than the same bacteria in planktonic form.

To validate the specificity of the immunohistochemical stainings, we used several controls. The rabbit IgG isotype control is a primary antibody that lacks specificity to the target. Isotype controls are used as negative controls to differentiate a nonspecific background signal from a specific antibody signal. An E coli –specific antibody was used to show the specificity of the viridans streptococci antibody cocktail. All IgG isotype control–stained samples as well as the E coli immunostainings were negative.

### Performance of the 2023 Duke-International society of cardiovascular infectious diseases diagnostic criteria for infective endocarditis in relation to the modified Duke criteria and to clinical management-reanalysis of retrospective bacteremia cohorts [^69134c94]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

One particular clinical situation in which IE needs to be considered is the finding of gram-positive or HACEK (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella) bacteria in blood cultures. For patients with such bacteremia, the risk for IE needs to be evaluated so that echocardiographic investigations are performed in patients at risk for IE. The finding of IE has direct implications for prolonged treatment time and also for the decision about heart valve surgery. Therefore, several studies have been performed to determine risk factors for IE and risk stratification systems for IE in patients with bacteremia caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci (also known as non–β-hemolytic streptococci, NBHS), and Enterococcus faecalis.

The objective of the current study was to compare the performance of the Duke-ISCVID criteria for IE with that of the 2000 modified Duke criteria in patients with bacteremia from 14 different cohorts. The study also evaluated the agreements of the classifications by the sets of criteria compared with the clinical decision to treat as IE.

Vaccine development and widespread immunization have rapidly affected the changing epidemiology of this disease. There is a growing consensus that the reduction in incidence of occult bacteremia and the significant problem of antibiotic resistance are tipping the balance in favor of no testing and no treatment for well-appearing febrile children between 6 and 36 months of age who are immunized with Haemophilus influenzae B vaccination and PCV-7 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). This review of occult pneumococcal bacteremia will not only elaborate on current knowledge and clinical practice, but will also provide historical context to this fascinating phenomenon.

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (vancomycin) [^fdc139eb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

MICROBIOLOGY

The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi.

Synergy

The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci, and the viridans group streptococci.

Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms

Diphtheroids
Enterococci (e.g. Enterococcus faecalis)

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^05ba6735]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, viridans streptococci and S. gallolyticus, NVE, penicillin-susceptible, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering aqueous crystalline penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4 weeks in patients with native valve IE caused by highly penicillin-susceptible (MIC ≤ 0.12 mcg/mL) viridans group streptococci or S. gallolyticus.

### Infective endocarditis due to penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci [^ec7b33d1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The emergence of viridans group streptococci that are relatively or fully resistant to penicillin is increasingly being recognized worldwide, but only a scant number of penicillin-resistant isolates have been described as a cause of infective endocarditis. Because of the paucity of data, it has been difficult to define optimal treatment regimens for this syndrome. Thus, recommendations for therapy have largely been made on the basis of consensus opinion.

Methods

We retrospectively identified a cohort of patients with infective endocarditis due to penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci who were seen at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) between January 1967 and April 2006. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, treatment regimens, and outcomes were analyzed. Mean values are shown with standard deviations.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were identified over the 38.5-year study period. Nineteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured; 9 of these 19 patients received a 2.3 ± 0.4-week antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin and an aminoglycoside, and 8 of these 19 patients received treatment courses of 5.1 ± 1.4 weeks' duration that consisted of either a bimodal combination regimen with a penicillin or ceftriaxone and an aminoglycoside or ceftriaxone monotherapy. Nine of 10 patients with prosthetic valve infection were cured with 4.1 ± 0.6-week regimens that consisted of either a combination regimen or monotherapy with vancomycin or ceftriaxone. Mean duration of follow-up after hospital discharge was 9.1 years.

Conclusions

Outcomes of this relatively large population of patients with endocarditis with a prolonged duration of follow-up indicate that the application of current treatment guidelines should be successful in most patients.

### Evaluation of the HANDOC score and the 2023 international society of cardiovascular infectious diseases and European Society of Cardiology Duke clinical criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis among patients with streptococcal bacteremia [^b91786ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococci rank among the most common culprits of infective endocarditis (IE), trailing only Staphylococcus aureus in frequency. Nevertheless, the risk of IE varies among different streptococcal species, with those belonging to the Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus mitis groups exhibiting the highest IE risk. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and β-hemolytic streptococci pose a lower risk. This discrepancy led to the inclusion of a new recommendation in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for performing echocardiography for bacteremia caused by certain streptococcal species.

Despite this, uncertainty persists regarding the necessity of universal echocardiography screening for IE in patients with streptococcal bacteremia. The question remains whether these screenings should be reserved for high-risk individuals. Notably, a screening test, known as the HANDOC score, was developed specifically for patients with bacteremia caused by non-β-hemolytic streptococci to identify those at a heightened risk of IE. The HANDOC score, composed of 6 variables (heart murmur or valve disease [H]; aetiology with the groups of S mutans, S bovis, S sanguinis, or S anginosus [A]; number of positive blood cultures ≥ 2 [N]; duration of symptoms ≥ 7 days [D]; only 1 species growing in blood cultures [O]; and community-acquired infection [C]), demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in the initial study and 2 subsequent validation studies. However, both studies had several limitations. First, the number of evaluated patients was low (223, 152, and 62 patients). Second, the reference standard was definite IE by the 2015 ESC Duke criteria, which have been shown to have a less than optimal sensitivity and specificity, and exclusion of patients not undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or those clinically treated for IE without meeting the 2015 Duke-ESC criteria for definite IE.

### Association between time to appropriate antimicrobial treatment and 30-day mortality in patients with bloodstream infections: a retrospective cohort study [^3bd073c0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Out of 581 334 adult admissions, we were able to identify 13 511 BSI episodes. After applying exclusion criteria, 10 628 BSI episodes remained for analysis, occurring in 9192 unique patients (Figure 2). The BSI episodes corresponded to 12 223 unique pathogens of which Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and viridans streptococci were the most prevalent pathogens (Figure 3). The most common empirical antimicrobials were cefotaxime (46.5%), piperacillin-tazobactam (35.7%), and meropenem (12.1%).

### Pneumococcal pneumonia: differences according to blood culture results [^7820ba62]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination and advances in antimicrobial agents, case-fatality rates among adults with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia vary significantly (ranging from 6% to 30%); they have improved little in the past three decades and, in general, remain high. In addition, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia continues to evolve, and regular comprehensive analysis of this entity is necessary.

The severity of sepsis can be graded, using the American Collage of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine classification, into different progressive stages: bacteremia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunctions. Although there is a hierarchical continuum of severity across sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction, the presence of SIRS has no prognostic significance, and the prognostic significance of bacteremia remains unclear. Among patients with pneumonia, bacteremia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae has traditionally been associated with poor outcomes, it being considered an invasive form of infection. To date, however, there has been little research on the impact of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia on the outcome of pneumococcal pneumonia: most studies have focused on bacteremic infection, or on the impact of antibiotic resistance on clinical outcome, few reports having compared the clinical outcomes of pneumonia patients with and without pneumococcal bacteremia. Moreover, among the few existing comparative studies the findings are contradictory and characteristics of some of the studies have limited their generalizability: the enrolment of relatively small numbers of patients; collection of information from a single institution; and no adjusted analysis.

Our main objective was to assess whether bacteremia in patients with pneumonia was related to severity on admission, septic shock at admission or during hospitalization, and mortality in a large pneumococcal pneumonia study. We hypothesized that the presence of bacteremia would be associated with higher severity on admission, and also higher rates of shock and mortality due to a greater degree of systemic invasion.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Viridans group streptococci — antimicrobial resistance patterns and implications for IE prophylaxis report resistance to penicillin ranging from 17 to 50 percent and resistance to ceftriaxone from 22 to 42 percent; ceftriaxone was two to four times more active in vitro than was cefazolin. Resistance to macrolides ranged from 22 to 58 percent, and resistance to clindamycin ranged from 13 to 27 percent. In patients without cancer, 32 percent of strains were resistant to penicillin, and erythromycin resistance was 41 percent in otherwise healthy patients; after treatment with either azithromycin or clindamycin, the percentage of resistant streptococci increased to 82 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The impact of viridans group streptococcal resistance on antibiotic prevention of IE is unknown, it is impractical to recommend prophylaxis with only vancomycin or a fluoroquinolone, and there is no evidence that such therapy is effective for prophylaxis of IE.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^a7be0a5c]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment perspectives in infective endocarditis (IE) note that initial therapy is empirical and is revised once a pathogen and susceptibilities are defined, and infectious diseases consultation should occur at empirical therapy initiation. It is reasonable for the counting of days for the duration of therapy to begin on the first day on which blood cultures are negative, and it is reasonable to obtain 2 sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until clearance. After valve surgery, an entire course of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable if resected valve tissue is culture positive or a perivalvular abscess is found, whereas if tissue is culture negative, it may be reasonable for the duration of postoperative treatment given less the number of days of treatment administered for native valve infection before valve replacement. Retrospective data from 2 medical centers suggest that 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy may be sufficient after surgery when valve tissue cultures are negative, particularly in IE caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis); whether 2 weeks is sufficient with positive valve cultures was not addressed in one survey and included only 5 patients in another, and histopathological Gram staining with negative cultures is not a factor in defining length of therapy after surgery.

### Viridans Streptococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: clinical characteristics and comparison with concurrent polymicrobial infection [^1ebc9f6f]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

*Mono-VS peritonitis vs. mixed-VS peritonitis

Regarding the additional organisms other than VS found among the mixed-VS peritonitis episodes, 1 organism was found in 26 episodes, 2 in 4, and 3 in 1. The concurrent infectious organisms are shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Organisms other than viridans streptococcus (VS) isolated from 31 episodes of mixed-VS peritonitis

Of the VS isolates in mono-VS peritonitis episodes, 93.6% were susceptible to ampicillin, 91.0% to penicillin, and 91.2% to ceftriaxone. In contrast, of the VS isolates in mixed-VS peritonitis episodes, 90.3% were susceptible to ampicillin, 87.1% to penicillin, and 87.1% to ceftriaxone (Table 3). All viridans streptococci, regardless of being isolated from mono-VS or mixed-VS peritonitis patients, were susceptible to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin (Table 3). We also examined the association of antibiotic susceptibility with recent antibiotic exposure and prior peritonitis. In mono-VS peritonitis, the rate of those with recent antibiotic exposure was lower (13.0–16.7%) than those with prior peritonitis (47.4–52.7%) among susceptible episodes. The trend was similar in mixed-VS peritonitis wherein the rate of those with recent antibiotic exposure was lower (10.7–13.8%) than those with prior peritonitis (66.7–75.9%) among susceptible episodes. A detailed antibiotic susceptibility profile is shown in Table 4.

### Bacteremia in febrile nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients [^acc970ba]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to determine the risk of bacteremia in a cohort of outpatient febrile nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients and to assess clinical characteristics that may influence decisions regarding empiric antibiotic therapy.

Procedure

A single institution retrospective cohort study was performed of outpatient pediatric oncology patients presenting with fever, a central venous catheter, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≥ 500/microl over a 6-year period. We also collected data regarding the presence of clinically evident infections, antibiotics prescribed, and the sensitivity of bacteria to specific antibiotics.

Results

There were 29 cases of bacteremia in 459 (6.3%) febrile outpatient visits by 167 patients. Bacteremia was documented in 4.4% of patients with ports and in 16.2% of patients with external catheters. Patients with external catheters had a relative risk of bacteremia of 3.7 (95% CI: 1.8–7.4) times the risk of those with internal catheters (P < 0.0001). A documented source for fever on exam was noted in 21% of patients but in none of the patients with bacteremia (P = 0.004). Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone was administered to 92% of the patients. Of the high-risk bacteremic infections (Gram-negative organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus) 94% had at least an intermediate sensitivity to ceftriaxone.

Conclusions

Bacteremia is an important issue in febrile nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients occurring in 6% of the patient visits in this study. The overall sensitivity of high-risk bacteremia to ceftriaxone provides justification for its empiric use in outpatient febrile nonneutropenic pediatric oncology patients.

### Predictors of mortality of streptococcal bacteremia and the role of infectious diseases consultation: a retrospective cohort study [^1e5f12a6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The absence of early source control and the administration of inappropriate antimicrobials emerged as independent predictors of mortality in our study. Although the significance of promptly initiating appropriate antimicrobial treatment in improving survival among patients with streptococcal bacteremia has been previously underscored, the role of early source control had not been explored in prior research. Notably, in patients with necrotizing fasciitis, the majority of which is instigated by streptococci, the timing of surgical debridement has been shown to impact prognosis, with those receiving early surgical treatment experiencing lower mortality rates.

The time to positivity of blood cultures for various pathogens has previously been associated with mortality, particularly in the context of S. aureus bacteremia. However, among different groups of streptococci, conflicting results have been reported. In our current study, we did not find any association between the time to positivity of any streptococcal group and mortality. The time to positivity in blood cultures typically serves as an indicator of the microbial load of the infecting organism. However, variations in results among different studies may be attributed to discrepancies in blood culture collection protocols and the duration between blood culture collection and processing in the incubation machine in different centers. These factors introduce variability into the results and impact the interpretation of the time to positivity in various studies.

Nonetheless, our study has its limitations. First, it is a retrospective single-center study. Given that our center is a tertiary university facility, the cohort examined represents the most complex cases and may not be fully representative of the epidemiology in nontertiary centers. Additionally, there are numerous confounding factors that can influence the association between improved survival and early interventions, such as the decision to limit or withdraw care and the willingness of surgeons or interventional radiologists to perform source control interventions. In our study, only 4 patients died within 48 hours from bacteremia onset, with an additional 2 experiencing a withdrawal of care in the same time frame, thus having limited impact on our findings. Furthermore, although we considered the appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial treatment, we did not assess the specific types of antimicrobials, duration, or eventual oral switch. Moreover, hospitalization length and readmission were also not included.

In conclusion, this study endeavors to bridge this knowledge gap and provide insights into the multifaceted approach required for the effective management of streptococcal bacteremia. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of infectious diseases consultation in guiding antimicrobial treatment and recommending source control interventions for patients with streptococcal bacteremia, thereby contributing to the enhancement of patient care and the reduction of mortality.

### Pathogen influence on epidemiology, diagnostic evaluation and management of infective endocarditis [^5fa5493f]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is uncommon and has, in the past, been most often caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS). Due to the indolent nature of these organisms, the phrase 'subacute bacterial endocarditis', so-called 'SBE', was routinely used as it characterised the clinical course of most patients that extended for weeks to months. However, in more recent years, there has been a significant shift in the microbiology of IE with the emergence of staphylococci as the most frequent pathogens, and for IE due to Staphylococcus aureus, the clinical course is acute and can be associated with sepsis. Moreover, increases in IE due to enterococci have occurred and have been characterised by treatment-related complications and worse outcomes. These changes in pathogen distribution have been attributed to a diversification in the target population at risk of IE. While prosthetic valve endocarditis and history of IE remain at highest risk of IE, the rise in prevalence of injection drug use, intracardiac device implantations and other healthcare exposures have heavily contributed to the existing pool of at-risk patients. This review focuses on common IE pathogens and their impact on the clinical profile of IE.

### Ceftriaxone (Easy-ceft) [^82dcab25]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

Microbiology:

Mechanism of Action:

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance:

Mechanism of Resistance:

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials:

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^5edda63a]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Viridans group streptococci (VGS) and Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) prosthetic valve endocarditis — recommended regimens include aqueous crystalline penicillin G sodium 24 million U/24 h IV either continuously or in 4–6 equally divided doses for 6 weeks (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B) or ceftriaxone 2 g/24 h IV or IM in 1 dose for 6 weeks (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), with or without gentamicin sulfate 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV or IM in 1 dose for 2 weeks; penicillin or ceftriaxone together with gentamicin has not demonstrated superior cure rates and gentamicin therapy should not be administered to patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. For patients unable to tolerate penicillin or ceftriaxone, vancomycin hydrochloride 30 mg/kg per 24 h IV in 2 equally divided doses for 6 weeks is Class IIa; Level of Evidence B. For penicillin relatively or fully resistant strain (MIC > 0.12 μg/mL), use aqueous crystalline penicillin G sodium or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin for 6 weeks (each Class IIa; Level of Evidence B); ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 h is a reasonable alternative to penicillin if a penicillin shortage exists, and gentamicin dosing is preferably once daily though 3 equally divided doses can be used.

### Epidemiology of bacteremia in previously healthy febrile infants: a follow-up study [^79dfaf5b]. Hospital Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Describe the etiology of bacteremia among a geographically diverse sample of previously well infants with fever admitted for general pediatric care and to characterize demographic and clinical characteristics of infants with bacteremia according to bacterial etiology. We hypothesized that the epidemiology of bacteremia in febrile infants from a geographically diverse cohort would show similar results to smaller or single-center cohorts previously reported.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of positive, pathogenic blood cultures in previously healthy, febrile infants ≤ 90 days old admitted to a general unit. In total, there were 17 participating sites from diverse geographic regions of the United States. Cultures were included if the results were positive for bacteria, obtained from an infant 90 days old or younger with a temperature ≥ 38.0°C, analyzed using an automated detection system, and treated as pathogenic.

Results

Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species, followed by group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Among the most prevalent bacteria, there was no association between gender and species (Ps > .05). Age at presentation was associated only with Streptococcus pneumoniae. There were no cases of Listeria monocytogenes.

Conclusions

Our study confirms the data from smaller or single-center studies and suggests that the management of febrile well-appearing infants should change to reflect the current epidemiology of bacteremia. Further research is needed into the role of lumbar puncture, as well as the role of Listeria and Enterococcus species in infantile bacteremia.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^82bed817]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — highly penicillin‑susceptible viridans group streptococci and S gallolyticus (bovis) native valve IE: Both aqueous crystalline penicillin G and ceftriaxone are reasonable options for a 4‑week treatment duration (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). A 2‑week treatment regimen that includes gentamicin is reasonable in patients with uncomplicated IE, rapid response to therapy, and no underlying renal disease (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Vancomycin for a 4‑week treatment duration is a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot tolerate penicillin or ceftriaxone therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). The desired trough vancomycin level should range between 10 and 15 μg/mL (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

### Empyema management: a cohort study evaluating antimicrobial therapy [^a6d782b2]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Empyemas require aggressive antimicrobial and surgical management. However, the specifics of antimicrobial therapy have not been studied in clinical trials. The present study examines management and outcomes among a cohort of patients with empyema cared for in a tertiary-care referral hospital over a decade.

Methods

We retrospectively identified patients hospitalized with empyema from January 2000 through December 2010 at one institution. Patient demographics, laboratory findings, treatments, and patient outcomes were abstracted using a standard form. Data were summarized with standard descriptive statistics.

Results

A total of 91 patients were identified. The predominant organisms were viridans group streptococci, which were isolated in 64% of cases with cultures. The median length of hospitalization was 9 days. Length of antimicrobial therapy from time of source control was variable, with a median (interquartile range) duration of 27 (15–31) days. Of note, longer courses of parenteral, but not oral, therapy were associated with fewer cases of clinical failure.

Conclusions

This descriptive analysis demonstrated a higher rate of viridans group streptococci than expected. Three weeks of therapy was generally adequate and prevented clinical failure, but further study is needed with a much larger cohort to better define the optimal drug regimen, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy for empyema.

### Effect of a chlorhexidine mouthwash on the risk of postextraction bacteremia [^ad17f275]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence, duration, and etiology of bacteremia following dental extractions performed after a single administration of chlorhexidine mouthwash.

Design and Setting

A randomized, controlled trial performed in a university hospital.

Methods

A series of 106 patients with mental and behavioral disabilities who underwent dental extractions under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to a control group or chlorhexidine group. The exclusion criteria applied were use of antibiotics in the previous 3 months, use of oral antiseptics, any type of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and disease that predisposes the patient to infections or bleeding. The chlorhexidine group had 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash administered for 30 seconds before any dental manipulation. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 30 seconds, 15 minutes, and 1 hour after the dental extractions. Subculture and further identification of the isolated bacteria were performed by conventional microbiological techniques.

Results

The prevalence of bacteremia after dental extraction in the control and chlorhexidine groups were 96% and 79%, respectively, at 30 seconds (P = 0.008), 64% and 30% at 15 minutes (P < .001), and 20% and 2% at 1 hour (P = 0.005). The most frequently identified bacteria were Streptococcus species in both the control and chlorhexidine groups (64% and 68%, respectively), particularly viridans group streptococci.

Conclusion

We recommend the routine use of a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash before dental extractions to reduce the risk of postextraction bacteremia.

Periodontal disease

Gingivitis is a localized or generalized inflammation of the gingiva without loss of periodontal attachment, whereas periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the gingiva, affecting the deeper parts of the periodontium. As dental plaque migrates in apical direction, periodontal attachment degrades, leading to ulcerative periodontal pockets, bone resorption, and tooth loss. About 40–50% of adults has chronic gingivitis, around 35% suffer from moderate periodontitis, whereas the prevalence of severe periodontitis is estimated to range from 10 to 15% in Western populations. Periodontitis risk increases with age (peaks between 50 and 60 years) and is more prevalent in men than in women. The severity of the periodontal disease depends on environmental and host factors (e.g. genetic susceptibility, comorbidities, oral hygiene, and smoking). Inflamed and infected periodontal tissues can expose up to 35–50 cm² of connective inflamed tissue and may serve as a reservoir of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and proteolytic enzymes that may spread systemically via ulcerated pocket epithelium and contribute to endothelial dysfunction, a pro-coagulant state, and low-level inflammation. Periodontal infection has been associated with bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices, FUO, and a wide range of systemic conditions, including ischemic cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia.

Table 4 summarizes the literature on gingivitis and periodontitis and their association with bacteremia, FN and infectious complications.

Ulcerated periodontal pocket epithelium can allow translocation of microorganisms into the bloodstream. Bacteremia may be caused by facultative or strictly anaerobic bacteria likely originating from the periodontium, including Capnocytophaga spp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum. However, bacteremia with these microorganisms is relatively uncommon, whereas bacteremias with viridans streptococci and CONS occur frequently in profoundly myelosuppressed patients. Increases of gingival viridans streptococci and CONS have been documented during high-dose CT, and one study reported that periodontitis may contribute to the risk of bacteremia with viridans streptococci and CONS during the neutropenic phase of HSCT. Periodontal disease may be occult without symptoms and clinical signs that may only be detected upon comprehensive periodontal evaluation and not identified based on general oral examination.

### Infective endocarditis in the pacific: clinical characteristics, treatment and long-term outcomes [^fbd87407]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present original data on IE, with long-term outcome measures, in a group of islands in the Pacific. The main underlying heart condition was rheumatic heart disease. The majority of patients presented with complicated IE. Barely half the surgical candidates were deemed fit for surgery. Access to emergent or urgent surgery is limited in this remote area. Mortality was extremely high (> 40%) at long-term follow-up ∼2.5 years.

Clinical characteristics

Patterns of IE in New Caledonia, a high-income country, resemble those of many emerging market-economies with an on-going epidemiological transition. Although we focused our study on adults, patients were relatively young (mean age ∼53 years). Our patients are younger by 10 years when compared to a recent survey conducted in France. In the USA, patients with IE are increasingly older; 36% of patients are over 69 years of age.

As in Europe and North America, the most frequent pathogen in IE was S. aureus. However, S. viridans remains the second leading pathogen in our series (15.7%), whereas it has almost disappeared in the USA. In our study, the microbiological profile reflects the emergence of healthcare-related bacteraemia and the persistence of poor dental health. Healthcare-associated IE was, however, present in a minority of our patients (13.7%). This finding differs from the epidemiology of IE in Western countries, where healthcare-associated IE accounts for over a third of cases.

Rheumatic heart disease remains a major predisposing factor of IE, the condition being highly prevalent among Oceanic populations in New Caledonia. Although rheumatic heart disease still prevails in most of the developing countries and among indigenous populations, the importance of rheumatic heart disease as an underlying condition for IE is highly variable across other tropical or subtropical countries. The disease remains the main predisposing factor for IE in countries where a large proportion of the population lives in poverty, whereas its significance has diminished elsewhere over the past decade.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^55bb6cbd]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Viridans group streptococci (VGS) native-valve endocarditis with relative penicillin resistance — Therapy options include aqueous crystalline penicillin G sodium 24 million U/24 h IV either continuously or in 4–6 equally divided doses with duration 4 wk (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), plus gentamicin sulfate 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV or IM in 1 dose for 2 wk; vancomycin hydrochloride 30 mg/kg per 24 h IV in 2 equally divided doses for 4 wk (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C) is reasonable only for patients unable to tolerate penicillin or ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be a reasonable alternative when isolates are susceptible, the targeted range is MIC is > 0.12 to < 0.5 μg/mL for penicillin, ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 h is a reasonable alternative to penicillin if a penicillin shortage exists, and gentamicin (3 mg/kg) is preferred as a single daily dose though 3 equally divided doses are a second option.

### Cefepime [^7e96bc7b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Pneumonia

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter species.

1.2 Empiric Therapy for Febrile Neutropenic Patients

Cefepime for injection as monotherapy is indicated for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. In patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia), antimicrobial monotherapy may not be appropriate. Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in such patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.3 Uncomplicated and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis)

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis) caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, when the infection is severe, or caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis, when the infection is mild to moderate, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia with these bacteria.

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

1.5 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (used in combination with metronidazole)

Cefepime for injection is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) in adults caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, viridans group streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Bacteroides fragilis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefepime for injection and other antibacterial drugs, cefepime for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Evolution, incidence, and susceptibility of bacterial bloodstream isolates from 519 bone marrow transplant patients [^cfa2eade]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Bacteria remain an important cause of infection in bone marrow transplants. To examine shifts in the etiology and susceptibility of bacterial isolates from transplants, we reviewed the incidence and susceptibility of blood isolates during a 7-year period. The infection rate fell dramatically during this time. Gram-positive organisms were isolated more often than gram-negative organisms, but the trend is reversing. Streptococci surpassed staphylococci for 5 years as the leading pathogen. Increasing resistance to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem was noted in Streptococcus species. With the exception of type 1 beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-negative isolates remained overall susceptible to ceftazidime. Increased antibiotic prophylaxis coincided with the reduction in percentage of infected patients and increase in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Mortality attributed to bacteremia was low except for infections caused by P. aeruginosa and the Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter group. There was no mortality attributable to gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and viridans streptococci.

### Oral streptococcal bacteremia in hospitalized patients: taxonomic identification and clinical characterization [^1617db93]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Oral streptococci have been associated with systemic diseases, including infective endocarditis and neutropenic bacteremia. We analyzed 58 recent oral streptococcal bloodstream isolates, and we obtained clinical and demographic data for source patients. The sodA gene was found to be a better target than the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer for DNA sequence-based species identification. Together, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more likely than the 12 combined remaining species to be isolated from neutropenic patients.
