## Question

What is the best tube feed for diabetics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which enteral tube feed is best for patients with diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether diabetes-specific enteral formulas (DSEFs) are indicated. Then, I should verify the evidence base for DSEFs versus standard formulas on glycemic outcomes. Next, I will examine macronutrient composition features that drive benefit, consider special populations and settings, and finally align with guideline positions and practical implementation details including insulin management and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication. Patients with diabetes who require tube feeding are at increased risk of hyperglycemia during enteral nutrition, and hyperglycemia during hospitalization is associated with worse outcomes, so formula selection and insulin strategy matter; I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing beyond patients who actually need enteral support and who have or are at risk for hyperglycemia [^114vaa54] [^114Vxqzq].

> Next, I should review the comparative evidence. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and consistency of benefit. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies showed that diabetes-specific formulas reduced postprandial glucose rise by about 1 mmol/L, reduced peak glucose by about 1.6 mmol/L, and decreased glucose AUC by roughly 35% versus standard formulas, with signals toward lower insulin requirements in some studies, though heterogeneity and limited inpatient tube-feeding data temper certainty [^1118Ufy2]. Randomized trials in tube-fed type 2 diabetes demonstrate clinically meaningful reductions in fasting glucose and HbA1c with DSEFs over 12–84 days, alongside lower daily insulin needs, supporting both short- and intermediate-term glycemic advantages [^117FLM7m] [^113Vbwkr]. In acute settings, crossover and controlled studies show lower glucose and insulin excursions during continuous feeding with DSEFs compared with standard formulas, reinforcing mechanistic plausibility even if durations are short [^114Tyd1i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm guideline positions. ASPEN's clinical guidance for hyperglycemia concludes that evidence is low and states "further research needed", so a strong universal recommendation is not made, yet acknowledges that some trials show improved glycemic metrics with DSEFs; this means shared decision-making and individualized use are prudent while we await higher-quality inpatient data [^114nUmU3]. I should double-check that this aligns with specialty society positions; indeed, diabetes standards emphasize structured insulin coverage during enteral nutrition rather than endorsing a specific formula brand, which keeps the focus on safe insulin delivery alongside formula choice [^114Vxqzq].

> I will now examine the macronutrient composition that likely drives benefit. Let me think about the key features: lower total carbohydrate load, substitution of some carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids, inclusion of soluble fiber, and higher protein content, particularly whey-based, which may have insulinotropic and incretin-mediated effects; these design elements collectively blunt postprandial spikes and reduce insulin requirements in observational and randomized comparisons [^1118Ufy2] [^114U9SLE] [^117Ps5B4]. But wait, what if the patient has fat malabsorption or pancreatitis? In that case, I should reconsider a very high-fat DSEF and balance lipid load with tolerance and caloric goals, tailoring the formula to GI physiology and comorbidities [^1127VRFU].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with hyperglycemia, randomized multicenter data suggest that high-protein DSEFs reduce insulin requirements, lower mean and capillary glucose, reduce glycemic variability, and may reduce ventilator-associated infections compared with standard high-protein formulas; however, the studies are open-label and mortality effects are uncertain, so I should frame this as potential short-term glycemic and infection-related benefits rather than proven mortality impact [^114eUiGb] [^114vRUSc] [^111VCLmX]. In stroke, even in non-diabetic patients, DSEFs reduced hyperglycemia and were associated with improved oral route recovery in some trials, but I need to be cautious about indirect outcomes and confounding by stroke severity and care processes [^114pjoXd] [^113gJpUQ]. For cystic fibrosis with CFRD risk, guidelines recommend mid- and post-feeding glucose checks when initiating and during continuous enteral feeds, given the propensity for feed-related hyperglycemia, so formula selection should be integrated with screening protocols and insulin planning [^114jskQ5] [^114nmKU6].

> Now, I should translate this into practical formula selection. Initially, I thought "brand X" might be categorically superior, but wait, I should verify that no head-to-head DSEF trials establish hierarchy; in fact, most comparative data contrast DSEFs against standard formulas rather than against each other, so the safest evidence-based statement is to prefer a DSEF with low glycemic carbohydrates, higher MUFA, soluble fiber, and higher protein when glycemic control is a priority, while matching total calories, protein, and fluid needs to the patient's condition and access route [^1118Ufy2] [^114CmtX4]. Examples include Glucerna-style formulations with reduced carbohydrate and increased MUFA, and newer high-protein DSEFs enriched with omega-3s and fiber, but I should confirm local availability and individual tolerance rather than assume interchangeability [^111XXLsW] [^114eUiGb].

> Next, I should review insulin management because formula alone is not enough. I need to ensure basal, prandial, and correction insulin are ordered when enteral nutrition is provided, with carbohydrate-based dosing approximating 1 unit per 10–15 g carbohydrate per feeding, and for nocturnal continuous feeds, scheduled NPH aligned to feeding initiation is reasonable; I should also plan for hypoglycemia risk if feeds are interrupted and avoid overbasalization in continuous feeding states [^114Vxqzq] [^117PUwnk]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not targeting overly tight glucose in this continuous postprandial state; guidelines caution that aggressive targets increase hypoglycemia risk during continuous nutrition, so a moderate, safety-conscious range is appropriate while individualizing to patient factors and care setting [^114Vxqzq].

> I will now examine monitoring and safety. I need to check that glucose is monitored frequently during initiation and titration of enteral nutrition, with a plan to reassess nutrition risk, tolerance, and glycemic control at least weekly in institutionalized patients and quarterly at home; abrupt changes in rate or discontinuation require immediate insulin adjustment to prevent hypoglycemia, and head-of-bed elevation and aspiration precautions remain essential [^112cZayb]. For patients with diabetes on continuous feeds, especially in CF or other high-risk groups, mid- and post-feeding glucose checks help detect feed-related hyperglycemia early and guide therapy adjustments [^114jskQ5].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. The best available evidence supports choosing a diabetes-specific enteral formula with lower glycemic load, higher MUFA, soluble fiber, and higher protein when glycemic control is a clinical priority during tube feeding, while recognizing that guideline strength is limited and that individualized insulin protocols and vigilant monitoring are indispensable; standard formulas remain acceptable when glycemic targets are less critical or when DSEFs are unavailable or not tolerated, with the understanding that more insulin may be required and glucose excursions may be higher [^1118Ufy2] [^114Vxqzq].

> Final recommendation, keeping the caveats in mind: for adult patients with diabetes who require enteral tube feeding, I recommend a diabetes-specific formula emphasizing reduced carbohydrate proportion, increased monounsaturated fat, inclusion of soluble fiber, and higher protein content, titrated to meet energy and protein goals, combined with a structured basal–bolus insulin regimen and proactive monitoring for interruptions; this approach balances the strongest available evidence for improved glycemic control with guideline cautions and practical safety considerations, and should be adapted to patient comorbidities, feeding route, and institutional formulary [^1118Ufy2] [^114Vxqzq] [^115oeiAW].

---

The best tube feed for diabetics is a **diabetes-specific enteral formula** with low glycemic carbohydrates, high monounsaturated fats, and added fiber (especially soluble fiber) [^1118Ufy2] [^117Ps5B4]. These formulas improve glycemic control by reducing postprandial glucose spikes [^114Tyd1i], lowering insulin requirements [^117FLM7m], and decreasing glycemic variability [^114eUiGb], with no increase in hypoglycemia risk [^114Tyd1i]. They are **superior to standard formulas** for glucose management and are recommended by ASPEN for hyperglycemic patients [^notfound].

---

## Nutritional composition of diabetes-specific enteral formulas

Diabetes-specific enteral formulas are designed to **optimize glycemic control** through specific macronutrient profiles:

- **Carbohydrates**: Low glycemic index carbohydrates (e.g. fructose, resistant starch, maltitol) to slow glucose absorption and reduce postprandial spikes [^1118Ufy2] [^114pjoXd].

- **Fats**: Higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (20–35% of total calories) to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin needs [^1118Ufy2] [^115oeiAW].

- **Protein**: Moderate-to-high protein (16–20% of total calories) to support metabolism and reduce glycemic load [^notfound].

- **Fiber**: Added soluble fiber (e.g. fructooligosaccharides, inulin) to slow gastric emptying and glucose absorption, improving glycemic control [^1118Ufy2] [^114pjoXd].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting diabetes-specific enteral formulas

Multiple studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that diabetes-specific formulas improve glycemic outcomes compared with standard formulas:

- **Glycemic control**: Significant reductions in postprandial glucose, peak glucose, and glucose AUC, with lower insulin requirements [^1118Ufy2] [^114Tyd1i].

- **Insulin requirements**: 26–71% reduction in insulin needs versus standard formulas [^1118Ufy2] [^117FLM7m].

- **Glycemic variability**: Reduced variability, associated with better outcomes in critically ill patients [^114eUiGb] [^111WFwQp].

- **Hypoglycemia**: No increase in hypoglycemia risk compared with standard formulas [^113Vbwkr] [^114Tyd1i].

---

## Comparison with standard enteral formulas

Standard formulas typically contain higher carbohydrates and lower fats, causing greater postprandial glucose spikes and higher insulin needs. Diabetes-specific formulas consistently outperform standard formulas in glycemic control and insulin requirements, making them the **preferred choice** for diabetic patients requiring enteral nutrition [^1118Ufy2] [^115oeiAW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from ASPEN and other authorities recommend diabetes-specific formulas for hyperglycemic patients receiving enteral nutrition, citing improved glycemic control and reduced insulin requirements. However, they also note that **further research is needed** to strengthen the evidence base [^114GDVRB] [^114Y9PND].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Formula selection should be **individualized**, considering:

- **Diabetes type and severity**: Tailor to glycemic targets and insulin regimen [^114Vxqzq].

- **Comorbidities**: Adjust for renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease [^1127VRFU].

- **Nutritional goals**: Ensure adequate protein, calories, and micronutrients [^114AXAT1].

- **Tolerance**: Monitor for GI intolerance and adjust as needed [^111uxcDc].

---

## Practical recommendations for implementation

- **Initiation**: Start with a diabetes-specific formula and titrate to glycemic targets [^1118Ufy2].

- **Monitoring**: Check glucose regularly, especially during initiation and adjustments [^114vaa54].

- **Insulin management**: Use basal-bolus regimens aligned with carbohydrate content and feeding schedule [^117PUwnk].

- **Education**: Train healthcare staff and caregivers on formula administration and glucose monitoring [^1172S3Lk].

---

Diabetes-specific enteral formulas are the **best tube feed for diabetics**, offering superior glycemic control, reduced insulin needs, and lower glycemic variability without increasing hypoglycemia risk. They are recommended by clinical guidelines and should be selected and implemented with individualized patient considerations and close monitoring.

### Enteral nutritional support and use of diabetes-specific formulas for patients with diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118Ufy2]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the benefits of nutritional support in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Studies utilizing an enteral nutritional support intervention (oral supplements or tube feeding) were identified using electronic databases and bibliography searches. Comparisons of interest were nutritional support versus routine care and standard versus diabetes-specific formulas (containing high proportions of monounsaturated fatty acids, fructose, and fiber). Outcomes of interest were measures of glycemia and lipid status, medication requirements, nutritional status, quality of life, complications, and mortality. Meta-analyses were performed where possible.

Results

A total of 23 studies (comprising 784 patients) of oral supplements (16 studies) and tube feeding (7 studies) were included in the review, and the majority compared diabetes-specific with standard formulas. Compared with standard formulas, diabetes-specific formulas significantly reduced postprandial rise in blood glucose (by 1.03 mmol/l [95% CI 0.58–1.47]; six randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), peak blood glucose concentration (by 1.59 mmol/l [86–2.32]; two RCTs), and glucose area under curve (by 7.96 mmol.l(-1).min(-1) [2.25–13.66]; four RCTs, i.e., by 35%) with no significant effect on HDL, total cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations. In addition, individual studies reported a reduced requirement for insulin (26–71% lower) and fewer complications with diabetes-specific compared with standard nutritional formulas.

Conclusions

This systematic review shows that short- and long-term use of diabetes-specific formulas as oral supplements and tube feeds are associated with improved glycemic control compared with standard formulas. If such nutritional support is given long term, this may have implications for reducing chronic complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular events.

### Improved glucose profile in patients with type 2 diabetes with a new, high-protein, diabetes-specific tube feed during 4 hours of continuous feeding [^114Tyd1i]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia frequently occurs in hospitalized patients receiving nutrition support. In this study, the effects of a new diabetes-specific formula (DSF) on glucose profile during 4 hours of continuous feeding and 4 hours after stopping feeding were compared with a standard formula (SF).

Materials and Methods

In this randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study, ambulant, nonhospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes received the DSF or an isocaloric, fiber-containing SF via a nasogastric tube. After overnight fasting, the formula was continuously administered to the patients during 4 hours. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were determined during the 4-hour period and in the subsequent 4 hours during which no formula was provided.

Results

During the 4-hour feeding period, DSF compared with SF resulted in a lower mean delta glucose concentration in the 3- to 4-hour period (0.3 ± 1.0 and 2.4 ± 1.5 mmol/L; P < .001). Also, the (delta) peak concentrations, (delta) mean concentrations, and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose and insulin were significantly lower during DSF compared with SF feeding (all comparisons: P < .001). Furthermore, fewer patients experienced hyperglycemia (> 10 mmol/L) on DSF compared with SF (2 vs 11, P = 0.003, respectively). No differences in number of patients with hypoglycemia (< 3.9 mmol/L) were observed. No significant differences in tolerance were observed.

Conclusion

Administration of a new, high-protein DSF during 4 hours of continuous feeding resulted in lower glucose and insulin levels compared with a fiber-containing SF in ambulant, nonhospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. These data suggest that a DSF may contribute to lower glucose levels in these patients.

### Glycaemic control in type II diabetic tube-fed patients with a new enteral formula low in carbohydrates and high in monounsaturated fatty acids: a randomised controlled trial [^117FLM7m]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of long-term treatment with a new enteral formula low in carbohydrates and high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), in comparison with a standard formula, on glycaemic control in tube-fed type II diabetic patients.

Design

Randomised, double-blind, controlled, multi-centre trial.

Setting

Early rehabilitation centres, primary care and nursing facilities.

Subjects

A total of 78 patients with insulin-treated type II diabetes with HbA(1C) ≥ 7.0% and/or fasting blood glucose > 6.66 mmol/l, who required enteral tube feeding due to neurological dysphagia.

Interventions

Patients received 113 kJ (27 kcal)/kg of body weight of either test feed or an isoenergetic, isonitrogenous enteral formula (control) for 12 weeks. Glycaemic control (total daily insulin dosage (IU), fasting blood glucose, and HbA(1C)) and gastrointestinal tolerance were monitored daily.

Results

After 12 weeks, median values for changes from baseline were as follows (test group vs control group, 'data as available' analysis): total daily IUs -6.0 vs 0.0 (P = 0.0024), fasting blood glucose (mmol/l) -1.59 vs -0.08 (P = 0.0068); HbA(1C) (%) -0.8 vs 0.0 (P = 0.0016). Both formulas were tolerated comparably.

Conclusions

This study indicates that in tube-fed insulin-treated type II diabetic patients, the new low-carbohydrate, high MUFA formula results in a more effective glycaemic control than the standard diet, while being comparable in safety.

### Glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a disease-specific enteral formula: stage II of a randomized, controlled multicenter trial [^113Vbwkr]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Stage I of a preplanned 2-stage study has provided good evidence for improved glycemic control with a disease-specific enteral formula low in carbohydrates and high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), fish oil, chromium, and antioxidants in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. The study was continued with stage II to give confirmatory proof of these beneficial effects.

Methods

105 patients with HbA1C ≥ 7.0% and/or fasting blood glucose (FG) > 6.7 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) requiring enteral tube feeding due to neurological dysphagia received 113 kJ (27 kcal)/kg body weight of either test formula (Diben) or an isoenergetic, isonitrogenous standard formula (control) for up to 84 days. Total insulin (TI) requirements, FG, and afternoon blood glucose (AG) were assessed daily. HbA1C and safety criteria were evaluated on days 1, 28, 56, and 84.

Results

55 patients completed the study; on day 84, median changes from baseline (data as available, test vs control) were the following: TI, -8.0 vs +2.0 IU; FG, -2.17 vs -0.67 mmol/L (-39.0 vs -12.1 mg/dL); HbA(1C), -1.30% vs -1.20%; AG, -2.36 vs -0.49 mmol/L (-42.5 vs -8.9 mg/dL). The number of relevant hypoglycemic episodes (FG < 3.33 mmol/L < 60 mg/dL) was 1 vs 5. Feeding tolerance was comparable in both groups.

Conclusions

Long-term tube feeding with a disease-specific enteral formula was safe and well tolerated in type 2 diabetic patients with neurological disorders. When compared with a standard diet, TI requirement decreased significantly with less hypoglycemia whereas FG and AG were significantly lowered, resulting in improved glycemic control.

### Is there a difference in metabolic outcome between different enteral formulas? [^116L7M2Z]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite appropriate enteral nutrition, many elderly patients do not reach a good metabolic outcome. Two nutrition formulas are commonly used in Israel with no evidence-based medicine to indicate preference of one over the other.

Methods

We describe a 2-month observational study of patients fed by 1 of the 2 formulas. The first (Osmolite, Abbott Company, Abbott Park, IL) is without fiber, and the second (Easy Fiber, Easyline Company Givataim, Israel) in addition to containing fiber is also richer in protein, vitamins, and minerals. The formula was selected by the primary care physician before enrollment in the study and was not influenced by the investigators. Routine blood tests as well as body weight were monitored at the start of enteral feeding and during the 2 months following as part of the regular follow-up.

Results

Fifty-seven patients were fed with the regular formula and 77 with the enriched one. No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups during the follow-up period, in body weight, cholesterol levels, total lymphocyte count, renal function tests, or electrolyte balance. However, in the enriched formula group there was a significant decrease in glucose (p < .05), and increase in albumin (p < .05) and hemoglobin (p = .01) levels.

Conclusions

Enteral feeding with enriched formula appears to improve albumin and hemoglobin levels as well as diabetic control, thus it may be more appropriate than the nonfiber diet for use in long-term care patients.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^1162N1rQ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that repeated bolus nutrient administration for up to 2 weeks at a time via a novel, intraorally anchored enteral feeding tube is feasible. The prototype device requires further development to allow rigorous evaluation of the clinical value of bolus jejunal feeding for weight management, obesity-related comorbidities, and the development of other nutrient-based therapies.

### Selecting the most appropriate route of feeding [^113mp7hy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

This article provides an overview of the various methods available for providing nutritional support. The various techniques available for both enteral and parenteral access are discussed. The selection of the most appropriate route of nutritional support is highly individual and recommendations are made regarding the factors that should be considered by the patient and the clinician in the decision-making process.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^115qo7pV]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of blinding in this study was sub-optimal. This step was taken to safely provide nutrient of desired composition to the participant. Several steps to mitigate the lack of blinding were taken, including no discussion with the participant regarding possible differing effects of the nutrients, removal of identifying labels, not referring to the participant as being in a "control" or "intervention" cycle, and assessment of the main outcome measure by the research assistant. Furthermore, the investigators were not blinded to the type of infusion, though steps were taken to minimize the impact of this on weight measurements. In future studies, double blinding should be used to minimize risk of bias.

Future studies should aim to assess the position of the tube tip during use and to standardize the amount, timing, and rate of the selected nutrient administration. Once the response to a consistently administered stimulus at a consistent site has been determined, then the stimulus type, amount, and site of administration can be iteratively altered to optimize therapeutic efficacy and inform the development of other nutrient-based weight-loss strategies, including caloric restriction, and functional foods such as enteric-coated nutrients for release in the distal intestine –.

Outcome measures

The original approved study design included multiple primary and secondary anthropometric, dietary, and biochemical outcome measures as described in the protocol. However, this proved very time-consuming, resulting in the provision of incomplete data by participants. We thus greatly reduced the requirements of the participants while continuing to monitor them closely for clinical safety. After commencement of this pilot trial, emphasis changed to focus on simpler measures of participant flow and body weight measurement, and identifying reasons for early withdrawal from the trial, in order to design an appropriately powered and definitive weight-loss trial. The primary outcome was 14-day weight change (from cycle baseline to end of the 14-day nutrient intervention: days 0–14). Secondary outcomes included the 28-day cycle weight change (cycle baseline to end of cycle: days 0–28), and the weight change from the 14-day end of nutrient intervention to 28-day end of cycle (days 14–28). For all enrolled participants, select baseline demographic and clinical parameters were recorded. Major events related to device use, and significant clinical events, including adverse events, were documented at weekly study visits. Body weight was measured in the morning with the participant wearing light clothing on a calibrated scale.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^114pjoXd]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/objectives

In patients with acute stroke, the presence of hyperglycaemia has been associated with higher morbidity and less neurological recovery. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a diabetes specific enteral nutrition (EN) formula on glycaemia, comorbidities and mortality in patients admitted with a first episode of stroke who received complete EN.

Methods

This was a prospective randomised controlled trial. Patients with acute stroke did not have diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and required nasogastric tube feeding. This study has been registered with code NCT03422900. The patients were randomised into two arms: an isocaloric isoprotein formula (control group (CG), 27 patients) vs a diabetes-specific formula (low glycaemic index carbohydrates, fibre (80% soluble) and higher lipid content) (experimental group (EG), 25 patients). Pre-EN blood glucose, hyperglycaemia during EN treatment, HbA1c, insulin use, oral route recovery, length of stay (LOS) and mortality at 30 days were collected. The complications of enteral nutrition during admission were collected as well.

Results

52 patients were included, 50% females, with an age of 77.44(11.48) years; 34 (65.4%) had ischaemic stroke, with a Rankin score of 0(0–2), and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 19 (15–22). In CG, there were more cases of hyperglycaemia on the 5th day post-NE (13(65%) vs7(35%), p < 0.01). CG showed an OR of 7.58(1.49–39.16) (p = 0.02) for the development of hyperglycaemia. There were no differences in LOS between groups (12(8.5) days vs 14(23) days, p = 0.19) or in the death rate (10(37%) vs 10(40%), p = 0.8), although differences were found in terms of oral route recovery (EG: 11(44%) patients vs CG: 5(18.5%) patients, p = 0.04) (OR (EG): 5.53(1.25–24.47); p = 0.02).

Conclusions

The use of a diabetes-specific enteral formula in non-diabetic patients admitted with acute stroke reduced the risk of developing hyperglycaemia and improved the rate of oral route recovery.

Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT03422900.

The patients were randomised into two arms: an isocaloric isoprotein formula (control group (CG), 27 patients) vs a diabetes-specific formula (low glycaemic index carbohydrates, fibre (80% soluble) and higher lipid content) (experimental group (EG), 25 patients). Pre-EN blood glucose, hyperglycaemia during EN treatment, HbA1c, insulin use, oral route recovery, length of stay (LOS) and mortality at 30days were collected. The complications of enteral nutrition during admission were collected as well.

Results

52 patients were included, 50% females, with an age of 77.44(11.48)years; 34 (65.4%) had ischaemic stroke, with a Rankin score of 0(0–2), and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 19 (15–22). In CG, there were more cases of hyperglycaemia on the 5th day post-NE (13(65%) vs7(35%), p < 0.01). CG showed an OR of 7.58(1.49–39.16) (p = 0.02) for the development of hyperglycaemia. There were no differences in LOS between groups (12(8.5)days vs 14(23)days, p = 0.19) or in the death rate (10(37%) vs 10(40%), p = 0.8), although differences were found in terms of oral route recovery (EG: 11(44%) patients vs CG: 5(18.5%) patients, p = 0.04) (OR (EG): 5.53(1.25–24.47); p = 0.02).

Conclusions

The use of a diabetes-specific enteral formula in non-diabetic patients admitted with acute stroke reduced the risk of developing hyperglycaemia and improved the rate of oral route recovery. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT03422900.

### Differences in resource utilization between patients with diabetes receiving glycemia-targeted specialized nutrition vs standard nutrition formulas in U.S. hospitals [^112M8y88]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of the study was to compare patient outcomes and costs for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) receiving glycemia-targeted specialized nutrition (GTSN) with similar patients receiving standard nutrition (STDN) formulas during acute care hospitalizations.

Research Design and Methods

The study was designed as a retrospective analysis over a 10-year period (2000–2009) of clinical and cost data from 125,000 hospital inpatient episodes in the Premier Research Database. Patients received either GTSN or STDN, by tube or orally, as a component of comprehensive care for hyperglycemia in patients with DM. To adjust for potential cohort imbalances, GTSN patients were matched with STDN patients on the basis of propensity scores, adjusting for many characteristics, including age, sex, race, All Patient Refined Diagnosis-Related Group (APR-DRG) illness severity, APR-DRG mortality risk, and comorbidities.

Results

Tube-fed patients with DM who were provided GTSN had a 0.88-day (95% confidence interval, 0.73–1.02) shorter length of hospital stay (LOS) on average compared with those patients provided STDN. Orally fed patients with DM who were provided GTSN had a 0.17-day (95% CI, 0.14–0.21) shorter LOS than did those patients provided STDN. The shorter LOS associated with GTSN contributed to a cost savings of $2586 for tube-fed patients and $1356 for orally fed patients.

Conclusions

The use of GTSN feeding formulas for patients with DM in acute care hospital settings was associated with reduced LOS and inpatient hospital episode cost in comparison to STDN.

### Tube feeding with a diabetes-specific enteral formula improves glycemic control in severe acute ischemic stroke patients [^113ihELD]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Glycemic control is essential for managing acute stroke. This study evaluated the impact of a diabetes-specific formula (DSF) on glycemic control in severe acute ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

A randomized, prospective controlled trial was conducted in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Acute ischemic stroke patients who scored > 10 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale as well as had swallowing problems were randomized to group A, which received a diabetes-specific enteral formula, and group B, which received a standard formula. Glycemic parameters were assessed at baseline and 7 days after admission.

Results

One hundred four patients were enrolled in the study (group A, 53; group B, 51). Postprandial glucose parameters, including capillary glucose concentration from 8 hours to 16 hours after enteral nutrition (EN) consumption, incremental areas under the curve (iAUC 0–16 h), peak value, and mean glucose concentration, were significantly lower in group A than in group B following a 7-day intervention period. Moreover, changes in HOMA IR after the 7-day treatment were significantly higher in group A than in group B. No significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability parameters, or nutrition parameters was found between the 2 groups, either at baseline or after treatment. There were no serious adverse events observed during the study.

Conclusion

A diabetes-specific formula may improve acute-term glycemic control in severe acute ischemic stroke patients.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^113gJpUQ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of a specific-diabetic formula in non-diabetic patients with stroke and complete enteral nutrition by a nasogastric tube showed a lower development of hyperglycaemia episodes compared to an isocaloric isoprotein formula. The use of a diabetes-specific formula produced lower venous and capillary glycaemia compared to the control formula.

In patients treated with a diabetes-specific formula, there was an increased recovery of the oral route, which could be related to the less frequent development of hyperglycaemia. No differences between groups were observed in the mean hospital stay, readmissions or percentage of deaths.

It is necessary to develop new studies on the use of diabetes-specific formulas in non-diabetic patients to assess clinical outcomes of the nutritional intervention. The effect of glycaemic control in patients without diabetes treated with a diabetes-specific formula may help to create some lines of investigation into the effect of glycaemic control using the new continuous glucose monitoring devices. Also, given the results obtained for oral route recovery, it would be interesting to develop studies with this aim as a principal objective.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^112S6dXd]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

We hypothesized that repeated administration of nutrient boluses directly to the jejunum would promote weight loss. The aim of this pilot study was to ascertain the effect of a 14-day bolus jejunal feeding with MM and electrolyte solution (ES) on the body weight of ambulatory adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity. In order to achieve this aim, a simple modified enteral feeding tube-based device was devised, allowing participants to continue with their usual daily activities without the tube being evident to others, while self-administering nutrient several times a day. We also aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of using the modified tube to test the hypothesis.

We present here the first-in-human findings of the feasibility and safety of the prototype device as well as our experience evaluating the hypothesis that bolus jejunal feeding promotes weight loss.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^115LteDE]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Informed consent and blinding

Potential participants were provided with information and supplies in a manner that aimed to maximize safety and minimize risk of bias. Participants were informed that the main purpose of the study was to see if there was weight loss when people receive some of their daily nutritional requirements through a tube into the jejunum and that they might lose some weight. They were advised that they could see alterations in blood glucose level, including hypoglycemia, and that another purpose of the study was to gather information about how well people tolerated having a tube anchored in the mouth for 2 weeks. With respect to nutrients, there was no discussion as to the composition of the two treatments or hypothesized difference in response. Complete blinding of the participants by providing identical appearing tube feeds and containers was not feasible due to difficulty finding similar appearing nutrients of the desired composition and the preference to provide the feed in the original sealed container to minimize risk of contamination.

The investigators were not blinded to the treatment being administered; however, steps were taken to minimize the risk of bias. The research assistant was responsible for ascertaining randomization, preparing supplies, and assessment of the main outcome (weight), which was recorded automatically by the scale, usually with a dated printout of the value. The P. I. an endocrinologist, was responsible for participant safety, including monitoring of blood glucose levels, decisions on dosage adjustment, and withdrawal from the study. Although these duties may have been done without being aware of the assignment for this initial pilot study when the effect of long-term bolus nutrient administration was uncertain, it was considered safer for the P. I. not to be blinded to the type of study cycle.

### Glycemic and lipid control in hospitalized type 2 diabetic patients: evaluation of 2 enteral nutrition formulas (low carbohydrate-high monounsaturated fat vs high carbohydrate) [^111XXLsW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetic patients may need enteral nutrition support as part of their treatment. The objective was to compare glycemic and lipid control in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes requiring feeding via nasogastric tube using enteral feedings with either a highcarbohydrate or a high-monounsaturated-fat content.

Methods

This trial included type 2 diabetes patients admitted to the hospital for neurologic disorders or head and neck cancer surgery who received either a low-carbohydrate-high-mono-unsaturated-fat (Glucerna) or a high-carbohydrate diet (Precitene Diabet). Glycemic and lipid control was determined weekly. Safety and gastrointestinal tolerance were also assessed.

Results

A total of 104 patients were randomized and 63 were evaluable according to preestablished protocol criteria. Median duration of therapy was 13 days in both groups. Mean glucose was significantly increased at 7 days of treatment (p = .006) in the Precitene arm, with no significant variations in the Glucerna arm. Mean weekly blood triglycerides levels in the Precitene arm were increased without reaching statistical significance, whereas patients in the Glucerna arm showed a stable trend. Patients in the Precitene arm showed a significantly higher incidence of diarrhea than patients in Glucerna arm (p = .008), whereas the incidence of nausea was smaller in the Precitene arm than in the Glucerna arm (p = .03).

Conclusions

An enteral formula with lower carbohydrate and higher monounsaturated fat (Glucerna) has a neutral effect on glycemic control and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients compared with a high-carbohydrate and a lower-fat formula (Precitene Diabet).

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^112491Gh]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample size

In this pilot study, we anticipated a significantly greater weight loss in the MM arm with a sample size of ten participants per group, based on previous results with dietary restrictions of 5230 kJ (1250 kcal) for 1 week.

Interim analysis and stopping guidelines were not initially specified. The decision was made by the investigators to close the pilot trial after sufficient data were acquired for calculating effect sizes and parameter estimates for use in the design and power calculations of future studies with an improved device prototype.

Randomization was performed using an online random number generator, without blocking or restrictions. The statistician provided the randomization list to the research coordinator who prepared sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes. An envelope in the numbered set was only opened by the research coordinator after confirmation of tube placement. Participants, but not the research team, were blinded to the composition of the treatment as labels were removed from the original sealed bottles being provided. The bottles and contents for both arms did not look the same, but the hypothesized effects of different treatments were not discussed with participants. Weight was measured and recorded by the research assistant. Apart from treatment, all other aspects of each cycle were the same.

Statistical methods

For all enrolled participants, descriptive summary data, including mean (SD) for continuous variables, were summarized for select baseline demographic and clinical parameters, major events related to device use, and significant clinical events including adverse events. We used a general linear model to compare treatments for the primary outcome of 14-day weight change (days 0–14). Main effects at each cycle were specified for intervention (MM vs. ES), period (cycle 1 or 2), and randomized crossover sequence. A random term for subjects nested within sequence was also specified. The primary analysis reported the per-crossover protocol analysis of the first two randomized cycles. In the secondary analysis, the additional six MM cycles were added (a total of 18 cycles analyzed among the 6 participants). Secondary outcomes included weight change in the 28-day (days 0–28) and post 14-day (days 14–28) cycle. Paired t test was used to compare baseline and final measures in participants who underwent ≥ 2 cycles.

### Basal-bolus insulin regimen for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: a practical approach [^117PUwnk]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Prerequisites for Basal-Bolus Insulin Regimen

The following factors should be kept in mind before initiating a basal-bolus insulin regimen (ESM Table 1):
The patient should receive enteral nutrition per oral administration or via a feeding tube. The latter may be relevant for a patient emerging from or currently on ventilatory support. A regular diet plan should be followed, with a fixed number of calories and a fixed carbohydrate proportion for each major and minor meal (or major and minor feed). In the hospital setting, especially in the current COVID-19 scenario, very little support is likely to be available to assess the adequacy of teaching programmes aimed at educating the patient on carbohydrate counting; therefore, a meal with a fixed carbohydrate proportion should be the preferred option.
The patient should consume three major and three minor meals (or feeds) or three major and four minor meals (or feeds) (the latter option is preferred if the interval between lunch and dinner [or the second and third major feed] is large).
There should be a gap of at least 2 h between a major meal (or feed) and minor meal (or feed). This gap ensures that the release of prandial insulin is appropriate to match the post-meal rise in blood glucose and that there is no second unregulated wave of glucose release during this period.
Meal (or feed) timings (both major and minor) should be relatively fixed.

### Very high-protein and low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition formula and plasma glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover trial [^112Rxo7H]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

The crossover design, in which glucose and insulin responses to the two formulas were examined within same subjects, strengthens this study. The results of this study are limited by the fact that the subjects received a single bolus of 450 mL of formula. Although this design allowed us to observe the acute effect of the two formulas on glucose and insulin concentrations and is directly applicable to patients receiving bolus EN, it may not produce as dramatic results in patients receiving continuous EN.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that use of a very high protein, low carbohydrate formula is associated with a reduced glycemic response in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The formula may assist in improving blood glucose management in long term enterally fed subjects with type 2 diabetes. It is possible that the formula may also benefit other patients who require better blood glucose control that also have increased protein needs.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114Vxqzq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Enteral and parenteral nutrition insulin management — insulin orders should include coverage of basal, prandial, and correctional needs, and it is essential that people with type 1 diabetes continue to receive basal insulin even if fasting or feedings are discontinued. For nutrition coverage, the insulin dose may be calculated as 1 unit of insulin for every 10–15 g of carbohydrate, with options including NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) insulin two or three times daily (every 8 or 12 h) or regular insulin every 6 h; for nocturnal tube feeding, NPH insulin administered along with the initiation of feeding is a reasonable approach. In continuous parenteral nutrition, human regular insulin may be added to the solution, particularly if > 20 units of correctional insulin have been required in the past 24 h, with a starting dose of 1 unit of regular human insulin for every 10 g of dextrose adjusted daily. Because continuous enteral or parenteral nutrition produces a continuous postprandial state, efforts to bring blood glucose to below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) substantially increase hypoglycemia risk.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^112MbRyz]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/objectives

To ascertain the effect on body weight of 14 days of bolus enteral feeding with mixed meal (MM) and electrolyte solution (ES) in ambulatory adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and also the safety and feasibility of using a modified, intraorally anchored enteral feeding tube for this purpose.

Subjects/methods

We conducted a randomized, crossover pilot trial with 16 participants. A 140 cm, 8-French feeding tube was placed in the jejunum under electromagnetic guidance and anchored intraorally. Participants were randomized to self-administer 120 mL 523 kJ (125 kcal) MM, or 50 kJ (12 kcal) ES four times/day for 14 days. After ≥ 14 days without the tube, participants crossed over to the other treatment. The primary outcome compared weight change between treatments. Thereafter, participants could elect to undergo additional MM cycles. Participants were encouraged to continue with all usual activities including eating ad lib throughout the study.

Results

Ten participants withdrew prior to completing two randomized 14-day cycles (4 social, 3 intolerant of anchor, and 3 intolerant of tube). Six participants were assessed for the primary outcome and showed no significant difference in weight loss between MM and ES (p = 0.082). For the secondary outcome of within-group weight loss, average weight loss from baseline was significant for MM but not for ES: −2.40 kg (95% CI: −3.78, −1.02; p = 0.008) vs. −0.64 kg (95% CI: −2.01, 0.74; p = 0.27). A total of 23 2-week cycles were completed (12 paired, 2 unpaired, and 9 additional), with no significant adverse events for 334 days of tube use.

Conclusions

Repeated bolus nutrient administration via enteral feeding tube is associated with weight loss in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with no significant difference seen between MM and ES feeds. The prototype device was safe, but requires development for further investigation into the effect of bolus jejunal feeding on weight and to improve acceptability.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^114vRUSc]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The use of a high-protein diabetes-specific EN formula in hyperglycemic critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation leads to lower insulin requirements, reduces plasma and capillary blood glucose levels and glycemic variability, and could also reduce the risks of ICU-acquired ventilator-associated pneumonia and tracheobronchitis when compared with that of a standard high-protein formula. Similar findings were obtained for the use of another diabetes-specific formula of different composition.

Our results highlight the need for double-blind studies with glycemic variability as the primary endpoint in large critically ill patient populations to address the impacts of these enteral nutrition formulas on outcomes such as acquired infections, hospital stay and short- and medium-term mortality.

Managing Hyperglycemia During Inpatient Nutritional Support

Andjela Drincic, MD, FACP

University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA

Key ideas

Hyperglycemia during enteral (EN) and parenteral (PN) nutrition can be prevented/ameliorated by use of diabetes specific formulae in EN and decreasing the dextrose content to 150 to 200 g/day in PN.

Basal bolus principles of therapy where nutritional coverage can be calculated based on carbohydrate load can be applied in EN and PN therapy: in EN, the basal bolus ratio should be 40/60 to 50/50 (careful not to overbasal); in PN, adding regular insulin in a PN bag according to insulin dextrose ratio is appropriate.

Prevention of hypoglycemia with proactive order sets is crucial to ensure safety in case of nutrition interruption.

Summary

A significant percentage of patients receiving nutritional support experience hyperglycemia, with increased prevalence in patients receiving PN nutrition in comparison with patients receiving EN nutrition. Hyperglycemia can be prevented using lower concentrations of dextrose in PN and using a diabetes-specific formula in EN, which has been shown to improve mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes in the intensive care unit. Further issues may arise in treating hyperglycemia with EN if the tube feed is discontinued or if the rate is changed; proactive order sets must be prepared to ensure patient safety if this happens or if PN is interrupted. Future studies using continuous glucose monitoring should be conducted with the hope of creating accurate insulin-dosage calculators for widespread usage.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^111M58r9]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes-specific formulas have shown an improvement in glycaemic control and lipid control in patients with diabetes. In 2005, Elia et al. concluded that the use of diabetes-specific formulas in the short- and long-term was associated with better glycaemic control related to standard formulas. In 2019, Ojo et al. also showed better glycaemic control and an increase in HDL-cholesterol but no effect in other lipid parameters. In 2020, Sanz Paris et al. studied diabetes-specific formulas that are high in MUFAs and concluded that these formulas can improve glucose control and metabolic risk factors among patients with diabetes. Most of these studies are being developed in patients with diabetes and stress hyperglycaemia, but there are few studies that have compared diabetes-specific formulas with standard formulas in patients without diabetes.

In patients without diabetes who suffer a stroke, hyperglycaemia can be caused by several reasons: stress induced-hyperglycaemia, enteral nutrition, and acute treatments for stroke. As a result, medical nutrition therapy must be oriented to avoid this condition of hyperglycaemia. The use of diabetes-specific formulas in patients with stroke has shown an improvement in acute-term glycaemic control in severe acute ischaemic patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes and without diabetes. However, there is no evidence of the use of these formulas in patients with stroke and no diabetes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a diabetes-specific nutritional formula on the development of hyperglycaemia in non-diabetic inpatients with recent stroke who require complete enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube, as well as the effect of the use of this formula on the development of comorbidities, mortality and tolerance.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^114CmtX4]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

As strengths of this study, we should mention the idea that glycemic control can be modified using specific enteral nutrients in the critically ill patient; also the external validity of the methodology (prospective, blind-randomized, multicenter) and the generalizability of results. Its main limitations are that it was an open-label study, so some of its results (especially effects on infectious complications) need to be considered with caution. The use of capillary samples for blood glucose instead of arterial samples and use of the point-of-care glucose meter could be considered a further limitation. Consensus recommendations published in 2013 highlight the need to obtain arterial rather than capillary blood samples. This was selected as the standardized method by the researchers at the nine hospitals given it was logistically nonviable to collect arterial blood samples at the frequency necessary at two of the centers. However, regardless of the greater or lesser reliability of absolute glycemia values, the use of capillary samples should not affect the comparisons made between the three groups of patients. As a final limitation, the sample size precluded reaching conclusions on outcome measures (such as mortality) other than those related to glycemic or infection control.

Although the components of a diabetic-specific formula are important, no marked differences were observed in the impacts of the two such formulas examined here. Thus, to confirm the present findings and further examine EN effects on glycemic variability and mortality, we recommend comparing the latest-generation diabetes-specific formula with a standard formula in a multicenter, double-blind trial in a large patient sample.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^1166K4yg]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To ascertain the effect on body weight of 14 days of bolus enteral feeding with mixed meal (MM) and electrolyte solution (ES) in ambulatory adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and also the safety and feasibility of using a modified, intraorally anchored enteral feeding tube for this purpose.

Subjects/Methods

We conducted a randomized, crossover pilot trial with 16 participants. A 140cm, 8-French feeding tube was placed in the jejunum under electromagnetic guidance and anchored intraorally. Participants were randomized to self-administer 120mL 523kJ (125kcal) MM, or 50kJ (12kcal) ES four times/day for 14 days. After ≥ 14 days without the tube, participants crossed over to the other treatment. The primary outcome compared weight change between treatments. Thereafter, participants could elect to undergo additional MM cycles. Participants were encouraged to continue with all usual activities including eating ad lib throughout the study.

Results

Ten participants withdrew prior to completing two randomized 14-day cycles (4 social, 3 intolerant of anchor, and 3 intolerant of tube). Six participants were assessed for the primary outcome and showed no significant difference in weight loss between MM and ES (p = 0.082). For the secondary outcome of within-group weight loss, average weight loss from baseline was significant for MM but not for ES: -2.40kg (95% CI: -3.78, -1.02; p = 0.008) vs. -0.64kg (95% CI: -2.01, 0.74; p = 0.27). A total of 23 2-week cycles were completed (12 paired, 2 unpaired, and 9 additional), with no significant adverse events for 334 days of tube use.

Conclusions

Repeated bolus nutrient administration via enteral feeding tube is associated with weight loss in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with no significant difference seen between MM and ES feeds. The prototype device was safe, but requires development for further investigation into the effect of bolus jejunal feeding on weight and to improve acceptability.

### Decisions to be made when initiating enteral nutrition [^112rFWnw]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition support is preferred to parenteral or no nutritional support, but many patients who could benefit receive inadequate enteral feeding. Many decisions must be made before initiating enteral nutrition support; including if and when enteral nutrition should be started, which formula should be used, and how enteral nutrition support should be monitored. The gastroenterologist should be able to understand and evaluate these decisions in all patients potentially requiring nutritional support.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^112gc9he]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

We included individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, rather than obesity only, for two main reasons. First, given the relatively short duration of the treatments (2-week cycles), we considered that effects might be seen on glucose levels but not on weight. This hypothesis was based on studies suggesting weight-independent improvement in glucose early after intervention. Therefore, demonstration of this could provide support for further work on this important topic. Second, prior work had included adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes, hence we elected to continue with the same study population. Future studies should evaluate the effect of bolus jejunal feeding in individuals with obesity only.

The weight loss observed in this study occurred without any request to participants that they restrict their nutrient intake. Net weight loss occurred following administration of the ES selected as a "control" treatment. Jejunal distension may have led to some satiation with this treatment, consistent with reports of decreased ghrelin production with duodenal infusion of hyperosmolar saline. Continued weight loss in the 2 weeks after removal of the tube was noted in some participants, which may reflect persistent changes to the duodenal or jejunal mucosa, including in enteroendocrine cells and hormone production.

There were several major limitations to this study. The position of the tube tip was not confirmed after initial placement due to removal of the dual-access port which precluded reinsertion of the electromagnetic stylet. For proof-of-concept, the location of the tube tip should be confirmed after placement. It is certainly possible that some tubes could have coiled in the stomach, although expert opinion was that in ambulatory adults with no significant GI impairment, the tube would likely progress aborally due to usual peristaltic forces. In addition, adherence to nutrient administration was not formally evaluated. Thus, it is not known what amount of the prescribed treatment was actually delivered to the jejunum. Furthermore, medications were adjusted at the clinical discretion of the PI, which may have introduced bias to the results. Numerous desirable metrics were not collected. Future studies should evaluate food intake, gut hormones, appetite and gut sensations, and gut transit to understand the mechanisms of any intervention effects and improve on the technique. Safe and accurate monitoring of glucose levels will now be greatly facilitated by the wide availability of continuous glucose monitoring.

Screening of CF patients during continuous drip enteral feedings

Supplemental continuous drip feedings are commonly prescribed for malnourished CF patients. Although there are few data available specific to this situation, mid-feeding hyperglycemia may compromise efforts to gain weight. The Committee felt that glucose levels in the middle and immediately after the gastrostomy tube feeding should be measured in the hospital and at these same time points once a month at home using SMBG. SMBG levels are not sufficiently accurate to make a diagnosis of CFRD, and hyperglycemia detected by SMBG should be confirmed by laboratory plasma glucose measurement.

Screening for CFRD by measuring mid- and immediate postfeeding plasma glucose levels is recommended for CF patients on continuous enteral feedings, at the time of gastrostomy tube feeding initiation and then monthly at home. Elevated glucose levels detected by SMBG must be confirmed by a certified laboratory. (ADA-E; Consensus)

### Fibre-supplemented tube feeding in the hospitalised elderly [^116Q9mHD]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of fibre supplementation in enteral feeding on bowel function in hospitalised geriatric patients, and to assess its metabolic and nutritional efficiency.

Design

Prospective randomised controlled trial with stratification for diabetes.

Setting

Department of Geriatrics at the University of Antwerp.

Subjects

During 30 months (January 2000-June 2002) every hospitalised patient requiring tube feeding was assessed for eligibility (n = 183). Finally 172 patients (19% diabetics) were randomised.

Methods

An enteral nutritional regimen consisting of 30 kcal/kg in 2000 mL with a calorie/nitrogen ratio of 156 with or without fibre was instituted. At weekly intervals, stool output was qualitatively evaluated by recording frequency, volume (small < 1/2 cup, large > 1/2 cup) and consistency (solid-formed, soft-pasty or liquid-watery). Nutritional and metabolic effects were evaluated through laboratory analysis.

Results

Overall mortality was 24% with a trend for excess mortality in diabetic patients (33.3% versus 21.6% in non-diabetics; P = 0.176). There was no difference in duration of feeding between the fibre group (27.5 days; 95% CI = 19.1–35.9) and the no fibre group (27.9 days; 95% CI = 20.2–35.5). In the fibre-supplemented group, stool frequency was lower (4.1 per week; 95% CI = 3.7–4.6) than in controls (6.3 per week; 95% CI = 5.6–6.9). Qualitatively, stool consistency was higher (P < 0.001) but no difference in volume was noted. There were no differences in final laboratory parameters between groups.

Conclusions

Fibre supplementation improved bowel function with reduced stool frequency and more solid stool consistency. It did not affect the nutritional efficiency of enteral feeding in hospitalised geriatric patients. Diabetes may be a risk factor for mortality in malnourished patients requiring tube feeding.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^111VCLmX]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

Few studies have explored the possible benefits of diabetes-specific EN formulas in terms of controlling hyperglycemia, glucose variability and acquired infectious complications.
In our study, compared with a high-protein standard EN formula, a high-protein diabetes-specific formula reduced insulin requirements, glucose variability, and plasma and capillary glycemia in mechanically ventilated, hyperglycemic ICU patients.
Our results also point to beneficial impacts of such a formula on ICU-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis and pneumonia. However, further efforts in the form of larger clinical trials are required to assess the capacity of these formulas to reduce the risk of acquired infections in these patients.

### Very high-protein and low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition formula and plasma glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover trial [^116WTLX7]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Background and objectives

Standard enteral nutrition (EN) formulas can worsen hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. We hypothesized that altering the proportion of macronutrients in a formula; increasing protein while decreasing carbohydrate concentrations would improve glycemic response. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that an EN formula containing a very high concentration of protein (in the form of whey peptides) and low concentration of carbohydrate provide better control of postprandial blood glucose relative to a very high-protein/higher-carbohydrate formula.

Subjects and methods

This was a randomized crossover clinical trial of 12 ambulatory adult subjects with type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was glycemic response following a bolus of isocaloric amounts of two EN formulas; the secondary outcome was insulin response. Subjects were randomized to the experimental or the control formula, on two separate days, 5–7 days apart.

Results

Mean blood glucose concentrations at 10–180 min post-infusion and mean area under the curve for glucose over 240 min post-infusion were significantly lower with the experimental formula than with the control formula (71.99 ± 595.18 and 452.62 ± 351.38, respectively; p = 0.025). There were no significant differences in the mean insulin concentrations over time, insulinogenic indices, and first-phase insulin measurements.

Conclusions

An EN formula containing high-protein and low-carbohydrate loads can significantly improve glucose control in subjects with type 2 diabetes in ambulatory settings as evidenced by observed improved glucose control without significant difference in insulin response.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^115Ha1gE]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Administration protocol and formula composition

The study patients were started on EN through a nasogastric tube within 48 h of ICU admission. Enteral feeding was continued over 24 h each day and only interrupted for 8 h (from 12 p.m. to 8 a.m.) along with insulin infusion on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 to obtain samples for complete blood tests. Patients were managed by the responsible researchers at each center. Gastric residual volume (GRV) was measured every 6 h for the first 2 days and every 24 h thereafter until EN was stopped. All patients received 10 mg metoclopramide every 8 h only for the first 3 days.

Prescribed caloric intake was 25 kcal/kg/day. Nutritional requirements were calculated by the responsible researchers. It was ensured that patients received their calculated requirements in the first 48 h of EN. Non-nutritional caloric constituents like glucose or propofol were included in caloric balance calculations. Insulin was administered in saline solution at a 1:1 ratio by continuous infusion using a 50-mL syringe pump. The nursing staff adjusted the dose guided by capillary blood glucose levels using a sliding-scale algorithm and a point-of-care glucose meter following a consensus protocol for the nine participating centers (see Table S1 in Additional file 2).

Patients were randomized to receive one of three different nutrition formulas (Table 1). The two diabetes-specific formulas contain greater percentages of fat while the standard formula has a greater carbohydrate content and less fiber. The carbohydrates included in each formula are: low-dextrose-equivalent maltodextrin and type IV-resistant maltodextrin in the study formula; modified maltodextrin, fructose and maltitol in the control diabetes-specific formula; and maltodextrin and saccharose in the standard high-protein formula. The two specific formulas contain greater proportions of MUFA and the study diet also has higher ω-3, EPA and DHA contents. Due to their different caloric densities, formula volumes were calculated on the website to ensure patients received similar caloric and nitrogenous support.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^116tQWVe]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Critically ill patients show a stereotype metabolic response to injury that affects carbohydrate metabolism, causing hyperglycemia, which is boosted by the actions of counterregulatory hormones. This metabolic response makes the critically ill patient especially susceptible to infection and increases morbidity and mortality. The control of blood glucose levels and adequate nutritional support contribute to metabolic improvement and help reduce the risk of infection.

Glycemic variability (GV) has been independently associated with mortality and a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infection in critically ill patients. Accordingly, it has been proposed that this variability could be improved by modifying the composition of the standard enteral nutrition formula given to the patient. In an effort to avoid the detrimental consequences of hypoglycemia, many ICUs have elevated their targeted lower limits for glucose levels. However, to date no consensus has been reached on the optimal target glucose range.

Hyperglycemia in the ICU patient can be treated with exogenous insulin and by the enteral administration of diabetes-specific formulas. Although the use of standard enteral nutrition (EN) products is widely accepted, the benefits of disease-specific or modified standard enteral formulas for hospitalized patients with diabetes remain controversial. When used as short- to medium-term treatment, a standard high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet may compromise glycemic control. By modifying carbohydrate composition and adding monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and fiber, studies have shown improved glycemic control compared with a standard diet. However, few studies have examined the benefits of diabetes-specific formulas in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia.

We hypothesized that in the hyperglycemic, critically ill patient, the use of a diabetes-specific nutrition formula might serve to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infection. The aim of our study was to compare, in mechanically ventilated ICU patients with hyperglycemia, the use of three EN formulas: a standard EN formula, a widely used diabetes-specific formula and a new-generation diabetes-specific formula. This last formula contains high protein levels, MUFA, slowly absorbed carbohydrates, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and is enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and fiber.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^111KFAQa]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Study subjects

Patients with a first-ever ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, without history of diabetes mellitus, admitted to the Stroke Unit of our hospital were included in the study. The patients had complete dysphagia and required total enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube (for at least 7 days). The inclusion criteria were the start of enteral nutrition during the first 72 h after stroke and acceptance by the patient or their legal representative to participate in the study. The main reason to select 72 h was that there is no evidence of the use of early enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube could ameliorate the outcomes and if the patient has no dysphagia could be dangerous. We select 72 h to ensure the stability of patient and the protocol to confirm dysphagia in these patients in our hospital.

The exclusion criteria were enteral nutrition not feasible; severe gastrointestinal pathology; diagnosed diabetes mellitus; current glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) > 6.5%; allergy or intolerance to ingredients of the formula; pregnant women; patients who required an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay; previous neurodegenerative disease; and did not sign the informed consent.

Randomisation was done by a randomisation seed generated bywith a block assignation AABB, ABAB, ABBA, BAAB, BBAA and BABA.

The investigators were aware of the allocation sequence and treatment allocation. The trial personnel who worked in hospital plant only administrate the enteral nutrition prescribed by investigators. There was no blinding because it was a trial in real clinical practice with the formulas commonly used in the hospital. Nevertheless, the investigator who made the randomization is not involved in the clinical follow-up of the patient. This investigator informed the allocation of treatment to the physician of clinical nutrition services that prescribed the indicated treatment. This physician is not involved in data collection or analysis. At the end of the study the physician who had followed the patient in a multidisciplinary team delivered a report of variables to the investigator that includes it in the database. Another investigator took care of the data analysis. In this way, the investigator who collected and analyzed the variables was not the physician who followed the patient.

There was no predefined stopping rule. In the development of study, we have seen a better glycaemia evolution in patients with diabetes-specific formula. For this reason, we consider the primary outcome was solved and all patients could benefit from the use of diabetes-specific formula.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^116a9d7P]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Participant flow and feasibility

Recruitment for this study began in November 2014, and the study took place between November 2014 and February 2019, with the last follow-up visit in February 2019 (Fig. 1). Sixteen participants (10%) were enrolled from screening, and 12 were randomly assigned to cycle 1 treatment. Of these, six participants completed 28-day randomized cycles for both MM and ES, and were analyzed for the primary outcome. A total of 23.8 2-week cycles were completed for 334 days of tube placement. The trial ended due to the investigators' decision to improve the device prototype and protocol rigor with insights gained from the feasibility study prior to further evaluation.

Demographics and baseline clinical measures

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for all 16 participants who were randomized to the two-cycle study protocol are given in Table 1. Age range was from 24 to 58 years, and BMI from 30.4 to 92.5 kg/m 2. All participants were Hispanic. There were 3 men and 13 women. Six participants were taking only oral antidiabetic agents, while ten were also taking insulin.

Table 1
Demographics and baseline characteristics for all enrolled participants.

Safety

There were no significant clinical or device-related adverse events reported throughout the study, including the 334 days of tube use. Minor discomfort related to the oral anchor was the most frequently reported concern. Participants were inconsistent with providing glucose readings, and flash glucose monitoring was used for only a few cycles with incomplete data collection. No participant reported or was noted to have any episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and no significant adverse events were noted related to glucose control.

Device

Device-related adverse events for each participant including all harms and unintended effects are given in Table 2. Two tubes were removed the day of initial placement and one after 5 days, due to poor tolerance. Eight of the nine participants who had the tube placed for ≥ 1 day tolerated it well, and six elected to participate in multiple 14-day cycles of use. Several participants reported episodes of difficulty administering treatment. They generally overcame this problem themselves by partially withdrawing the tube and reinserting it as advised, and they became more confident in adjusting the tube position in second and later cycles. On several occasions, the participants removed the tube themselves without incident and with rapid relief of any associated problems.

Results

Out of 17 subjects screened, 5 were screen failures, and 12 were randomized into the trial. Twelve subjects completed the trial and were included in the analyses. No adverse events occurred during the course of the study. The subjects had mean age of 56 ± 7.5 years (range 20–75 years) and 50% were female. There were six Caucasians, three African Americans, two Hispanics, and one subject reported other race. The mean BMI was 33.5 ± 5.5, and ten (83%), eight (67%), and nine (75%) subjects had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and were receiving metformin, respectively (Table 2).

Blood glucose response to the formulas

The change in glucose concentrations from baseline over 240 min for each formula are illustrated in Fig. 1a. The mean blood glucose concentrations for the experimental and the control formulas were 7.58 ± 2.09 and 7.20 ± 1.66 mmol/l, respectively, and were comparable at baseline (p = 0.48). Compared to the baseline (0 min), there was a significant increase in blood glucose concentrations within 10 min in response to a dietary challenge with the control formula (adjusted p < 0.005), which lasted until 150 min. In contrast, only moderate increases in blood glucose concentrations from baseline occurred at 30 min with experimental formula (adjusted p = 0.009), with no further increase in blood glucose across time. Between the formulas, the increase in blood glucose was significantly lower when the subjects were given the experimental formula compared to the control formula across eight time points from 10 to 180 min (p < 0.05). Blood glucose returned to the baseline level at 180 min with control formula (adjusted p > 0.1), and were no longer significantly different between the two formulas at 210 and 240 min (p > 0.05). The minimum and maximum of the mean glucose concentrations (mmol/l) for the experimental formula were smaller than those of the control formulas over the course of the trial [(6.48 ± 2.41, 9.00 ± 1.71) and (6.90 ± 2.79, 10.78 ± 2.47), respectively].

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^112cZayb]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN Safe Practices for Enteral Nutrition Therapy — clinical considerations during transition highlight timing of oral attempts, positioning, cognitive fluctuations, dysphagia support, patient-dependent timelines, and glycemic safety. Oral ingestion is best attempted when the stomach is not full, continuous feedings can be modified to intermittent to stimulate hunger cycles, and ideally intermittent feedings are tolerated before an oral diet is attempted. When attempting oral feedings, patients should be fully upright and alert; for fluctuating mental status, feed when alertness is maximal, and return to oral intake may only involve attempts at 1 or 2 meals per day. If swallowing difficulties are present, a speech-language pathologist can recommend appropriate food types and textures. The total time to wean is patient dependent and not all patients share the goal of weaning to oral nutrition. Abrupt discontinuation predisposes to hypoglycemia if insulin is not adjusted; a reduction in infusion rate without insulin adjustment was the second most common cause for hypoglycemia in a retrospective study, and close monitoring of glycemic control in patients transitioning from enteral to oral diet is critical to prevent sentinel events.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^114eUiGb]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although standard enteral nutrition is universally accepted, the use of disease-specific formulas for hyperglycemic patients is still controversial. This study examines whether a high-protein diabetes-specific formula reduces insulin needs, improves glycemic control and reduces ICU-acquired infection in critically ill, hyperglycemic patients on mechanical ventilation (MV).

Methods

This was a prospective, open-label, randomized (web-based, blinded) study conducted at nine Spanish ICUs. The patient groups established according to the high-protein formula received were: group A, new-generation diabetes-specific formula; group B, standard control formula; group C, control diabetes-specific formula. Inclusion criteria were: expected enteral nutrition ≥ 5 days, MV, baseline glucose > 126 mg/dL on admission or > 200 mg/dL in the first 48 h. Exclusion criteria were: APACHE II ≤ 10, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal or hepatic failure, treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or lipid-lowering drugs and body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m 2. The targeted glucose level was 110–150 mg/dL. Glycemic variability was calculated as the standard deviation, glycemic lability index and coefficient of variation. Acquired infections were recorded using published consensus criteria for critically ill patients. Data analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Over a 2-year period, 157 patients were consecutively enrolled (A 52, B 53 and C 52). Compared with the standard control formula, the new formula gave rise to lower insulin requirement (19.1 ± 13.1 vs. 23.7 ± 40.1 IU/day, p < 0.05), plasma glucose (138.6 ± 39.1 vs. 146.1 ± 49.9 mg/dL, p < 0.01) and capillary blood glucose (146.1 ± 45.8 vs. 155.3 ± 63.6 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Compared with the control diabetes-specific formula, only capillary glucose levels were significantly reduced (146.1 ± 45.8 vs. 150.1 ± 41.9, p < 0.01). Both specific formulas reduced capillary glucose on ICU day 1 (p < 0.01), glucose variability in the first week (p < 0.05), and incidences of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (p < 0.01) or pneumonia (p < 0.05) compared with the standard formula. No effects of the nutrition formula were produced on hospital stay or mortality.

Conclusions

In these high-risk ICU patients, both diabetes-specific formulas lowered insulin requirements, improved glycemic control and reduced the risk of acquired infections relative to the standard formula. Compared with the control-specific formula, the new-generation formula also improved capillary glycemia.

### Effect of bolus enteral tube feeding on body weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes: a feasibility pilot randomized trial [^113SP69i]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of administering repeated enteral boluses of nutrients in a minimally invasive, secure, and unobtrusive manner via a novel modified orojejunal feeding tube. We also aimed to evaluate for the first time, the effect of repeated jejunal boluses on weight in ambulatory adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We observed significant weight loss from beginning to end of MM administration, but no significant difference in weight change with ingestion of higher calorie MM and lower calories ES treatments, with no significant differences between interventions.

The technique used has low feasibility for widespread adoption. Only a small proportion of participants screened for participation completed this pilot study, as also reported by other researchers when conducting pilot trials of novel weight-loss devices. However, the lessons learned from this pilot study can be used to significantly improve recruitment and retention rates going forward. For example, self-referral in response to flyers and discussing participation with individuals already actively seeking weight loss was more successful than approaching participants based on medical criteria. The absence of any adverse events in almost a year of device use suggests that BMI, age, and medical eligibility criteria may be broadened, with the frequency of study visits decreased. Furthermore, populations obtaining routine dental healthcare and younger individuals without diabetes-related periodontal disease or tooth loss will have a higher chance of meeting dental eligibility requirements. Within the study, the proactive use of orthodontic wax was found to reduce mucosal irritation by the dental anchor and increased successful participation in the study. Apprehension in participants regarding tube use can be reduced by extensive pre-procedure discussion, allowing participants to become used to the anchor prior to tube placement, and by the use of a low-calorie initial test feed to minimize any dumping symptoms. Although we did not use any analgesia during tube placement, this may also allow for easier tube placement in some participants.

### Dietary intakes in adult patients with cystic fibrosis – do they achieve guidelines? [^111yHcEk]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) require a higher energy and protein intake than their healthy peer group. There are few data on dietary intakes of adult patients. The aim of this study was to determine nutritional intakes in an adult population with CF. The impact of nutritional intervention and disease on macronutrient intake was examined.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 94 unweighed food diaries at annual review (1995–2000). Energy and protein intakes were compared to the estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy and reference nutrient intake (RNI) for protein. The effect of diet alone, oral supplements, enteral tube feeding, and cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), on macronutrient intake was examined and impact of pancreatic sufficency (PS) and lung transplantation.

Results

Mean energy and protein intakes approached recommended CF guidelines, but in 72% of assessments these values were not achieved. Mean energy and protein intakes for patients on diet alone and protein intake for those with CFRD failed to meet recommendations. Oral supplementation and enteral tube feeding regimens increased energy and protein intake above recommended levels. No group achieved 40% total energy from fat. Patients receiving enteral tube feeds had the highest mean energy and protein intakes but lowest body mass index (BMI) and lung function.

Conclusion

Adequate mean energy and protein intakes in adult patients with CF mask subgroups of patients who fail to meet recommendations ie. diet alone, diabetic. Oral supplementation and enteral tube feeding increase energy and protein intake but fail to achieve an adequate BMI level in subjects with a decreased clinical status. Individual nutritional assessment remains essential.

### Pathways to quality inpatient management of hyperglycemia and diabetes: a call to action [^115qMUZF]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Glycemic control in special clinical populations

A) Patients receiving enteral and parenteral nutrition.

Enteral and parenteral nutrition pose major challenges for glucose management in the hospital. These nutritional approaches frequently result in hyperglycemia, even in patients without a history of diabetes. The resultant hyperglycemia has been associated with poor outcomes. However, scheduled subcutaneous insulin may be difficult to implement safely because of frequent planned and unplanned interruptions and titration of the nutritional source. In the case of enteral nutrition, a small randomized clinical study demonstrated that subcutaneous basal insulin is more effective than correction dosing alone. Another study had suggested that the use of premixed 70/30 insulin twice or three times daily may be safer than the use of long-acting insulin in patients on continuous tube feeding. It is unclear whether approaches such as scheduled short-acting insulin may be equally safe and efficacious because studies of other potential approaches have not been published. In the case of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), no randomized controlled trials comparing various approaches to insulin therapy are available, although retrospective data suggest that the addition of insulin in the TPN bag provides good control with less hypoglycemia than the use of intravenous insulin or subcutaneous insulin alone.

Suggested future directions.

Comparative effectiveness RCTs are needed to compare several approaches to insulin management on intermediary glycemic, clinical, and economic outcomes for patients receiving continuous enteral nutrition and TPN. For either nutritional approach, a computerized intravenous insulin algorithm or noninsulin agents, such as incretin-based therapies, may provide safer or more effective alternatives, but very few data are available. Therefore, comparative effectiveness RCTs comparing the effect of insulin-based to incretin-based therapies on glycemic and clinical outcomes are needed for this population.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^113gsuAa]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

The main strength of the study is the type of study as a randomised controlled trial with two different enteral formula. Otherwise, the population selected, as the use of a diabetes-specific formula has mainly been studied in patients with diagnosed diabetes and its prescription in patients with a risk of development of hyperglycaemia has a lack of evidence. On the other hand, in addition to the reported effect on glycaemia, differences were observed in outcome variables such as recovery of the oral route in those fed with the specific formula for diabetes, a condition that could be studied in subsequent trials and well-designed trials.

The main limitations of the study were the different type of stroke studied that could interfere with the results. However, as we have adjusted multivariable analysis with this condition, the type of stroke seems not to influence the main objective of the study on glycaemic control and secondary outcomes as oral route recovery. Another limitation was that the calculated sample size was 150 patients, but the study had to be stopped at 60 because it had accomplished the primary aim, and we could not continue due to ethical considerations. We think that more striking results on p -value must be a better guarantee for reducing possible false positive results. Nevertheless, the use of diabetes-specific formulas has a long experience in control hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients in critic and non-critic condition. There is less experience in non-diabetic patients but as we can see in these patients, the behaviour was similar in glycaemia, and we see secondary aims as oral route recovery in patients with an adequate control of glucose metabolism. These two reasons lead us to plant the use of a more specific formula in all patients. On the other hand, there was no blinding due to the use of usual formulas of the hospital in real clinical practice; we think that these characteristics did not influence the trial result because the use of diabetic enteral formulas is clear in patients with diabetes, but this not so clear in patients with diagnosed diabetes. On the other hand, the separation between investigators who allocated patients to the different groups of study and the physicians that followed the patients in their clinical route avoid the possible bias of not blinding the study.

### Diabetes-specific enteral nutrition formula in hyperglycemic, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients: a prospective, open-label, blind-randomized, multicenter study [^115Jy2DN]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that a diabetes-specific high-protein EN formula containing MUFA, slowly absorbed carbohydrates and omega-3 PUFA enriched with EPA, DHA and fiber gives rise to better glycemic homeostasis than a standard high-protein formula and may also reduce the risk of acquired infections in ICU patients.

When comparing the diabetes-specific study formula (A) with a widely used diabetes-specific formula of different composition (C), the only significant difference found was a lower mean capillary blood glucose level in patients given the study formula.

The similar 28-day and 6-month mortality rates recorded for the three treatment groups could be related to an insufficient sample size for comparing these endpoints. No effects of the different formulas were produced on insulin resistance or sensitivity determined using the HOMA2 calculator.

Glycemic control

Continuous insulin infusion protocols help to maintain plasma glucose levels within recommended ranges. However, consistent with our findings, numerous studies have shown that insulin requirements and plasma and capillary blood glucose levels can be reduced using a diabetes-specific EN formula as an adjuvant to insulin (Table 4). It therefore seems that the composition of these formulas, both in quantitative terms (smaller percentages of carbohydrates and higher fat percentages) and qualitative terms (including modified carbohydrates and MUFA, EPA and DHA), helps reduce insulin requirements, and this also reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. No prior studies in critical patients have compared enteral feeding formulas with similar protein and fat contents but different carbohydrate sources and levels such that we cannot attribute the better blood glucose control observed here to the carbohydrate supply provided by the formula. Notwithstanding, recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of this type of formula and indicate a need for further studies.

For some years, GV has been associated with outcome in the critically ill patient. Thus, in a cohort of 7049 critical patients, Egi et al. observed a greater GV in patients who died than in survivors. Similarly, Hermanides et al. in 5728 critical patients, found a significant relationship between GV, measured as mean absolute glucose, and the likelihood of ICU death. In addition, Krinsley et al. in an international, multicenter cohort study conducted in 44,964 patients, noted that greater GV was independently associated with increased mortality in critical patients with no prior diabetes.

These studies on GV, however, failed to address the nutritional support or, in many cases, the amount of insulin administered to the patients. Thus, it is worth asking what influence these diabetes-specific formulas could have in controlling both hyperglycemia and GV.

Alish et al. reported lower GV based on the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) in noncritically ill patients with diabetes who were administered a diabetes-specific formula than in those administered a standard formula. These results are in agreement with those of our study (Table 4) indicating similarly lower glucose variability for the diabetes-specific study and control formulas versus the standard formula, both in the first week of ICU stay and for 28 days of follow-up. In the first 7 days of ICU stay, stress hypermetabolism is at its maximum and its adequate control can impact short-term outcomes in critically ill patients. In our patients, greatest differences among treatment groups were detected in MCG on the first ICU day and in GV and CV during the first ICU week. Given the important role of GV in critically ill patient outcomes, we recommend the use of such specific formulas in hyperglycemic ICU patients, at least during the first week of ICU stay.

### Effect of a diabetes-specific formula in non-diabetic inpatients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^116hUuw6]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Dysphagia is a frequent complication after a stroke. A recent study has estimated that it occurs in > 20% of stroke patients and persists in > 50%. The severity of the stroke, more than the location, is what determines the appearance of dysphagia. Dysphagia deteriorates nutritional status and increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia in > 20% of patients, which causes death in 20% of patients in the year following the stroke. In our study, patients in the interventional group had an increased probability (OR: 5.53) of recovery of the oral route. As seen in recent studies, the development of hyperglycaemia is related to non-recovery of the oral route in these patients. An intervention which avoid the increase of glycaemia can improve the dysphagia. Our trial shows that the diabetes-specific formula produces a lower rate of hyperglycaemia and, therefore, greater recovery from the oral route. However, it is necessary to design studies directed to study the oral route recovery to better assess the effect of the control of glycaemia and the use of a diabetes-specific formula.

There were no significant differences in the percentage of deaths in both groups. Hospital mortality due to stroke has decreased from 1970–2008 from 35.9%–19.8%. Some of the factors associated with an increased risk of mortality after a stroke are the following: age, the initial severity of the stroke, gender, race, previous functional status, hyperthermia, hyperglycaemia, high or low blood pressure and previous cardiovascular diseases. In our trial, mortality was higher, around 40%, due to the extension of stroke that involved the ability to swallow, and the advanced age (77 years) of the patients included in the study. The need for a nasogastric tube is usually linked to a greater clinical severity and/or to the development of severe clinical complications. There were no differences between groups, although there was better glycaemic control in the experimental group.

Enteral nutrition (EN) monitoring and reassessment — Practice recommendations specify to "Assess nutrition risk of the patient receiving EN throughout the patient's therapy", to "Provide regular documentation of patient reassessment — typically, daily and/or weekly. Monitoring of nutrition status may be more frequent than documentation of reassessment", and to schedule follow-up such that "Reassess the tube-fed patient in institutionalized long-term care at least monthly" and "Reassess the home tube-fed patient at least quarterly". The rationale notes timing and aspiration precautions, stating "EN intolerance will likely be noted within the first 3 days of initiation, if at all" and advising "elevating the HOB to at least 30° to 45° during and after tube feeding".

### The great debate: medicine or surgery: what is best for the patient with type 2 diabetes? [^115iLbyq]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The study of enterohormonal changes after different bariatric surgeries and how these relate to metabolic change and sustained weight loss is an emerging field. Among the best studied enterohormones is ghrelin, which is synthesized in the stomach. Concentrations increase before meals and stimulate appetite, participating in the initiation of feeding. Specific dietary lipids may serve as substrates for acylation of ghrelin, which modify its activity, thereby providing a mechanism for communication between nutrient availability and metabolic status. With diet-induced weight loss ghrelin concentrations increase, driving appetite and promoting weight regain. In contrast, after RYGB ghrelin levels decrease, contributing to reduced food seeking activity and promoting sustained weight loss. At the same time, peptides produced postprandially from the-cells of the ileum, including GLP-1, peptide YY, and oxyntomodulin, all increase, likely because of early nutrient delivery to the ileum and neuronal mechanisms. All of these peptides have been associated with satiation, likely further contributing to sustained weight loss. These changes are not seen with LABG or diet-induced weight loss. Some of these enterohormonal changes, including increased GLP-1, may promote pancreatic islet regeneration or maintenance of mass or function. Expression of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1, an early and essential transcription factor in the β-cell lineage, and bromodeoxyuridine (a synthetic thymidine analog that gets incorporated into a cell's DNA when the cell is dividing) uptake into β-cells are both increased after RYGB, supporting positive islet effects. However, whether there is increased islet mass or function after gastric bypass remains highly controversial. Very recent feeding tube case reports suggest that the route of nutrient delivery seems to be a primary and potentially reversible event in eliciting this enteroendocrine and β-cell response.

### Basal versus sliding-scale regular insulin in hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia during enteral nutrition therapy [^115oeiAW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Standard enteral formulas reflect the reference values for macro- and micronutrients for a healthy population. Most standard formulas contain whole protein, lipid in the form of long-chain triglycerides, and fiber. Most diabetes-specific enteral formulas comply with this rule in two different ways: standard formulas provide low amounts of lipids (30% of total calories) combined with a high supply of complex carbohydrates (55–60% of total calories), most of these being starch, possibly containing fructose; newer diabetic formulas have replaced part of carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids (up to 35% of total calories) and may include dietary fiber. A number of outpatient and inpatient studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes have reported better glycemic control (lower mean, fasting, and/or postprandial glucose levels), a trend toward decreased A1C levels, and lower insulin requirements with low-carbohydrate high–monounsaturated fatty acid (LCHM) formulas compared with standard high-carbohydrate formulas. Based on these results, it is generally accepted that newer diabetic enteral formulas (LCHM) are preferable to standard high-carbohydrate formulas in hospitalized patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Hyperglycemia is a common complication of enteral nutrition therapy reported in up to one-third of adult patients in the hospital and in up to one-half of elderly patients in long-term services. Increasing evidence indicates that the development of hyperglycemia during acute medical or surgical illness is not a physiological or benign condition but is a marker of poor clinical outcome and mortality. Insulin, given either intravenously as a continuous infusion or subcutaneously, is the most effective agent for immediate control of hyperglycemia in the hospital. In the critical care setting, continuous insulin infusion has been shown to be effective in achieving glycemic control. In general medicine and surgery services, however, few studies have focused on the optimal management of hyperglycemia during enteral nutrition therapy. Several clinical reviews and small uncontrolled studies recommend a variety of subcutaneous regimens including the administration of regular insulin (every 4–6 h), NPH insulin (every 8–12 h), or once- or twice-daily insulin glargine.

ABM Clinical Protocol #27 — scope and background for breastfeeding infants or young children with insulin-dependent diabetes states that these protocols serve only as guidelines and that variations in treatment may be appropriate to individual needs; it aims to provide guidance on insulin dosing based on carbohydrate intake for breastfeeding infants, assessing carbohydrate in expressed breast milk, dosing for small-volume frequent feeds, goals and methods for glycemic control in breastfeeding infants and young children, and counseling/support to continue breastfeeding after diagnosis. Background notes that the incidence of type 1 diabetes has been rising overall, with about 4% of patients being diagnosed younger than the age of 2 years, that diabetes diagnosed in neonates and young infants is more likely to be of the monogenic form (usually diagnosed before 9 months of age), and that for diabetes requiring insulin the same principles are used for both types of diabetes in infants.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding initiation timing — practice recommendations state to use a PEG tube for feedings within several hours of placement, and "current literature supports ≤ 4 hours in adults and children". Clinicians should also educate providers on the appropriate timing of use of the PEG tube postprocedure and review procedural documentation for time of PEG insertion. As context, tube feedings have traditionally been delayed to the next day and up to 24 hours after the procedure, with no consensus regarding initiation after placement.

Endogenous insulin production

The change in insulin concentration from baseline over 240 min by formulas are shown in Fig. 1b and are characterized by significant variations between individuals. The mean insulin concentrations were not statistically different at baseline between the formulas (11.4 ± 7.2 and 9.2 ± 6.8 µIU/ml for experimental and control, respectively; p = 0.23). There was a trend towards lower average endogenous insulin production in response to the experimental group over time (10–240 min) when compared to the control group (p > 0.1). The minimum and maximum of the mean insulin (µIU/ml) for the experimental and the control formulas were (11.4 ± 7.2, 34.9 ± 26.0) and (9.2 ± 6.8, 64.2 ± 81.6), respectively. The mean insulinogenic indices for the experimental and the control formulas were 10.9 ± 12 and 6.6 ± 10.4, and the mean first-phase insulin measures (AUC 0–30 min) were 244.6 ± 227.6 and 521.5 ± 749.3, respectively. There were no significant difference between the formulas for these outcomes (p = 0.15; p = 0.23, respectively; data not shown).

Section 8. Medication delivery via enteral access devices — Medication administration through an enteral access device (EAD) "can be much more complex than it would seem", and "The vast majority of medications are not formulated to be administered through a feeding tube", so "it may be advisable to have a pharmacist review medication orders and the preparation of medications for administration via EAD". It is essential that a necessary medication is "appropriately prepared and administered through a feeding tube without increasing the risk for complications in the patient", since "Complications include impairing the patency of the feeding tube, reducing therapeutic effect of the medication, or increasing drug toxicity", and "some medications can pose a hazard to the healthcare provider". For process clarity, "Preparation pertains to the retrieval of a medication from the container and any alteration to a dosage form to make it suitable for delivery through a feeding tube", with alteration "as simple as diluting a liquid medication prior to administration or as complex as compounding a new formulation from multiple components, including the active pharmaceutical ingredient", while "The administration step involves the timing of drug delivery to the patient's GI tract with respect to flushing protocols, other medications, and the EN regimen".

### Facilitators and barriers to establishing lactation among women with diabetes? [^111fbd7v]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Diabetes in pregnancy includes gestational diabetes (GDM), type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Women with diabetes report challenges establishing breastfeeding due to delayed lactogenesis ll, hypoglycaemia, separation of mother and infant, and maternal self‐efficacy challenges.
The early feeding period is emotionally challenging for women with diabetes; mothers require consistent evidence‐based information where they are supported with early and responsive feeding practices, avoidance of commercial formula milk unless medically indicated and breastfeeding solutions to breastfeeding problems.
Women with diabetes who choose to breastfeed require individualised person‐centred lactation care plans to maximise their opportunity to experience a successful breastfeeding journey. This will support best clinical practice within the multidisciplinary healthcare team.

### Guidelines for gastrostomy tube placement and enteral nutrition in patients with severe, refractory hypoglycemia after gastric bypass [^1114u6p1]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postbariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) affects up to 38% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients. Severe cases are refractory to diet and medications. Surgical treatments including bypass reversal and pancreatectomy are highly morbid and hypoglycemia often recurs. We have developed a highly effective method of treatment by which enteral nutrition administered through a gastrostomy (G) tube placed in the remnant stomach replaces oral diet: if done correctly this reverses hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, yielding substantial health and quality of life benefits for severely affected patients.

Objectives

To provide clinical guidelines for placement of a G-tube to treat postRYGB hypoglycemia, including candidate selection, preoperative evaluation, surgical considerations, and post-RYGB management.

Setting

Stanford University Hospital and Clinics.

Methods

Based on our relatively large experience with placing and managing G-tubes for PBH treatment, an interdisciplinary task force developed guidelines for practitioners.

Results

A team approach (endocrinologist, dietitian, surgeon, psychologist) is recommended. Appropriate candidates have a history of RYGB, severe hypoglycemia refractory to medical-nutrition therapy, and significantly affected quality of life. Preoperative requirements include education and expectation setting, determination of initial enteral feeding program, and establishing service with a home enteral provider. Close postoperative follow-up is needed to ensure success and may require adjustments in formula and mode/rate of delivery to optimize tolerance and meet nutritional goals. G-tube nutrition must fully replace oral nutrition to prevent hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

G-tube placement in the remnant stomach represents a relatively well-tolerated and effective treatment for severe, refractory hypoglycemia after RYGB.

### Glycaemic management during the inpatient enteral feeding of people with stroke and diabetes [^112ffYBJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This paper is an abridged and modified version of guidelines produced by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for inpatient care on glycaemic management during the enteral feeding of people with stroke and diabetes. These were revised in 2017 and have been adapted specifically for Diabetic Medicine. The full version can be found at: www.diabetes.org.uk/joint-british-diabetes-society or https://abcd.care/joint-british-diabetes-societies-jbds-inpatient-care-group. Many people have both diabetes and an acute stroke, and a stanv dard approach to the management of people with stroke is the provision of adequate nutrition. Frequently, this involves a period of enteral feeding if there is impaired ability to swallow food safely. There is currently considerable variability in the management of people with diabetes fed enterally after a stroke, and the evidence base guiding diabetes management in this clinical situation is very weak, although poor glycaemic outcomes in people receiving enteral feeding after stroke may worsen recovery and cause harm. The aim of this document is to provide sensible clinical guidance in this area, written by a multidisciplinary team; this guideline had input from diabetes specialist nurses, diabetologists, dietitians, stroke physicians and pharmacists with expertise in this area, and from UK professional organizations. It is aimed at multidisciplinary teams managing people with stroke and diabetes who require enteral feeding. We recognize that there is limited clinical evidence in this area.

Enteral nutrition (EN) formula classification and labeling — policy guidance is as follows: An EN formula that contains nonhydrolyzed macronutrients intended for those with normal digestive function can be generically identified as "standard", whereas hydrolyzed macronutrient formulas for malabsorptive disorders can be identified as "peptide-based" or "elemental", and higher fat/fiber content to assist glycemic control can be identified as "carbohydrate controlled". Facilities should develop policies and procedures regarding patient-specific EN formula labels that can be affixed to EN administration containers, ensure labels contain all elements in the same sequence as the original EN order, and determine whether labels present all nutrients or only macronutrients and select micronutrients.

### Fully closed-loop insulin delivery in inpatients receiving nutritional support: a two-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^114vaa54]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nutritional support with enteral or parenteral nutrition is an important component of medical care. Hyperglycaemia is common in patients receiving nutritional support in non-critical care, occurring in up to half of those receiving parenteral nutrition and in a third of those receiving enteral nutrition. The carbohydrate content of nutritional support can exacerbate other causes of hyperglycaemia in hospital inpatients, such as metabolic responses to acute illness and medications that alter insulin sensitivity (eg, glucocorticoids).

Hyperglycaemia occurring in inpatients receiving parenteral or enteral nutrition, with or without a history of diabetes, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Observational studies, have shown that the risks of infection, cardiac complications, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and mortality increase as mean blood glucose increases in patients receiving parenteral nutrition.

Clinical practice guidelines for inpatient glucose management in non-critical care have been proposed, but implementation in patients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition is particularly challenging. Unanticipated dislodgement of feeding tubes, temporary discontinuation of nutrition because of nausea or for administration of medication or diagnostic testing, and cycling of nutritional support with oral intake all necessitate a high level of vigilance among health-care professionals, including frequent blood glucose monitoring, regular adjustment of insulin doses, and pre-emptive administration of carbohydrates to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Glucose management in this population is associated with a substantially increased workload for ward staff, and fear of hypoglycaemia often leads to suboptimal glycaemic control.

Instruct the patient or caregiver:

To read the Instructions for Use for appropriate preparation and administration instructions on oral versus feeding tube administration.
Before administration, to mix DOJOLVI thoroughly into semi-solid food/liquid (oral) or medical food/formula (feeding tube) at mealtimes or with snacks.
To not prepare or administer DOJOLVI using containers, oral syringes, or measuring cups made of polystyrene or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics.
That if a dose is missed, to take the next dose as soon as possible with subsequent doses taken at 3 to 4-hour intervals. Skip the missed dose if it will not be possible to take all doses in a day [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Storage

Instruct the patient or caregiver to store DOJOLVI at room temperature in the bottle in which it was dispensed [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

Feeding Tube Dysfunction

Advise the patient or caregiver to regularly monitor the feeding tube for proper functioning and integrity and report to the healthcare provider if any issues are identified [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Intestinal Malabsorption in Patients with Pancreatic Insufficiency

Rationale — tube size, route, and formulation selection for medication via EAD: tubes with an internal diameter equal to or greater than 10 Fr work best for administering crushed or dissolved solid dosage medications, whereas if the tube is less than 10 Fr, the medication must be in a liquid formulation with few, if any, residual solids. For a jejunal feeding tube, the API should be fully dissolved and prepared in a vehicle with a final osmolality of approximately 285 mOsm/L, while liquid medications administered to the stomach and macronutrient-based enteral formulas have a higher osmolality of approximately 500 mOsm/L; in some cases, acid is added to enhance solubilization and in other cases sodium bicarbonate is added to remove the medication's enteric coating and allow dissolution. Ordering risks are highlighted: it is troubling how few CPOE systems allow for selecting the specific feeding tube route, and the practice of using "PO" with special instructions in a free text field can contribute to error.

### Very high-protein and low-carbohydrate enteral nutrition formula and plasma glucose control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover trial [^114U9SLE]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that the differences in macronutrient composition, specifically carbohydrate, protein, and fat, in EN formula can exert a significant metabolic effect on blood glucose levels of subjects with type 2 diabetes. The experimental and the control formulas tested in the current study contain very high amounts of protein, providing 37 and 35% of total calories, respectively (Table 1). The improved glycemic response observed in this study is most likely due to a reduction in glycemic load, whereby carbohydrate is replaced by increasing protein and fat concentrations. However, there may be an additional explanations for the significant difference in glucose control. In particular, the type of protein in the two formulas varies. The experimental formula contains hydrolyzed protein sourced from 100% whey. Whey has been associated with an increased release of insulin and lower blood sugar levels. There are several potential mechanisms for this proposed possible insulinotropic effect of whey. The higher leucine content appears to stimulate insulin secretion through the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Whey stimulates an increase in incretin hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1)which in turn may delay gastric emptying. Additionally, inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV by whey derived bioactive peptidesleads to increased half-lives of GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. There is also a potential effect of MCT on glycemic control. Furthermore, fish oil may also play a key role in increasing adiponectin resulting in improved insulin sensitivity. The experimental formula did contain a very small amount of fiber, however the presence or absence of two grams of fiber in the formulas was an unlikely cause of the differential glucose responses as consumption of larger amount of fructooligosaccharides for extended periods did not affect fasting blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes as shown by Alles.

Blenderized tube feeding (BTF) safety rationale and storage guidance emphasize that home-prepared BTFs have a higher risk of cross-contamination and potential for foodborne illness than commercial enteral nutrition products, and once prepared the BTF should be immediately used or immediately refrigerated at appropriate temperatures; given the potential for infection associated with foodborne illness, BTF may not be appropriate among medically unstable or immunocompromised patients or those without a mature feeding tube site; BTF should not be held at room temperature for more than 2 hours and refrigerated BTF formula not used within 24 hours of formulation should be discarded; there may be an increased risk of tube occlusion with BTFs given their high viscosity, and BTFs are not recommended for patients with a feeding tube smaller than 14 French.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 159 consecutive ICU patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were initially recruited. Two patients were excluded because of incorrect randomization (one group A, one group C) leaving a study population of 157 patients (52 group A, 53 group B, 52 group C) (Fig. 1). Fifteen patients did not complete the minimum of 5 days of treatment, but all 157 were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The three patient groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics (Table 2).

Enrollment, randomization and follow-up of the study participants. TPN total parenteral nutrition, SPN supplementary parenteral nutrition, EN enteral nutrition. a Three deaths, one withdrawal by patient, one withdrawal by doctor, one change of diet. b Two deaths, one withdrawal by doctor, one change of diet, one infusion interrupted > 48 h. c Two deaths, one change of diet, one infusion interrupted > 48 hours

Nutrition onset was targeted for within 24 h of ICU admission. Median values for EN onset after ICU admission in hours were 23.4 (18.1–27.2), 25.1 (19.6–26.2) and 26.7 (21.3–28) for groups A, B and C, respectively (Table 2).

The calorie and protein intake values provided in Table 3 indicate isocaloric and isonitrogenous intakes across the three groups, with no differences in effective volume. The mean volume ratio was approximately 80% of the prescribed ratio. Despite differences in fiber, carbohydrate and lipid intake arising from the different formula compositions, total intakes were within recommended limits. Propofol 2% was administered in the first 7 days of ICU stay in six group A, seven group B, and five group C patients.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^1129Miki]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteral feeding tube medication orders and preparation — safe practice steps are specified as follows: Evaluate factors related to the medication and its dosage form, identify the route (oral vs enteral) and the distal site of drug administration, and develop real-time communications to inform the pharmacy of changes. Confirm enteral medication orders with the prescriber and nurse, ensuring the dosage form is appropriate for enteral feeding tube administration (ie, immediate release), 'Avoid any solid dosage form medications that would result in a significant change in the absorption of the active ingredient(s) if opened (capsule) or crushed (tablet)', and 'Evaluate each medication for its inherent solubility and release characteristics'. Verify the drug and formulation are appropriate for the distal end of the feeding tube, 'Avoid bypassing the primary site of absorption' and 'Avoid high-osmolality or highly viscous preparations'. Identify orders requiring preparation steps (eg, crushing, diluting, mixing) and 'Establish and follow organizational policies and procedures to prepare medications for enteral administration that will comply with USP chapter < 795 > '. Document in the EHR clarifications or interventions for patients receiving EN, and work with CPOE vendors and application architects so each medication is ordered by the appropriately intended route of administration.

ASPEN safe practices — enteral medication preparation and administration through an EAD — include several directives. Use available liquid dosage forms only if they are appropriate for enteral administration, and if liquid dosage forms are inappropriate or unavailable, substitute only immediate-release solid dosage forms. Prepare immediate-release solids per pharmacist instructions by crushing simple compressed tablets to a fine powder and mixing with purified water or opening hard gelatin capsules and mixing the powder with purified water. Use only appropriate instruments to measure and prepare enteral medication. Use only clean enteral syringes (≥ 20 mL with ENFit device) to administer medication through an EAD. Provide tube irrigation around dosing: prior to administering medication, stop the feeding and flush the tube with at least 15 mL water, then flush the tube again with at least 15 mL water, repeat with the next medication, and flush the tube one final time with at least 15 mL water. Restart enteral feeding in a timely manner, and hold the feeding by 30 minutes or more only if separation is indicated to avoid altered drug bioavailability. Consult with an adult or pediatric pharmacist for patients who receive medications coadministered with enteral nutrition (EN).

### Newer components of enteral formulas [^113iGB4B]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a paradigm shift in the goals of nutritional care from basic delivery of macronutrient calories to the provision of specific nutrients, which, in addition to supporting growth, have health and disease modulating effects. The appreciation of the central role of nutrition in heath and disease may lead to increased use of a new array of diets that are more specific for underlying health and disease pathophysiologic processes. An improved understanding of disease-specific pathophysiology, and limited but promising data from ongoing clinical trials, are fueling this positive change. Therefore, a greater understanding of rationale for the newer products may lead to improved nutritional and clinical care during health and disease.

### The effect of different nutritional feeds on the postprandial glucose response in healthy volunteers and patients with type II diabetes [^117Ps5B4]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Assessment of postprandial glycaemic response to four nutritional feeds with different macronutrient and fibre composition.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, crossover study.

Setting

University of Maastricht, the Netherlands.

Subjects

A total of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with type II diabetes.

Interventions

Subjects received 200 kcal of four enteral nutrition products (two standard products and two diabetes-specific products). Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose were measured for 2 h. Peak glucose level and area under the curve were calculated.

Results

In healthy volunteers and diabetic patients, the feed with a low carbohydrate (CHO), high monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and high fibre content significantly decreased peak glucose concentration and area under the curve compared to the feeds with standard composition.

Conclusions

Special feeds with a low CHO, high MUFA and high fibre content improve glycaemic balance and therefore should be considered in diabetic patients who are in need of nutritional support.

Enteral nutrition (EN) home education — program design and delivery considerations emphasize that effective patient and caregiver education is an integral part of discharge for patients going home on EN and can start soon after the decision is made to transition a patient, and that inadequate initial EN education and follow-up have been reported as challenges associated with EN at home. Institutions need guidelines, protocols, and policies for the safe provision of EN and procedures for ensuring a safe discharge to home on EN, and home care and supply companies should continue this process after discharge; when possible, it is advisable to provide training for more than 1 person on all aspects of tube care and feeding management, and essential components include training on feeding tube and access site care, preparation and administration of formula, medication administration, enteral pump operation, monitoring and troubleshooting complications, and emergency plan and contact information. Thompson et al have emphasized the need for clinicians to evaluate the effectiveness of their EN education process, provide comprehensive EN education and patient resources, proceed over more than 1 educational session, and prepare patients and caregivers to resolve foreseeable problems such as tube occlusion and dislodgement, skin care issues, and psychosocial challenges. Flexibility within feeding regimens may alleviate stress and has the potential to improve the impact of EN on quality of life; simplifying the EN regimen, minimizing the infusion time, and providing an ambulatory pump or feeding tube that best fits the patient's physical and lifestyle needs may help reduce EN-associated life disruptions. For some patients with gastrostomy tubes, transition to home may be made easier by employing the syringe/bolus feeding method, and feedings are ideally scheduled to fit as conveniently as possible with the patient's home and/or work routine; another opportunity is to refer the patient to a support group or organization specific to the disease or therapy the patient is experiencing. The most effective methods will take into account the individual's specific learning styles and provide visual demonstration and reinforcement with graphics, video, online tutorials, nutrition education handouts, or other approaches that best suit the learner, and language and health literacy are factors to consider in the instruction process.

9.6 Situations associated with an increased risk for new onset

Gestational diabetes can develop earlier in pregnancy in PwCF compared to those at risk for T2DM with prevalence rates ranging from 11% to 36%.OGTT screening for preexisting diabetes should be done before or immediately after the onset of pregnancy, and screening for gestational diabetes is recommended at the end of both the first and second trimesters.

Additional high‐risk situations in which increased glucose monitoring (by SMBG and/or CGM) is recommended include pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospital admissions for intravenous antibiotics, initiation of gastrostomy tube feedings, use of systemic glucocorticoids, and organ transplantation. Recommendations are to monitor fasting and 2‐h post‐prandial glucose levels for the first 48 h of hospitalization. A diagnosis of CFRD is confirmed when fasting BG ≥ 126 mg/dl (≥ 7 mmol/L) or 2‐h postprandial BG ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) are detected and persist for at least 48 h, with 2 or more elevated BGL values. PwCF on enteral feeds should be screened with mid‐ and immediate post‐feeding BGLs at the time of initiation of gastrostomy tube feedings and then monthly. CFRD is diagnosed when mid‐ or post‐feeding BGLs are ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) on 2 separate days. Given the importance of maintaining glucose values in target range for transplant outcomes, CFRD screening with an OGTT is recommended in the 6 months prior to transplant. Post‐transplant, immediate close bedside BGL monitoring is important, particularly given the increased risk of diabetes with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents. It is recommended to verify elevations captured by SMBG with plasma glucose measurements.

### Association between enteral carboxymethyllysine intake and daily glycemic variability in critically ill adults: a retrospective cohort study [^114xmnv2]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Hyperglycemia is prevalent in critically ill patients, and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. At present, insulin forms the primary therapeutic strategy to mitigate hyperglycemia; however, it is not without risks. Administration of insulin leads to an increase in hypoglycemic episodes and greater glycemic variability, both of which are associated with increased mortality. Hence, maintaining the fine balance of glycemic control with insulin is particularly challenging in this group of individuals.

These risks could be mitigated through alternate approaches to blood glucose management, such as modifying the composition of nutrition formula administered via a feeding tube that patients usually receive as a routine part of their clinical care. It has been demonstrated that reduced‐carbohydrate formulae result in less insulin administered and improve overall blood glucose control measured as reduced mean blood glucose, reduced glucose variability, and greater percentage of blood glucose levels in range.

In addition to this, altering the macronutrient composition of a nutrition formula can impact the content of advanced glycation end‐product (AGE) present and delivered to people. AGEs are products of biochemical reactions between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids. They commonly exist in dietary formulaebut can also be produced endogenously, including in response to hyperglycemia, inflammation, and other stress‐related pathway activation — all of which are commonly present in critical illness. It is now postulated that ingested nutrition exacerbates circulating AGE burden.

The circulating and tissue AGE pool, made up of both endogenous and exogenous AGEs, has implications for glycemic control and inflammation. In otherwise healthy people increasing dietary AGEs has been shown to reduce insulin sensitivity, whereas decreasing dietary AGEs can improve insulin sensitivity in people with early type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through binding to the receptor for AGEs (RAGEs), AGEs also exacerbate and sustain inflammatory responses. Given that most AGEs, including carboxymethyllysine, carboxyethyllysine, and methylglyoxal‐derived hydroimidazolone, are excreted from the body via renal clearance, patients with reduced kidney function have greater AGE accumulation.

### Enteral feeding [^115UArzf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) is an established modality of nutritional support that has received wide acceptance. However, it is not clear in which conditions does it improve patient outcome and the best way to optimize its delivery. In this review, articles addressing the outcome of patients and methods to optimize delivery of EN are reviewed. With few exceptions, however, most studies are based on few patients or do not have a placebo arm. The usual comparison is against total parenteral nutrition and, in such comparisons, the studies fail to make the two groups comparable in terms of energy intake and the occurrence of a major risk factor for sepsis, namely hyperglycemia.

### First aid glucose administration routes for symptomatic hypoglycaemia [^116B1ZwL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoglycaemia is a common occurrence in people with diabetes but can also result from an imbalance in glucose homeostasis in the absence of diabetes. The best enteral route for glucose administration for suspected hypoglycaemia in a first aid situation is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of first aid glucose administration by any route appropriate for use by first-aid providers (buccal, sublingual, oral, rectal) for symptomatic hypoglycaemia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL as well as grey literature (records identified in the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and the EU Clinical Trials Register) up to July 2018. We searched reference lists of included studies retrieved by the above searches.

Selection Criteria

We included studies involving adults and children with documented or suspected hypoglycaemia as well as healthy volunteers, in which glucose was administered by any enteral route appropriate for use by first-aid providers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated trials for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias in the randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and the 'risk of bias In non-randomised studies of interventions' (ROBINS-I) tool, in addition to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions recommendations on cross-over studies, for the non-RCTs. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. All data on glucose concentrations were converted to mg/dL. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing data.

Main Results

From 6394 references, we included four studies evaluating 77 participants, including two RCTs, studying children and adults with hypoglycaemia, respectively, and two non-RCTs with healthy volunteers. The studies included three different routes of glucose administration (sublingual, buccal and a combination of oral and buccal administration). All studies had a high risk of bias in one or more 'Risk of bias' domain. Glucose administration by the sublingual route, in the form of table sugar under the tongue, resulted in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with the oral route in the very specific setting of children with hypoglycaemia and symptoms of concomitant malaria or respiratory tract infection (MD 17 mg/dL, 95% CI 4.4 to 29.6; P = 0.008; 1 study; 42 participants; very low-quality evidence). Resolution of hypoglycaemia at 80 minutes may favour sublingual administration (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.54; P = 0.006; 1 study; 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but no substantial difference could be demonstrated at 20 minutes (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.74; P = 0.16; 1 study; 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A decrease in the time to resolution of hypoglycaemia was found in favour of sublingual administration (MD -51.5 min, 95% CI -58 to -45; P < 0.001; 1 study; 42 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported in either group. No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, and treatment delay. Glucose administered by the buccal route in one study resulted in a lower plasma glucose concentration after 20 minutes compared with oral administration (MD -14.4 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.5 to -11.4 for an imputed within-participants correlation coefficient of 0.9; P < 0.001; 1 trial; 16 participants; very low-quality evidence). In another study there were fewer participants with increased blood glucose at 20 minutes favouring oral glucose (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.98; P = 0.05; 1 study; 7 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for resolution of symptoms and time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay. For the combined oral and buccal mucosal route (in the form of a dextrose gel) the MD was -15.3 mg/dL, 95%CI -33.6 to 3; P = 0.09; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-quality evidence. No improvement was identified for either route in the resolution of symptoms at 20 minutes or less following glucose administration (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; P = 0.08; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for time to resolution of symptoms, resolution of hypoglycaemia and time to resolution of hypoglycaemia, adverse events, and treatment delay.

Authors' Conclusions

When providing first aid to individuals with hypoglycaemia, oral glucose administration results in a higher blood glucose concentrations after 20 minutes when compared with buccal administration of glucose. A difference in plasma glucose concentration could not be demonstrated, when administering a dextrose gel, defined as "a combined oral and buccal mucosal route" compared to oral administration of a glucose tablet or solution. In the specific population of children with concomitant malaria and respiratory illness, sublingual sugar results in a higher blood glucose concentration after 20 minutes when compared with oral administration. These results need to be interpreted cautiously because our confidence in the body of evidence is very low due to the low number of participants and studies as well as methodological deficiencies in the included studies.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^112V8Hth]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

EAD patency — Background and management highlights state that tube occlusion is a common cause of enteral feeding failure with an incidence as frequent as 23%–35%, and in most cases it delays administration of nutrition support and medications. Research supports water as the best choice for initial declogging efforts; flushing a tube with water is an easy and often effective first step. The use of cranberry juice and carbonated beverages may worsen occlusions because of the acidic pH of these fluids, as acid can cause proteins in enteral formula to precipitate within the tube, making the clog worse or leading to more clogging later on. If water does not work, a pancreatic enzyme solution, an enzymatic declogging kit, or mechanical devices for clearing feeding tubes are second-line options.
