## Question

What are the clinical consequences of coxsackie B?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical consequences of coxsackievirus B infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the virology and transmission to anchor pathogenesis. Then, I should categorize clinical manifestations by organ system and severity. Next, I will examine high-risk populations and outcomes, followed by mechanisms of disease. After that, I should review diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Finally, I will synthesize the overall burden and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the virologic context and transmission, because this shapes the clinical spectrum. Coxsackievirus B (CVB1–6) are non-enveloped, positive-sense RNA enteroviruses in species B, transmitted primarily via fecal–oral and respiratory routes, with evidence for transplacental transmission and potential bloodborne spread, which explains multiorgan tropism and neonatal vulnerability [^115bapuf] [^111MXBAV].

> I will now examine cardiovascular disease, since this is a hallmark of CVB. Wait, let me verify the burden and mechanisms. CVB accounts for roughly 20–40% of myocarditis/cardiomyopathy in children and young adults, with CVB3 and CVB5 most frequently implicated, and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy is well described; fulminant myocarditis can be rapidly fatal, whereas some patients recover but later develop chronic cardiomyopathy, reflecting both direct viral cytotoxicity and immune-mediated injury, including molecular mimicry and persistent viral RNA in the myocardium [^113X8Hta] [^113EnFKg] [^113rZ4nZ].

> Next, I should review central nervous system involvement, and I need to ensure I distinguish frequency from severity. CVB are leading causes of aseptic meningitis and can cause encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and rhombencephalitis; outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported across ages, with neonates and young children at highest risk, and long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae including epilepsy and neurocognitive impairment have been documented, with some associations to later psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia after neonatal infection [^111VLVzX] [^116j168H] [^113LGa95].

> Hold on, I should verify the endocrine consequences, especially type 1 diabetes, because this is a major chronic outcome. Persistent CVB infection in pancreatic islets and ducts has been strongly associated with islet autoimmunity and progression to clinical T1D in prospective cohorts; CVB1 in particular has been linked to increased risk of β-cell autoimmunity, and CVB vaccines are entering trials to test causality and prevention, though the human evidence remains largely observational and mechanistic data are compelling but not definitive [^114QSJi3] [^115j4DSK] [^1174p6h4].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal disease, and I should double-check the classic entity. Epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) presents with spasmodic chest or abdominal wall pain and fever; CVB are the principal cause, though other enteroviruses can contribute, and isolated myositis with rhabdomyolysis has been reported, particularly in children, reflecting viral myotropism and immune-mediated injury [^1163JsPi] [^113vEDrH].

> I need to check gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations, especially in neonates. CVB can cause gastroenteritis and, more critically, neonatal hepatitis with coagulopathy and liver failure; CVB3 is especially prominent in severe neonatal hepatitis series, and fulminant cases show hepatocellular necrosis with DIC, underscoring the need for early recognition and supportive care [^116UJj2b] [^111DzVZh].

> But wait, what about genitourinary involvement; I should confirm whether this is direct or post-infectious. CVB have been detected in testicular tissue and semen in orchitis/epididymitis, suggesting direct infection, and hemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported in association with CVB, though causality remains uncertain; these manifestations are less common but clinically relevant in the right context [^114MQXMJ].

> Next, I should review respiratory disease, and I must be careful not to overstate frequency. Although CVB are not classic respiratory pathogens, pneumonia and pleural effusion have been documented, including adult cases with lung involvement, indicating that lower respiratory tract disease, while uncommon, is a recognized manifestation in severe or atypical presentations [^113gzDGR].

> I will now examine special populations and outcomes, because this is where morbidity and mortality concentrate. Neonates are uniquely vulnerable: severe CVB disease presents within the first week of life with sepsis-like illness, myocarditis, hepatitis, and CNS involvement, with mortality around 30% overall and higher in myocarditis; early IVIG and supportive care, including ECMO, are commonly used, and pleconaril showed signal for improved survival in a small randomized trial, though antivirals remain investigational [^117J54iK] [^113CU4Qq] [^114Ln7p6].

> Let me think about mechanisms, because they explain the breadth of disease. Direct viral cytotoxicity in target organs, persistent infection with low-level replication, and immune-mediated injury including molecular mimicry and autoimmunity are all implicated; in the heart and pancreas, both viral persistence and autoimmune attack can drive chronic disease, while in the CNS, immune activation may contribute to acute injury and long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae [^113X8Hta] [^114QSJi3] [^116j168H].

> I should confirm diagnostic and therapeutic implications, since management hinges on suspicion and testing. PCR is the cornerstone for detecting CVB in blood, stool, respiratory samples, and CSF, with faster turnaround than culture; in neonates, early enterovirus testing in sepsis-like presentations can avert unnecessary antibiotics and expedite supportive care, and although IVIG is widely used, evidence is largely observational, while antivirals such as pleconaril and pocapavir have shown signals of benefit in small studies but are not routinely available outside trials [^116VGm4Y] [^111yhHXy] [^113CU4Qq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prevention; I should verify vaccine prospects. Multivalent CVB vaccines are in preclinical and early clinical development, with NOD mouse data showing prevention of CVB-accelerated diabetes without disease induction, supporting the biological plausibility of vaccination to modify T1D risk, but human efficacy and safety remain to be proven [^113i3Fzw] [^114okGnP].

> Let me synthesize the overall burden and clinical consequences. CVB infections span a continuum from mild, self-limited febrile illness to severe multiorgan disease, with the most consequential outcomes being myocarditis/cardiomyopathy, CNS infection with neurodevelopmental sequelae, and T1D as a chronic autoimmune sequela; neonates face disproportionate risk of fulminant disease and death, and persistent infection with immune dysregulation appears to underlie several chronic conditions, making CVB a major, underrecognized contributor to pediatric and young adult morbidity [^113X8Hta] [^111VLVzX] [^114QSJi3] [^117J54iK].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit: CVB are cardiotropic, neurotropic, and diabetogenic enteroviruses that cause acute and chronic disease across organ systems, with the highest stakes in neonates and in the development of T1D; early recognition, appropriate diagnostics, and supportive care reduce harm, and ongoing research into vaccines and antivirals may shift the prevention landscape if safety and efficacy are confirmed [^115pThrq] [^114okGnP] [^117J54iK].

Coxsackie B viruses cause a broad spectrum of disease, from **mild febrile illness** to **life-threatening organ failure** [^115pThrq]. The most significant consequences are **myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy** [^113X8Hta], which can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death [^113EnFKg], and **aseptic meningitis and encephalitis**, with risk of seizures, coma, and long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae [^111VLVzX] [^113LGa95]. Other major outcomes include **pancreatitis and type 1 diabetes** via persistent β-cell infection and autoimmunity [^114QSJi3] [^114okGnP], and severe neonatal disease with hepatitis, coagulopathy, and multiorgan failure [^111DzVZh] [^117J54iK]. Less common but important complications include pleurodynia, orchitis, and ocular disease [^1163JsPi] [^114MQXMJ]. Severity is highest in neonates, the immunocompromised, and those with cardiac disease; **early diagnosis and supportive care** are critical, and antivirals or IVIG may be considered in severe cases [^113CU4Qq] [^111yhHXy].

---

## Cardiac manifestations

- **Myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy**: Coxsackie B is a leading cause of viral myocarditis, especially in children and young adults, and can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death [^113X8Hta] [^113EnFKg].

- **Pericarditis**: Often accompanies myocarditis, causing chest pain and effusions [^notfound].

- **Fulminant myocarditis**: Rapid-onset severe heart failure requiring ICU care and mechanical support [^113rZ4nZ].

---

## Neurological manifestations

- **Aseptic meningitis and encephalitis**: Common in children; can cause seizures, coma, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment [^111VLVzX] [^113LGa95].

- **Acute flaccid paralysis**: Rare but serious, resembling poliomyelitis [^112nWfAB].

- **Post-encephalitic sequelae**: Chronic neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment and movement disorders [^111VLVzX].

---

## Pancreatic and endocrine manifestations

Pancreatitis is an **acute inflammatory complication** of Coxsackie B infection [^115j4DSK]. Persistent Coxsackie B infection in pancreatic β-cells is strongly linked to islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes, particularly with CVB1 and CVB3 [^114QSJi3] [^1174p6h4].

---

## Neonatal and infant disease

- **Severe systemic disease**: Neonates are at high risk for fulminant hepatitis, coagulopathy, myocarditis, and multiorgan failure; mortality is 30–50% [^111DzVZh] [^117J54iK].

- **Transplacental transmission**: Can cause congenital infection with severe fetal and neonatal disease [^116jdpvc].

- **Early-onset disease**: Symptoms within the first week of life correlate with higher severity and mortality [^114Ln7p6].

---

## Musculoskeletal manifestations

Pleurodynia (**Bornholm disease**) presents with severe spasmodic chest or abdominal wall pain and fever [^1163JsPi]. Myositis with **rhabdomyolysis** is rare but can cause acute kidney injury [^113vEDrH].

---

## Other clinical consequences

- **Orchitis and epididymitis**: Direct viral infection of testicular tissue, occasionally persistent [^114MQXMJ].

- **Ocular disease**: Conjunctivitis, keratitis, and rare retinal vasculitis with vision loss [^112xwznB].

- **Erythema multiforme**: Immune-mediated mucocutaneous reactions [^116SS1Tf].

---

## Risk factors for severe disease

Risk factors include **neonates and infants** due to immature immunity and high vulnerability to severe disease [^117J54iK]. Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of severe, persistent, or disseminated infection [^116DYCj4]. Pre-existing cardiac disease heightens susceptibility to myocarditis and cardiomyopathy [^notfound].

---

## Long-term sequelae

Long-term sequelae include **chronic heart failure** from myocarditis progressing to dilated cardiomyopathy [^113X8Hta]. Neurological impairment may manifest as cognitive deficits, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders [^113LGa95]. Permanent insulin dependence can result from autoimmune β-cell destruction leading to type 1 diabetes [^114QSJi3].

---

## Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations

Diagnosis relies on **PCR** for viral RNA in blood, stool, CSF, or tissue, and on **serology** for IgM/IgG detection [^116VGm4Y]. Management is supportive, with **IVIG** and antivirals (e.g. pleconaril) considered in severe cases, particularly in neonates [^113CU4Qq] [^117J54iK]. Early recognition and aggressive supportive care are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^111yhHXy].

---

Coxsackie B viruses cause a wide range of disease, with **myocarditis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, and severe neonatal disease** carrying the highest morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis, supportive care, and selective use of IVIG or antivirals are key to improving outcomes [^115pThrq].

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^1111ECkN]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Coxsackieviruses-induced infections, particularly in infants and young children, are one of the most important public health issues in low- and middle-income countries, where the surveillance system varies substantially, and these manifestations have been disregarded. They are widespread throughout the world and are responsible for a broad spectrum of human diseases, from mildly symptomatic conditions to severe acute and chronic disorders. Coxsackieviruses (CV) have been found to have 27 identified genotypes, with overlaps in clinical phenotypes between genotypes. In this review, we present a concise overview of the most recent studies and findings of coxsackieviruses-associated disorders, along with epidemiological data that provides comprehensive details on the distribution, variability, and clinical manifestations of different CV types. We also highlight the significant roles that CV infections play in the emergence of neurodegenerative illnesses and their effects on neurocognition. The current role of CVs in oncolytic virotherapy is also mentioned. This review provides readers with a better understanding of coxsackieviruses-associated disorders and pointing the impact that CV infections can have on different organs with variable pathogenicity. A deeper knowledge of these infections could have implications in designing current surveillance and prevention strategies related to severe CVs-caused infections, as well as encourage studies to identify the emergence of more pathogenic types and the etiology of the most common and most severe disorders associated with coxsackievirus infection.

### Combating coxsackievirus B infections [^115pThrq]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Coxsackieviruses B (CVB) are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. They are common worldwide and cause a wide variety of human diseases ranging from those having relatively mild symptoms to severe acute and chronic pathologies such as cardiomyopathy and type 1 diabetes. The development of safe and effective strategies to combat these viruses remains a challenge. The present review outlines current approaches to control CVB infections and associated diseases. Various drugs targeting viral or host proteins involved in viral replication as well as vaccines have been developed and shown potential to prevent or combat CVB infections in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Repurposed drugs and alternative strategies targeting miRNAs or based on plant extracts and probiotics and their derivatives have also shown antiviral effects against CVB. In addition, clinical trials with vaccines and drugs are underway and offer hope for the prevention or treatment of CVB-induced diseases.

### Coxsackie B viruses and the kidney – a neglected topic [^115pUfpf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Coxsackie B viruses types 1–6 (CVB1-6) occur worldwide and cause a broad spectrum of diseases, including myocarditis and aseptic meningitis. Although renal damage due to CVB has been suspected since the 1950s, these agents are only rarely searched for in today's clinical nephrological practice. Nevertheless, CVB can infect mesangial cells. Furthermore, infections with these viruses lead to a histological picture resembling mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and IgA-nephropathy in mice. In the present article, we provide an overview of this largely neglected topic, and of the slowly and steadily increasing evidence suggesting a link between coxsackieviral infections and kidney diseases.

### Mechanisms and results of the antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infections and role in the pathogenesis of coxsackievirus B-induced diseases [^117Vfc2X]. Microbes and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection are presented, particularly within the Picornaviridae family. The ADE of infection has been described in both human and animal models, worsens viral infections and compromises vaccine safety. The ADE of coxsackievirus B infection can also be implied in the pathogenesis of diseases like chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes.

### Coxsackievirus and type 1 diabetes: diabetogenic mechanisms and implications for prevention [^114okGnP]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The evidence for an association between coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection, pancreatic islet autoimmunity, and clinical type 1 diabetes is increasing. Results from prospective cohorts and pancreas histopathology studies have provided a compelling case. However, the demonstration of a causal relationship is missing, and is likely to remain elusive until tested in humans by avoiding exposure to this candidate viral trigger. To this end, CVB vaccines have been developed and are entering clinical trials. However, the progress made in understanding the biology of the virus and in providing tools to address the long-standing question of causality contrasts with the scarcity of information about the antiviral immune responses triggered by infection. Beta-cell death may be primarily induced by CVB itself, possibly in the context of poor immune protection, or secondarily provoked by T-cell responses against CVB-infected beta cells. The possible involvement of epitope mimicry mechanisms skewing the physiological antiviral response toward autoimmunity has also been suggested. We here review the available evidence for each of these 3 non-mutually exclusive scenarios. Understanding which ones are at play is critical to maximize the odds of success of CVB vaccination, and to develop suitable tools to monitor the efficacy of immunization and its intermingling with autoimmune onset or prevention.

### Increased detections and severe neonatal disease associated with coxsackievirus B1 infection – United States, 2007 [^111oHwC9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Enteroviruses generally cause mild disease; however, neonates are at higher risk for severe illness because of the immaturity of their immune systems. Neonatal systemic enterovirus disease, characterized by multiorgan involvement, is among the most serious, potentially fatal conditions associated with enterovirus infection. Typical clinical presentations include encephalomyocarditis (characteristic of group B coxsackieviruses) and hemorrhage-hepatitis syndrome (typical of echovirus 11). To describe the severity of neonatal illness associated with coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) infection, CDC analyzed case reports and preliminary data from the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) for 2007. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2007, CVB1 for the first time was the predominant enterovirus in the United States, accounting for 113 (25%) of 444 enterovirus infections with known serotypes. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the 2007 CVB1 strains suggested that the cases resulted from widespread circulation of a single genetic lineage. Health-care providers and public health departments should be vigilant to the possibility of neonatal disease caused by CVB1. Testing for enteroviruses in clinically compatible cases and reporting of identified enteroviruses to NESS should be encouraged.

Table 1
Coxsackieviruses and associated-diseases.

Similar to other enteroviruses, the majority of the CVs are transmitted by oral or fecal–oral routes. It is worthwhile to highlight that some CVs may spread via contaminated fomites or ocular and respiratory secretions. Additionally, evidence of transplacental CV transmission has been described, which can result in congenital infection, and although the possibility of transmission through blood donors is remote, it should not be discarded. After ingestion of the CV, can occur infection of the cells of the gastrointestinal tract, leading the virus to spread to the bloodstream (primary viremia), which allows its transport to various organs, including the central nervous system (CNS), heart, pancreas, spleen, lungs, skin, and liver. A secondary viremia is produced by additional replication in the tissues of those organs. Indeed, CVs have been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina, conjunctivitis, upper and lower respiratory disease, myocarditis, pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), pleurodynia, and severe syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS), including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and meningoencephalitis. Recent findings have also discussed the possible role of CVs in the development of neurodegenerative disorders as well as the impact of CV infection on neurodevelopment and cognition. Table 1 also illustrates the increased neurotropism of coxsackieviruses, as all types of CV have previously been linked to various CNS illnesses. To date, many studies have dedicated special attention to type B coxsackieviruses, even though many disorders associated with CVs belonging to EV-A and EV-C species have been neglected. Our review will focus on current knowledge of coxsackieviruses-associated disorders providing new insights that may be used in tailoring surveillance strategies to timely monitor the emergence/re-emergence of infection related to these viruses.

3 CV-associated infections

3.1 Coxsackieviruses and skin manifestations

Non-polio EVs are a prevalent cause of a wide range of cutaneous symptoms. In general, dermatologic manifestation through the occurrence and characteristics of the rash is diversified. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common, self-limiting infection that primarily affects children under the age of five and is characterized by fever with cutaneous vesicles on the hands, feet, mouth, and buttocks. HFMD outbreaks/sporadic cases were described in many countries as infections caused by different enterovirus, mainly belonging to the CVs group, including CVB1-B5, CVA1, CVA2, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA7, CVA8, CVA9, CVA10, CVA11, CVA12, CVA13, CVA14, CVA16, CVA19, CVA20, CVA21, CVA22, and CVA24 (Table 1). However, the majority of HFMD cases in the last few years have been primarily brought on by CVA6, CVA10, and CVA16 with an increased frequency of nail abnormalities and neurological complications, and other long-term sequelae as well as mortality. Interestingly, many of these complications are related to a variety of atypical manifestations and coinfection with CVs and other enteroviruses. In addition, there is evidence that CVA6 variants can be associated with severe or atypical HFMD cases, supporting the idea that recombination events play a critical role in the emergence of a novel genotype as well as pathogenicity. It´s important to highlight that the coinfection and co-circulation of multiple EV-types, particularly CVs, during HFMD outbreak can favor recombination events and atypical manifestations.

### Type B coxsackieviruses and central nervous system disorders: critical review of reported associations [^116j168H]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Type B coxsackieviruses (CV-B) frequently infect the central nervous system (CNS) causing neurological diseases notably meningitis and encephalitis. These infections occur principally among newborns and children. Epidemiological studies of patients with nervous system disorders demonstrate the presence of infectious virus, its components, or anti-CV-B antibodies. Some experimental studies conducted in vitro and in vivo support the potential association between CV-B and idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia. However, mechanisms explaining how CV-B infections may contribute to the genesis of CNS disorders remain unclear. The proposed mechanisms focus on the immune response following the viral infection as a contributor to pathogenesis. This review describes these epidemiological and experimental studies, the modes of transmission of CV-B with an emphasis on congenital transmission, the routes used by CV-B to reach the brain parenchyma, and plausible mechanisms by which CV-B may induce CNS diseases, with a focus on potential immunopathogenesis.

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^111MXBAV]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The current EV classification includes fifteen species: EV A-L and human rhinoviruses (HRV A-C). Seven species (EV A-D and HRV A-C) are able to cause human infection. Particularly, CVs present a high diversity within the Enterovirus genus and are categorized into three EV species: A (CVA2–8, CVA10, CVA12, CV14 and CVA16), B (CVA9, and CVB1–6) and C (CVA1, CVA11, CVA13, CVA17, CVA19–22, CVA24) being responsible for a wide variety of clinical diseases (Table 1). Even though CVs are typically thought of as a lytic virus, emerging evidence suggests that persistent CV infection can occur in some pathologies and individuals immunodeficient (;.;). Additionally, the illness process may potentially be influenced by latency and episodic reactivation.

3.4 Coxsackieviruses and cardiac manifestations

Cardiomyopathies include a variety of conditions defined by structural and functional cardiac changes such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Some of these manifestations, such as DCM, may emerge as a late sequela of acute or chronic viral myocarditis, due to viral persistence or a chronic immune process primarily triggered by a viral infection. These events are associated with high morbidity and death. Although infectious (bacteria, protozoa, fungi) and non-infectious (drugs, poisons) agents can cause inflammatory cardiomyopathy (myocarditis), viruses have been identified as the most common etiological agents. Among the viruses, enteroviruses, notably coxsackieviruses, are typically associated with cardiovascular manifestations, with proteins/RNA viral detected rates ranging from 20 to 40% of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy cases in children and young adults. The cardiotropic potential and molecular mechanisms, as well as the immunology evoked by these viruses during infection and injury of the cardiac cells infection have been thoroughly reviewed. The majority of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy cases have been implicated most frequently to CVB, particularly CVB3 and CVB5, but types 1, 2, and 4 have also been reported frequently. Although rarely identified, CVB6-induced cardiac muscle disease has also been reported. In addition to CVB, other CVs-types have also been associated with heart injury, which included fatal cases, such as CVA1, CVA2, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA7, CVA8, CVA9, CVA10, and CVA16 (Table 1). Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that mutations and recombination events in distinct CVB genomic areas play a crucial role in cardiac pathogenicity. In fact, there is evidence that mutations in the 5′UTR in CVB2 and CVB3 seem to be associated with the lower replicative capacity of the virus supporting the idea that these deletions may enable viral persistence in the cardiac muscle. Interestingly, analysis of RNA genomic viral derived from cardiac tissue from idiopathic DCM patients indicated the presence of these modifications. It is worth noting that these variant viruses may have an impact on the mechanisms of viral-host interaction and viral detection for diagnostic purposes. Finally, even though some studies have suggested a causal relation between CVB infections and myocardial infarction, others have not found an elevated rate of infection in patients who suffered infarction when compared with the control group.

3.6 Coxsackieviruses and gastrointestinal manifestations

During coxsackieviral infections, gastrointestinal manifestations such as vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea may occur with some regularity. It is important to highlight that coxsackieviruses infections can cause one or more gastrointestinal symptoms as part of the overall illness and are rarely found isolated. Even so, the most common gastrointestinal manifestation related to EVs, particularly CVs, is diarrhea. Worldwide, numerous studies have detected CVs from the feces of patients with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), even though many of these failed to include a matched healthy control or were unable to perform an assay to identify bacteria or the presence of viruses less commonly associated with AGE. In order to recognize EVs as major causative agents of AGE, some studies conducted in the presence of healthy controls have found CVs as an important etiologic agent of the AGE. In these studies, the majority of gastrointestinal manifestations have been implicated most frequently to EVB, particularly CVB. In addition to CVB, other CVs-types have also been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, such as CVA1, CVA2, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA8, CVA9, CVA10, CVA11, CVA12, CVA13, CVA14, CVA16, CVA17, CVA19, CVA20, CVA21, CVA22, and CVA24 (Table 1). It's also interesting to highlight that follow-up studies revealed a significant association of CVs with persistent diarrhea in children. Interestingly, another gastrointestinal manifestation known as non-diarrheal increased frequency of bowel movements (IFoBM-ND) has been linked to EVs, including CVs. Another gastrointestinal manifestation associated either etiologically or incidentally with CVs is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is a potentially fatal illness affecting almost exclusively neonates. A link between NEC and CVs was first observed in the 1970s, with fatal cases related to CVB2 and CVB3. Finally, it's important to highlight that many virus infections, particularly those associated with the gut, can result in dysbiosis and disruption of intestinal homeostasis prior to gastrointestinal manifestations onset. As a result, the dysbiosis caused by viral infection can favor an increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria, while decreasing the organisms considered to be beneficial.

### Viral myocarditis [^113EnFKg]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The article traces the pathways leading from viral infection of the heart by coxsackievirus B3 to autoimmune myocarditis in its various manifestations.

Recent Findings

Myocarditis can be induced by a number of different infectious agents and represents a significant cause of death especially in young individuals. Following infection, patients may develop lymphocytic, eosinophilic, or giant cell/granulomatous myocardial inflammation. It can lead to infectious dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease frequently requiring cardiac transplantation. Although acute viral myocarditis is frequently subclinical and recovery may be spontaneous, treatment of chronic myocarditis is currently unsatisfactory. Ongoing disease may be because of persistent virus in the heart or to immunopathic attack. Depending on the cause, treatment may be antiviral or immunosuppressive. Endomyocardial biopsy is proving of value in determining cause and deciding future therapy. A great deal of information about the pathogenesis of myocarditis has been gained from experimental models in rodents using heart disease induced by infection using coxsackievirus B3 or by immunization with cardiac myosin.

Summary

Treatment of myocarditis is still problematic and may depend on etiologic diagnosis to distinguish infectious from immune-mediated disease. Both pathogenic mechanisms may co-occur in individual patients. In the future, treatment may depend upon endomyocardial biopsy, immunohistologic testing, improved imaging, and molecular genetic analysis for providing more precise diagnoses.

### Persistent coxsackievirus B infection and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus [^114QSJi3]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Enteroviruses are believed to trigger or accelerate islet autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals, thereby resulting in loss of functional insulin-producing β-cells and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although enteroviruses are primarily involved in acute and lytic infections in vitro and in vivo, they can also establish a persistent infection. Prospective epidemiological studies have strongly associated the persistence of enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B (CVB), with the appearance of islet autoantibodies and an increased risk of T1DM. CVB can persist in pancreatic ductal and β-cells, which leads to structural or functional alterations of these cells, and to a chronic inflammatory response that promotes recruitment and activation of pre-existing autoreactive T cells and β-cell autoimmune destruction. CVB persistence in other sites, such as the intestine, blood cells and thymus, has been described; these sites could serve as a reservoir for infection or reinfection of the pancreas, and this persistence could have a role in the disturbance of tolerance to β-cells. This Review addresses the involvement of persistent enterovirus infection in triggering islet autoimmunity and T1DM, as well as current strategies to control enterovirus infections for preventing or reducing the risk of T1DM onset.

Similarly to HFMD, herpangina is usually a self-limited disease characterized by fever and ulcers typically found on the posterior oropharynx. In uncommon cases, however, the condition can progress to serious complications, including death. Herpangina, like HFMD, is primarily caused by EVs, particularly CVs. Although the majority of herpangina cases have been mostly associated with CVA2, CVA4, CVA6, and CVA10 (Table 1) other CVs types are also responsible for outbreaks/sporadic cases, including CVA1, CVA3, CVA5, CVA7, CVA8, CVA9, CVA12, CVA16, CVA20, CVA22, CVA24, CVB1, CVB2, CVB3, CVB4, CVB5, CVB6 (Table 1). Additionally, EV coinfection, especially CVs C-species, can favor the emergence of uncommon symptoms. HFMD and herpangina have historically been the most prevalent cutaneous manifestations linked with CVs, however, there are a wide variety of exanthematous disorders with various clinical presentations. In addition to vesicular exanthem, CV infections can be related to skin lesions that exhibit macular, maculopapular, petechial, purpuric, and urticarial exanthems (Table 1).

3.5 Coxsackieviruses and genitourinary manifestations

The involvement of the kidney in patients infected with enterovirus, especially CVs has been reported over the years. These viruses are associated with genitourinary manifestations, particularly orchitis and nephritis, as an inflammatory post-infectious phenomenon. In fact, numerous studies have described outbreaks/sporadic cases of pleurodynia, myocarditis, and HFMD with orchitis/epididymitis and nephritis as a complication. CVA6, CVA9, CVA16, and CVB1–6 were identified from epididymal fluid and testicular tissue as CVs-types typically related to these clinical symptoms (Table 1). Additionally, recent findings point toward a direct virus-induced etiology in many genitourinary manifestations. Pilatz and coworkers detected CVBs (CVB2-B5) in the semen of patients with acute orchitis as well as epididymitis. It is worthwhile to highlight that none of the patients experienced classic pleurodynia, HFMD, or myocarditis symptoms. Furthermore, the authors carried out successfully viral isolation in cell cultures from tissue samples demonstrating that these viruses were replication competent. The ability of CVs to directly induce infection can be explained by expressing receptors on the cell membrane of the kidney and germ cells, which act as a platform for these viruses to obtain access into the cell host. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is another genitourinary finding related to CVs (CVA2, CVA4, CVA7, CVA9, CVA10, CVA16, CVA21, and CVB1–6) (Table 1). However, it is unknown whether this relationship is etiologic.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^114ZSMMt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

HFMD is a common, contagious childhood disease caused by members of the genus Enterovirus, usually the coxsackieviruses. HFMD is typically a mild, febrile illness, characterized by mouth sores and a red, sometimes blistery rash involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Nail loss occasionally occurs, often weeks after symptom onset. In the United States, HFMD is commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16. Cases of HFMD with atypical rashes, involving the arms, legs, trunk, perioral regions, buttocks, and genitalia have been recently reported in association with CVA6. Although HFMD is most common among children aged ≤ 5 years, adults can also be infected. However, clusters of HFMD in adults are unusual.

During 2011–2012, an outbreak of HFMD caused by CVA6 occurred in North America. Sixty-three cases were reported to CDC, including 15 among adults. Approximately 50% of the adult patients had reported exposure to children with HFMD. The college outbreak reported here might also have begun with an exposure to a symptomatic child. The spread of HFMD among adults in a college setting has not been previously described.

Most cases of HFMD are mild and treatment is supportive, although CVA6 has been associated with more severe disease. HFMD is transmitted person-to-person through contact with vesicle fluid, respiratory secretions, and feces. Hand washing and routine disinfection of surfaces help prevent spread. Awareness of unusual features of CVA6, including the occurrence of a varicella-like rash (,–) or a rash with an atypical distribution, can assist health care providers in diagnosing HFMD and recommending appropriate care.

### Epidemiological and clinical insights into enterovirus circulation in Europe, 2018–2023: a multicenter retrospective surveillance study [^1151Qd1D]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Enteroviruses (EVs) are a diverse group of nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae family. To date, over 110 EV types that infect humans have been classified into species A–D.

EVs are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral and respiratory routes. They pose a significant public health threat with a broad range of severe clinical manifestations, including hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), respiratory illnesses, meningitis, paralysis, and encephalitis, particularly in newborns and young children. Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outbreaks of echovirus 11 (E11), E18, coxsackievirus B types (CVBs), and EV-D68 have been reported with severe clinical outcomes such as hepatitis, meningitis, myocarditis, and paralysis, respectively, predominantly affecting neonates and young children.

Although surveillance has proven to be essential in contributing to poliovirus elimination and vaccination programs, nonpolio EV surveillance is passive and remains substantially inconsistent across Europe. With the lack of implemented surveillance systems, the European Non-Polio Enterovirus Network (ENPEN) was established to standardize data collection of EV infections, to monitor EV circulation, and to estimate the disease burden of these viruses across Europe. In this study, we investigate EV epidemiological and clinical patterns, such as seasonality, specimen type, age distribution, and clinical presentations, and the (re)emergence of specific EV types in Europe from 2018 through 2023.

### Encephalitis due to group B, type 5 coxsackie virus… [^112nWfAB]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Convincing evidence has been presented of the etiologic association of Group B Coxsackie virus with respiratory tract inflammation, pleurodynia, pericarditis, myositis including myocarditis, and the aseptic meningitis syndrome. Since first noted by Steigman, 1 a small but significant percentage of mild, transient, paralytic lower motor-neurone disease clinically indistinguishable from poliomyelitis has been demonstrated to be consequent to Coxsackie Group A and B and ECHO virus infection. 2–5 Overt encephalitis. with serious neurologic derangement due to Coxsackie virus infection has been, with rare exceptions, confined to infancy and associated with diffuse visceral disease involving the liver and myocardium. 6, 7 Thus, the occu rence in a 9-year-old boy of severe encephalitis proved to be associated with Group B, Type 5 Coxsackie virus infection emphasizes the need to reconsider the neurotropic potentialities of this group of agents.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^115rqsu6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
D. Coxsackie A infection
E. Herpes zoster infection

Answers:
A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herpes zoster is a reactivation of the latent VZV, this typically presents with a dermatomal, unilateral vesicular eruption associated with pain, including sensations of burning and tingling.

### Enterovirus infection of human β-cells activates dendritic cells and triggers innate antiviral responses: are enteroviruses convicted now? [^117L9Qay]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Despite a large number of epidemiologic associations, clinical studies, and animal models, a direct involvement of pathogens in the etiology of human type 1 diabetes is still a matter of critical debate. Human enteroviruses (HEV), such as coxsackievirus B (CVB) and echoviruses (EV), have been associated with type 1 diabetes since the late 1960s and have been found in pancreatic isolates of type 1 diabetic patients (rev. in). However, there are several difficulties hampering the conviction of HEV as inducers of type 1 diabetes: 1) pancreatic biopsies are not done on a regular basis in type 1 diabetic patients; 2) HEV infections are frequently found in nondiabetic individuals and often remain asymptomatic; 3) the clinical manifestation of type 1 diabetes may occur years to decades after infection (virus infection as a "hit-and-run" event); 4) type 1 diabetic patients as well as healthy individuals undergo multiple virus infections throughout their lifetime, some of which might even protect them from rather than induce autoimmune disease; and 5) genetic predispositions might cover possible environmental (i.e. virus) factors.

### Probable transmission of coxsackie B3 virus from human to chimpanzee, Denmark [^112SCj2V]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Six serotypes of coxsackie B viruses (CBVs) (family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus) are recognized: CB1–6. CBV infections are common in humans and usually cause minor symptoms. However, CBVs are also linked to several serious acute manifestations in infants, children, and adults. CBVs are one of the most common causes of meningitis and can also cause encephalitis. In addition, enteroviruses are well documented as a cause of acute myocarditis, with viruses in the species Human enterovirus B, particularly CBVs, being the most common etiologic agents.

The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (P. paniscus) are the closest living relatives to humans. Research has shown that wild chimpanzees from Cameroon excrete different types of enteroviruses in their feces and that some of the enteroviruses are closely related to those known to infect humans. It has also been shown that fatal myocarditis caused by CBV can occur in other primates, including the orangutan and the snub-nosed monkey. We report an incident of likely human-to-chimpanzee enterovirus transmission, which raises the question of whether enteroviruses are regularly transmitted between humans, chimpanzees, and other primates.

3.10 Coxsackieviruses and central nervous system manifestations

Central nervous system (CNS) infections cause a high rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide, primarily in children and the elderly. These infections can result in illnesses ranging from fever to manifestations that can impact different anatomical regions, such as the meninges, brain, and spinal cord (encephalitis, myelitis), or they can affect multiple regions simultaneously (meningoencephalitis, encephalomyelitis). Enteroviruses have been implicated in most cases of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis worldwide, especially in pediatric patients. In the last years, due to the advanced state of polio eradication, the involvement of non-polio enteroviruses (NPEVs), particularly CVs, associated with CNS infections has been highlighted. In fact, all CVs that belong to the EV-A and EV-B species have been related to CNS infections, even though the majority of manifestations have causative agents CVB1-B6. Additionally, numerous epidemiological studies from patients with aseptic meningitis have identified different CVs-types, such as CVA1, CVA2, CVA3, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA7, CVA8, CVA9, CVA10, CVA12, CVA13, CVA14, CVA16, CVA17, CVA19, CVA21, CVA24, CVB1-B6 (Table 1). The vast majority of these viruses are rarely or occasionally associated with sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis, while CVA9 and CVB5 are commonly related to outbreaks. In addition to aseptic meningitis, coxsackieviruses have been associated with encephalitis (inflammation of the brain parenchyma), meningoencephalitis (severe inflammatory process of the brain parenchyma and meninges), and rhombencephalitis (brainstem encephalitis and cerebellitis). Indeed, numerous studies have revealed different CV types as causative agents of these inflammatory processes, such as CVA2, CVA3, CVA4, CVA5, CVA6, CVA7, CVA9, CVA10, CVA16, CVA21, CVB1-B5 (encephalitis), CVA6, CVA9, CVA10, CVA11, CVA16, CVB2-B5 (meningoencephalitis) and CVA9, CVA16, CVB2, and CVB4 (rhombencephalitis) (Table 1), including fatal cases. The most common CV types associated with these conditions are CVA9, CVB2, CVB3, and CVB5. Apart from the sporadic detection, certain CV types have also been linked to a community outbreak associated with these disorders. It is important to highlight that coxsackieviruses have been associated with encephalitis lethargic (EL), also known as von Economo's disease, in addition to being linked to post-encephalic parkinsonism or viral parkinsonism. During the acute phase of EL, sleep, ocular motility, and movement disorders are typically related, whereas in the chronic phase, parkinsonism (a term used to describe syndromes similar to Parkinson's Disease, which emerge as an immediate sequela to viral encephalitis) can be observed. Reports of the disease throughout the world show that some CV types, particularly CVB1-B4 may produce a post-encephalitic syndrome of acute parkinsonism.

3.8 Coxsackieviruses and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and other autoimmune diseases

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile, or childhood-onset diabetes, is widely thought to be a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of insulin-producing - cells (pancreatic β-cells) caused by a complex combination, such as genetic predisposition, immunological factors, and environmental causes. These environmental factors are becoming more important, as the consistent rise of T1DM annual incidence rate over the last 50 years, especially among children under the age of five years, cannot be explained by human population genetic drift. Multiple exogenous factors have been implicated as triggers for the development of T1DM, such as drugs, vitamin D deficiency, gut microbiota, and viral infections. Regarding viral infections, numerous epidemiological, clinical, and pathology studies, supported by different meta-analysis approaches, strongly indicate a significant association between EV infection, particularly coxsackieviruses (CVB1-B6), and the pathogenesis of T1DM. In addition to CVB, other coxsackieviruses have been associated with T1DM, such as CVA7, CVA9, CVA21 and CVA24 (Table 1). It is important to highlight that some studies failed to find a relationship between enterovirus infection and T1DM onset in patients and control groups. The putative molecular pathways that trigger the initiation and progression of CVB-induced autoimmunity against islet antigens in T1DM have been thoroughly reviewed.

### Coxsackievirus infection as an environmental factor in the etiology of type 1 diabetes [^114UF5BS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is dictated by a complex interplay between genetic determinants and environmental influences. Accumulating evidence strongly supports viral infection as an important factor in the etiology of T1D. To this effect, several viruses have been associated with the capacity to induce or exacerbate T1D in both humans and mice. The most convincing evidence linking viral infection and autoimmunity comes from studies on enteroviruses, particularly coxsackievirus. In this review we will discuss the evidence associating coxsackievirus infection to T1D and present the current state of knowledge on the potential mechanism of coxsackievirus-mediated T1D.

### Encephalitis and myocarditis in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: role of coxsackievirus B5? [^116DYCj4]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Enteroviruses are common causes of viral encephalitis in childhood and the most common cause of myocarditis. The prognosis is good with exception of the immunocompromised children who are at higher risk with increased mortality. A case of a 7-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and coxsackievirus B5-associated encephalitis and myocarditis is described. The boy was in complete remission and coxsackievirus B5 infection occurred 22 months after the beginning of chemotherapy. The clinical manifestations were fever, seizures, and altered consciousness. He underwent only supportive treatment. He had an excellent outcome; 2 years later he is still in complete remission with normal electroencephalogram and normal cardiac function.

Am J Dis Child. 1974; 128: 464–468. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1974.02110290034006 Coxsackievirus B infection was proved by virus isolation or rise in virus titer in 26 children during 1972 at the Montreal Children's Hospital. Sixty-nine percent of these infections occurred during July and August. The spectrum of illness associated with the five implicated coxsackievirus B serotypes included gastroenteritis, pleurodynia, pharyngitis, meningitis, and pericarditis. Lower-respiratory tract infection, transverse myelitis, and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome were also seen, and coxsackievirus B1 was isolated from a lymphosarcoma. This experience emphasizes the need for appropriate viral studies in determining the cause of childhood illnesses suspected of being infectious in origin.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^113v68ZT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some viral infections are known to cause post-acute infection syndromes, and may represent a considerable healthcare burden, with social and economic consequences for children, adolescents, and their families. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both physical and psychological symptoms, usually without any specific clinical findings or laboratory abnormalities. The features may vary according to the etiology of the viral infection, individual patient response (complete recovery, relapse, or remitting pattern), and age (younger children being more prone to respiratory symptoms and older children often presenting with chronic fatigue). It can be argued that post-viral syndromes often share a similar symptom profile, irrespective of the involved pathogen. This suggests the potential existence of a common etiopathogenesis. Post-viral fatigue syndrome, also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, presents symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and variable neurological abnormalities. Many viruses have been thought to be associated with post-acute infection syndromes, most commonly Coxsackie viruses, but also Influenza, Varicella, Epstein–Barr, Ebola, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a comparable post-acute, long-lasting multi-organ syndrome. The most commonly reported symptoms of Long/post COVID conditions include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, cough, chest pain and dyspnea; however, with a lower prevalence in children to young adults as compared to adults. Fatigue is a dominant feature of Long/post COVID, potentially lasting for weeks to months. According to adult data, prolonged illness duration and persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection will generally resolve within six months or less, except for severe fatigue or post-exertional malaise.

Post COVID-19 conditions became a global concern after the initial acute phase of the pandemic, however little is known about the pathogenesis and long-term clinical course both in adults as well as in children, adolescents and young adults. The overlap between the clinical presentation and course of post COVID and other post-viral conditions highlights the need to review the clinical characteristics, duration of symptoms, and possible healthcare burden in the pediatric population of both entities.

This review aims to systematically describe the available evidence on symptoms persisting beyond acute COVID infection, as compared to other viral infections; to evaluate clinical characteristics, duration, and healthcare burden.

3.3 Coxsackieviruses and muscle manifestations

Due to the myotropism of CVs observed in suckling mice, the connection between EV and inflammatory muscle disorders became apparent, and it was best supported by the relationship of these viruses with an outbreak of pleurodynia on the island of Bornholm in Denmark. Epidemic pleurodynia or Bornholm disease is an acute febrile illness characterized by spasmodic pain in the chest or upper abdomen myalgia, headache, and flu-like symptoms. Pleurodynia has historically been an epidemic illness, yet isolated cases do occur. Although other EV types can be associated with pleurodynia, CVs are frequently recognized as the principal causative agent, especially CVB. In fact, outbreaks of epidemic pleurodynia have been reported from different parts of the world associated with CVA (CVA1, CVA2, CVA4, CVA6, CVA9, CVA10, CVA16) (sporadic occurrence), and CVB (CVB1-B6) (frequently) (Table 1). Currently, pleurodynia is rarely reported, even though the CVs that cause it still circulate, most likely because it is overlooked or misdiagnosed. The latest outbreak caused by CVB1 was reported thirty years ago.

Clinical and epidemiological features for 2194 stage 2 and 156 stage 3 of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases were characterized and the dominated pathogens were Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) and enterovirus 71(EV-A71), respectively. Our data highlights that CV-A6 is emerging to be a pivotal pathogen for severe HFMD in southern China and clinical symptoms preference may exist among CV-A6, EV-A71, and CV-A10.

### Coxsackievirus A6-induced hand-foot-mouth disease [^114MEvCb]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute, self-limited, highly contagious viral illness that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. It is most typically caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16 and results in asymptomatic infection or mild disease. Immunocompetent adults are rarely affected. Recently, there have been increasing reports of a more severe form of HFMD associated with fevers, joint pains, and widespread painful eruptions. Some of these patients required hospitalization for supportive care. These severe cases were most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A6.

Observations

We describe a 37-year-old white man with widespread, crusted, pruritic papules on the scalp, ears, and face and a purpuric and targetoid painful vesicular eruption on his hands and feet, with associated fevers, neurologic symptoms, and arthritis, who required hospitalization for supportive care. His infection with coxsackievirus A6 was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction from his oral mucosa and cutaneous vesicle fluid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dermatologists should be familiar with the severe variant of HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A6, include it in their differential diagnosis of acute febrile blistering diseases, and be aware that certain patients may require hospitalization.

2 Understanding the coxsackieviruses contribution

Currently, > 300 EV types have been identified through genetic characterization and phylogenetic clustering, with some of these being classified into Enterovirus A: 25 types, Enterovirus B: 63 types, and Enterovirus C: 23 types (https://Ictv. Global/Report/Chapter/Picornaviridae/Picornaviridae/Enterovirus). The search was performed in the PubMed database using search terms "CVxx" or "coxsackievirus Axx" or "coxsackievirus Bxx" or "coxsackievirus Cxx", where "xx" denotes the coxsackievirus number. We limited our search to studies published in English and Spanish languages from 2000 to 2023. In the context of this review, we identified a total of 4510 studies that included coxsackieviruses (Fig. 1), regardless of subtype. Although CVB3 had been the most frequently reported CV type, accounting for 37.45% (1689/4510) and 63.62% (1689/2655) of the citations inter and intra-species, respectively, the contribution of the other types could not be neglected. CVB4 and CVB5 were also reported in most studies for B-species (Fig. 1). Regarding CVA, CVA6 and CVA16 appeared to be predominant, and mostly associated with large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease HFMD sometimes linked to severe neurological complications. Both viruses account most than 70% (1126/1582) of studies intra-species but represent only 24.83 (1126/4510) of studies inter-species, while all CV belonging to EV-A species represented 35.07% (1126/4510) (Fig. 1). Currently, nine members of CV belong to the EV-C species, which also includes the three types of polioviruses. Interestingly, enteroviruses frequently undergo recombination, which is thought to be a factor in the development of pathogenic circulating vaccine-derived PVs (cVDPVs) that have complicated the World Health Organization's efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis worldwide. These recombination events may have an impact on viral fitness and pathogenicity, particularly in neurovirulence. However, much less attention has been devoted to CV belonging to EV-C species, which represents only 6.05% (273/4510) (Fig. 1). It is worthwhile to highlight that the number of CV sequences deposited in GenBank is not correlated with the number of studies (Fig. 1). The CV types that are most common and medically relevant, such as CVA6 and CVA16 (A species), particularly associated with outbreaks of HFMD worldwide, are those most strongly represented and present a high number of sequences available as well as CVA10 and CVA24 (Fig. 1). Conversely, CVB3 revealed a lower number of sequences deposited at the GenBank (Fig. 1). Despite their lower frequency, other clinically significant CVs including CVA9 (B species) and CVA24 (C species) are also highlighted (Fig. 1). The difficulty in successfully isolating these viruses may be one reason for the limited number of studies related to CVC. Indeed, EV-C species are mostly isolated in Hep-2C cells, whose requirement for surveillance routine was abolished, hampering the CVC isolation efficiency. It's also interesting to note that enterovirus C circulating strains may favor the emergence of recombinant cVDPVs. Indeed, lineages circulating of cVDPVs were detected in the African region with the non-structural region of CVA13 and CVA20. Similarly, sequences of CVA13 and CVA17 were found in cVDPV strains responsible for outbreaks of poliomyelitis in Cambodia and Madagascar. Additionally, Bayesian molecular clock analysis revealed that the inferred substitution CVA13 rate is 3.07 × 10⁻² substitutions per site per year. Compared to other coxsackievirus species, this unusually high substitution rate in CVA13 may favor the emergence/reemergence of novel viruses with variable pathogenicity and clinically unknown outcomes.

### Severe enterovirus infections in hospitalized children in the south of england: clinical phenotypes and causative genotypes [^117S83LG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The results also highlight that there is considerable diversity in the causative genotypes in each of the clinical phenotypes. However, there was a relative predominance of echoviruses in patients with meningitis, and some predominance of coxsackie B viruses in the myocarditis group. The latter association has been described in previous publications.,

Earlier studies have shown that the predominant enterovirus serotypes within populations change continuously over time. In our study, we found that coxsackie A viruses, coxsackie B viruses and echoviruses accounted for similar proportions of the severe enterovirus infections. This contrasts with data from an epidemiological study conducted in England and Wales that reported data from 1975 to 1994, in which 61% of the culture-confirmed enterovirus isolates were found to be echoviruses, 10% coxsackie A viruses and 29% coxsackie B viruses. A recently published study providing laboratory data from the national reference laboratory in England and Wales from the period 2000 to 2011 reported similar proportions, with echoviruses accounting for 55%, coxsackie A viruses for 5%, and coxsackie B viruses for 23% of the enterovirus strains for which typing result were available. Comparing our data to those national data it appears that cases with coxsackie A virus infection were relatively overrepresented in our cohort, although the significance of this remains uncertain. However, our data show that this was not due to a single coxsackie A virus serotype with particular virulence.

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^115j4DSK]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Coxsackieviruses have also been frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as celiac disease (CD). CD is a chronic digestive and immune-mediated condition that is thought to be brought on by consuming gluten and unidentified environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. Recently, a longitudinal study suggested that children with increased genetic risk of CD had a higher frequency of enteroviruses in stool samples before the development of CD than healthy controls. CVA2, CVA4, CVA6, CVA10, and CVA16 were significantly correlated with later CD (OR 2,53). Another finding supports these observations showing an association between EV infections and CD development. Anyway, further studies in larger sample sets must be conducted to confirm this association and provide additional insight into the potential molecular pathways.

Another pancreatic manifestation strongly associated with coxsackieviruses is pancreatitis (acute inflammation of the pancreas) of unknown etiology. In fact, a higher detection rate of CVB1-B6 have been noted in patients with acute pancreatitis, and more uncommonly CVA4 and CVA16 (Table 1). Additionally, one case has also been reported suggesting a putative father-to-daughter transmission of CVB5 causing pancreatitis.

### Perinatal enterovirus infection in neonates: a systematic review [^111n7ELK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of perinatal EV infections is evident, with maternal symptoms often being mild and nonspecific, such as fever, mild gastrointestinal or respiratory complaints, and transient rashes, while neonates may develop severe conditions including sepsis, meningitis, myocarditis, and acute liver failure. The difference in disease severity between mothers and neonates suggests that maternal infections may not predict adverse outcomes, whereas neonates remain highly vulnerable due to their immature immune responses. The timing of infection is also critical; neonates exposed to maternal infection near delivery, as indicated by fever or chorioamnionitis, tend to show serious symptoms within the first few days of life, while earlier or subclinical maternal infections may lead to less severe disease in neonates. Moreover, variability in EV serotypes, with echovirus 11 and coxsackie B viruses frequently associated with severe neonatal disease, further contributes to these differences. These findings underscore the need for enhanced surveillance with detailed maternal histories, early diagnostic testing, and tailored intervention strategies for this vulnerable population.

The limitations of this systematic review include the heterogeneity of included studies, the potential for publication bias, and the reliance on observational data. The small number of studies included and the variability in their methodologies limit the generalizability of our findings. Publication bias may have led to the overrepresentation of studies with positive or significant findings. Additionally, the reliance on observational studies, with their inherent risk of bias, may affect the strength of evidence for causal relationships between perinatal EV infections and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Despite these limitations, this systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on perinatal EV infections. Our findings underscore the need for further research to address the knowledge gaps identified, including the development of standardized diagnostic protocols and surveillance systems to enable more accurate and comparable estimates of the global burden of these infections.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the global presence and potential severity of perinatal EV infections, emphasizing the diverse range of maternal and neonatal complications. Our findings underscore the critical need for healthcare providers to maintain a high index of suspicion for EV infection when encountering neonates with sepsis‐like features or other severe clinical presentations.

### The group B coxsackieviruses and myocarditis [^117MY8NH]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

The six serotypes of the group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) are common human enteroviruses linked etiologically to inflammatory cardiomyopathies. This has been demonstrated by molecular detection of enteroviral RNA in human heart tissue, serologic associations with disease, and virus isolation from cases of fulminant myocarditis. The murine model of CVB-associated myocarditis has demonstrated that CVB can be attenuated through mutations at different genomic sites. Human CVB3 isolates demonstrate varying degrees of cardiovirulence in the murine model; one site of virulence determination has been mapped to domain II of the 5' non-translated region. The interplay of CVB replication and the immune response to that replication in the heart is a complex interaction determining the extent to which the virus replication is limited and the degree to which a pathogenic inflammation of cardiac muscle occurs. Studies of CVB3-induced myocarditis in murine strains lacking subsets of the immune system or genes regulating the immune response have demonstrated a pivotal role of the T cell response to the generation of myocarditis. While CVB are associated with 20–25% of cases of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, the severity of the disease and the existence of attenuated strains shown to generate protective immunity in animal models indicates that vaccination against the CVBs would be valuable.

3.7 Coxsackieviruses and hepatitis and coagulopathies

Hepatitis is uncommon after EV infection, and when it does occur, it appears to be age-dependent, happening primarily in neonates. Even so, EVs are one of the most frequently recognized pathogens associated with acute hepatitis and coagulopathy in neonates. These disorders, known as the most common complication of severe neonatal enterovirus infection, are characterized by lethargy, hepatomegaly, jaundice, elevated hepatic transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia, in addition to thrombocytopenia, clotting time extension, fibrin split products, and bleeding complications. Coxsackieviruses are identified in the vast majority of neonatal hepatitis cases, particularly CVB (CVB1–6) (Table 1). Overall, infants usually infected with CVB1–5 present a high risk of a fatal outcome associated with neonatal hepatitis. In fact, clinical and pathological evidence from fatal fulminant hepatitis patients and acute liver failure revealed hepatocellular necrosis associated with CVB1, CVB2, and CVB3 from viral isolates from different tissues, including the liver. A recent systematic review of 109 cases of neonates with hepatitis or coagulopathy demonstrated that 71 of the 87 EV types found were CVB. Of these 87, 22 were CVB1, CVB2 was identified in one, CVB3 in 46 cases, CVB4 in one, and CVB5 in one case. Although uncommon, other CV types have also been related to hepatitis, including in adults, such as CVA4 and CVA9 (Table 1).

### Neurotropic virus infections as the cause of immediate and delayed neuropathology [^1136L81L]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Picornaviridae

The family Picornaviridae is one of the largest virus families consisting of small, non-enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The family is classified into 29 genera including many human pathogens such as poliovirus (PV) and the non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) of the Enterovirus genus, human parechovirus (HPeV) and hepatitis A virus. Animal pathogens include foot-and-mouth disease virus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Clinical symptoms caused by picornaviruses in humans vary greatly, ranging from the common cold to life-threatening infections such as encephalitis and myocarditis. Hereafter, picornaviruses that can cause neurological disease in humans will be discussed. CNS infections are most often caused by EVs and are estimated to cause 10–15 million infections in the United States with at least 30,000–50,000 hospitalizations per year, that are mainly due to aseptic meningitis. Based on molecular and serological characteristics the EVs are classified into species EV-A, containing EV71 and several Coxsackie A viruses (CV-A), species EV-B including coxsackie B viruses (CVB) 1–6 and all echoviruses, EV-C with the polioviruses (PVs) 1–3 and several CVAs, and EV-D containing EV-68. Following EVs, the second most frequent viral cause of CNS disease is HPeV, which belongs to the Parechovirus genus. The HPeV species are only found in primates and now consists of 16 types. The disease spectrum is similar to that of EV infections, although HPeV infection is almost exclusively seen in children.

### Detection of coxsackievirus A10 in multiple tissues of a fatal infant sepsis case [^116thkQp]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-polio enteroviruses are a common cause of childhood infections varying in symptomatology and severity. While infections with many of the enterovirus serotypes can be severe and even fatal, coxsackievirus A10 (CVA10) has most commonly been associated with more mild disease. Here we present the detection of CVA10 in multiple organ tissues in the investigation of an infant death.

6 Concluding remarks

Globally, coxsackieviruses infect millions of people every year and have been associated with a broad range of acute diseases, from mild febrile illness to life-threatening conditions. Additionally, coxsackieviruses can potentially cause chronic illnesses through persistent infection. From aperspective, the effects of these infections are vastly observed in low- and middle-income countries or in areas with high population density. There are still various aspects that must be addressed in order to further understand the impact of CV infections. The current knowledge about some CV types has been poorly considered, except for type B coxsackieviruses, CVA16 and CVA6. As a result, our understanding of the epidemiology of other CV types, especially belonging to EV-C species and that are known to infect people is incomplete and sometimes is biased. We do not understand why some CV-types and variants are more prevalent or geographically restricted, while others circulate worldwide. For instance, CVA6 and CVA16 are associated with large epidemics, mostly in Asia. On the other hand, among healthy infants and AFP patients in African countries, a wide circulation of several CV types and lineages from EV-C species was found, especially CVA13, demonstrating a significant intratypic diversity. Apart from CVA13, studies have also reported high detection rates of CVA11, CVA17, CVA20, CVA21, and CVA24 in these countries, in contrast to prevalent types in Europe, America, and Asia. Interestingly, enterovirus C circulating strains may favor the emergence of recombinant cVDPVs in areas where OPVs are massively used. Indeed, lineages circulating of cVDPVs were found in the African region with the non-structural region of CVA13, CVA17, and CVA20. Furthermore, the adaptative capability of the coxsackieviruses through recombination events should not be neglected. Finally, some CV-types known to infect primarily humans have also been detected in non-human primates (NHP) revealing their co-circulation in both humans and NHP favoring a high genetic diversity. Regarding fatal outcomes, CVB4 has one of the highest percentages of reports among individuals infected when compared to any other EV-type. Even though CVs have been associated with numerous disorders, the real impact of these pathogens on human health, especially on CNS and the development of NDs must be better comprehended. Furthermore, we do not know why some types are rarely reported. The effectiveness of the viral isolation of these viruses in different cell culture systems may suggest a lower susceptibility to viral infection in cell lines utilized by surveillance systems. Additionally, other regions of the enterovirus genome that are known to modify its phenotype are frequently disregarded in favor of the capsid-encoding region, which is sufficient to identify the virus type. Lastly, CV infection in early childhood may have long-term impacts on public health, thus prevention strategies must be implemented. Regarding the CV application in OV, several issues still need to be addressed before the virus can be used for clinical applications, including the treatment-related side effects, deeper knowledge of the virus's interactions with the immune system, and to evaluate the potential of different CV strains and compare to each other to find the positive and negative aspects of using them in cancer therapy. Coxsackievirus plays a critical role in human health. Strengthening surveillance systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries to identify the emergence/reemergence of novel viruses with atypical manifestation and clinically unknown outcomes are required to better understand the real contribution of these viruses in human diseases.

### Metagenomic surveillance uncovers diverse and novel viral taxa in febrile patients from Nigeria [^112uhSqn]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Metagenomics identifies viral infections in undiagnosed, severe clinical cases

In the clinical setting, metagenomic sequencing offers an alternative to the enumeration of single-pathogen diagnostic tests, which can require multiple samples and ultimately be costly and time-consuming. Moreover, in Nigeria and other LMIC settings, even large hospitals currently only have the capacity to test for a small set of pathogens. We received eight plasma samples from individuals with clinical presentations consistent with an infectious etiology but without evidence of any commonly circulating pathogens, collected in 2019–2020 from Ondo, Lagos, and Ebonyi states. Clinical and demographic metrics for these cases were highly varied (Supplementary Table 7).

We first screened the eight patient samples against the RT-qPCR common pathogens panel (Supplementary Table 5; Supplementary Data 1) and failed to identify any positive hits. Via unbiased metagenomic sequencing, we identified viruses that are plausible candidates for illness in two patients. In a third sample, we detected Pegivirus C, a common infection in healthy individualsthat is unlikely to be the cause of the clinical syndrome. No plausible pathogenic viral taxa were detected in the remaining five samples. Here, we describe the clinical and genomic features of the cases with a putative diagnosis.

We identified reads mapping to Enterovirus B in the plasma of a child presenting with fever and seizures. We assembled a genome of Coxsackievirus-B3 (CV-B3; Fig. 5a), which is associated with both gastrointestinal illness and more serious manifestations, including myocarditis and meningitis. The genome was most similar to a CV-B3 genome from Japan (82% pairwise sequence identity), though the VP1 gene was most closely related to a partial genome from Nigeria (88% pairwise sequence identity to GQ496547.1).

### "Eczema coxsackium" and unusual cutaneous findings in an enterovirus outbreak [^112c7joG]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the atypical cutaneous presentations in the coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6)-associated North American enterovirus outbreak of 2011–2012.

Methods

We performed a retrospective case series of pediatric patients who presented with atypical cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) from July 2011 to June 2012 at 7 academic pediatric dermatology centers. Patients were included if they tested positive for CVA6 or if they met clinical criteria for atypical HFMD (an enanthem or exanthem characteristic of HFMD with unusual morphology or extent of cutaneous findings). We collected demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data including history of skin conditions, morphology and extent of exanthem, systemic symptoms, and diagnostic test results.

Results

Eighty patients were included in this study (median age 1.5 years, range 4 months-16 years). Seventeen patients were CVA6-positive, and 63 met clinical inclusion criteria. Ninety-nine percent of patients exhibited a vesiculobullous and erosive eruption; 61% of patients had rash involving > 10% body surface area. The exanthem had a perioral, extremity, and truncal distribution in addition to involving classic HFMD areas such as palms, soles, and buttocks. In 55% of patients, the eruption was accentuated in areas of eczematous dermatitis, termed "eczema coxsackium". Other morphologies included Gianotti-Crosti-like (37%), petechial/purpuric (17%) eruptions, and delayed onychomadesis and palm and sole desquamation. There were no patients with serious systemic complications.

Conclusions

The CVA6-associated enterovirus outbreak was responsible for an exanthem potentially more widespread, severe, and varied than classic HFMD that could be confused with bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, vasculitis, and primary immunobullous disease.

### HFMD symptoms and… [^114fKzQn]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms HFMD symptoms usually include fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. Fever and flu-like symptoms Children often get a fever and other flu-like symptoms 3 to 5 days after they catch the virus. These can include:

- Fever
- Eating or drinking less
- Sore throat
- Feeling unwell. Mouth sores Your child can get painful mouth sores. These sores usually start as small red spots, often on the tongue and insides of the mouth. The spots blister and can become painful. Signs that swallowing might be painful for your child:

- Not eating or drinking
- Drooling more than usual
- Only wanting to drink cold fluids. Skin rash Your child can get a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also show up on the buttocks, legs, and arms. The rash usually is not itchy and looks like flat or slightly raised red spots; sometimes with blisters that have an area of redness at their base. Fluid in the blister can contain the virus that causes HFMD.

Keep blisters clean and avoid touching them. Complications HFMD is usually not serious and complications from it are rare. Nearly all people get better in 7 to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. Dehydration Some people, especially young children, can get dehydrated. This can happen if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores. Parents can prevent dehydration by making sure their child drinks enough liquids. Fingernail and toenail loss Although very rare, people may lose a fingernail or toenail after having HFMD. Most reports of fingernail and toenail loss have been in children. In these reported cases, the person usually lost the nail within a few weeks after being sick. The nail usually grew back on its own. However, there is no evidence that HFMD was the cause of the nail loss. Viral meningitis Although very rare, a small number of people with HFMD get viral meningitis.

This causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The infected person may require to be hospitalized for a few days. Keep Reading: About Viral Meningitis Encephalitis or paralysis While extremely rare, a small number of people. with HFMD get encephalitis or paralysis.

### Acute unilateral maculopathy associated with adult onset of hand, foot and mouth disease: a case report [^111f5Zxu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Viruses are frequent causes of infections involving the eye's posterior segment. Measles, influenza, Ebstein-Barr and Rift Vallery fever virus can cause retinitis and chorioiditis, which is typically preceded by an acute systemic viral disease. Similarly, Coxsackie viruses infections can be associated with chorioretinitis as reported in just a few cases in the literature. Diagnosing Coxsackie virus infection mainly relies on pathognomic clinical findings and can be supported by laboratory tests such as PCR. Although our patient underwent no anterior-chamber or vitreous-fluid aspiration to detect the Coxsackie virus via PCR or cell culture, our patient's clinical and funduscopic features are in line with previous case reports and make the diagnosis of an HMFD-associated maculopathy very likely.

### Etymologia: coxsackievirus [^1146JF11]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Named for Coxsackie, the small town on the Hudson River where they were first isolated, human coxsackieviruses are nonenveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus. They were first described by Gilbert Dalldorf, who was investigating suspected poliomyelitis outbreaks in upstate New York in the summer of 1947. Coxsackieviruses are divided into 2 groups, A and B. In suckling mice, group A viruses cause generalized myositis and flaccid paralysis, and group B viruses cause focal myositis and spastic paralysis. With the discovery of coxsackieviruses, Dalldorf also helped popularize the suckling mouse as an inexpensive laboratory animal model.

### Pulmonary hemorrhage due to coxsackievirus B infection – A call to raise suspicion of this important complication as an end-stage of enterovirus sepsis in preterm twin neonates [^116TbEHZ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Prematurity is an important risk factor for the fulminate form of neonatal enteroviral infection. Pulmonary hemorrhage is a morbid complication that should be anticipated and managed aggressively due to its fatal outcome.

Objective

To emphasize the significance of pulmonary hemorrhage as a complication of severe enterovirus infection in preterm neonates.

Study Design

This report is a description of the clinical history, medical management and clinical outcomes of two pairs of preterm twin newborns (30 weeks and 36 weeks) with fulminant infection due to Coxsackievirus B (CBV) infection.

Results

Maternal fever was reported in both deliveries and it was a factor in the decision for urgent cesarean section of the 30-week twins. Three of the four infants failed to survive. Their clinical course involved multiple organ system failure complicated with profound disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary bleeding leading to hypovolemic shock and respiratory failure was the direct cause of death in two cases.

Conclusions

This small series of preterm neonates with the diagnosis of CBV sepsis highlights the importance of correct diagnosis of maternal enterovirus infection in order to extend pregnancy and allow the fetus time to passively acquire protective antibodies. This report emphasizes the morbid complication of pulmonary hemorrhage as a result of enterovirus infection that should be anticipated and managed aggressively due to its potentially fatal outcome. Moreover, evaluation and observation of the asymptomatic twin is recommended in order to detect early signs of infection and deterioration in that sibling as well.

### Fulminant myocarditis as an early presentation of SARS-CoV-2 [^113pwTwW]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Myocarditis is well known to be caused by viral infections such as Coxsackie virus group B, human herpes virus 6 and parvovirus B19. However, during the current emerging outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, there have been few case reports describing myocarditis as a possible presentation. In our case report we describe, early cardiac manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK District General Hospital. A 44-year-old Caucasian woman without any comorbidities presented with SARS-CoV-2 related fulminant myocarditis without initial respiratory symptoms. Patient underwent treatment with milrinone and methylprednisolone that showed reduction in myocardial inflammation and significantly improved myocardial contractility. This was then followed by a second phase of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia and renal failure requiring ventilatory support and haemofiltration. Although, not described in the literature, we have found conjunctive use of milrinone and methylprednisolone effective in patient with SARS-CoV-2 fulminant myocarditis.

### Clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infection: a systematic review [^117J54iK]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Enterovirus (EV) is a common cause of infection in neonates. Neonates are at high risk of enterovirus infection with serious clinical manifestations and high lethality. This review systematically summarized the clinical characteristics of neonates with severe enteroviral infection to provide evidence for the identification and treatment of severe neonatal EV infection.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for original studies on neonates with severe EV infections from January 1, 2000, to November 27, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and performed a descriptive analysis.

Results

In total, 66 articles with 237 cases of severe neonatal enterovirus infection were included. All neonates developed severe complications. Among them, 46.0% neonates had hepatitis or coagulopathy, 37.1% had myocarditis, 11.0% had meningoencephalitis, and 5.9% had other complications such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The lethality rate of neonates with severe infection was 30.4%. The highest lethality rate was 38.6%, which was observed in neonates with myocarditis. In 70.5% neonates, the age at the onset of symptoms was less than 7 days. Coxsackievirus B infection was seen in 52.3% neonates. The most common symptoms included temperature abnormalities (127, 53.6%), rash (88, 37.1%), poor feeding (58, 24.5%), and respiratory symptoms (52, 21.9%). The main treatment included transfusion of empirical antibiotics (127, 53.6%), blood components (100, 42.2%), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 97, 40.9%), mechanical ventilation (51, 21.5%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; 43, 18.1%). Additionally, antiviral medications pleconaril (14, 5.9%) and pocapavir (3, 1.3%) were administered.

Conclusions

Lethality was high in neonates with severe enterovirus infection, especially in those complicated with myocarditis. The most common symptoms included temperature abnormalities, rash, and poor feeding. The chief supportive treatment consisted of transfusion of blood components, mechanical ventilation, and ECMO. Empirical antibiotics and IVIG were widely used. Antiviral medications included pocapavir and pleconaril; however, more clinical evidence regarding their efficacy is needed.

### A case cluster of aseptic meningitis associated with a newly identified recombinant echovirus 6 / coxsackievirus B1 enterovirus [^111WR4ro]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The genus Enterovirus consists of small single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, which are generally transmitted via a respiratory route or through the gastrointestinal tract. Enteroviruses are within the Picornavirus family and are responsible for a range of illnesses in humans, including upper respiratory infections, meningitis/encephalitis, myopericarditis, and poliomyelitis, as well as hand, foot, and mouth disease. Enteroviruses were previously classified into 4 major groups: polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses, Coxsackie B viruses, and echoviruses. Current nomenclature is based on genetic characteristics, with identification of 15 enterovirus/rhinovirus species, which may contain echovirus and coxsackievirus serotypes.

Reporting of enterovirus infections is not mandatory at a national level in the United States. As noted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US laboratory capacity for enterovirus serotyping is limited, and serotyping is rarely done in clinical cases. In 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Enterovirus Surveillance System received reports of enteroviral infections from laboratories in only 7 states with enterovirus D68 the most commonly identified serotype, accounting for 62% of cases. In a recent European study of 2018–2023 enterovirus surveillance data from 28 institutions in 16 countries, 11 605 confirmed enterovirus cases were identified; the most frequent types were echovirus 30 (1440 cases), coxsackievirus A6 (1341 cases), enterovirus D68 (1261 cases), and echovirus 9 (1004 cases). Evidence of neurologic infection was reported in 40.5% of the European cases for which clinical data were available, with neurologic infections more common in certain serotypes: enterovirus A71 (neurologic infections in 73% of cases), coxsackievirus B5 (72.9%), echovirus 30 (71.6%), and echovirus 6 (E6; 56.6%).

RNA recombination occurs frequently within enteroviral groups and is a major driving force in the evolution of the species, with recent studies exploring the genetic processes by which such recombinations occur. We report here a cluster of enterovirus cases associated with a childcare facility; the virus responsible for the outbreak was a novel recombinant of E6 and coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1).

### Enterovirus and human parechovirus surveillance-United States, 2009–2013 [^115PEcLb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are small, non-enveloped RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which are known or suspected to cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans. Although most infected persons are asymptomatic, mild presentations can include respiratory infections, herpangina, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Among the more severe syndromes associated with EV and HPeV infection are acute flaccid paralysis, meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and sepsis. Neonates and infants are at higher risk for infection and for severe clinical outcomes than older children or adults (1–3). As of August 2015, a total of 16 HPeV types and 118 EV types (within four EV species known to infect humans: A, B, C, and D) had been identified, and the spectrum of illness caused differed among virus types (4). To describe trends in EV and HPeV circulating in the United States during 2009–2013, CDC summarized detections reported through two surveillance systems. The most commonly reported types of EV and HPeV during this period were coxsackievirus (CV) A6 and HPeV3. The large number of CVA6 detections likely reflected an increase in testing in response to an outbreak of severe hand, foot, and mouth disease in late 2011 and 2012 (5). Most HPeV3 detections originated from a single hospital that routinely tested for HPeV (6). Clinicians and public health practitioners should consider the EV and HPeV types recently circulating in the United States to inform diagnostic and surveillance activities. When EV and HPeV typing is performed, clinical and public health laboratories should routinely report their results to improve the reliability and generalizability of surveillance data.

### Coxsackievirus B1 is associated with induction of β-cell autoimmunity that portends type 1 diabetes [^1174p6h4]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The rapidly increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes implies that environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis. Enteroviruses are among the suspected environmental triggers of the disease, and the interest in exploring the possibilities to develop vaccines against these viruses has increased. Our objective was to identify enterovirus serotypes that could be involved in the initiation of the disease process by screening neutralizing antibodies against 41 different enterovirus types in a unique longitudinal sample series from a large prospective birth-cohort study. The study participants comprised 183 case children testing persistently positive for at least two diabetes-predictive autoantibodies and 366 autoantibody-negative matched control children. Coxsackievirus B1 was associated with an increased risk of β-cell autoimmunity. This risk was strongest when infection occurred a few months before autoantibodies appeared and was attenuated by the presence of maternal antibodies against the virus. Two other coxsackieviruses, B3 and B6, were associated with a reduced risk, with an interaction pattern, suggesting immunological cross-protection against coxsackievirus B1. These results support previous observations suggesting that the group B coxsackieviruses are associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes. The clustering of the risk and protective viruses to this narrow phylogenetic lineage supports the biological plausibility of this phenomenon.

### Echovirus 13 aseptic meningitis, Brazil [^112vLD9J]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Human enteroviruses (polioviruses, coxsackievirus A, coxsackievirus B, echoviruses, enterovirus 71, and newer recognized serotypes) belong to the Picornaviridae family, Enterovirus genus. They are common viral agents associated with a diversity of clinical manifestations, including respiratory illness; nonspecific rashes; hand, foot, and mouth disease; myocarditis; acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; and central nervous system (CNS) syndromes. Acute viral infections of the CNS are the source of a group of globally distributed diseases, which affect the population in a sporadic, endemic, or epidemic way. These infections cause a number of illnesses, particularly in children, and may result in serious sequelae; in severe cases, they can be fatal. Meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis), mononeuritis, polyneuritis, and Reye syndrome constitute most of the illnesses. Nonpolio enteroviruses are responsible for > 80% of viral meningitis cases in which the etiologic agent is identified. Several of the 28 currently recognized serotypes of echovirus are found in association with these infections.

We describe an outbreak of aseptic meningitis that occurred in southern Brazil in 2003 with echovirus 13 (E13) virus as the etiologic agent. This is the first meningitis outbreak due to E13 reported in the country.

From March to April 2003, 17 children and young adults from Horizontina City (population 16,800), Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil, with symptoms of meningitis, sought medical attention at the local hospital. Seven of these case-patients were linked to each other either by school or domiciliary contact. Lumbar puncture showed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests a viral cause. The following symptoms were associated with patients: fever (92%), headache (84%), vomiting (79%), diarrhea, stiff neck, and fatigue (7.69% each). Patients' ages ranged from 1 to 19 years of age, with the age peak incidence in children 5–9 years of age (46%). Fifty-eight percent of patients were male. All patients recovered, and no sequelae or deaths were identified. The pattern of meningitis associated with E13 in this outbreak was clinically similar to those observed in aseptic meningitis due to other enteroviruses in previous outbreaks.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^11445e2c]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Prevention of type 1 diabetes through viral infections.

What about the flipside of this coin, that is, the possibility that viral infections and other types of infectious diseases would actually prevent type 1 diabetes? At first, this seems counterintuitive because of the aforementioned data indicating that viruses can be strong inducers of inflammation. However, emerging experimental evidence from various animal models has taught us otherwise. I will discuss some of the evidence and underlying mechanisms in the following examples.

New unpublished data from us and published work from others support the so-called "hygiene hypothesis", which implies that type 1 diabetes is a disease of the more industrialized countries because lesser numbers of infections occur and the immune system has therefore less opportunity to be properly trained for its main task, which is host defense. For example, in our laboratory, we infected two completely different pre-diabetic type 1 diabetes mouse models, the NOD and the RIP-LCMV, with Coxsackie B3. This virus has been shown to systemically infect mice and has been epidemiologically associated with human type 1 diabetes. The Cox B infection usually lasts 10 days and involves the pancreas, but rarely the islets. Interestingly, acceleration of diabetes is only seen in some instances and depends on the timing of infection, for example, when Coxsackie B3 is given to 10-week-old NOD mice or RIP mice 7 days post triggering of the diabetogenic response. Interestingly, it is important to note that an equally common outcome for viral infection is the lowering of diabetes penetrance. I would now like to discuss some impressive data supporting one of the underlying mechanisms for viral prevention of type 1 diabetes and then discuss some of the other potential mechanisms in a brief overview.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^116rXd2r]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Disease transmission and symptoms

The first evidence showed that TF, as the HFMD, is a very contagious disease transmitted by close contact making under-five children a particular group at risk. Infants can be infected mainly through nappies or if they touch unclean surfaces or put infected objects directly into the mouth.

The main symptoms of TF are described as high fever, intense arthralgias with sometimes joint swelling, and a rash localized in the mouth (tongue, gums, inside of the cheek), palms, and soles. Doctors now report some atypical localization of the lesions; they can also be found on the buttocks or even the shedding of nails. The lesions are described as red, painful, growing blisters.

Additional symptoms like many viral infections include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, body aches, and influenza-like symptoms. The symptoms may have different presentations or intensity from one child to another, as illustrated by the two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom a week after returning from a trip to Kerala. The two siblings, a five-year-old boy and a 13-month-old girl presented a vesicular rash without fever or other systemic symptoms. The girl's rash was more florid, and she gave two days after painful oral lesions while his brother was in a healing process. After six days, the boy's lesion completely healed without scarring, while his sister had to wait until 16 days for the same result. The Enterovirus PCR was positive for both children, and the EV typing by sequencing showed Coxsackie A-16, another finding in favor of the likeliness of the tomato flu as an atypical presentation of the HFMD.

### Human parechovirus are emerging pathogens with broad spectrum of clinical syndromes in adults [^115oPNbe]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Parechoviruses are emerging pathogens of humans often affecting the pediatric age group, with a growing line of evidence implicating them as agents of a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes in adults. However, because many clinicians are not familiar with the manifestation of the infections, they are not included in the list of diagnostic pathogens. Furthermore, due to the indistinguishable feature of the infection compared with other common pathogens, a large number of cases are likely to go unchecked. Some may develop asymptomatic infection and recover without overt clinical disease. In this manuscript, we reviewed available literature on parechovirus infection in adult and summarized information relating to epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory diagnosis, and therapeutics. The information provided should help in early case detection and support an evidence-based clinical decision.

### Clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infection: a systematic review [^113CU4Qq]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Manifestations of neonatal enterovirus infections range from asymptomatic, febrile illness to severe disease. A prospective cohort study in 2011–2012 in China reported 131 episodes of neonatal enterovirus infection (39.22%) among the 334 febrile neonates. Xu et al. reported 16 cases of neonatal hand-foot-mouth disease with coxsackievirus A6 infection between 2016 and 2017 in Shanghai, China. In this systematic review, a categorical summary of the most common complications of severe neonatal enterovirus infection was presented, including myocarditis, hepatitis, and encephalitis. In addition, the clinical features of other rare complications were reviewed. Lethality in each of the severe forms of neonatal enterovirus disease is high and varies between 11.5 and 38% depending on the type of disease. The most common severe complication was hepatitis, while myocarditis was the complication with the highest lethality rate. The age of onset in most neonates was less than 7 days and this might be related to the lack of specific transplacental neutralizing antibodies against the infecting serotype in newborns. The main sites of virus detection were the respiratory system, stools, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine. Additionally, enteroviruses have also been detected in tissue samples from dead neonates, such as the heart, lung, spleen, and bone marrow. Isolation of the virus in the amniotic fluid or placenta as evidence of prenatal transmission has also been reported in severe cases. IVIG is frequently used for the treatment of enterovirus infections. Studies suggest that there may be more rapid clearance of viremia after IVIG therapy. A retrospective study from Taiwan, China, evaluating the timing of IVIG administration revealed that early IVIG therapy (within 3 days of illness onset) may be beneficial for the survival of neonates with severe enteroviral infections. The study analyzed 67 cases with culture-confirmed severe enteroviral infection. 41 infants (61%) received IVIG therapy and 29 cases were administered IVIG within 3 days of the illness onset with the mortality rate of 7% (2/29). While among the neonates with late IVIG therapy, the mortality rate was 50% (6/12). In our review, 40.9% of the neonates were treated with IVIG and the dosage of IVIG therapy varied from 0.5–2 g/kg/day. Therefore, more research is needed on the optimal dosage of IVIG treatment. Pleconaril, with activity against the picornaviruses, can bind to the viral capsid, thereby preventing viral uncoating within the cells. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 43 enterovirus-infected neonates in America from 1999 to 2010 supported the potential efficacy of pleconaril. The study enrolled 61 subjects (43 treatment, 18 placebo). Subjects in the treatment group received oral pleconaril of 5 mg/kg per dose 8 hourly for 7 days. Mortality rates in the treatment and placebo groups were 23 and 44%, respectively. They concluded that enterovirus-infected neonates in the treatment group had shorter times to culture, PCR negativity, and better survival.

### Myopericarditis associated with varicella zoster virus infection [^114mRJLG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Acute myopericarditis is a major cause of acquired heart disease worldwide in pediatric patients. Various viruses have been reported as the etiology, of which varicella zoster virus was first reported in 1953. However, since nationwide administration of the varicella vaccine, reports of varicella-associated myopericaridits have become sporadic. We report a case of varicella myopericarditis with an initial manifestation of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension. Typical skin vesicles developed 2 days after these symptoms, which confirmed the diagnosis. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered before the appearance of the skin vesicles under the impression of suspected Coxsackie virus infection. Intravenous acyclovir effectively controlled the progression of the disease, and both clinical symptoms and electrocardiographic changes subsided soon after the use of an antiviral agent. Varicella zoster virus serum IgM antibody also showed positive test results. On the following visit, the patient's myocardial function had fully recovered from this episode.

### Clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infection: a systematic review [^114Ln7p6]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Overall, 237 neonates developed severe complications of enterovirus infection, with a male/female ratio of 116/88, and birth weight ranging from 1730 to 4500 g. In total, 51.3% (101/197) of the preterm infants and 52.5% (95/181) of the neonates were delivered by cesarean section. In 70.5% (167 cases) of the cases, the age at the onset of symptoms was less than 7 days. Seventy cases (29.5%) were associated with maternal disease before delivery, while 16 cases (6.8%) reported siblings or friends with symptoms. Maternal amniotic fluid culture revealed scarce Staphylococcus epidermidis in a case of myocarditis. Also, a mother was diagnosed with chorioamnionitis and amnionitis was suspected in another mother. Enterovirus was identified mostly from the rectal or stool samples (118, 49.8%), followed by respiratory samples (101, 42.6%). Additionally, 82.7% (124 cases) of the neonates had coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection, 16.7% (25 cases) had echovirus infection, and 0.7% (1 case) had enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. The clinical manifestations included temperature abnormalities (127, 53.6%), rash (88, 37.1%), poor feeding (58, 24.5%), respiratory symptoms (45, 19.0%), lethargy (40, 16.9%), jaundice (38, 16.0%), circulatory failure or shock (37, 15.6%), arrhythmias (29, 12.2%), thrombocytopenia (28, 11.8%), poor perfusion (23, 9.7%), irritability (17, 7.2%), hypotonia (9, 3.8%), and diarrhea (9, 3.8%). A total of 127 (53.6%) neonates were treated with empirical antibiotics and 97 (40.9%) neonates with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Antiviral medications included pocapavir (3, 1.3%) and pleconaril (14, 5.9%). Altogether, the lethality rate was 30.4% (72 cases).

### Severe enterovirus infections in hospitalized children in the south of england: clinical phenotypes and causative genotypes [^115k3wwN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Enterovirus infections, particularly enterovirus myocarditis and encephalitis, can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Even with high-level PICU support available, a substantial proportion of patients with severe enterovirus disease have a fatal outcome. In addition, our data show that there is considerable diversity in the enterovirus genotypes causing severe disease in the South of England, with coxsackie A virus-related disease being relatively overrepresented when compared with national epidemiological data. Furthermore, the results highlight that there are currently no strong associations between clinical phenotypes and particular causative enterovirus genotypes in the South of England.

### Infective myositis [^113vEDrH]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 VIRAL MYOSITIS

Though several microbial organisms are known to cause myositis, viruses easily involve the muscle and are the most common cause for infectious myositis leading to myalgia, polymyositis, or associated rhabdomyolysis. The common ones include influenza (A and B) group of viruses, parainfluenza, enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus and Echovirus), adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, retroviruses, herpesviruses (Varicella, Herpes simplex, Epstein–Barr, and cytomegalovirus), parvovirus B19, dengue, and hepatitis viruses (B and C). The viral infection mechanisms include direct cytopathic/cytolytic effect, molecular mimicry, immune complex formation, immune dysregulation, and others. However, direct myotoxic effect and immune‐mediated mechanisms are the main causes of muscle damage. There is usually spontaneous recovery except in some who develop complications of rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and compartment syndrome. The common viruses that cause rhabdomyolysis include Influenza, enteroviruses (Coxsackie A & B) followed by Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Herpes simplex virus.

The muscle damage caused by viruses may be exaggerated or triggered by exercise. Normalization of muscle enzymes (e.g. CK levels) precedes functional recovery. Viral myositis is relatively more common in children because of viruses' trophic property to immature muscle cells. Clinically, viral myositis is often mistaken with idiopathic "polymyositis" or dermatomyositis when skin rashes exist. A severe form of viral myositis with extensive necrosis may mimic necrotizing myopathy, drug‐induced myopathy, metabolic crisis, or vasculitis.

The biochemical parameters, EMG, and muscle biopsy findings may be similar in both viral myositis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Viruses can rarely be isolated from muscle biopsy specimens. Clinical evaluation and corroborative evidence from all the ancillary tests are needed for a definitive diagnosis. However, suspicion of viral etiology increases when muscle symptoms (weakness) develop acutely or sub‐acutely following an antecedent respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.

### Masticator myopathy [^115fZf5A]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old woman developed low-grade fever and pain and swelling of the masticatory muscles. A T2-weighted magnetic resonance image showed high signal intensity in these muscles. Coxsackie B3 and echo 30 viruses were detected from a nasopharyngeal swab and feces, respectively. The clinical symptoms accompanied a marked decline in the serum immunoglobulin G level with progressive eosinophilia. Her symptoms disappeared by 8 weeks after onset. She was diagnosed as having masticator myopathy, which has rarely been reported in humans. The present case suggests that masticator myopathy is associated with coxsackie or echo virus infection.

Background

Coxsackie A16 (CVA16) belongs to the picornavirus family, which can cause a wide spectrum of diseases, such as encephalitis, paralysis or myelitis, meningitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), upper and lower respiratory tract diseases, pleurodynia, herpangina, and myopericarditis. HFMD is a common infectious disease, with CVA16 as the major pathogen, mainly observed among children under 5 years old in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in China. CVA16 predominated in China in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018, accounting for 58.6% of HFMD outbreaks between 2011 and 2018. An increasing number of HFMD cases caused by CVA16 have been observed since 2017. Although most patients show minor symptoms, CVA16 can cause severe and fatal HFMD, and increasing numbers of reports of such outcomes have been noted in the US, France, Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan of China. In Shenyang, northeastern China, 20.7% (19/92) of HFMD cases with neurological symptoms were caused by CVA16 infection, of which 2 patients had brainstem encephalitis and 1 had acute flaccid paralysis.

### Disseminated enteroviral infection associated with obinutuzumab [^117EBt1p]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical features described in most cases of disseminated enteroviral infections relate to chronic meningoencephalitis. However, several reports describe a dermatomyositis-like syndrome with edema and hepatitis that responded to IVIg; this syndrome is strikingly similar to the cases reported here. Enteroviral infections (coxsackieviruses and echoviruses) also have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myositis. Enterovirus PCR was positive from the muscle biopsy of the patient in our report, suggesting that the virus had a direct role in pathogenesis of the myositis.

Reports of enteroviral infections associated with rituximab use since its introduction have been rare, in contrast to obibutuzumab, for which a case of enteroviral meningencephalitis has been reported. Of the 11 cases of enteroviral infection associated with rituximab use, 8 were meningoencephalitis and 2 were myocarditis (,–). To our knowledge, enteroviral infection has not previously been associated with rituximab use in patients who also had hepatitis, dermatomyositis, and edema, as in the cases we report and those associated with XLA.

Future studies could define susceptibility to enteroviruses through the effect of obinutuzumab on B-cell and immunoglobulin function and host defense against enteroviral infections. It would be clinically useful to identify biomarkers or clinical predictors of disseminated infection. Future research might also focus on the development of a screening strategy for enteroviral infections followed by prophylactic or preemptive therapy with IVIg.

The clinical manifestation of disseminated enteroviral infections, particularly those similar to dermatomyositis, may be unfamiliar to clinicians caring for adults because most experience of the illness is in children and there have been few reports in recent years. Given the therapeutic response to IVIg in the cases we report, enteroviral infection and the use of IVIg therapy should be considered in patients treated with obinutuzumab who develop atypical clinical features of organ inflammation.

### Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy as a late complication of healed viral (coxsackie B virus) myocarditis: historical analysis, review of the literature, and a postulated unifying hypothesis [^117RmJAq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A historically based literature review of the relationship between acute viral myocarditis and the subsequent development of a dilated cardiomyopathic state is presented. A strong emphasis on a state of definitional ambiguity in the literature as regards the timing of the myopathic state following a viral infection is noted, i.e. does the myopathic state develop acutely and concomitantly with viral myocarditis due to overwhelming viral mediated myocardial cell necrosis, subacutely due to negative remodeling following severe but not overwhelming viral mediated myocardial cell necrosis, subacutely due to a sustained immune mediated myocarditis or in a delayed time frame following complete recovery from the initial infection (i.e. a return of normal histology and the absence of any cellular infiltrate and the presence of normal cardiac function). Evidence for the first two mechanisms is supported by the literature; evidence for the immune mediated chronic myocarditis remains controversial while hard evidence for the development of an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) as a late downstream complication following complete recovery from a bout of myocarditis is nonexistent. Recent basic virologic studies of myocarditis and the potential effects of retained noninfectious viral genomic material within the myocardium are reviewed. These studies allow for the proposal of a hypothetical mechanism whereby IDCM develops as a downstream complication of acute viral myocarditis.

Coxsackievirus intrauterine infection has been documented mostly on the basis of indirect evidence of transplacental transmission, with neonatal manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and generalized sepsis. This is the first report of prenatal findings and fetoplacental pathology in a third trimester fetus with coxsackie B3 transplacental infection confirmed by molecular techniques. Prenatal ultrasound detected severe reduction of fetal movements at the 27th week. Late onset fetal akinesia deformation sequence with mild arthrogryposis, necrotic meningoencephalitis with vascular calcifications, interstitial pneumonitis, mild myocardial hypertrophy, and chronic monocytic placental villitis were the cardinal findings at fetal autopsy following interruption of the pregnancy.

### Probable transmission of coxsackie B3 virus from human to chimpanzee, Denmark [^114UfFqS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The Case

Chimpanzees at the Copenhagen Zoo (Copenhagen, Denmark) zoo are housed together and allowed contact with each other at all times. In October 2010, respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, and serous nasal discharge) developed in all chimpanzees at the zoo; however, a 7-year-old female chimpanzee was particularly affected. She was a West African chimpanzee (P. troglodytes verus) that had been born at the zoo; typical lifespan for such chimpanzees is 50–60 years. Following 36 hours with respiratory symptoms, lethargy, and decreased appetite, the chimpanzee died on October 25.

Postmortem examination revealed marked hepatic congestion and mild congestion of the small intestine. The heart was flaccid, and pale streaks were observed in the myocardium. On histographic examination, the lungs showed mild mononuclear interstitial infiltration, and there was marked infiltration in the myocardium consisting mainly of CD3 positive T lymphocytes mixed with a few granulocytes. In addition, multifocal severe myonecrosis was observed; cardiac myocytes were completely engulfed by inflammatory cells (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Postmortem tissue sections from chimpanzee with coxsackie virus B infection, Denmark. A) Myocardial section showing artifacts of freezing and a diffuse lymphocytic infiltration. Scale bar = 80 µm. B) Myocytic degeneration (arrows) is evident. Scale bar = 40 µm. C) CD3 marker reaction showing T lymphocytes. Scale bar = 40 µm.

One-step real-time PCR was performed on RNA extracted from blood, myocardial tissue, and feces to assay for the presence of enterovirus sequences. All results were strongly positive; cycle threshold values of samples were unusually low, in comparison with general values observed for enterovirus-infected samples from humans. On the basis of histopathologic and microbiologic findings, we concluded that the chimpanzee died from generalized infection by an enterovirus, which caused an overwhelming inflammation of the heart muscle.

Viral infections as a trigger or enhancer of type 1 diabetes?

Let's venture into an area that has preoccupied us for 10 years now: How do viral infections influence the development of type 1 diabetes? I will first discuss the current evidence in humans and mice that supports the hypothesis that viruses do in fact trigger or enhance the disease process. It is known that viruses, for example Coxsackie B, Rubella, and mumps, can directly infect and lyse β-cells. This has been demonstrated by Notkins and Yoon in 1984, where infection with Coxsackie B4 led to fulminant type 1 diabetes in a child and a mouse model. However, epidemiological evidence indicates that such rapid cases of type 1 diabetes are relatively uncommon. Our own studies published in 2004 have shown that molecular cross-reactivity or "molecular mimicry" between viral and β-cell antigens is unable to precipitate type 1 diabetes in a healthy animal. These data indicate that although viral infections have the potential to lyse β-cells, they do not commonly, in the absence of a vulnerable immune system, mediate onset of type 1 diabetes. If viral infections can be considered unlikely to commonly cause type 1 diabetes in humans by lysing all β-cells rapidly without participation of the immune system, what could their role in the diabetogenic process be?

Let me propose a concept to you that was brought forth by us and which might be called the "fertile-field" hypothesis, a termed coined by my collaborator, Lindsay Whitton. It goes like this: We know, as mentioned previously, that genetic predisposition probably accounts for the development of anti-islet autoimmunity, but not type 1 diabetes, in individuals at risk. What if certain viral infections that target the islets or pancreas create a "fertile field" for preexisting islet autoimmunity, resulting in its augmentation, increased β-cell destruction, and ultimately type 1 diabetes? Can we experimentally define the viral factors that can push a pre-diabetic or susceptible animal over the brink and cause type 1 diabetes? I want to share with you now some experimental data that supports this concept.

### Antiviral and immunoregulatory effects of curcumin on coxsackievirus B3-infected hepatitis [^111tm6MW]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

In Taiwan, enterovirus (EV) infections in children usually occur from April to June yearly. These annual epidemics are induced by different circulating serotypes, and neonatal EV (NEV) infections play an important role in this spectrum. Coxsackievirus B (CVB) 1 infected many young infants and caused myocarditis in the USA in 2007. In 1994 and 2005, two epidemics were caused by CVB1 and CVB3 in Taiwan, respectively. An echovirus 11 (Echo 11) outbreak led to the death of seven neonates in 2018, according to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The clinical manifestations of NEV infection range from mild illness, rash, herpangina, or aseptic meningitis to life-threatening severe complications, including encephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, or death. The disease severity varies with the serotypes. CVB3 is one of the most common serotypes in NEV infection and can cause organ damage in the heart, lung, liver, and central nervous system. Myocarditis commonly occurs with CVB3 infection worldwide, which leads to cardiomyocyte necrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy in neonates. Several outbreaks of NEV infection occurred in Taiwan, and most of the severe cases are related to fulminant hepatitis. In 1994–1997, five young infants developed fulminant hepatitis with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) due to CVB 1–4. Additionally, Echo11 infection cases were reported in 2018, and the major clinical presentations included hepatitis with DIC. NEV infections in young infants cause hepatic necrosis with DIC and increase levels of liver enzymes, including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), in the serum. The disease progresses rapidly and can be fatal.

### Papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome associated with B19V infection in a 6-year-old child [^113S6QtP]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

A 6 year-old girl was admitted for evaluation of a fever associated with a petechial rash of 2 days' duration. She was in good general condition with no acute distress. Inspection of the skin revealed an amazing papular and purpuric rash of predominantly acral and symmetrical distribution and sharply demarcated on the ankles. All laboratory tests were found normal. Rash and fever completely resolved in less than 3 days. Serological testing for parvovirus B19 (B19V) antibodies was positive for IgM but negative for IgG. Moreover, B19V DNA was detected in serum with a viral load of 2.24 × 10⁸ copies per mL. So we concluded of a paediatric case of popular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS) associated with B19V infection. PPGSS is an idiosyncratic reaction to viral infection. The syndrome has been associated with several viruses such as HHV6, measles, coxsackie B6, and above all B19V. PPGSS occurs mostly in young adults. It is characterised by a typical papular and purpuric rash with an acral distribution and a sharp demarcation on the wrists and ankles. The rash is often pruritic and can be accompanied by mucosal lesions and/or systemic symptoms such as fever, asthenia and lymphadenopathy. Most of the time, the disease is self-limited with a short course and a benign prognosis. A very similar disease has been described in some children. The distinctive clinical characteristics of PPGSS in children should be recognized by paediatrician in particular at the emergency room in order to avoid superfluous explorations.

### Dermatological spectrum of hand, foot and mouth disease from classical to generalized exanthema [^1144PPbU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is classically defined as a childhood fever accompanied by a rash with vesicles or erosions of the oral mucosa, hands, feet and sometimes the buttocks. Severe neurological complications are associated with enterovirus 71 outbreaks in Asia. Recently, it has been suggested that HFMD is related to coxsackie virus A6 (CV-A6) when there is an atypical rash. The objective of the study is to determine the dermatological pattern of HFMD and to identify the virus serotypes associated with a specific dermatological pattern.

Methods

A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 pediatric dermatology units in France from March 2010 to February 2012. All children with clinically suspected diagnosis of HFMD were included. Clinical data were collected and swabs from the nasopharynx and vesicles were taken for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and genotyping. Only children with confirmed HFMD — defined by clinical diagnosis of HFMD and positive enterovirus polymerase chain reaction results — were included for analysis.

Results

One hundred and four children consulted for suspected HFMD, including 89 (mean age: 25.7 months; sex ratio M/F 1.54) with confirmed HFMD. Seventy-eight (87.6%) had skin lesions on sites other than hand, feet and mouth. Thirty-seven (41.5%) had 5 or more anatomical sites involved (hand, feet and mouth, buttocks, legs, arms and trunk) considered as widespread exanthema. Widespread vesicular exanthema was observed with both CV-A6 and CV-A16. Peri-oral rash was associated with CV-A6 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

HFMD has a clinical spectrum ranging from classical to generalized vesicular exanthema. Generalized and atypical exanthema were observed with both CV-A6 and CV-A16 infections. CV-A6 is associated with peri-oral rash.

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^113LGa95]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, it's important to highlight the neurocognitive impacts of enterovirus infections, particularly in children. Coxsackieviruses CNS infections (CVA9, CVA6, CVA16, and CVB1-B4) in young infants revealed a neurodevelopmental delay with a decline in gross and fine motor function domains and a higher risk of developing epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. Hand, foot, and mouth disease patients with CNS complications caused by CVA16 may have sequelae motor, language, cognition, and adaptative behavior. Additionally, patients with enterovirus-induced encephalitis, including those caused by CVs, have a higher risk of developing (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) ADHD, which may rise with increased frequency of infection. Moreover, transplacental transmission of coxsackieviruses during pregnancy can raise the chance of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and mental retardation. A 28-year follow-up investigation carried out in a Finnish cohort of CNS infection revealed an increased risk of adult-onset schizophrenia and other psychoses in CVB5-infection patients during the newborn period. Recently, CVA13 was the most prevalent EV-type detected in patients with Nodding syndrome, a rare epileptic disorder of unknown cause occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Effects of glycine 64 substitutions in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on ribavirin sensitivity and pathogenicity of coxsackievirus A6 [^111iPdQm]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Enteroviruses (EVs) are the most common members of the Picornaviridae family. Human EVs comprise seven species, EV-A–D and rhinoviruses A–C, which are the main causative agents of pediatric infectious diseases. EV-A species cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD); among them, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has emerged as the predominant pathogen responsible for HFMD outbreaks in recent years: first in 2008 in Finland and then in several other countries. Although CVA6 infection is usually mild and self-limiting, some of the reported severe cases indicate that CVA6 may also lead to serious complications in the central nervous system, such as aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Therefore, the public health problems associated with CVA6 should not be underestimated.

### A season of aseptic meningitis in Germany: epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic aspects [^11128BpN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We assessed epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory features of aseptic meningitis during one season of multiserotype enteroviral meningitis in East Germany in 70 consecutive patients with aseptic meningitis admitted to the Children's University Hospital Leipzig.

Results

Patients, age 1 to 16 years, typically presented with headache, emesis and fever, whereas signs of meningeal irritation were only moderately expressed in one-half of the patients. The median number of leukocytes in the CSF was 151 cells/mm³ (range, 2 to 1,820) with a high percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). Initial blood counts showed mild leukocytosis and pronounced PMN predominance (78.9 ± 1.3%). The percentage of PMNs in the peripheral blood decreased in favor of mononuclear cells after 3 days to a pattern more compatible with viral infection as opposed to that suggestive for bacteria in the beginning. Mean cerebrospinal fluid values of protein, glucose and lactate and the C-reactive protein were mildly elevated or normal. Nonpolio enteroviruses were detected in 30 of 70 patients. Subsequent serotyping revealed echovirus type 13 (13 patients), type 6 (2), type 30 (1) and coxsackie B virus type 5 (2). There were no differences in demographic or clinical data between enterovirus positive and negative patients.

Conclusions

Even though individual laboratory values do not solely allow discrimination between viral and bacterial meningitis, the combined epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data facilitate the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis in most cases. Viral diagnostics, identifying echovirus type 13 that thus far has not been associated with epidemics of meningitis, adds important epidemiologic information.

### Epidemic myalgia in adults associated with human parechovirus type 3 infection, yamagata, Japan, 2008 [^116X844N]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

By conducting virus isolation, RT-PCR, and serologic examination, we confirmed an outbreak of epidemic myalgia among adults in Yonezawa, Yamagata, Japan, during June–August 2008 was associated with HPeV3 infection. Although we did not detect any virus in our first screening, direct sequencing analysis suggested that these patients were infected with HPeV3. We next tried to detect this virus specifically and isolated HPeV3 strains from the throat swabs or stool specimens of 7 patients; detected the virus genome in the throat swabs or stool or serum specimens of 11 patients; and observed seroconversion or 4-fold increases in antibodies against HPeV3 in 11 patients. Altogether, we confirmed HPeV3 infection in 14 of the 22 patients in this outbreak. All patients, except 1 who experienced complications related to epilepsy, recovered completely within 1 week after the onset of illness through treatment with antiinflammatory drugs only.

Enteroviruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human neuromuscular diseases because of their association with certain acute and chronic acquired myopathies and paralytic motor neuron syndromes. Epidemic pleurodynia (Bornholm disease), an acute febrile illness with myalgia caused by picornaviruses such as group B coxsackieviruses, is perhaps best known. However, in this outbreak, none of the patients showed the chest and abdominal pain typical of pleurodynia; they instead showed muscular weakness, which is not generally observed in epidemic pleurodynia. Conversely, it has been reported that patients with acute enterovirus myositis experience fever, chills, myalgia, and generalized weakness and that thigh muscle or generalized muscle involvement may occur. Among these patients, laboratory studies may demonstrate myoglobinemia, myoglobinuria, and an elevated levels of muscle enzymes such as CPK. The HPeV3 outbreak in Yonezawa resembles these descriptions of acute myositis outbreaks; patients commonly had fever, myalgia, and muscle weakness mainly in the arms and legs, and laboratory findings and MRI studies suggested the presence acute inflammation around the peripheral muscles. Thus, we concluded that the disease in this outbreak was an acute inflammatory muscle disease associated with HPeV3 infection in adults.

### Severe enterovirus infections in hospitalized children in the south of england: clinical phenotypes and causative genotypes [^113M5juM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background:

Most enterovirus surveillance studies lack detailed clinical data, which limits their clinical usefulness. This study aimed to describe the clinical spectrum and outcome of severe enterovirus infections in children, and to determine whether there are associations between causative enterovirus genotypes and clinical phenotypes.

Methods:

Retrospective analysis of microbiological and clinical data from a tertiary children's hospital in the South of England over a 17-month period (2012–2013).

Results:

In total, 30 patients were identified, comprising sepsis (n = 9), myocarditis (n = 8), meningitis (n = 8) and encephalitis (n = 5). Cases with sepsis or myocarditis were significantly younger than those with central nervous system disease (median age 21 and 15 days vs. 79 days; P = 0.0244 and P = 0.0310, respectively). There was considerable diversity in the causative genotypes in each of the clinical phenotypes, with some predominance of echoviruses in the meningitis group, and coxsackie B viruses in the myocarditis group. Thirteen cases required mechanical ventilation, 11 cases inotropic support, 3 cases dialysis and 3 cases extracorporal membrane oxygenation. The overall mortality was 10% (sepsis group, n = 1; myocarditis group, n = 2). Of the survivors, 5 (19%) had long-term sequelae (myocardial dysfunction, n = 2; neurological sequelae, n = 3). Patients with encephalitis had the longest hospital stay (median: 16 days), compared with 9, 6 and 3 days in patients with myocarditis, sepsis and meningitis, respectively (P = 0.005).

Conclusions:

Enterovirus infections, particularly enteroviral myocarditis and encephalitis, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The results show that there are currently no strong associations between clinical phenotypes and particular causative enterovirus genotypes in the South of England.

Myocarditis

Myocarditis is an inflammatory process that affects the heart muscle and can cause rare, yet devastating HF in neonates. Myocarditis has been classified as both an inflammatory and infectious cause of cardiomyopathies, which is reflective of its myriad presentations range from minimal symptoms to severe HF and sudden death. Myocarditis accounts for approximately 15% of patients with DCM in children, but is less common in neonates (although it may be under-reported;). Although the incidence in neonates is decreasing, it remains a significant complication of infection. Neonatal infectious myocarditis can be caused by several viruses (Coxsackie B, parvovirus, herpes simplex, and adenovirus) or bacteria (group B streptococcal), but is predominantly caused by Coxsackie B. Neonatal Coxsackie B myocarditis can affect both full-term and preterm infants and usually presents within the first week of age. The signs of neonatal myocarditis are nonspecific and range from mild respiratory or gastrointestinal illness to significant meningoencephalitis. Manifestations include congestive HF, tachycardia, and electrocardiographic changes.

In neonates, cardiac muscle involvement is more prominent and the myocardial damage primarily occurs due to direct lysis of infected myocytes during the initial viral infection phase. In the second stage, the inflammatory phase, activation of the host immune system by the primary viral infection causes myocellular damage that results in myocardial dysfunction (often LV) leading to impaired contractility and HF. The acute myocarditis is commonly followed by complete recovery of LV function, but can progress to a secondary DCM with chronic HF. During this third phase, some neonates will develop significant arrhythmias (atrial or ventricular), conduction disturbances, or circulatory collapse. This cardiovascular collapse may occur several days after the onset of the sepsis-like illness during this second wave of a biphasic pattern of infection. The prognosis for neonates that develop myocarditis varies. Neonatal myocarditis can be fatal in early infection. However, for patients that survive the acute illness, recovery with few long-term sequelae may be seen. Full recovery can be prolonged and associated arrhythmias may persist for months afterwards.

### Coxsackievirus B vaccines prevent infection-accelerated diabetes in NOD mice and have No disease-inducing effect [^113i3Fzw]. Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Enteroviruses, including the Coxsackievirus Bs (CVB), have been implicated as causal agents in human type 1 diabetes. Immunization of at-risk individuals with a CVB vaccine provides an attractive strategy for elucidating the role of CVBs in the disease etiology. Previously, we have shown that an inactivated whole-virus vaccine covering all CVB serotypes (CVB1-6) is safe to administer and highly immunogenic in preclinical models, including nonhuman primates. Before initiating clinical trials with this type of vaccine, it was also important to address 1) whether the vaccine itself induces adverse immune reactions, including accelerating diabetes onset in a diabetes-prone host, and 2) whether the vaccine can prevent CVB-induced diabetes in a well-established disease model. Here, we present results from studies in which female NOD mice were left untreated, mock-vaccinated, or vaccinated with CVB1-6 vaccine and monitored for insulitis occurrence or diabetes development. We demonstrate that vaccination induces virus-neutralizing antibodies without altering insulitis scores or the onset of diabetes. We also show that NOD mice vaccinated with a CVB1 vaccine are protected from CVB-induced accelerated disease onset. Taken together, these studies show that CVB vaccines do not alter islet inflammation or accelerate disease progression in an animal model that spontaneously develops autoimmune type 1 diabetes. However, they can prevent CVB-mediated disease progression in the same model.

### Cranial ultrasound in neonatal brain infections [^111sHZeg]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Enterovirus/parechovirus

Infections with enterovirus and HPeV (Figure 12) can be mild and self‐limiting but may also run a fulminant course. Encephalitis is more commonly seen caused by enterovirus than HPeV, but the latter may run a more severe course. As clinical presentation and neuroimaging findings are similar, the two are discussed together. Enterovirus and HPeV are small non‐enveloped RNA viruses and belong to the Picornaviridae. They are subdivided into several serotypes. HPeV type 3 is associated with neonatal encephalitis. Neonates can be admitted with fever, rash, irritability, feeding problems, and/or diarrhoea. Group B coxsackie virus and echovirus 11 are often associated with systemic neonatal infection, and myocarditis is a well‐known complication. Most neonates acquire the infection in the perinatal period from a symptomatic mother or sibling. Perinatally acquired enterovirus and HPeV infection have their clinical onset between postnatal days 3 and 7. For both enterovirus and HPeV encephalitis, CUS can show similar abnormalities with diffuse periventricular hyperechogenicity, resembling extensive periventricular leukomalacia. Involvement of the external capsule and the frontal white matter can be seen, especially in HPeV3. Cystic evolution may ensue and can be detected by serial CUS; it is therefore important to perform serial scanning. Cysts are more likely to develop in infants born (late) preterm than the term neonates. In case of cystic evolution, the infant is more likely to have a poor neurodevelopmental outcome.

### Notes from the field: respiratory viral panel as an early diagnostic tool for neonatal enterovirus infection-san diego, California 2023 [^111yhHXy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Preliminary Conclusions and Actions

Enterovirus infection can be life-threatening in the early neonatal period. At the time of this cluster, countries in Europe were reporting echovirus 11 infection in neonates. Coxsackie B4 and B5, but not echovirus 11, were identified among the patients described in this report. In a review of clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infections during 2000–2020, in cases where virus serotype was known, 82.7% of cases resulted from Coxsackie B viruses and 16.7% from echoviruses. Data from the U.S. National Enterovirus Surveillance System showed that Coxsackie B viruses and echoviruses were also the most common groups of enteroviruses reported among U.S. neonates.

Maternal illness is reported in association with neonatal enterovirus infection and is a likely source of infection for infants with early illness. Details of maternal symptoms in this cluster of patients were not available for review; however, symptoms attributed to chorioamnionitis and endometritis might also have been due to maternal enterovirus infection.

Detection of rhinovirus-enterovirus among the five patients at illness onset, despite absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms, led to high suspicion of enterovirus and thus a targeted neonatal sepsis workup. Timely RVP testing is not always performed for neonates. If rapid on-site enterovirus-specific RT-PCR testing is not available, including nasopharyngeal RVP testing as part of the neonatal sepsis workup, particularly during summer and fall, could facilitate diagnosis of neonatal enterovirus infection. Timely identification facilitates optimal clinical management for the infant, which might include receipt of IGIV and possibly antiviral medication.

### Coxsackie B virus serology and type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review of published case-control studies [^112j5w63]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Enteroviruses, in particular Coxsackie B4, have been implicated in the aetiology of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the epidemiological evidence has not been systematically evaluated.

Methods

Systematic review of evidence from published controlled studies of the relationship between Coxsackie B virus serology and incident or prevalent Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Studies were identified through a Medline search (1966 to 2002), supplemented by references from identified papers and hand search of relevant journals. All studies (full papers, abstracts or letters) with data adequate for calculation of unadjusted odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for Type 1 diabetes mellitus in relation to Coxsackie B virus serology were included.

Results

The review included 26 case-control studies; no cohort study met the inclusion criteria. Odds ratios for Type 1 diabetes mellitus in serology-positive vs. serology-negative subjects ranged from 0.2 to 22.3. For Coxsackie B (any serotype) 7/13 studies had point estimates significantly greater than 1.0 (P < 0.05). For Coxsackie B3, Coxsackie B4 and Coxsackie B5-specific assays, 1/11, 6/17 and 1/11 studies, respectively, had point estimates significantly greater than 1.0. Summary odds ratios were not calculated because of doubts about the validity of individual study estimates, heterogeneity between studies, and the possibility of publication bias.

Conclusions

The results of these studies are inconsistent and do not provide convincing evidence for or against an association between Coxsackie B virus infection and Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Better designed studies using effective assays are needed to resolve this important issue.

Coxsackievirus B3 can cause severe neonatal disease with high mortality. We present the first report of detection of coxsackievirus B3 in the mothers' milk of 2 severely infected neonates by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive tool to detect coxsackievirus B3 in breast milk within few hours. By 12 to 14 days after onset of symptoms, coxsackievirus B3 could not be detected in the breast milk of the symptomatic mothers.

### Current perspectives on erythema multiforme [^116SS1Tf]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Recognition and timely adequate treatment of erythema multiforme remain a major challenge. In this review, current diagnostic guidelines, potential pitfalls, and modern/novel treatment options are summarized with the aim to help clinicians with diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. The diagnosis of erythema multiforme, that has an acute, self-limiting course, is based on its typical clinical picture of targetoid erythematous lesions with predominant acral localization as well as histological findings. Clinically, erythema multiforme can be differentiated into isolated cutaneous and combined mucocutaneous forms. Atypical erythema multiforme manifestations include lichenoid or granulomatous lesions as well as lesional infiltrates of T cell lymphoma and histiocytes. Herpes simplex virus infection being the most common cause, other infectious agents like-especially in children-Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis C virus, Coxsackie virus, and Epstein Barr virus may also trigger erythema multiforme. The second most frequently identified cause of erythema multiforme is drugs. In different studies, e.g., allopurinol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid, antibacterial sulfonamides, penicillins, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, tetracyclines, chlormezanone, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, as well as different TNF-α inhibitors such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept were reported as possible implicated drugs. Recently, cases of erythema multiforme associated with vaccination, immunotherapy for melanoma, and even with topical drugs like imiquimod have been described. In patients with recurrent herpes simplex virus-associated erythema multiforme, the topical prophylactic treatment with acyclovir does not seem to prevent further episodes of erythema multiforme. In case of resistance to one virostatic drug, the switch to an alternative drug, and in patients non-responsive to virostatic agents, the use of dapsone as well as new treatment options, e.g. JAK-inhibitors or apremilast, might be considered.

### Clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infection: a systematic review [^112Kv2uE]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We systematically searched for relevant studies in the following English databases: PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. We limited our search to English language articles published between January 1, 2000, and November 27, 2020. We also reviewed the references of all the included articles and major reviews. We combined all search records of databases using Endnote 9.1, which was used to manage and de-duplicate records. The following medical subject headings were used: "Enterovirus Infections", "Coxsackievirus Infections", "Echovirus Infections", "Infant, Newborn". The detailed search strategy for PubMed is shown in Frame s 1.

The titles and abstracts of the searched citations were screened for a full-text review by two independent reviewers. Two independent reviewers evaluated full-text articles using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved by discussion with the entire review team. Studies were included if they met the inclusion criteria: (1) primary research articles, (2) study on the clinical characteristics of severe neonatal enterovirus infections. A severe neonatal enterovirus infection was defined as the presence of severe diseases such as myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, coagulopathy, sepsis, and other life-threatening diseases. The diagnostic test criteria for enterovirus infections included positive enterovirus cultures or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the patient samples, (3) study published in English language, (4) study with complete diagnosis and treatment process of severe neonatal enterovirus infections. The exclusion criteria were: (1) study designed to evaluate the risk factors or virus serotypes that included only the number or proportion of patients without clinical characteristics, (2) study about non-severe neonatal enterovirus infection, (3) study with only abstract, (4) reviews.

### Acute viral myocarditis [^113rZ4nZ]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Pathophysiological process of virus myocarditis.

Two important observations in the progression of virus infection to heart failure remain unclear. First, patients with initial fulminant myocarditis that require intense haemodynamic support rapidly recover within days and have a better long-term prognosis when compared with patients with (sub)acute myocarditis, which have a worse prognosis due to development of DCM. The precise reason for this difference is uncertain. One may postulate that a fulminant inflammatory reaction, which is able to clear the virus, may induce temporal stunning and dysfunction of the myocardium. These patients probably do not enter the second phase of viral-injury-mediated autoimmune responses, whereas patients with virus persistence due to a (sub)acute, but insufficient inflammatory reaction, are more prone to chronic autoimmune inflammation and injury of the heart.

Secondly, it remains unclear why some patients develop myocarditis. The cardiotropic viruses causing myocarditis, including adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), parvovirus B19 (PVB19) and cytomegalovirus are common cough viruses. Although up to 90% of people will catch one or more of these viruses in their life without getting their heart affected, only a selected few develop clinical symptoms. The exact incidence of myocarditis remains unclear, partly due to the insensitivity of diagnostic tools used in previous studies. This may cause an underestimation of its true incidence. The prevalence of myocarditis has been found to be up to 42% in cases of unexplained deaths in people aged 35 or younger. – Therefore, a certain genetic background, either or not related to immune alterations, appears to be a requisite to develop clinical symptoms of myocarditis and/or progression to DCM following virus infection in the heart. A recent review, by Caforio and Iliceto, shows that in myocarditis/DCM, cardiac-specific and disease-specific antibodies of IgG class are potential biomarkers for identifying 'at-risk' relatives. As such, it has been shown that dystrophin mutations may facilitate myocarditis and cardiac failure during coxsackievirus B3 infection, whereas dystrophin and/or sarcoglycan disruption by viral proteases account for myocardial injury. Future research should therefore focus on the understanding of the underlying genetic susceptibility and related immune responses that explain why some persons are susceptible to develop clinical symptoms of myocarditis following viral infection, whereas others 'spontaneously' improve afterwards or progress to an 'idiopathic' DCM afterwards (Figure 2).

### Enterovirus infections: a review of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115s6C8u]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The enteroviruses, RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family, are ubiquitous pathogens which include more than 70 different serotypes that infect people of all ages and tend to occur seasonally in the summer and fall. Clinical manifestations may vary diversely with one serotype, while multiple serotypes can present with identical symptoms and may mimic bacterial infections. Most enterovirus infections cause benign, self-limiting disease; however, they can also produce severe and sometimes fatal illnesses such as meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, neonatal sepsis, and polio. Severe enterovirus infections are being diagnosed and treated earlier with better prognostic outcomes due to the advances of polymerase chain reaction technology in accurately detecting virus in patient fluids as well as the recent development of new antiviral therapies.

### Enterovirus infections in hospitals of ile de France region over 2013 [^113DYMzr]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The monitoring and genotyping of Enterovirus (EV) infections can help to associate particular or severe clinical manifestations with specific EV types and to identify the aetiology of infectious outbreaks.

Objectives

To describe the epidemiological features of EV infections diagnosed during the year 2013 in the Greater Paris area (Ile de France).

Study Design

During 2013, 2497 samples taken from 470 patients in 33 hospitals of Ile-de France were tested for EV genome by RT-PCR. EV genotyping was performed by the National Reference Centre (NRC) laboratories. EV infections were retrospectively reviewed by retrieving clinical and genotyping data from the NRC database.

Results

Of the 2497 samples, 490 (19.6%) was positive for EV genome detection. These EV infections represented 88.7% and 24.1%, respectively, of all reported regional and national infections. Twenty-seven different genotypes were identified. Echovirus 30 (E-30) accounted for 54.1% of all characterized strains and caused a large outbreak. Four severe neonatal infections were reported, of which two were caused by EV-A71. Respiratory infections involving EV-D68 were observed in two adults. One fatal case of Coxsackievirus A2-associated myocarditis was reported.

Conclusion

Monitoring EV infections in combination with EV genotyping via the French EV network characterized the epidemiology of EV infections in the Ile de France region in 2013 and documented severe EV infections associated with EV-A71 or CV-A2.

### Recurrent pericarditis: infectious or autoimmune? [^112sBMM9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) remain controversial standing like a bridge that crosses infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways. Anything may cause acute pericarditis; Echo-virus, and Coxsackie are the most frequently involved viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnetii the most common bacteria, but in 85% of cases it remains "idiopathic". Recurrences occur in up to 20–50% of patients. An immuno-mediated pathogenesis is suggested by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pericardial fluid, the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) in sera of the patients, the occurrence of new autoimmune diagnoses and the good response to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be used at recommended dosages, till the resolution of symptoms and normalization of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Corticosteroids should be used rarely, at low doses, with an extremely low tapering and with osteoporosis prevention. Colchicine leads to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit, reducing recurrences by 50%. The long term outcome of IRAP is good, without evidence of constriction even after a very long follow-up.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: case report and literature review [^115Wq16x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a self-limiting disease with common clinical manifestations of neck pain spreading to the jaw or ears, accompanied by mild to moderate fever, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis with tenderness on palpation of the thyroid gland. The etiology of SAT is still unknown, and virus infections such as coxsackie virus, adenovirus and influenza virus were previously thought to be the predisposing factors of SAT. A small number of atypical SAT cases without neck pain or tenderness have been reported in the literature. Thus, attention should be paid to SAT in clinical practice.

Herein, we report a patient with simple acute headache who did not have typical thyroid pain and was misdiagnosed as meningitis. His headache symptoms were associated with SAT, and his symptoms gradually resolved with SAT treatment. At present, headache caused by Graves' disease and painless thyroiditis has occasionally been reported, but no detailed cases of headache caused by SAT have been reported.

### Aseptic meningitis [^116VGm4Y]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight some of the recent key epidemiologic and clinical diagnostic dilemmas of aseptic meningitis and to evaluate some tests that may help distinguish aseptic compared with bacterial meningitis.

Recent Findings

Enteroviruses remain the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Certain enteroviruses (e.g. coxsackie B5, echovirus 6, 9 and 30) are more likely to cause meningitis outbreaks, while others (coxsackie A9, B3 and B4) are mostly endemic. Nucleic acid tests are more sensitive than cultures in diagnosing enteroviral infections. In centers where the turnaround time for these tests is less than 24 h, there can be substantial cost savings and avoidance of unnecessary treatment of aseptic meningitis with antibiotics. Serum and stool specimens are important adjunct samples for diagnosing enteroviral infections in children. Cerebrospinal fluid protein (≥ 0.5 g/l) and serum procalcitonin (≥ 0.5 ng/ml) appear to be useful laboratory markers for distinguishing between bacterial and aseptic meningitis in children aged 28 days to 16 years, but they have relatively low sensitivity and specificity.

Summary

Enteroviruses are the major causes of aseptic meningitis. The major focus of diagnosis remains ruling out bacterial infection or confirming enteroviral etiology of infection. Properly implemented nucleic acid tests have the potential to reduce cost and unnecessary treatment.

### Acute unilateral maculopathy associated with adult onset of hand, foot and mouth disease: a case report [^112xwznB]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common and highly contagious infectious disease caused by Coxsackie viruses which belong to the Picornaviridae family of viruses. In Germany 80.000 to 140.000 cases are reported per year according to data of the Robert Koch Institut. It predominantly affects children and is characterized by fever and maculopapular or vesicular erupions on the hands, feet, and inside the mouth. Symptoms and rash normally disappear spontaneously within a week. However, systemic complications are possible such as gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms, meningoencephalitis, and cardiac inflammation. Ocular complications such as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iridocyclitis, scattered hemorrhagic dots, and occlusive retinal vasculitis can rarely occur and result in temporary vision loss.

Here we report the case of a 31-year-old patient with HFMD and concurrent acute monocular maculopathy and describe multimodal imaging findings, including previously undescribed optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).
