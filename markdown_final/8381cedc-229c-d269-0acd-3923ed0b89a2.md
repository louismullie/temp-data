## Question

A 38-year-old project manager is told by her boss that her team will need to work on an additional project in the coming week for a very important client. This frustrates the woman, who already feels that she works too many hours. Instead of discussing her feelings directly with her boss, the woman leaves a voice message for her boss the next day and deceitfully says she cannot come to work for the next week because of a family emergency. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is this individual demonstrating?
A. Acting out
B. Passive aggression
C. Malingering
D. Blocking

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which psychological defense mechanism best fits a scenario in which a frustrated employee avoids confronting her boss and instead feigns a family emergency to skip work. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core elements of the behavior and whether they reflect indirect expression of anger. Then, I should verify the definitions of the candidate mechanisms and eliminate those that don't match. Next, I will compare the closest options, especially passive aggression versus malingering, and check for subtle distinctions. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and briefly consider implications for management and communication strategies.

> Let me first confirm the behavioral pattern. The employee is angry about added workload, avoids direct communication, and expresses her resentment indirectly by fabricating a reason to be absent, which signals covert hostility rather than open confrontation or a lapse in memory or inhibition [^notfound].

> I need to check the definition of passive aggression. Passive aggression involves expressing anger indirectly through procrastination, sarcasm, forgetfulness, or deceptive excuses, rather than stating feelings openly; the key is that the aggression is covert and the person avoids direct confrontation, which aligns with leaving a deceptive voicemail to avoid work rather than discussing the issue with the boss [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the other options before concluding. Acting out typically refers to impulsive, disruptive behaviors that violate norms or rules in a more overt way, such as outbursts or reckless actions; this case is indirect and deceptive, not openly disruptive, so acting out doesn't fit as well. Blocking is a temporary inability to recall or access thoughts, which isn't present here. Malingering involves intentional fabrication of symptoms or disability to achieve a tangible external incentive, like financial gain or avoiding duty; while there's deception, the motivational frame is more about indirect expression of anger than feigning illness for a material benefit, so passive aggression remains closer to the psychological mechanism in play [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuance between passive aggression and malingering. Malingering is primarily about external gain via falsified impairment, whereas passive aggression is about indirectly expressing anger or resistance; here, the absence of direct confrontation and the use of a deceptive excuse to avoid work map more cleanly onto passive aggression than malingering, even though both involve deception. I initially wondered if malingering might apply because the excuse is false, but the motivational context and the indirect hostility point back to passive aggression [^notfound].

> Let me consider the broader context to ensure consistency. Workplace stress and conflicting demands can precipitate indirect coping and resentment, reinforcing the plausibility of passive-aggressive responses when employees feel unable to assert themselves directly; this fits with observed patterns of job strain and avoidance behaviors in occupational settings [^7bdc280c].

> I should double-check my conclusion. Given the indirect expression of anger, avoidance of direct communication, and the deceptive excuse to absent herself, the best-fitting defense mechanism is passive aggression, with the caveat that the behavior is maladaptive and likely to perpetuate workplace conflict if unaddressed [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **passive aggression**. The woman is expressing anger indirectly by avoiding direct confrontation and using a deceptive excuse to avoid work, which is a hallmark of passive-aggressive behavior [^notfound]. Acting out involves overt, impulsive behavior; malingering is intentional deception for external gain; and blocking is a temporary memory lapse — none of which fit this scenario.

---

## Analysis of defense mechanisms

### Passive aggression

Passive aggression involves **indirect expression of anger or resentment**, often through procrastination, sarcasm, or deceptive behavior. Here, the woman avoids direct communication and uses a fabricated family emergency to express frustration, which is a classic passive-aggressive response [^notfound].

---

### Acting out

Acting out involves **overt, impulsive behavior** that violates social norms or expectations, such as angry outbursts or reckless actions. The woman's behavior is indirect and covert, not impulsive or overt, so acting out does not apply.

---

### Malingering

Malingering is **intentional deception** to achieve a tangible external incentive, such as financial gain or avoiding responsibility. While the woman is deceptive, her primary motivation appears to be indirect expression of anger rather than a clear external reward, making malingering less accurate.

---

### Blocking

Blocking is a **temporary inability to recall information** or perform a task due to anxiety or stress. There is no evidence of memory lapse or inability to perform here; the woman deliberately chooses to deceive, so blocking does not fit.

---

## Conclusion

The woman's behavior best matches **passive aggression**, as she indirectly expresses anger and avoids direct confrontation by using a deceptive excuse to avoid work [^notfound].

Emotional health issues for families of deployed emergency response workers — support strategies include to "Provide family members with as much information as possible about the disaster and deployment" and, "As a second possible strategy, assign a specific liaison from your organization to family members". Guidance notes that "Family members should understand that deployed staff usually work very long hours in very stressful and emotional conditions", and "In many cases, they may be exposed to scenes of suffering, possible destruction, and the strong emotions, anger, and loss that victims experience". On return, "When a family member returns from a disaster scene, he or she may need time to adjust to the normal pace of everyday life and may require additional rest", and "It is important for family members to be able to talk to one another about what happened and the emotions that accompanied the work", recognizing that "Sometimes, deployed workers do not want to burden family with these stories". Emotions may be "proud, frustrated, angry, sad, tearful, and happy all at the same time", and "It may take some time to sort out these conflicting emotions and share them". "Returning deployed workers also may seem overly preoccupied with the disaster experiences and may not seem to share in excitement, disappointment, or frustration about events at home", and "The disaster experience tends to overshadow everyday events and puts them in a different perspective". "Often, emergency response workers return home with a conscious or unconscious need to reassure themselves about the safety of their environment" and "Response workers often feel that they left something undone or that they could have done more", so "Time, understanding, empathy, and support from family are important to readjustment".

Grief contexts and influencing factors — certain deaths can bring additional psychological harm and require special sensitivity, and growth is identified as the desired outcome of grieving. Premature death or "death out of time" can be accompanied by additional psychological harm, and the death of someone not sick or advanced in age, such as a healthy child, can be particularly difficult; people communicating to those experiencing such losses must be especially aware of how this grief is experienced. The person and the context of the death will affect the grieving process, and several other factors may also influence it, including the circumstances of the death, the relationship with the deceased, history of loss, and secondary losses such as no longer fitting into a social group or the loss of a dream.

Fostering Confidence and Hope

In facilitating the construction and sharing of individual members' narratives, the counselor can highlight personal and family assets and strengths while underscoring past successes in dealing with similar challenges. The counselor can also identify problematic misattributions or distortions as family members process the different experiences and perceptions contained in their individual narratives. This may include calling upon family members to challenge or clarify problematic attributions, such as a circumstance in which one family member feels inappropriately responsible for a negative outcome or misconstrues the actions of another family member.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?", "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?", "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?", and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes", with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior".

Family physicians often treat patients who are experiencing psychological or medical crises. Any event perceived as overwhelming by the patient may trigger a crisis reaction consisting of psychological and physiological symptoms. Physicians are encouraged to assist patients who are experiencing a crisis by: (1) providing reassurance and support; (2) evaluating the nature of the problem and determining the patient's mental, psychiatric, suicidal or homicidal, and medical statuses; (3) ensuring the safety of the patient and others; (4) assisting the patient in developing an action plan that minimizes distress, and obtaining patient commitment to the plan; and (5) following up with the patient and other relevant persons to ensure follow-through, assess progress, and provide additional assistance and support. Medication or referral for psychiatric or psychological counseling may be necessary for patients with continuing problems.

### "She's not ready to give up yet! ": when a family member overrides the patient's medical decisions [^05c9ed12]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2021). Medium credibility.

Autonomy, which gives individuals the right to make informed decisions about their medical treatment, is a central principle in Western bioethics. However, we often encounter patients for whom a family member seems to dominate medical decision-making, to the extent that clinicians become concerned that the patient is subject to excessive pressure or even coercion. In this article, we describe one such case and how we assess a decision-making process that involves family influence. This entails acknowledging that many individuals weigh their family members' preferences and/or well-being heavily in making medical decisions, and family norms for decision-making differ. A family member who tells their loved one "You can't give up now" is typically not ursurping the patient's liberty to make a different decision. However, there are some family influences which may be autonomy-limiting, including credible threats, or in situations of abuse. Aside from these scenarios, our role is not to alter a couple's long-standing dynamics and decision-making processes. However, for the patient who wants to assert herself, we can set the stage in a family meeting and amplify her voice. We must also attend to the emotional level of family members' statements. "I won't let you give up" might be more a statement of grief rather than a true reflection of their values or intent. Supporting the family member's coping may help to bring together what initially seem to be divergent goals. Exploring these decision-making dynamics is key to providing good palliative care.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) features and management — unique identifying PTSD features may include re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance and numbing symptoms, symptoms of increased arousal, symptoms that last for at least one month, and significant distress or impairment of functioning. PTSD sufferers tend to have abnormal levels of key hormones involved in response to stress, with some studies showing that cortisol levels are lower than normal and epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are higher than normal; when people are in danger, they produce high levels of opiates, and PTSD sufferers continue to produce those higher levels even after the danger has passed. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they're no longer in danger, and the main treatments for people with PTSD are psychotherapy, medications, or both.

### Public perspectives on decisions about emergency care seeking for care unrelated to COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic [^e489574d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

When respondents were faced with hypothetical, serious symptoms, up to 1 in 4 had preferences consistent with forgoing potentially life-saving ED care to avoid COVID-19 exposure. This finding suggests that during the current COVID-19 pandemic and future infectious outbreaks, health care systems and public health organizations should develop communication strategies for patients and the community at large that describe the institutions' safety measures to reassure and encourage timely health care for critical and routine needs. Moreover, additional research examining pathogen-avoidance psychology is needed to inform development of novel, effective strategies that support appropriate care seeking not only for current and potential future outbreaks of COVID-19, but also for any scenario that could promote maladaptive pathogen-avoidance behaviors.

Enhancing Selected Family Resiliency Skills

Specific parent skill sets and family-level coping strategies can help families anticipate, plan for and mitigate the impact of stressful events, and improve child adjustment (Saltzman et al; Spoth et al.). Randomized controlled trials of resilience-enhancing family programs have identified specific parent- and family-level skills as being effective in improving child outcomes over time (Beardslee et al; Layne et al.). These core skills include stress management and emotion regulation, collaborative goal setting and problem solving, and managing trauma and loss reminders.

Although normally applied to individuals, stress management and emotion regulation skills can be effectively leveraged at the family level to enhance resilience. For example, family members can be trained to collectively identify and anticipate stressful situations, monitor idiosyncratic expressions of distress among different family members, poll individual family members for desired forms of support, and to provide appropriate types of support in a timely and developmentally appropriate manner. Families may be coached to develop a shared vocabulary and method for checking in with one another's emotional or stress status, and to practice using a specific set of coping strategies including relaxation, distraction, activity planning, cognitive reframing, and positive messaging to assist each other in modulating family stress and reactivity (Lester et al; Saltzman et al.). Families can also profit from training in collaborative goal setting and problem solving. Families impacted by ongoing stress and impaired parenting may be disorganized and lack proactive strategies for managing problems or including family members in decision making and planning (Beavers and Hampson; Ryan et al.). The result can be a chaotic or rigidly closed family structure in which individual members feel isolated, marginalized, and out of control. Establishing a collaborative and explicit process by which family members may jointly voice preferences and develop coordinated plans of action can increase a sense of connectedness and control. Training in these collaborative family-level skills that invite joint participation and shared decision making can also generalize to other areas of family functioning and increase the family's adaptive and resilient potential (Walsh). Managing combat and deployment stress reminders can be an essential skill for families in which members are reactive to cues that remind them of highly stressful or traumatic experiences. Research has delineated separate classes of reminders related to specific trauma experiences (e.g. the backfire of a car, hot and dry weather, or uncontrolled crowds at malls and stores – all potential reminders that may evoke stressful memories of combat or danger) and to loss experiences (e.g. specific times, activities, or settings, which remind an individual of the absence of a deceased loved one or the traumatic circumstances of the death) (Layne et al.). These cues may evoke such reactions as abrupt mood shifts, withdrawal, or shifts in behavior that are confusing and disruptive to family relations. Such cues may contribute to family disengagement and conflict and may undermine supportive familial transactions. In addition to education about the impact of reminders, parents and children are taught to identify personal- and family-level triggers and to develop collaborative strategies for modulating their impact (Layne et al; Pynoos et al.).

### Does COVID-19 count? defining criterion A trauma for diagnosing PTSD during a global crisis [^9610ff05]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

A strict, conservative approach to conferring a PTSD diagnosis, in which the identification of a "true" Criterion A trauma serves as a gateway element, requires that some aspect of the traumatic exposure was "sudden" and "catastrophic". Under these restrictions, a chronic threat of potential virus exposure, actual infection, active COVID symptoms, or even death would not be sufficient to merit Criterion A status and thus would preclude a diagnosis of PTSD. Indeed, for any medical event to meet PTSD's Criterion A, as highlighted in the supporting DSM‐5 text, it must occur under traumatic circumstances (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, anaphylactic shock, and severe respiratory distress).

We must also emphasize that we are not suggesting that COVID‐related Criterion A traumas be minimized or that this clinical manifestation of PTSD does not exist. Numerous reports, anecdotal and empirical, from the early literature present examples that undoubtedly satisfy Criterion A (Rodriguez et al.). These include events in which there was a sufficiently high probability of harm or death with clear, direct exposure to the threat, such as patients with severe respiratory distress who were admitted to intensive care units and either experienced themselves or witnessed near‐death encounters with devastating features and robust psychological effects (de Graaf et al.). Having a family member or friend who is a frontline worker could begin to be considered as a Criterion A event if the frontline worker was exposed to graphic details of death and dying then subsequently and repeatedly relayed these details to the vicariously traumatized individual.

Representative, but not exclusive, examples of COVID‐related experiences meeting Criterion A are as follows:
1 Extreme anxiety/panic and fear of death during severe respiratory distress.
2 Being overwhelmed by the magnitude of exposure to/witnessing severely ill and dying COVID patients as a health‐care worker or exposure as a health‐care worker without adequate personal protective equipment.
3 Being a family member or close personal friend of a child, parent or partner, and then subsequently learning about that individual's experience (e.g. indirect exposure) with extreme anxiety/panic and fear of death during severe respiratory distress.

### Mental health and well-being of anaesthetists during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review [^54b5b3a9]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of the anaesthetist is often stressful. Everyday practice involves working in an unpredictable and dynamic environment where errors can lead to patient harm. The onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in early 2020 led to increased concern about the additional physical and psychological demands on this important subset of healthcare workers. With their expertise in airway management, many anaesthetists were re‐assigned from operating theatres to ICUs. As a consequence, they have been at potentially increased risk of contracting COVID‐19 infection due to exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosols during airway procedures. Compounding these concerns, pandemic‐related pressures included: workplace changes; surgical backlogs; staff and equipment shortages; carrying out tasks wearing personal protective equipment (PPE); witnessing patients and colleagues dying; and interactions with distressed families of patients.

Additional workplace pressures of this nature can lead to increased psychological distress and burnout, which is characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment. Burnout and poor well‐being are associated with: lower work performance; impaired decision‐making; risk of medical errors and reduced patient safety; depression and suicidal ideation; sleep disorders; alcohol and drug use; and clinician attrition. This compounds the existing concern that anaesthetists are already at increased risk of suicide compared with the general population.

Although disruptions to essential healthcare services still persist well into the third year of the COVID‐19 pandemic, responses have evolved with the introduction of vaccines, treatment protocols and improved PPE and equipment supply chains. The focus of practice has shifted toward the resumption of business as usual, including the restoration of primary care, management of elective backlogs and the consequences of medical staff turnover and loss. Importantly, clinicians who worked during previous epidemics were found to be at high risk of developing long‐term mental health issues, demonstrating the need for ongoing psychological support once a pandemic has ended.

The purpose of this scoping review was to investigate the known prevalence of psychological distress and burnout in anaesthetists during the COVID‐19 pandemic; identify the risk and protective factors associated with mental health and well‐being; and report concerns and support mechanisms related to working under pandemic conditions. Findings from this review can inform monitoring and intervention strategies that support psychological health during periods of increased demand under pandemic conditions, which may be useful beyond the pandemic.

### Chronic leptin deficiency improves tolerance of physiological damage and host-pathogen cooperation during Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection [^c4bb91d3]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

To combat infections, hosts employ a combination of antagonistic and cooperative defense strategies. The former refers to pathogen killing mediated by resistance mechanisms, while the latter refers to physiological defense mechanisms that promote host health during infection independent of pathogen killing, leading to an apparent cooperation between the host and the pathogen. Previous work has shown that Leptin, a pleiotropic hormone that plays a central role in regulating appetite and energy metabolism, is indispensable for resistance mechanisms, while a role for Leptin signaling in cooperative host-pathogen interactions remains unknown. Using a mouse model of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) infection, an emerging pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, and mesenteric lymphadenitis in humans, we found that the physiological effects of chronic Leptin-signaling deficiency conferred protection from Yptb infection due to increased host-pathogen cooperation rather than greater resistance defenses. The protection against Yptb infection was independent of differences in food consumption, lipolysis, or fat mass. Instead, we found that the chronic absence of Leptin signaling protects from a shift to lipid utilization during infection that contributes to Yptb lethality. Furthermore, we found that the survival advantage conferred by Leptin deficiency was associated with increased liver and kidney damage. Our work reveals an additional level of complexity for the role of Leptin in infection defense and demonstrates that in some contexts, in addition to tolerating the pathogen, tolerating organ damage is more beneficial for survival than preventing the damage.

### Why families matter [^4b5bfb17]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Serious illness puts pressure not only on individual family members but also on the family itself. The care of an acutely ill child requires the family to channel many of its resources toward a single member — an arrangement that can usually be sustained for a while but that cannot continue indefinitely while the other members do without. Illness disrupts ordinary familial functions and, if it is serious enough, threatens to break the family altogether. In this article, I argue that there are situations in which the threat to family integrity is so real and serious that the interests of parents or siblings or sometimes grandparents may override the interests of the pediatric patient.

### Supplementary search methods versus bibliographic database searching to identify studies and study reports [^52bbb845]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

How these methods might work

Supplementary search methods have different mechanisms of action compared to bibliographic databases, and, thus, 'search' for studies in different ways. Where the mechanism of action in a bibliographic database relies on searching controlled indexing and free‐text fields, supplementary methods might locate studies or study reports in different ways.

For instance, in contacting study authors, the 'search' constitutes dialogue and discussion with authors rather than query formulation in bibliographic databases. For complex reviews, explaining to a topic expert the type of study that you are searching for and why (the dialogue), might be more effective and efficient than formulating search strategies for multiple bibliographic databases and processing the search results. Moreover, it might yield studies or data in different formats, not accessible in bibliographic databases.

In citation searching or reference checking, the 'search' is for links between publications (or authors) rather than a search based on free‐text keywords or controlled indexing (as is used to search bibliographic databases). A citation search can identify studies or reports which have yet to be indexed in bibliographic databases, may have been missed in bibliographic searching due to mis‐indexing, lack of indexing, or missed keywords, and it may locate unpublished or more complete versions of study reports.

In short, supplementary search methods may complement the primary search of a bibliographic database, but questions about the overall effectiveness and resource use of the different methods remain.

Why it is important to do this review

This will be the first Cochrane review to identify and assess up‐to‐date evidence for all the supplementary search methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (hereafter referred to as the Cochrane Handbook). Although two previous Cochrane reviews evaluated two specific supplementary search methods (handsearching and checking references), these reviews are dated and have not been maintained. In addition, the search methods we will assess have evolved over time, underlining the need for a rigorous, comprehensive, and current review.

The review is intended to support researchers in selecting supplementary search methods for use alongside bibliographic database searching. Where possible, we will summarise the evidence on resource use by method, to guide planning of the study identification phase in a systematic review.

### Gastroesophageal reflux and altered motility in lung transplant rejection [^c27e264f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lung transplantation has become an effective therapeutic option for selected patients with end stage lung disease. Long-term survival is limited by chronic rejection manifest as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The aspiration of gastric contents has been implicated as a causative or additive factor leading to BOS. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and altered foregut motility are common both before and after lung transplantation. Further, the normal defense mechanisms against reflux are impaired in the allograft. Recent studies using biomarkers of aspiration have added to previous association studies to provide a growing body of evidence supporting the link between rejection and GER. Further, the addition of high-resolution manometry (HRM) and impedance technology to characterize bolus transit and the presence and extent of reflux regardless of pH might better identify at-risk patients. Although additional prospective studies are needed, fundoplication appears useful in the prevention or treatment of post-transplant BOS.

Purpose

This review will highlight the existing literature on the relationship of gastroesophageal reflux and altered motility to lung transplant rejection, particularly BOS. The article will conclude with a discussion of the evaluation and management of patients undergoing lung transplantation at our center.

Moreover, parents stated that the family could become more or less isolated due to frequent cancelling of social events, but also because of the exhaustion that followed the child's recurrent illness episodes. In the Facebook group, parents shared their experiences of exhaustion with each other:

People, the pediatrician and specialist always try to be sweet and say he will most likely outgrow it so as to say, no worries. But how much can a young child really bear and how much can a mother/ family take? (FB).

Gets so exhausting, our little guy gets it every 19 days for 5–6 days so we usually only get a 14 day break. I really feel like I am drowning lately. (FB).

Parents experienced work-related challenges in terms of dealing with frustrated colleagues and managers who had to replace them during recurrent sick-leaves. For some parents, it became more or less impossible to maintain their jobs. In the Facebook community, parents discussed how they tried to solve this unsustainable situation in daily life:

My question for everyone is how do you manage time out of work? I've worked only 2 full weeks since mid-January and hearing this may be our new normal until she grows out of it. It scares me. Anyone have to quit work because of the frequency? (FB/February).

Fortunately, I stay home. There is no way I would be able to hold a position with him being sick so often. My husband was traveling often for work and had to take another position. (FB).

Parents also shared stories of missed opportunities in their professional career because of the consequences of their child's disease. For example, in order to manage the family situation, they hesitated to take on a career opportunity or considered leaving a position they had already reached.

Now, sitting in the doctor's office and wondering what the verdict would be, he didn't even notice when Theresa took the seat beside him. They had been good friends when she worked in the front office at the plant, but he hadn't seen her since she left three years ago to take a job as a customer service representative. Her gentle poke in the ribs brought him around, and within minutes they were talking and gossiping as if she had never left. "Well, I really miss you guys, " she said. "I'm afraid I jumped from the frying pan into the fire. In my new job, the computer routes the calls and they never stop. I even have to schedule my bathroom breaks. All I hear the whole day are complaints from unhappy customers. I try to be helpful and sympathetic, but I can't promise anything without getting my boss's approval. Most of the time I'm caught between what the customer wants and company policy. I'm not sure who I'm supposed to keep happy.

The other reps are so uptight and tense they don't even talk to one another. We all go to our own little cubicles and stay there until quitting time. To make matters worse, my mother's health is deteriorating. But for David and Theresa, the situation is different-the challenge has turned into job demands that cannot be met, relaxation has turned to exhaustion, and a sense of satisfaction has turned into feelings of stress. In short, the stage is set for illness, injury, and job failure. In 1960, a Michigan court upheld a compensation claim by an automotive assembly line worker who had difficulty keeping up with the pressures of the production line. To avoid falling behind, he tried to work on several assemblies at the same time and often got parts mixed up. As a result, he was subjected to repeated criticism from the foreman. Eventually he suffered a psychological breakdown.

Example: Theresa's physical isolation reduces her opportunities to interact with other workers or receive help from them. Work Roles. Conflicting or uncertain job expectations, too much responsibility, too many "hats to wear. " Example: Theresa is often caught in a difficult situation trying to satisfy both the customer's needs and the company's expectations. What Can Be Done About Job Stress.

CAP-IASLC-AMP updated molecular testing guideline — systematic evidence review questions address resistance mechanisms and liquid biopsy in lung cancer. In patients undergoing targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the questions include the types and rates of secondary (acquired clinical) resistance, whether pre-treatment discovery of de novo resistance-related mutations and evaluation of rebiopsy specimens improve clinical outcomes, and the clinical performance characteristics of emerging technologies such as rebiopsy, next generation sequencing (NGS), and circulating DNA or circulating tumor cells (CTC). Additional questions ask about the clinical performance characteristics of circulating DNA/CTC in plasma for diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma or relapse and whether biomarkers are predictive of clinical outcome in squamous and small cell carcinomas.

### Work-family conflict and retirement preferences [^33099dec]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigates relationships between retirement preferences and perceived levels of work-family conflict.

Methods

Using the large sample of 52-54-year-old respondents to the 1992 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we estimated multinomial logistic regression models of preferences for partial and full retirement within the next 10 years. We examined the association between retirement preferences and perceived work-family conflict, evaluated the extent to which work-family conflict was a mediating mechanism between stressful work and family circumstances and preferences to retire, and explored potential gender differences in the association between work-family conflict and preferring retirement.

Results

Work-family conflict was positively related to preferences for both full and partial retirement. Yet work-family conflict did not appear to mediate relationships between stressful work and family environments and retirement preferences, nor did significant gender differences emerge in this association.

Discussion

Our analyses provide the first direct evidence of the role played by work-family conflict in the early stages of the retirement process, although we were not able to identify the sources of conflict underlying this relationship. Identifying the sources of this conflict and the psychological mechanisms linking work-family conflict to retirement preferences is an important task for future researchers.

### APA guidelines for psychological practice with military service members, veterans, and their families [^677d82f4]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Additional factors in psychological assessment, evaluation, and intervention — guidance emphasizes that Psychologists strive to be knowledgeable about common stressors faced by military personnel, veterans, and their families, and how these concerns may affect assessment and treatment. The guideline details general and role-related stressors, noting "frequent moves, frequent job changes, separation/living apart from family of origin or support system, and lack of control over geographic moves", that "Unemployment is also a potential stressor for military spouses who might have difficulty obtaining and sustaining gainful employment during the course of the military cycle of moves", and that some service members may experience stress related to "military occupational specialty, work settings, detention camp service, job changes, or work dissatisfaction", while "Service in the National Guard and Reserve entails such stressors as balancing the demands of military and civilian careers, including disruptions in civilian employment because of calls to service". It adds that "Those who deploy to combat zones may experience additional combat-related stressors, raising the risk of mental health problems" and that such stressors "can interact with or be exacerbated by stressors experienced by the whole population throughout the life course — for example, job loss, divorce, bereavement, retirement, serious illness, and facing the end of life". Family and reintegration issues are highlighted: "The deployment cycle brings additional stressors on family units, including geographical separation, challenges of communicating and maintaining relationships during separation", and "Service members and their families may experience a number of reintegration challenges", including that deployments "may create in the service member a sense of having missed out on major events". Transition to civilian life "can present challenges", with qualitative reports that it "can be experienced as a loss of a supportive social environment, a loss of purpose or structure, or as transition in an aspect of identity". The guideline notes that "Feelings of being disconnected from the military but not yet connected to civilian social organizations can occur", and that "Finding satisfying work, experiencing family and spousal support, or having access to peer support can be helpful in this transition". It also cautions that "Other coping behaviors that are adaptive in high-risk military situations may become problematic in civilian life", and that veterans may be "more meticulous, exacting, and cautious/alert to their surroundings", which "can be adaptive in more dangerous situations that require self-protection or less adaptive when a clear danger is no longer present". Finally, beyond reintegration, it states that "veterans may experience stress related to finding employment or resuming their education".
