## Question

Inflammation markers

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to use inflammatory markers across common scenarios, including which tests to choose, how to interpret results, and how to integrate them with clinical judgment and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that govern biomarker use. Then, I should verify which markers are most validated and in which diseases. Next, I will examine disease-specific applications for cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection/sepsis, and malnutrition. After that, I need to check special populations and contexts where interpretation is tricky. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a concise decision framework, making sure I double-check areas where guidelines conflict or where evidence is limited [^115b4rEh].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to conclusions: no single inflammatory marker is universally diagnostic; biomarkers should be analytically validated, clinically qualified, and used in a specific utilization context; interpretation must be anchored to pretest probability and clinical context; and serial measurements are often more informative than isolated values, especially for trajectory and treatment response [^115b4rEh] [^112AcW7J].

> I need to check which markers have the strongest clinical footing. High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) is the most consistently validated across multiple domains, with robust standardization and guideline endorsement, particularly in cardiovascular risk assessment and residual inflammatory risk, and it is generally preferred over ESR for acute-phase inflammation because of greater sensitivity and specificity and fewer confounders [^112kZF47] [^111dZZUZ] [^114wu1HY]. Hold on, I should verify the ESR caveat: ESR can still be useful for certain chronic inflammatory conditions and for monitoring trends, but it is slower to change and more susceptible to noninflammatory factors, so it should not be ordered reflexively alongside CRP without a specific indication [^114wu1HY] [^114c3ror].

> Next, I will examine cardiovascular disease, where hsCRP has the clearest role. I should confirm that ACC 2025 recommends universal hsCRP screening in primary and secondary prevention, interpreted alongside cholesterol, to identify residual inflammatory risk and guide therapy intensification; hsCRP > 3 mg/L in primary prevention signals higher inflammatory risk and supports lifestyle and pharmacologic risk reduction, while in secondary prevention, hsCRP remains a powerful predictor of recurrent events and can inform statin intensity escalation when > 2 mg/L, independent of LDL-C [^112kZF47] [^116LTvVH] [^111buT1H] [^1128tdrW]. Wait, let me verify the nuance: hsCRP is a risk marker, not a treatment target per se, but on-treatment hsCRP levels correlate with outcomes, and emerging data suggest other biomarkers like IL-6 may add prognostic value, though they are not yet standard for routine care [^114SwL8n] [^116CTEga].

> Now, inflammatory bowel disease. I should confirm that fecal calprotectin and serum CRP are the principal noninvasive markers, with calprotectin more sensitive for colonic inflammation and CRP more responsive in Crohn's disease; both are endorsed to detect active inflammation and guide treatment adjustments, but normal biomarkers do not absolutely exclude disease, especially in mild activity or UC where CRP can be blunted [^113CB1Bo] [^114Ldtnm] [^114khZJE]. Hold on, I should verify thresholds: fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g or CRP > 5 mg/L generally flag active inflammation, but pretest probability and discordant symptoms still mandate endoscopic confirmation before escalating therapy in many scenarios [^113CB1Bo] [^114Ldtnm].

> For infection and sepsis, I need to ensure I don't overstate biomarker specificity. CRP rises within 4–6 hours and peaks around 36–50 hours, making serial kinetics useful to gauge response; procalcitonin can help differentiate bacterial from viral or noninfectious inflammation in some contexts, but neither CRP nor PCT reliably distinguishes sepsis from sterile SIRS, so trend and clinical context remain paramount [^112AcW7J] [^111bw38N] [^115K8y2A]. Wait, let me double-check stewardship guidance: in respiratory viral pandemics, CRP may be monitored to inform immunomodulatory therapy decisions, but inflammatory markers should not be used to trigger antibiotics, and routine PCT to start antibiotics is discouraged; in ICU fever without a clear source and intermediate probability of bacterial infection, obtaining CRP can be reasonable, but not to rule out infection when suspicion is high [^114Z5MHa] [^115BLvbZ] [^115zL26K].

> I will now examine malnutrition and the inflammation criterion. The GLIM consensus supports using CRP to confirm inflammatory etiology when the contribution of inflammation is uncertain, with practical thresholds of 3–9.9 mg/L for mild, 10–50 mg/L for moderate, and > 50 mg/L for severe inflammation; albumin should not be used to diagnose malnutrition in inflammatory states because it is a negative acute-phase reactant and lags behind clinical changes [^114WSSBA] [^115Gemak] [^114uBeWh]. Hold on, I should verify that clinical judgment remains central: laboratory confirmation is not always necessary if the inflammatory disease is obvious, but CRP helps adjudicate uncertain cases and can be repeated when the inflammatory status is unclear [^114WSSBA] [^117PUmCu].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts where interpretation is tricky. In pediatrics, normal CRP/ESR ranges differ and noninfectious neonatal conditions can mimic sepsis biomarker patterns; in oncology, CRP is often elevated due to tumor-related inflammation and should not be used to infer malnutrition; in autoimmune rheumatic diseases, CRP may be normal despite active disease in some entities, necessitating composite measures and clinical correlation; in COVID-19, routine biomarkers can risk-stratify deterioration but should be repeated only if results will change management [^114dBHL4] [^116LmjJe] [^114DivS9] [^1178PH1D]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CRP is always elevated in active rheumatic disease; that's not correct — entities like psoriatic arthritis and SLE flares can have normal CRP, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize composite indices and clinical assessment [^116eYrty].

> Next, I should review test selection and avoid low-yield combinations. CRP is preferred over ESR for undifferentiated acute inflammation; simultaneous ESR and CRP is often unnecessary and increases cost without improving diagnostic accuracy; serial CRP is more informative than a single value for treatment response; and fecal calprotectin is preferred over serum markers to detect intestinal inflammation when available [^114wu1HY] [^114c3ror] [^112AcW7J] [^113CB1Bo]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with stewardship data: yes, interventions reducing routine ESR ordering decreased utilization without harming outcomes, reinforcing targeted use of CRP or ESR based on indication [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address emerging and investigational markers. IL-6, neutrophil-derived indices, and imaging of vascular inflammation show promise but are not yet standard for routine care; in IBD, novel stool and blood signatures are under study but remain largely research tools; in airway disease, exhaled nitric oxide is useful for eosinophilic inflammation but is not a global marker of all inflammatory phenotypes [^114SwL8n] [^112Dw223] [^114xBniu]. But wait, what if a patient asks about "cutting-edge" tests? I should counsel that most are not ready for prime time and that validated, available markers like hsCRP and calprotectin remain the clinical mainstays pending stronger qualification data [^115b4rEh].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check it against guidelines. First, define the clinical question: diagnosis, activity assessment, treatment response, or risk prediction. Second, choose the right compartment and marker: hsCRP for systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk, fecal calprotectin for intestinal inflammation, and CRP kinetics for infection response. Third, interpret in the context of pretest probability and consider serial trends rather than single values. Fourth, act on results: escalate therapy when biomarkers corroborate clinical suspicion, but verify with gold standards (e.g., endoscopy in IBD) before major changes. Finally, avoid low-value testing: do not order ESR reflexively with CRP, do not use inflammatory markers to start antibiotics in viral illness, and do not overinterpret normal biomarkers in high-suspicion scenarios [^112kZF47] [^113CB1Bo] [^114Z5MHa] [^114wu1HY].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the core message: inflammatory markers are valuable adjuncts when selected and interpreted thoughtfully, but they are not substitutes for clinical judgment; hsCRP and fecal calprotectin are the most broadly validated for cardiovascular risk and intestinal inflammation, respectively, and their optimal use hinges on aligning the biomarker to the clinical question, integrating pretest probability, and leveraging serial measurements to guide timely, context-specific decisions [^112kZF47] [^113CB1Bo] [^115b4rEh].

Inflammation markers are laboratory tests that detect and quantify systemic or local inflammatory activity, aiding diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment decisions across clinical contexts [^114KKEQL]. The most commonly used markers are **CRP, ESR, and procalcitonin**, each with distinct clinical roles and limitations [^114wu1HY] [^111bw38N].

- **CRP** is a rapid, sensitive acute-phase reactant that rises within 6–8 hours of inflammation and returns to baseline within days; it is preferred for acute inflammation and infection monitoring, and is widely used in cardiovascular risk assessment and IBD management [^112AcW7J] [^114wu1HY] [^112kZF47] [^113CB1Bo].
- **ESR** is a nonspecific, delayed marker that rises more slowly and can remain elevated longer; it is less sensitive to acute changes but may be useful for chronic inflammatory conditions and trend monitoring [^114wu1HY].
- **Procalcitonin** rises specifically with bacterial infection and is most useful for differentiating bacterial from viral or noninfectious inflammation, guiding antibiotic stewardship in sepsis and respiratory infections [^111bw38N] [^114Z5MHa].

Other markers — such as IL-6, TNF-α, ferritin, and D-dimer — provide additional context but are less standardized or are context-specific. Interpretation must always be **clinical-context aware**, as no single marker is definitive; trends and combinations improve accuracy and guide therapy [^114KKEQL] [^111bw38N].

## Clinical applications of inflammation markers

### Diagnosis

For diagnosis, **CRP and ESR** are nonspecific but widely used to detect inflammation in infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies, whereas **procalcitonin** helps distinguish bacterial from viral or noninfectious inflammation and is especially useful in sepsis and respiratory infections [^111bw38N] [^114Z5MHa].

---

### Monitoring disease activity

For monitoring disease activity, **IBD** is commonly tracked with CRP and fecal calprotectin to assess activity and guide therapy, while **cardiovascular disease** uses hs-CRP to assess residual inflammatory risk and inform prevention strategies [^113CB1Bo] [^111buT1H] [^114mwJx7].

---

### Treatment response

For treatment response, **CRP and procalcitonin** track response in infections and sepsis, helping decide when to continue or stop antibiotics, and **autoimmune diseases** are monitored with CRP and ESR to assess response to immunosuppressive therapy.

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Nonspecificity**: Most markers are elevated in diverse conditions, limiting diagnostic specificity [^1143cL2Y].
- **Variability**: Age, sex, comorbidities, and medications can influence levels [^114wu1HY] [^115REQ6Y].
- **Single measurements**: Single values may be misleading; trends and clinical context are essential [^111bw38N].
- **Standardization**: Assay variability and lack of universal thresholds complicate interpretation [^111dZZUZ].

---

## Emerging biomarkers and novel technologies

- **Multi-marker panels**: Combining markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6, TNF-α) improves diagnostic accuracy [^114DivS9].
- **Point-of-care devices**: Rapid, portable assays enable real-time decision-making [^114spc5q].
- **Omics technologies**: Genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are identifying novel, disease-specific markers [^116TW2gS].

---

Inflammation markers are essential tools for detecting, monitoring, and managing inflammatory conditions. CRP, ESR, and procalcitonin remain the most widely used, each with specific strengths and limitations. Emerging biomarkers and technologies promise to **enhance precision and enable personalized medicine** [^113ieq6u].

### Laboratory markers in IBD: useful, magic, or unnecessary toys? [^115oZRct]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory markers have been investigated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for diagnostic and differential diagnostic purposes, for assessment of disease activity and risk of complications, for prediction of relapse, and for monitoring the effect of therapy. The introduction of biological therapies in IBD has renewed interest in inflammatory markers (especially C reactive protein (CRP)), given their potential to select responders to these treatments. Of all the laboratory markers, CRP is the most studied and has been shown to have the best overall performance. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and correlates well with disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates and normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials with biologicals. However, despite the advantages of CRP over other markers, it is still far from ideal. Furthermore, CRP correlates less well with disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with CD. Other laboratory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocyte and platelet count, albumin, and 1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), have been studied either less extensively in IBD or have proven to be less useful than CRP. Faecal markers seem promising and may be more specific in detecting gut inflammation in patients with established IBD. Promising results have been reported with the use of faecal calprotectin in CD as well as in UC. Recent data however suggest that the performance of the faecal calprotectin test is superior for UC than for CD. Taken together, laboratory markers are useful and should be part of the global management of our IBD patients. They are however not magic and until more data become available, the use of CRP and other laboratory markers should be seen as an additive tool to clinical observation and physical examination rather than a replacement.

### Inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk: association or cause and effect? [^115kzt4g]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

With the current understanding that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, markers of the associated systemic inflammatory response have been extensively studied as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Recently the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed for risk assessment in individuals at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease. The traditional view of inflammatory biomarkers, including CRP, regards them as risk markers rather than risk factors. Either category of marker would serve a diagnostic role, monitor disease activity, and indicate the efficacy of therapy or changing prognosis. However a risk factor with a causal role would be a potential target for therapy. This review discusses the available evidence that argues for and against a causal role for inflammatory biomarkers, with specific reference to CRP, in the atherosclerotic process.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### Biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease: from classical laboratory tools to personalized medicine [^113ieq6u]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnostics of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) currently relies on a combination of biological and morphological tests. The current method of diagnostic remains a critical challenge for physicians in part due to their invasiveness and also for their limitations in term of diagnosis, prognosis, disease activity and severity assessment, and therapeutic outcomes. Laboratory biomarkers can be used in the diagnosis and management of IBD, but none of them has been proven to be ideal. Increasing efforts are being made to discover new biomarkers that can discriminate between the types of IBD, predict future responses to treatment, and aid in differential diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction. This review addresses the potential for current biomarkers and the emergence of the concept of biomarker signatures in IBD diagnostic and personalized medicine.

### Immune monitoring and treatment in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [^114KKEQL]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) can occur in a number of organ systems as a result of aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses to genetic and environmental triggers. Immune-monitoring technologies are used to detect disease-relevant immune biomarkers, either to enable diagnosis or monitor response to therapy. Immune monitoring is predominantly used in the research setting at present but routine clinical use is increasing. This poster explores the mechanisms underlying a number of common IMIDs, biomarkers relevant to the diagnosis or monitoring of IMIDs, and therapies used to treat these diseases.

### What defines a healthy gut microbiome? [^114ctu3T]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Inflammation markers

Low levels of inflammatory markers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin in the stool are indicative of a healthy gut. Low inflammation directly reflects the absence of gut inflammation and related disorders. Measuring inflammation markers in stool is a non-invasive method for assessing gut health. However, inflammation markers can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including infections and dietary changes, potentially leading to false positives. Therefore, these markers must be interpreted in the context of other clinical and microbiota data for accurate assessment(figures2 3).

Resilience

The ability of the gut microbiota to maintain a stable composition over time and resist disturbances, such as antibiotics or dietary changes, is crucial for gut health. Resilience indicates a robust and adaptable microbiota capable of maintaining homeostasis and supporting overall health. A resilient microbiota can recover quickly from disruptions, reducing the risk of long-term health issues. However, assessing resilience requires long-term monitoring, which can be logistically challenging and costly. Furthermore, the factors contributing to microbiota resilience are complex and not fully understood, complicating the assessment process.

Conclusion

While there are several markers indicating a healthy gut microbiota, there is still no consensus on what constitutes a healthy gut microbiota. Each marker has its advantages and limitations, and the complex interplay between these factors adds to the challenge of defining gut health objectively. Emerging research continues to refine our understanding of these markers and their interactions, but the quest for a definitive and universally applicable definition of a healthy gut microbiota remains ongoing.

### Effective use of the laboratory in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^116Kmomw]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, intestinal inflammatory disorders, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. IBD is characterized by periods of relapse and remission. Long-term progressive intestinal inflammation can result in severe and devastating complications, such as intestinal strictures and/or fistulae. Immune suppressive medications with potent side effects are often used to control inflammation and limit disease activity. Laboratory tests guide various decisions in clinical management of IBD. We discuss tests used to diagnose IBD, assess for relapse or remission, monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic regimen, screen for the maintenance of health, and diagnose or prevent complications.

### The use of high-sensitivity assays for C-reactive protein in clinical practice [^112gPtho]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity assays that accurately measure levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein have been proposed for use in assessments of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A growing body of evidence supports recommendations for these tests in selected asymptomatic individuals deemed to be at intermediate risk of CVD according to traditional risk-factor assessments and who do not already warrant chronic treatment with aspirin and statin therapy. Data suggests that these high-sensitivity assays should be used in combination with measurements of LDL-cholesterol levels to assist risk stratification of selected patients for prevention of CVD.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis? [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops to established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed. Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for identification of at risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and together with acute phase reactants were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria of RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis of RA. Several novel autoantigens and antibodies that may improve early diagnosis and predict further development of the disease have been recently identified. Besides clinical signs and serological tests, imaging techniques, particularly ultrasound, may improve early diagnosis of RA, particularly in seronegative patients.

In this commentary, we will attempt to summarize the role of ultrasound and several serological biomarkers, which are currently studied in order to serve as surrogate measures for RA diagnosis.

### Measuring and targeting persistent Inflammation in chronic coronary disease [^115eMkeV]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Are hsCRP levels sufficient for assessment of inflammatory risk in CAD patients?

Inflammation encompasses a broad range of cellular responses that involve immune cells, vascular cells, and organ parenchymal cells, and cannot be quantitatively measured by a single marker. In addition to hsCRP, several other biomarkers have been tested in chronic CAD patients and may provide independent prognostic information. For example, neutrophil-derived indicators were found to predict all-cause mortality in CAD patients at low residual inflammatory risk, independently of hsCRP levels. Moreover, in a comparison of interleukin (IL)-6, LDL-C and hsCRP in CAD patients enrolled in the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial, IL-6 levels were the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality. In addition to more specific serum biomarkers, emerging molecular imaging modalities can contribute information on the inflammatory profile of the plaques, thus identifying patients with high-risk lesions that may benefit from anti-inflammatory interventions. Although new more specific and pathophysiologically relevant biomarkers and imaging strategies may eventually prove valuable, successful implementation of anti-inflammatory approaches in the clinical setting requires well-validated, simple, practical, and inexpensive markers. Thus, despite its lack of specificity, hsCRP remains the most reliable, informative, and widely used tool for inflammatory risk assessment in chronic CAD patients.

### CDC / AHA workshop on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease: application to clinical and public health practice: laboratory tests available to assess inflammation – performance and standardization: a background paper [^111dZZUZ]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. A number of different biomarkers of inflammation are measurable in blood. These include cytokines, chemokines, soluble adhesion molecules, and acute-phase reactants. The first 3 groups of molecules are not routinely measured in clinical laboratories. The acute-phase reactants include C-reactive protein (CRP). This analyte is stable and is readily measured by several commercial high-sensitivity (hs) assays, and numerous clinical studies have demonstrated its usefulness as an atherosclerotic risk marker. For these reasons, CRP is currently the inflammatory marker of choice. Comparison of commercial hsCRP assays has demonstrated that many are capable of imprecision of < 7% at a CRP concentration of < 1 mg/L. Method comparability studies have shown good agreement among some commercial hsCRP assays in terms of quartile assignments, whereas additional standardization efforts are necessary for others. The first goal of standardization is to develop a secondary reference material with a CRP of approximately 4 mg/L. This material can be used to assist diagnostic vendors in calibrator value assignment and assay harmonization. Another project is to define clearly what performance characteristics are necessary for hsCRP assays. Preliminary estimates based on the biological variability of CRP indicate that the total allowable analytical error is between 15% and 32%. The former requirement can be met with accuracy and imprecision of < 5% and the latter requirement with accuracy and imprecision of < 11%. If 2 hsCRP results are averaged, then the imprecision requirements are relaxed slightly. Clinical validation of these performance requirements is also required.

### CDC / AHA workshop on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular disease: application to clinical and public health practice: ability of inflammatory markers to predict disease in asymptomatic patients: a background paper [^116YikFW]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

There is great interest in moving beyond established risk factors to consider markers of inflammation for the prediction of initial cardiovascular disease events. Inflammatory markers such as leukocyte count, serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, and vascular outcomes in individuals free of cardiovascular disease at baseline are the key markers that have been investigated in the population setting. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies in asymptomatic individuals compared people in the bottom third of the C-reactive protein distribution with those in the top tertile. The authors reported an odds ratio of 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.5) for coronary heart disease among people in the top tertile. These results are among the strongest assembled thus far to recommend incorporating newer biomarkers into coronary heart disease risk estimation algorithms. A variety of issues should be considered and conditions satisfied before vascular disease risk factors are adopted into regular use. The type of vascular event and the follow-up interval are important features because results for short-, intermediate-, and long-term intervals may yield different results. The factors under consideration should have been standardized, and characteristics such as the variability of the measurements, correlations with established factors, evidence from observational studies and clinical trials, type of effect (linear, nonlinear, dichotomous), improvement in overall prediction (discrimination), generalization of results (calibration), and cost can affect the utility. Each of these issues needs to be considered and the effects on relative, absolute, and population-attributable risks described. In particular, we need to (1) develop sound strategies for implementing new testing and (2) demonstrate the benefit of testing by using the current foundation of prior probabilities developed from already-published risk factor assessments based on large population studies.

### Laboratory diagnosis of sepsis? No SIRS, not just yet [^115dkGek]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to maximize the benefit of prompt antimicrobial therapy and avoid the risk associated with inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents, patients with suspected sepsis must be rapidly differentiated from patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In combination with standard microbiological testing, a number of biomarkers have been recently evaluated for this purpose, and the performance characteristics of the most promising of these are reviewed.

### Diagnostic tests in neonatal sepsis [^112uSTZE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review examines the major developments in early detection of neonatal sepsis, with an emphasis on the utility of diagnostic laboratory markers in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Measures of acute phase proteins, cytokines, cell surface antigens, and bacterial genomes have been used alone or in combination to improve diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Most studies evaluating laboratory diagnostic markers are retrospective cohorts or single center experience with relatively small sample size. Interpretation of these studies is confounded by inconsistent definitions of sepsis, heterogeneous sample populations, and different thresholds for diagnostic markers. Furthermore, many diagnostic markers are not available for routine care, they require specialized analytical procedures, and are expensive to perform.

Summary

A better understanding of the neonatal inflammatory response to sepsis and identification of sensitive and specific markers of inflammation or rapid microbe-specific diagnostic tests would assist in the early detection of neonatal sepsis and in safely withholding antibiotics for patients in whom sepsis is unlikely.

### Inflammation and cardiovascular disease: 2025 ACC scientific statement: a report of the American college of cardiology [^116LTvVH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in primary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a single measurement of hs-CRP (> 3 mg/L) in routine clinical practice to identify patients at increased inflammatory risk, provided the patient is not acutely ill.

### C-reactive protein comes of age [^114CtaH3]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death throughout the world despite advances in its detection and treatment. Commonly used risk algorithms, such as the Framingham Risk Score fail to identify all affected individuals. Novel cardiovascular risk factors that identify these missed individuals would greatly improve overall care of patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory biomarker, has emerged as a leading candidate to fulfill this role. Based on the results of several prospective epidemiologic studies, CRP has emerged as one of the most powerful predictors of cardiovascular disease. This marker provides valuable information to clinicians in various clinical settings, ranging from overt cardiovascular disease, stable angina, presenting acute coronary syndromes and peripheral vascular disease, to the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, CRP has been demonstrated to actively contribute to all stages of atherogenesis, participating in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerotic-plaque formation, plaque maturation, plaque destabilization and eventual rupture. Thus, it might also serve as a therapeutic target. It is our contention that the future will see much wider use of CRP and CRP-driven therapies in clinical medicine, improving our ability to identify and manage cardiovascular disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Common laboratory blood test immune panel markers are useful for grading ulcerative colitis endoscopic severity [^111jXS7o]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic nonspecific inflammatory disease, that is characterized by a process of recurrence and remission. With treatment endpoints that target "mucosal healing (MH)" rather than mere "remission", comes a growing need to improve diagnostic and monitoring tools. At present, the diagnosis and monitoring of UC, monitoring of responses to intervention, and the detection of MH depend on endoscopy. However, colonoscopy is invasive, expensive, and requires intestinal preparation. In addition, at least one-third of UC patients in the remission stage have gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea without any signs of disease activity under endoscopy. Studies have found that previous inflammatory UC bouts lead to residual visceral hypersensitivity; even if the inflammatory infiltration subsides and the intestinal structure recovers, visceral hypersensitivity persists. Such patients have repeated symptoms but no identifiable inflammatory activity in the intestinal tract. Repeat endoscopy is not appropriate due to its invasiveness, expense, and other shortcomings, including poor acceptance by patients. Simple markers that reflect endoscopic findings are needed to predict the "active period" and "remission period" of the disease to help determine whether the patient has entered a "relapse". In particular, non-invasive indicators are desired because of their convenience, repeatability, objectivity, and patient comfort.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^115K8y2A]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our literature review indicates that there are many biomarkers that can be used in sepsis, but none has sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be routinely employed in clinical practice. PCT and CRP have been most widely used, but even these have limited abilities to distinguish sepsis from other inflammatory conditions or to predict outcome. In view of the complexity of the sepsis response, it is unlikely that a single ideal biomarker will ever be found. A combination of several sepsis biomarkers may be more effective, but this requires further evaluation.

### Noninvasive testing for mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^1123qNn6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have gained increasing attention for the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Endoscopy remains the gold standard for assessing disease activity. Biomarkers are rapid, inexpensive, and noninvasive, and can be used in different stages of the disease with high sensitivity and specificity. Calprotectin and tests for C-reactive protein are used to assess the disease activity, predict relapse, and monitor treatment response. New noninvasive tests are being studied. This review discusses current evidence for these surrogate markers, their potential clinical applications, and limitations in disease management. We highlight recent advances in IBD biomarkers and future uses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to biomarkers, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that other inflammatory biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, IL-6, fibrinogen, WBC count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and eicosapentaenoic acid-to-arachidonic acid ratio also predict cardiovascular risk; however, routine evaluation of these adds little to hs-CRP, which is the only biomarker recognized by regulatory agencies and consistently used in major cardiovascular outcome trials.

### Sequential C-reactive protein measurements in patients with serious infections: does it help? [^117Rowvf]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation traditionally used as a complementary tool to support the clinical diagnosis and as a marker of severity of disease. CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by cytokines and its serum levels increase markedly within hours after the onset of infection, inflammation or tissue injury. Dynamic serial measurement of CRP has been widely used to help therapeutic decision-making. Decreasing plasma concentrations of this biomarker have been used as an indicator for resolution of infection or sepsis.

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease: a resolute belief or an elusive link? [^111HJx2b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular (CV) events is well established. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has received the most attention for its use in screening and risk reclassification and as a predictor of clinical response to statin therapy. Although CRP is involved in the immunologic process that triggers vascular remodeling and plaque deposition and is associated with increased CV disease (CVD) risk, definitive randomized evidence for its role as a causative factor in atherothrombosis is lacking. Whether measurement of hsCRP levels provides consistent, clinically meaningful incremental predictive value in risk prediction and reclassification beyond conventional factors remains debated. Despite publication of guidelines on the use of hsCRP in CVD risk prediction by several leading professional organizations, there is a lack of clear consensus regarding the optimal clinical use of hsCRP. This article reviews 4 distinct points from the literature to better understand the current state and application of hsCRP in clinical practice: 1) the biology of hsCRP and its role in atherosclerosis; 2) the epidemiological association of hsCRP with CVD; 3) the quality of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk; and 4) the use of hsCRP as a tool to initiate or tailor statin therapy. Furthermore, we highlight recommendations from societies and important considerations when using hsCRP to guide treatment decisions in the primary prevention setting.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^114wu1HY]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

CRP is a specific acute phase reactant associated with inflammation and infection, and ESR is a non-specific measure of the acute phase reaction. ESR is influenced by many factors, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory, such as blood viscosity, age, sex and other chronic conditions such as renal disease, obesity and heart failure. Thus, an elevated ESR has limited specificity for inflammation. ESR may remain elevated even after the CRP has returned to baseline. These characteristics make CRP the preferred test for detecting acute phase inflammation in patients with undiagnosed conditions. Simultaneous ordering of ESR and CRP has been shown to increase costs without evidence of improving diagnostic accuracy or patient outcomes. Interventions incorporating education, audit and feedback and computerised clinical decision support (CDS) have been associated with reductions in ESR testing in hospitals. The clinical appropriateness of residual ESR testing following such interventions and the estimated changes in costs of laboratory testing have not been reported.

### Noninfectious influencers of early-onset sepsis biomarkers [^114dBHL4]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests for sepsis aim to either detect the infectious agent (such as microbiological cultures) or detect host markers that commonly change in response to an infection (such as C-reactive protein). The latter category of tests has advantages compared to culture-based methods, including a quick turnaround time and in some cases lower requirements for blood samples. They also provide information on the immune response of the host, a critical determinant of clinical outcome. However, they do not always differentiate nonspecific host inflammation from true infection and can inadvertently lead to antibiotic overuse. Multiple noninfectious conditions unique to neonates in the first days after birth can lead to inflammatory marker profiles that mimic those seen among infected infants. Our goal was to review noninfectious conditions and patient characteristics that alter host inflammatory markers commonly used for the diagnosis of early-onset sepsis. Recognizing these conditions can focus the use of biomarkers on patients most likely to benefit while avoiding scenarios that promote false positives. We highlight approaches that may improve biomarker performance and emphasize the need to use patient outcomes, in addition to conventional diagnostic performance analysis, to establish clinical utility.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^114j53gp]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Biomarkers can be useful for identifying or ruling out sepsis, identifying patients who may benefit from specific therapies or assessing the response to therapy.

Methods

We used an electronic search of the PubMed database using the key words "sepsis" and "biomarker" to identify clinical and experimental studies which evaluated a biomarker in sepsis.

Results

The search retrieved 3370 references covering 178 different biomarkers.

Conclusions

Many biomarkers have been evaluated for use in sepsis. Most of the biomarkers had been tested clinically, primarily as prognostic markers in sepsis; relatively few have been used for diagnosis. None has sufficient specificity or sensitivity to be routinely employed in clinical practice. PCT and CRP have been most widely used, but even these have limited ability to distinguish sepsis from other inflammatory conditions or to predict outcome.

### Inflammatory biomarkers in stable atherosclerosis [^1129iStp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a key mechanism in atherosclerotic progression and destabilization that precedes clinical events such as myocardial infarction. The inflammatory biomarkers provide a window into many of these inflammatory processes. In research studies, average levels of these biomarkers in groups of subjects are often related to the risk of clinical events, and modification of risk factors can change the plasma concentrations of many biomarkers, reflecting suppression of inflammation. More evidence exists for C-reactive protein (CRP) than for other inflammatory biomarkers, and the discussion of the clinical value of plasma levels of these markers is focused mainly on CRP. Although the inflammatory biomarkers are useful research tools, their value as a clinical instrument for assessment of cardiovascular risk and/or treatment efficacy is still widely debated. Each biomarker has passionate supporters who advocate these applications, but, at this stage, no inflammatory biomarker has universal support for clinical use and their potential for fulfilling this role requires further study.

### Procalcitonin to guide duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients: a randomized prospective controlled trial [^113we3WY]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- PCT is the first laboratory marker among a large array of inflammatory variables that offers the possibility to differentiate bacterial infection from viral or non-infectious inflammatory reaction.

- PCT assessment provides a helpful tool to decide on the duration of antibiotic treatment, if interpreted in the clinical context including the underlying disease.

- PCT-based algorithm supports the cautious use of antibiotics and has a favourable effect on the clinical outcome.

- PCT-based algorithm is certainly practicable and simple.

- PCT-controlled antibiotic therapy must still be tested in heterogenous groups of patients, particularly for safety.

### Biomarkers of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^116TW2gS]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Recent observations suggest that subjective measures of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often misleading. Objective measures of inflammation are more closely associated with important long-term outcomes, but often depend upon invasive and costly procedures such as ileocolonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Noninvasive, accurate, and inexpensive measures of intestinal inflammation would allow clinicians to adopt widely the paradigm of adjusting therapies with a goal of controlling inflammation. Blood, stool, and urine markers have all been explored as indicators of intestinal inflammation in IBD, and although none has been universally adopted, some have been well-characterized, and others hold great promise. Serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin are among the best-studied noninvasive biomarkers of inflammation in IBD, and their test characteristics have been described in the setting of differentiating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome, for grading inflammation, to describe the response to therapy, and in demonstrating recurrent inflammation after medical or surgically induced remission. High-throughput research platforms, including gene expression arrays, metabolomics and proteomics, are also being applied to the discovery of novel biomarkers of inflammation. It is certain that biomarkers of inflammation will attain growing importance in the clinic as we strive for more effective and cost-effective strategies to treat patients with IBD.

### Inflammation as a cardiovascular risk factor [^116KfEBg]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation occurs in the vasculature as a response to injury, lipid peroxidation, and perhaps infection. Various risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, are amplified by the harmful effects of oxidized low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, initiating a chronic inflammatory reaction, the result of which is a vulnerable plaque, prone to rupture and thrombosis. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown strong and consistent relationships between markers of inflammation and risk of future cardiovascular events. Inflammation can potentially be detected locally by imaging techniques as well as emerging techniques, such as identification of temperature or pH heterogeneity. It can be detected systemically by measurement of inflammatory markers. Of these, the most reliable and accessible for clinical use is currently high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A combination of methods may provide the best identification of persons at risk for cardiovascular events who would benefit from treatment. In randomized, controlled trials, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, in the form of statins, have been shown to provide effective therapy for lowering CRP, in conjunction with their lipid-lowering effects. Although the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statin use appears to be largest for those with the highest serum levels of CRP, whether CRP reduction per se lowers cardiovascular risk is unknown.

### Systematic review of the use of CRP in clinical trials for psoriatic arthritis: a concern for clinical practice? [^116eYrty]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CRP and ESR are traditionally suggested as easy point-of-care laboratory markers of systemic inflammation to support diagnosis and measure disease activity in PsA. However, in PsA CRP levels have shown to not increase consistently with disease activity. Nevertheless, CRP is regularly used individually in RCTs as part of the evaluation of disease activity and as a prognostic factor for long-term outcomes. In addition, CRP is included in different composite measures for monitoring disease activity in PsA, like ACR-20, –50, −70 response, DAS-28 CRP, DAPSA, and PASDAS.

In the studied phase 3 studies with biologicals in PsA, CRP levels within the PsA study population tend to be very heterogeneous. In general, baseline CRP levels are lower in those studies without enrolment requirement criteria for CRP. Although CRP levels are often normal in PsA, one-third of the studies used CRP as a way of identifying active disease. Using CRP levels as inclusion criterion possibly reduces the representativeness of the study population for the global patient population. In the DISCOVER 2 study for example, which used CRP as an inclusion criterion, the randomised study population had a high average of swollen and tender joints along with substantial systemic inflammation. This may possibly reduce the applicability of conclusions to patients who, despite lower CRP levels, also suffer from active disease and clearly require therapy. Lack of awareness among non-experts about the limitations of generalisability in these specific clinical trials carries some risks for patient care: underestimation of disease severity in patients with normal CRP levels, too strict criteria for reimbursement of advanced therapies by third party private or governmental organisations.

### How to use: C-reactive protein [^112AcW7J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that increases 4–6 h after an inflammatory trigger and peaks at 36–50 h. Levels decrease rapidly with the resolution of inflammation. CRP is generally highly elevated in invasive bacterial infections and is often used as a marker of inflammation. A single CRP level is neither sensitive nor specific enough to identify all children with serious bacterial infection. However, a raised CRP does suggest serious bacterial infection and should suggest further assessment is needed. CRP levels that fail to decrease, or continue to rise, after 48 h of antibiotic therapy suggest treatment failure. In infants with suspected neonatal sepsis, two CRP measurements 24 h apart that are < 10 mg/l are useful in excluding sepsis.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^1178PH1D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can (1) be asymptomatic (no symptoms), (2) cause mild or moderate signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy, breathlessness, and fast breathing, (3) cause severe signs and symptoms, which include severe respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation, indicative of severe pneumonia, (4) cause critical signs and symptoms, which require respiratory support due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or (5) can lead to organ dysfunction (indicative of sepsis). People with severe or critical COVID‐19 require distinctive management of their signs and symptoms; it is, therefore, important to identify them.

At present, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is more prevalent compared to when the pandemic started, and diagnosing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is no longer challenging. Clinicians now look at the added value of routine laboratory tests to decide to admit people with a suspected or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to the hospital, or to adapt a watchful‐waiting approach. Therefore, we aim, on the one hand, to focus on the distinction between mild or moderate COVID‐19, and severe or critical COVID‐19; and, on the other hand, on mortality from COVID‐19.

Index test(s)

Routinely available blood‐based biomarkers for infection and inflammation may be considered in the investigation of people with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Evaluation of commonly available tests may be helpful to predict death or deterioration of a person with mild or moderate COVID‐19 to severe or critical COVID‐19.

We collated evidence on all routine blood, plasma, and serum biomarker tests reported in the identified studies.

### The role of noninvasive surrogates of inflammation in monitoring pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases: the old and the new [^114aiXzm]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of limited available therapies for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease has reached stagnation. Previous non-invasive monitoring strategies have relied upon cumbersome tools to evaluate clinical symptoms and biochemical markers that do not reflect endoscopic activity or respond quickly to treatments. Novel, patient-centric, and highly accurate, monitoring strategies with a focus on intestinal ultrasound for a direct, precise monitoring of activity to achieve disease modification are now possible. Ultimately, research on the optimal tight control monitoring strategies, individualized to each pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patient, are in development and offer a hope to potential therapeutic ceiling breakthrough on the horizon.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^114c3ror]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Problem

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) and C reactive protein (CRP) are commonly used tests in clinical practice to evaluate for inflammation. CRP has been shown to be a more sensitive and specific test when assessing acute phase inflammation. Recommendations from the American Society for Clinical Pathology, as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign, state ' Don't order an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) to look for inflammation in patients with undiagnosed conditions. Order a C-reactive protein (CRP) to detect acute phase inflammation '.

The initiative was conducted at a 562-bed, level 1 trauma, academic medical centre in New England. We observed high rates of ESR and combined ESR/CRP testing at our medical centre, leading to concerns about potential overuse of ESR. We speculated that combined, simultaneous ESR and CRP orders were rarely indicated and could provide a marker of unnecessary tests, since CRP is preferred for detecting acute inflammation in undiagnosed conditions, whereas ESR may be preferred for monitoring disease activity in some specific inflammatory conditions. We surmised that lack of knowledge regarding the test characteristics of ESR and CRP, ordering habits and the design of order entry within the electronic medical record (EMR) contributed to overuse of ESR testing. We hypothesised that interventions targeting specific drivers identified at our institution would decrease unnecessary ESR testing, improve clinical appropriateness of ESR testing and effect institutional cost savings.

We sought to understand the drivers for ESR use, reduce unnecessary ESR testing, assess changes in clinician ordering practices and estimate the impact on the costs of care delivery. Specifically, we aimed to reduce the total number of ESR tests per month and the number of combined ESR and CRP tests per month by 50% within 12 months of initiating the project. We also aimed to improve the clinical appropriateness of ESR ordering so that testing was used for specific inflammatory conditions rather than for acute phase inflammation in undiagnosed conditions.

### Inflammatory processes in cardiovascular disease: a route to targeted therapies [^113AXR1D]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory processes are firmly established as central to the development and complications of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers have been shown to be predictive of future cardiovascular events. The specific targeting of these processes in experimental models has been shown to attenuate myocardial and arterial injury, reduce disease progression, and promote healing. However, the translation of these observations and the demonstration of clear efficacy in clinical practice have been disappointing. A major limitation might be that tools currently used to measure 'inflammation' are insufficiently precise and do not provide information about disease site and activity, or discriminate between functionally important activation pathways. The challenge, therefore, is to make measures of inflammation that are more meaningful, and which can guide specific targeted therapies. In this Review, we consider the roles of inflammatory processes in the related pathologies of atherosclerosis and acute myocardial infarction, by providing an evaluation of the known and emerging inflammatory pathways. We highlight contemporary techniques to characterize and quantify inflammation, and consider how they might be used to guide specific treatments. Finally, we discuss emerging opportunities in the field, including their current limitations and challenges that are the focus of ongoing study.

### Perspective on clinical application of biomarkers in AKI [^111JR6bS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Several biomarkers of renal injury have been identified but the utility of these biomarkers is largely confined to research studies, whereas widespread clinical applicability is limited. This is partly because the use of serum creatinine as the comparator has several limitations and restricts the full interpretation of biomarker performance. To highlight the potential for clinical application of biomarkers, the most pertinent biomarker data are summarized here, using clinically relevant scenarios in which biomarkers could assist with diagnostic and management dilemmas. The paradigms proposed in this review aim to enhance the clinical diagnosis, management, and prognosis of AKI through the combined use of available clinical markers and novel inflammatory, injury, and repair biomarkers.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^1141Tn99]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) are commonly ordered in clinical practice to evaluate for inflammation. CRP is a more sensitive and specific test for detecting acute phase inflammation, and the American Society for Clinical Pathology recommends ordering CRP rather than ESR to detect acute phase inflammation in patients with undiagnosed conditions. We sought to understand CRP and ESR ordering practices and reduce unnecessary use of ESR testing at our academic medical centre. We surveyed physician leaders in clinical areas with high utilisation of ESR testing to understand the drivers of potential overutilisation of these tests. Based on survey responses, we designed an intervention focused on education, clinical decision support within the electronic medical record and quarterly audit and feedback. We evaluated appropriateness of ESR ordering before and after the intervention via structured chart audit. Comparison of monthly rates of ESR tests during the preintervention and postintervention periods was conducted using interrupted time series analysis. Clinical habit and ease of test ordering were identified as key drivers of ESR overuse. Compared with the preintervention period, we observed a 33% reduction in the number of ESR tests per month and a 25% reduction in combined CRP and ESR tests per month during the postintervention period. This reduction corresponded to an annual avoidance of 2633 ESR tests with a corresponding estimated direct cost avoidance of $23 701 annually. Although the rate of ESR testing decreased, there was no significant improvement in the clinical appropriateness of residual ESR test ordering following the intervention. A multifaceted intervention was associated with significant decreases in unnecessary ESR tests and concurrent ESR and CRP tests at our academic medical centre. Despite these reductions, there are continued opportunities to reduce inappropriate ESR testing.

### Recent advances in vascular inflammation: C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers [^117AHHmf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inflammatory vascular diseases are initiated and perpetuated by the interaction of immune cells with cells of the affected vessel wall. This is directed by a network of chemical messengers, which, in a state of vascular health, exist as balanced but opposing forces. Our understanding of this highly complex process has advanced significantly in the last several decades. The detection of vascular inflammation and monitoring of this activity have long been attempted in systemic vasculitis, and, more recently, in atherosclerosis. Markers of vascular inflammation used thus far have been of limited value; few provide both adequate sensitivity and specificity for any particular disease. New insights into the pathophysiology of vascular inflammation have identified other potential markers that may improve detection and monitoring of these conditions.

Recent Findings

Immunomodulatory mediators of the inflammatory cascade have been identified, and their roles are being defined. There are recent data that implicate various cytokines, proteases, adhesion molecules, and acute phase proteins as participants in the generation of vascular inflammation.

Conclusion

The pursuit of highly sensitive and specific markers of vascular inflammation has produced a wealth of information that has been instrumental in advancing our comprehension of this complex process. Further studies will establish the role of these new markers in the diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication of inflammatory vascular disease.

Inflammatory markers in children and adolescents — evidence and recommendations are limited: Because inflammation is an important part of the atherosclerotic process in adults, it was included as an independent risk factor for the evidence review with specific inflammatory markers identified as outcome measures; however, no systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that addressed inflammation in children or adolescents were identified, and only a small number of RCTs and observational studies measured selected inflammatory markers. The Expert Panel concluded that the available evidence was not sufficient to make any statement regarding the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis in childhood or to include any recommendation regarding measurement of inflammatory markers in the pediatric age group.

### Should we measure C-reactive protein on earth or just on JUPITER? [^117Bffgr]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence for the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is compelling and has generated interest in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a marker of cardiovascular risk. Data regarding hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk, though largely consistent, is of unclear clinical relevance. Most recently, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial has led to further debate regarding the utility of hs-CRP. This article provides a comprehensive review of the data regarding cardiovascular risk and hs-CRP with an emphasis on the JUPITER trial and concludes with an evidence-based analysis of the current role of hs-CRP in cardiovascular risk assessment.

Statement 1: Fulfillment of the GLIM disease burden/inflammation criterion — laboratory confirmation guidance and consensus are as follows: Confirmation by laboratory markers is not always necessary, and when testing is available, we recommend that laboratory markers be measured in uncertain cases to help confirm the inflammatory character of the underlying disease or condition; the "agree" or "strongly agree" response rate to statement 1 was 100%.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^114WSSBA]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — assessment of inflammation criterion (modified Delphi guidance): A GLIM-constituted working group with 36 participants developed consensus-based guidance through a modified Delphi review, and a multiround review and revision process served to develop seven guidance statements, with the final round highly favorable at 99% overall "agree" or "strongly agree" responses. For applying the disease burden/inflammation criterion, the presence of acute or chronic disease, infection, or injury that is usually associated with inflammatory activity may be used to fulfill the GLIM disease burden/inflammation criterion, without the need for laboratory confirmation; however, we recommend that recognition of underlying medical conditions commonly associated with inflammation be supported by C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements when the contribution of inflammatory components is uncertain, and when testing is available, CRP should be measured in uncertain cases to help confirm the inflammatory character of the underlying disease or condition. Interpretation of CRP requires that consideration be given to the method, reference values, and units (milligrams per deciliter or milligram per liter) for the clinical laboratory that is being used, and confirmation of inflammation should be guided by clinical judgment based on underlying diagnosis or condition, clinical signs, symptoms, or CRP.

Airway inflammation markers — Many inflammatory correlates can be evaluated and studied serially in respiratory and other body fluids, such as nasal smears or lavage, induced sputum, or BAL, which may define specific phenotypes or in some cases predict severity. Exhaled nitric oxide is a noninvasive measure of airway inflammation and is useful for monitoring objective responses to globally administered corticosteroids. Although breath condensate analysis is an evolving noninvasive method for evaluation of asthma, results are still variable and further refinements are required before it can be accepted as a valid diagnostic method.

### Inflammation imaging [^114WWkW8]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic lung diseases are almost invariably associated with some degree of inflammation. Cells that evolved as an effective mechanism to counter infection and heal lung tissue may, in some circumstances, themselves be partially responsible for the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease that leads to irreversible lung damage and loss of lung function. Although standard measurements of lung function can document the progression of disease, the contributions of the numerous interacting elements to the process are difficult to measure in life. The use of molecular imaging techniques allows the different components of the inflammatory response to be monitored in situ in humans. In particular, positron emission tomography of selected markers targeted to specific cells and biochemical pathways can provide accurate measurements of disease activity, enabling a better understanding of inflammatory processes at all stages of disease. The practicability of sequential measurements allows one to monitor the natural history of different lung diseases. More importantly, imaging provides a unique tool for quantification of the modulation of discrete and specific aspects of inflammatory lung disease by targeted interventions. This should facilitate the development of new treatment strategies with better specificity for key elements of each disease.

### New biomarkers for diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease and assessing treatment outcomes [^112Dw223]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying inflammatory bowel disease, there remains a significant need for biomarkers that can differentiate between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with high sensitivity and specificity, in a cost-efficient manner. As the focus on personalized approaches to the delivery of medical treatment increases, new biomarkers are being developed to predict an individual's response to therapy and their overall disease course. In this review, we will outline many of the existing and recently developed biomarkers, detailing their role in the assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We will identify opportunities for improvement in our biomarkers, including better differentiation between the subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease. We will also discuss new targets and strategies in biomarker development, including combining modalities to create biomarker signatures to improve the ability to predict disease courses and response to therapy among individual patients.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^114Z5MHa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

SHEA — laboratory testing, inflammatory markers, and microbiology during respiratory viral pandemics: HCP should repeat laboratory testing only to the extent that it provides actionable clinical data, and HCP can monitor C-reactive protein (CRP) if clinically indicated to inform respiratory viral treatments; for COVID-19, CRP monitoring informed use of biologic agents such as tocilizumab or baricitinib. HCP should not use inflammatory markers as the basis for initiation of antibiotics or antifungal agents, and HCP should not use procalcitonin routinely to aid in the decision to initiate antibiotics. One study in 2,443 patients with COVID-19 showed that procalcitonin was not able to identify bacterial infection (positive predictive value 17%); however, it had a negative predictive value of 99.3% for bacterial infection. HCP should not obtain bacterial cultures or respiratory multiplex PCR tests for patients who do not have indicators consistent with bacterial infection, particularly those with stable clinical status in a non-ICU setting; bacterial cultures were frequently obtained for patients with COVID-19 despite a limited role in noncritical, hospitalized patients, and respiratory multiplex PCR can provide information for de-escalation of antibiotics once initiated but has not been shown to be associated with a change in management in most cases of severe COVID-19.

### Guidelines for biomarkers in autoimmune rheumatic diseases-evidence based analysis [^114DivS9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are characterised by an abnormal immune system response, complement activation, cytokines dysregulation and inflammation. In last years, despite many progresses in managing these patients, it has been shown that clinical remission is reached in less than 50% of patients and a personalised and tailored therapeutic approach is still lacking resulting in a significant gap between guidelines and real-world practice. In this context, the need for biomarkers facilitating early diagnosis and profiling those individuals at the highest risk for a poor outcome has become of crucial interest. A biomarker generally refers to a measured characteristic which may be used as an indicator of some biological state or condition. Three different types of medical biomarkers has been suggested: i. mechanistic markers; ii. clinical disease markers; iii. therapeutic markers. A combination of biomarkers from these different groups could be used for an ideal more accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, although a growing body of evidence is focused on improving biomarkers, a significant amount of this information is not integrated on standard clinical care. The overarching aim of this work was to clarify the meaning of specific biomarkers during autoimmune diseases; their possible role in confirming diagnosis, predicting outcome and suggesting specific treatments.

### C-reactive protein: repeated measurements will improve dialysis patient care [^111nJAGt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is a common feature in the uremic phenotype and associates with poor outcomes. The awareness regarding the importance of inflammation assessment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has risen in recent years, and despite the development of novel biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) is still the most measured inflammatory parameter. Notwithstanding, the possible weak points of CRP determination, this biomarker has demonstrated being useful both for guidance in clinical practice and for risk estimation. In addition, regular determination of CRP among dialysis patients has been associated with better outcomes in different dialysis facilities. Because persistent inflammation may be a silent reflection of various pathophysiologic alterations in CKD, it is crucial that inflammatory markers are regularly monitored and therapeutic attempts be made to target this inflammation.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^111Quy8j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We kept the eligibility criteria broad to include all groups of people and all variations of a test. If the participant population was unclear, i.e. when the study did not provide details regarding the inclusion criteria of the participants, such as age, the study was included.

We included studies of all designs that produced estimates of prognostic accuracy, or provided data from which estimates could be computed: prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case‐control designs (using participants from a single original cohort), and consecutive series of participants assessing the prognostic accuracy of routine laboratory tests.

We included only single‐gate designs, in which a single group of participants who may develop the target condition or event is recruited. We included studies that based their results on individual participants and studies that based their results on laboratory samples. We carefully considered the limitations of different study designs using quality assessment and analysis. Both studies that reported on a single biomarker or a range of biomarkers were considered eligible for our review question, allowing indirect or direct head‐to‐head comparisons, respectively.

Participants

We included studies recruiting people who presented to outpatient services, or were admitted to general hospital wards with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and studies that were based on serum banks of samples from people with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2.

Studies required a minimum of 10 samples or 10 participants for inclusion.

Index tests

Evidence on all reported routine blood‐based laboratory tests was collected. Tests were performed during the first assessment of the person as part of the initial routine diagnostic workup (e.g. during admission to hospital).
The tests were classified into the following groups:

Markers of inflammation;
Complete blood count;
Liver function tests;
Biochemistry;
Coagulation markers;
Kidney function tests;
Cardiac markers;
Other tests.

We interpreted the term 'routine' broadly, considering that some markers can be more routine in some settings or countries than in others. Most routine laboratory tests provide test results as continuous measurements. That means that an explicit threshold is needed to provide positive and negative results. A positive test was defined as an increased or decreased value compared to the normal range, which was defined by the included study, at the moment of first assessment. This was indicated in this review with an increase and decrease, e.g. CRP increase.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^113CB1Bo]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Recommendation 8: In patients with CD with moderate to severe symptoms, the AGA suggests biomarkers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g or CRP > 5 mg/L) to detect active inflammation and inform treatment adjustment and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity. (Conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty in evidence).

### How to use biomarkers of infection or sepsis at the bedside: guide to clinicians [^111bw38N]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In this context, biomarkers could be considered as indicators of either infection or dysregulated host response or response to treatment and/or aid clinicians to prognosticate patient risk. More than 250 biomarkers have been identified and evaluated over the last few decades, but no biomarker accurately differentiates between sepsis and sepsis-like syndrome. Published data support the use of biomarkers for pathogen identification, clinical diagnosis, and optimization of antibiotic treatment. In this narrative review, we highlight how clinicians could improve the use of pathogen-specific and of the most used host-response biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, to improve the clinical care of patients with sepsis. Biomarker kinetics are more useful than single values in predicting sepsis, when making the diagnosis and assessing the response to antibiotic therapy. Finally, integrated biomarker-guided algorithms may hold promise to improve both the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis. Herein, we provide current data on the clinical utility of pathogen-specific and host-response biomarkers, offer guidance on how to optimize their use, and propose the needs for future research.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115qTVdr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic accuracy and pretest probability impact: Across 15 studies evaluating serum CRP for detecting moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, reported single-cutoff performance spanned 1.2–73 mg/L with summary sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 50%–75%) and specificity 77% (95% CI, 67%–84%). In a low pretest probability setting (rectal bleeding score 0 and stool frequency score 0 or 1, 15% prevalence), using elevated CRP (generally > 5 mg/L) yields approximately 5.5% false negatives with normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) and false positives of 19.5%. In an intermediate pretest probability setting (e.g., stool frequency score 2 or 3, 50% prevalence), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) has false positives of 11.5%.

### Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease [^114a56TE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease of unknown pathological origin. The clinical diagnosis of AD is time-consuming and needs to a combination of clinical evaluation, psychological testing, and imaging assessments. Biomarkers may be good indicators for the clinical diagnosis of AD; hence, it is important to identify suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers have been the focus of research in recent years. This review summarizes the role of inflammatory biomarkers in the disease course of AD.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^115BLvbZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

SHEA diagnostic testing for hospitalized patients — use and limits of inflammatory markers: HCP may perform inflammatory marker tests at baseline, particularly in critically ill patients, including C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, serum ferritin, and high-sensitivity troponin. HCP should repeat laboratory testing only to the extent that it provides actionable clinical data. HCP can monitor CRP if clinically indicated to inform respiratory viral treatments. HCP should not use inflammatory markers as the basis for initiation of antibiotics or antifungal agents, and HCP should not use procalcitonin routinely to aid in the decision to initiate antibiotics. HCP should not obtain bacterial cultures or respiratory multiplex PCR tests for patients who do not have indicators consistent with bacterial infection, particularly those with stable clinical status in a non-ICU setting.

### Surrogate markers of airway inflammation: inflammometry in paediatric respiratory medicine [^116NywkN]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2000). Low credibility.

Until recently, there has not been any practical way to assess airway inflammation non-invasively in paediatrics. Surrogate markers of airway inflammation are potentially of great importance in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory airways disease in children. A large number of substances in blood, urine and exhaled air or induced sputum are currently under study to evaluate their possible usefulness as markers of airway inflammation. To be useful, a marker should be valid, preferably non-invasive, quick, reproducible, repeatable and cheap. In addition, markers should be studied in relation to their specific purpose because different markers may be useful for different types of airway inflammation. Few, if any, markers will fulfill all these requirements. Most research has focused on applications of markers in asthma, some data refer to cystic fibrosis, infections and ciliary dyskinesia. Of all surrogate markers, exhaled nitric oxide has been studied the most and seems to offer information that should be evaluated for its relevance to clinical practice. Before introducing markers of inflammation into daily practice, analysis of benefits and costs are needed. There is little doubt that 'inflammometry' will be a major step forward and will be useful in differentiating airways diseases and improving treatment.

### Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: in search of diagnostic biomarkers and treatable traits [^114QgZmc]. Thorax (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) working group defined a biomarker or biological marker as 'a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention'. In the context of COPD exacerbations, the role of biomarkers encompasses different areas. They can be applied as a diagnostic tool for early detection of events, as staging tools to classify disease severity and/or identify important subgroups, as prognostic tools to predict clinically important outcomes and, probably most importantly as therapeutic tools to identify treatment indications and monitor response. Ideally, a biomarker for COPD exacerbations is mechanistically linked to the acute burst of airway inflammation which it detects with both high negative and high positive predictive value. It should be amendable to existing therapeutic interventions (treatable trait)and serve as a surrogate endpoint for prognostic purposes. Moreover, for broad clinical implementation, a biomarker should be obtained non-invasively, highly reproducible and preferentially available at low cost. As cardiac troponin T covers most of these demands in the context of acute myocardial infarction, for many years the challenge within COPD exacerbations has been in searching for an equally well-performing biomarker. However, it seems generally accepted that due to the heterogeneity of exacerbations, such a 'global' marker most likely does not exist.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^116EVoyT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Newer CV risk stratification strategies incorporating hs-CRP (e.g. Reynolds Risk Score) have also been shown to improve risk stratification better than algorithms incorporating only traditional risk factors. There is also evidence from several landmark statin trials that on-treatment hs-CRP levels predict the likelihood of CV events. Although there is increasing evidence that CRP may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the question of whether reduction in CRP levels and/or its associated downstream effects will provide novel therapeutic avenues to reduce CV risk requires further investigation.

CV diseases are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Recent efforts directed at primary prevention of atherosclerosis have significantly reduced the incidence of initial clinical presentation of atherosclerosis. It is well established that patients with known diabetes or other traditional CV risk factors have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, 15–20% of major CV events occur in patients with no major traditional CV risk factors. As a result, recent preventive efforts have been directed at finding newer, nontraditional, biomarkers to improve risk stratification, particularly in otherwise apparently low-risk individuals.

hs-CRP, previously considered to be an indicator of systemic inflammation, has recently received much attention in the scientific literature, not only as a potential marker of increased atherosclerotic risk, but also as a potential target of therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In this review, we discuss whether hs-CRP should indeed be a target for therapy in the prevention of CV disease as well as other potential clinical implications related to hs-CRP.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115REQ6Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — inflammation laboratory markers (statement 5) indicate that use of C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended to support the inflammation criterion, with unanimous panel agreement. CRP has a half-life of 19 h, levels may be reduced in advanced liver disease, increased in end-stage kidney disease, and reduced with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium supplements, or statins may lower CRP levels. Serum albumin lacks validity for diagnosing malnutrition in inflammatory settings, recovers slowly with a half-life of 3 weeks, yet if albumin is low and CRP elevated, inflammatory activity is highly likely.

### Disease monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: evolving principles and possibilities [^111XSWdG]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease is a progressive and debilitating condition. Early and effective treatment using a treat-to-target approach is key to improving patient outcomes. Therefore, proactive monitoring is essential to ensure that treatment strategies are working and targets are being met. In this review we discuss the current monitoring tools available to us and how they can be used. We also discuss the importance of monitoring during key phases of the disease and propose an optimum treat-to-target monitoring strategy for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Regarding the advent of new technology, we discuss how this may improve our monitoring capabilities and how we envisage future monitoring strategies of inflammatory bowel diseases.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^114Ldtnm]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) reviews the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and the Endoscopic Healing Index across asymptomatic patients, those with varying symptom severity, and those in surgically induced remission, and the guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone, and in this setting a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity; however, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity, whereas in moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, while in other postoperative settings biomarkers are insufficient for establishing diagnosis of recurrence.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^117PUmCu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM inflammation criterion — application of clinical judgment states that clinical judgment based on the integration of underlying diagnosis or condition, clinical signs, and/or laboratory markers should guide confirmation of the presence of inflammatory disease or condition; judgment is also indicated to discern when serial CRP measurements may be indicated or when alternative laboratory indicators of inflammation warrant consideration, and although some of these indicators may still have limited sensitivity and specificity, they can still be used by clinicians to support the potential presence of inflammation. The "agree" or "strongly agree" response rate to statement 7 was 97%.

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a groundbreaking 2010 report, Evaluation of Biomarkers and Surrogate Endpoints in Chronic Disease. Key recommendations included a harmonized scientific process and a general framework for biomarker evaluation with three interrelated steps: (1) Analytical validation — is the biomarker measurement accurate? (2) Qualification — is the biomarker associated with the clinical endpoint of concern? (3) Utilization — what is the specific context of the proposed use?

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^11177Bcc]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline on biomarkers in ulcerative colitis — objective, scope, audience, and methods — states that the objective is to provide guidance on "well-established and commonly available biomarkers as surrogate tests for endoscopic assessment of disease or in longitudinal monitoring" of UC in the ambulatory setting, focusing on "serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin", while "predictive biomarkers for assessment of hospitalized patients with severe colitis is beyond the scope". The target audience "includes primary care and gastroenterology health care professionals, patients, and policy makers", with emphasis that qualifying statements "should never be omitted" and that recommendations "provide guidance for typical patients with UC" while recognizing individual circumstances; discussions of benefits and harms can support shared decision making. Methodologically, this document "represents the official recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)" and "was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework", with development "fully funded by the AGA Institute". The scope defines biomarkers as "biological molecules that are quantifiable in tissue or body fluid (blood, stool, and urine)" and notes that although many have been studied across outcomes such as "assessing disease activity" and "likelihood of colectomy", "most of these studies have been small, lack replication, and use markers that are not readily available outside of a research setting".

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention in adults [^114uBeWh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition definitions and inflammatory context — diagnoses and biomarker interpretation are described as follows: diagnoses include "(1) starvation-related malnutrition, which is chronic starvation without inflammation, (2) chronic disease–related malnutrition, where inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree, and (3) acute disease or injury–related malnutrition, where inflammation is acute and severe", and "Inflammation and related compensatory mechanisms associated with disease or injury may cause anorexia and alterations in body composition and stress metabolism". For laboratory markers, "experts have advised that albumin and prealbumin not be used in isolation to assess nutrition status because they are fundamentally markers of inflammatory metabolism", while "Positive acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein are also potent predictors of morbidity and mortality and are elevated in the presence of inflammation".

### Biosensors: a novel approach to and recent discovery in detection of cytokines [^112d1cGn]. Cytokine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cytokines in tissues and physiological fluids can function as potentially suitable biomarkers. Cytokines are involved in stimulating different body responses including inflammatory response to external pathogens, regulating cell-to-cell communication, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Consequently, cytokines are extensively used to monitor and predict disease progression and to track the outcome of patient treatment. The critical diagnosis of cytokine and chemokine biomarkers has been the focus of attention and it has been continuously directing the trajectory of related research to developing a novel sensing platform. Given the major challenges and constraints of the older identification methods including their high costs, low sensitivity, and high specificity, the development of biosensor technology as a simple and inexpensive tool with high sensitivity is quite attractive and interesting. The fundamental aim of this study is to present the state-of-the-art biosensor systems in order to detect different types of cytokines and to emphasize the role of these systems in the prevention, monitoring, and treatment of various cytokine-associated diseases.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115Gemak]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds for inflammation — interpretation and use are as follows: CRP levels of 3.0–9.9 mg/L are consistent with mild inflammation, levels of 10–50 mg/L are consistent with moderate inflammation, and levels of > 50 mg/L are consistent with severe inflammation; these thresholds are provided to help support identification of individuals with inflammatory diseases and conditions, not to assess risk for development of disease. Serial CRP measures can be helpful when the status or contribution of inflammation is unclear in the setting of a chronic condition, and measurement of CRP trends can be helpful, because a single normal CRP value does not exclude the possible contribution of an inflammatory component; whenever possible, the opportunity to make use of CRP test results that have been ordered for other medical purposes is encouraged.

### The relevance of RT-PCR markers for metastatic tumour cell detection [^113J92HS]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Sir,

In a recently published paper in your journal, following the commonly used definition, described 'a molecule expressed in all tumour cells but not in normal human tissues' as an ideal marker for minimal residual disease detection. In numerous studies based on this definition, the expression of markers thought to characterise disseminated cancer cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow or nodules is analysed against the results obtained in the relevant tissue obtained from healthy donors. We raise an issue that healthy donor tissues are not adequate controls.

The same volume of BJC publishes a paper (one of a series) on the association of cancer patients' outcomes with the inflammation-based prognostic score. This and many other studies clearly indicate the presence and importance of a systemic inflammation in cancer patients, implying the very likely presence of activated lymphoid cells in blood, bone marrow or nodules. Yet, this phenomenon is evidently ignored in many studies on disseminated cancer cell RT–PCR detection. As we have shown, many of the so-called tumour markers (squamous-cell carcinoma antigen, epidermal growth factor receptor, mammaglobin and small breast epithelial mucin) are expressed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes following polyclonal activation in vitro (unpublished data). Similarly, other researchers have demonstrated that some marker expression is inducible by cytokines in lymphoid cells from patients without epithelial cancer. Therefore, a positive RT–PCR result may not necessarily indicate the presence of a cancer cell, but of an activated, inflammatory cell instead. As a result, RT–PCR detection, characterised by high sensitivity, shows low specificity. Consequently, the last decade's constant attempts to apply RT–PCR for micrometastasis detection have so far failed to produce a commonly accepted, routinely applied diagnostic method.

The proper assessment of new tumour markers should consider the inflammation-induced expression. The marker expression in nonmalignant inflammatory diseases would be informative and this is an interesting issue for basic science studies, but it represents an unrealistic approach while validating new molecular markers for metastatic cancer cell detection, as each new marker would require studies of peripheral blood, bone marrow, and nodules of numerous untreated patients. Instead, a simple model of lymphoid cell activation, such as in vitro mitogen-stimulated normal peripheral blood cells could serve for testing the specificity of new markers.

### C-reactive protein and the prediction of cardiovascular events among those at intermediate risk: moving an inflammatory hypothesis toward consensus [^116CTEga]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Over 20 large-scale prospective studies show that the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events that additionally predicts risk of incident hypertension and diabetes. In many studies, the relative impact of hsCRP is at least as large as that individually of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, or smoking, and knowledge of hsCRP correctly reclassifies a substantial proportion of "intermediate-risk" individuals into clinically relevant higher- or lower-risk categories. Other studies show the relative benefit of statins to be greater among those with increased hsCRP and that achieved hsCRP levels after statin therapy predict recurrent event rates as much as achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nonetheless, it remains controversial whether the time has come to modify traditional algorithms used for global risk detection. As described here, 6 areas of controversy regarding hsCRP are resolvable with a consensus position that focuses in primary prevention on selective use among individuals with 5% to 20% 10-year risk as estimated by Adult Treatment Panel III, and focuses in secondary prevention on high-risk patients being treated with statin therapy. Forthcoming trial data could expand or contract this "screen selectively" policy, and investigators should be open to the possibility that second-generation inflammatory biomarkers may be developed that supplant hsCRP altogether. In the meantime, however, this consensus position on hsCRP should be one to which both advocates and critics of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis can adhere because it is one that can immediately improve patient care.

### Predictive value of inflammatory markers for cancer diagnosis in primary care: a prospective cohort study using electronic health records [^115Af7y3]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Repeat testing

When patients with a raised inflammatory marker (n = 46,092) had a second inflammatory marker test taken within 90 days (n = 13,873), the cancer incidence was greatest if the second test result was further increased, at 6.86% (5.73–7.99) for CRP, 5.04% (4.01–6.08) for ESR and 4.13% (2.00–6.26) for PV. If the second test was lower than the first, but still above the normal range, the cancer incidence was 4.35% (3.66–5.04) for CRP, 3.55% (2.86–4.24) for ESR and 3.28% (1.79–4.78) for PV. If the repeat test was normal the cancer incidence fell to 1.98% (1.49–2.47) for CRP, 2.49% (1.73–3.26) for ESR, and 1.32% (0.34–2.29) for PV. This is shown in Fig. 2 for the most frequently used inflammatory marker, CRP.

Multiple inflammatory marker tests

For the 61,545 who had more than one inflammatory marker test done together, if both were normal (n = 39 368; 64.0%), the cancer incidence was 1.28% (1.17–1.39), with one raised and the other normal (n = 13 472; 21.9%) the cancer incidence was 2.27% (2.02–2.52), if both were raised (n = 8 705; 14.1%) then cancer incidence was 4.71% (4.26–5.16).

### High-sensitivity troponin T as a rule-out marker for myocardial inflammation detectable by CMR imaging [^114eLdGH]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocarditis is a clinically important and relevant cardiac diagnosis, especially in young adults. The presentation ranges from mild symptoms to severe cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac death. While viral infections are the most common cause, myocarditis can also result from bacterial, fungal and other treatable diseases such as giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis or systemic inflammatory disorders.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can detect acute myocardial inflammation with a high sensitivity. Current guidelines recommend CMR as mandatory in addition to echocardiography, ECG and laboratory testing in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis.CMR may also guide interventionalists to regions of interest for endomyocardial biopsy.

The 'Lake-Louise' criteria are established criteria for the CMR-based diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Diagnosis is confirmed when two criteria are fulfilled: (1) presence of myocardial oedema as assessed via T2-weighted images or T2 mapping and (2) presence of myocardial damage with proof of early or late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) or elevated T1 mapping or extracellular volume values. Application of these criteria lead to detection of myocardial inflammation with high sensitivity, making CMR the gold standard of non-invasive diagnosis of acute myocarditis.

Despite the recommendation to use a multidimensional approach (ECG, CMR, echocardiography, laboratory testing) to diagnose myocarditis, CMR availability is often limited in clinical practice. Therefore, appropriate patient selection to indicate CMR imaging in suspected acute myocarditis is essential.

Cardiac biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTNT) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can detect myocardial damage, but are not specific for myocardial inflammation.hsTNT, however, correlates positively with CMR parameters of acute inflammation. Interestingly, hitherto, there is no established lower hsTNT cut-off value to securely exclude detection of acute myocarditis by CMR. The aim of this study was to evaluate laboratory markers to safely rule out acute myocarditis as detected by CMR.

### Biomarkers of inflammation in infants with cystic fibrosis [^114sKZCA]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease begins silently in infancy and is characterized by infection, chronic inflammation, bronchiectasis, progressive lung function decline and intermittent pulmonary exacerbations. Early detection and treatment of pulmonary decline is key to optimal long-term outcome; however, physiologic measures of lung function and radiologic outcomes fail to capture the inflammation and infection that begins in infancy and is often silent in CF. In addition, with the recent development of medications targeting the genetic mutations in CF, there is a need for outcome measures suitable for infants and young children for clinical trials. There are limited, non-invasive, objective tools available to help identify those CF infants at risk for a more rapidly progressive pulmonary course. This unmet need could be fulfilled by identifying biomarkers of lower airway inflammation and/or injury that are suitable both as "point-of-care" diagnostics and for monitoring longitudinal changes.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^1146RmgT]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — implementation considerations for biomarker use: The guideline notes that "the serum and fecal biomarkers in this guideline are not specific for UC disease activity", serologic biomarkers such as CRP "may be influenced by concurrent systemic illnesses, as well as other co-existing inflammatory diseases", fecal markers "although more specific for intestinal inflammation, are not specific for UC disease activity", and therefore "one should also consider simultaneous evaluation for enteric pathogens in patients with UC who present with gastrointestinal symptoms", as gastrointestinal infections "are detected in approximately one-third of patients with UC presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms".

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^115zL26K]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for fever in the ICU, more specifically with respect to inflammatory markers, IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining CRP, in addition to bedside clinical evaluation, if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed low-to-intermediate in critically ill patients with new fever and no clear focus of infection. Avoid obtaining CRP to rule out bacterial infection if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed high.

### Advances in use of endoscopy, radiology, and biomarkers to monitor inflammatory bowel diseases [^115Z2fFy]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous inflammatory bowel diseases, and therapeutic requirements vary among patients. We have a limited capacity to predict disease progression for individual patients, therefore it is important that they are evaluated for the presence of active disease when symptoms are mild or even absent, when patients are more likely to respond to new treatment interventions. It then is important to monitor responses to treatment, to quickly identify those therapies that are ineffective, modify or change therapy, and avoid disease complications. Studies are underway to assess the effects of different monitoring strategies. Because of the heavy burden of severe inflammatory bowel disease on patients' health and quality of life, and the association between intestinal healing and disease progression in high-risk patients, a treat-to-target strategy (based on tissue healing) is likely to be optimal.

### Thiols as a marker of inflammatory bowel disease activity: a systematic review [^1155iaEC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has two most common forms of presentation: Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD), which are characterized by chronic inflammatory processes, with alternating remission periods and disease activity. The various therapies aim to keep patients as long as possible without clinical manifestations. Predicting exacerbations of inflammation is challenging due to the highly variable spectrum of symptomatology and lack of availability of IBD-sensitive biomarkers.

Evidence suggests that inflammation in IBD is associated with increased systemic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress, reducing antioxidants and favoring the inflammatory environment; however, there is a need to identify biomarkers capable of predicting IBD activity.

The reduction in free thiol groups in plasma proteins (plasma thiols) reflects a condition of systemic oxidative stress, since thiols are primary substrates for ROS. Plasma thiols are considered a robust measure of overall redox status in vivo, considering that thiol groups are rapidly oxidized by ROS metabolites, and therefore systemic oxidative stress is associated with reduced plasma thiol levels. Therefore, plasma thiol levels could be considered predictors for monitoring disease activity and inflammatory degree in IBD.

Endoscopic evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosing and verifying IBD activity. However, due to its invasive nature and the need for bowel preparation, it is poorly accepted by individuals with UC and CD. Additionally, it is an expensive, time-consuming and risky procedure. In clinical practice, the use of clinical IBD indices are commonly applied to quantify patient-reported disease activity, although these indices are inaccurate to reflect mucosal inflammation.

In this perspective, less invasive tests capable of reflecting and predicting IBD activity are increasingly sought after. Fecal calprotectin is currently considered an important biomarker - capable of detecting inflammatory factors related to disease activity; however, both its diagnostic accuracy to differentiate degrees of disease activity and its clinical applicability demand further studies.

Searches in this area of investigation are incessant, and aim to identify substitute markers for conventionally used markers, which have the potential to monitor disease activity and to detect early IBD exacerbations.

We sought to systematically review the evidence inherent in the measurement of serum thiol levels as a marker of IBD activity, the potential for association to predict IBD activity and the degree of clinical applicability for managing IBD.

### Noninvasive biomarkers of airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis [^115K3jTY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Airway inflammation plays a central role in the lung disease of cystic fibrosis (CF). Biomarkers of inflammation may be useful for monitoring disease progression and evaluating response to therapy. Much of our knowledge of the chronic inflammatory process in the CF airway derives from studies of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. A number of noninvasive approaches have been recently developed to more readily assess airway inflammation including sputum induction, collection of exhaled air, analysis of systemic markers of inflammation, and computed tomography imaging.

Recent Findings

While measurements of biomarkers of inflammation continue to advance our understanding of the underlying disease process, there is as yet no established role for these markers in clinical practice. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of various inflammatory markers relevant to CF lung disease, with an eye towards application as surrogate outcome measures in CF clinical trials.

Summary

It is hoped that biomarkers obtained by noninvasive means will be useful in determining specific pathways of injury (ie, oxidative or proteolytic) in individual persons with CF and in assessing response to antiinflammatory treatments.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^113y2pH4]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline — scope and methods for Crohn's disease biomarkers are defined as follows: This document represents the official recommendations of the AGA and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The objective is to inform the role of commonly used serum and fecal biomarkers as surrogates for endoscopic disease activity for both cross-sectional assessment and longitudinal monitoring in patients with an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD). The scope is restricted to biomarkers that are widely available commercially within the United States, and the guideline separately examined the predictive value of biomarkers for assessment of postoperative recurrence in CD while not examining the role of biomarkers in the diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected CD. The target audience includes gastroenterology health care professionals; primary care, emergency, and urgent care providers; patients; and policy makers. The panel defined biomarkers as molecules quantifiable in tissue, blood, stool, or urine that represent an underlying biological disease process, and focused on biomarkers widely used for assessing disease activity and making treatment decisions, measurable in easily accessible body fluid compartments, and commercially available in the United States. The panel examined performance in unselected cohorts of patients with CD, including initial assessment of postoperative recurrence after surgically induced remission, and used endoscopic assessment of disease activity as the gold standard for cross-sectional performance. Biomarkers with demonstrated utility in research studies only, but not available for widespread commercial use, were outside the scope.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^112AY3M1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) is associated with necrotic inflammation in the wall of small arteries, veins and capillaries. The consequence is ischemia, followed by impairment of the organ functions. The classification of AAV includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and renal limited-AAV (RLV). AAV is a rare disease, the annual incidence is estimated at 5.0–10.65/million. The five-year survival rate for GPA is 74–91% and for MPA 45–76%. ANCA antibodies are detected in the serum in approximately 90% of patients, and in 10% they are absent despite the typical clinical course. The sensitivity of the detected PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA amounts to 85.5%, and the specificity is as high as 98.6%. Controversies concern the usefulness of testing for antibodies in monitoring vasculitis activity. Patient evaluation is based on a multivariate analysis and requires extensive clinical experience. In everyday clinical practice, we observe an incomplete correlation of test results with the condition of a patient and the intensity of involvement of various organs. This applies, in particular, to the markers of inflammation, i.e. peripheral blood leukocytosis, ESR, CRP, or the amount of ANCA antibodies. Additionally, the clinical picture includes symptoms resulting from permanent organ damage that occurred during the disease, adverse events of drugs and infectious complications. The absence of markers unequivocally correlating with AAV activity and differentiating between other clinical conditions makes diagnostic and treatment difficult. The objective of the study was to assess the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, degree of renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies.

### Blood / brain biomarkers of inflammation after stroke and their association with outcome: from C-reactive protein to damage-associated molecular patterns [^115bsUXS]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke represents one of the most important causes of disability and death in developed countries. However, there is a lack of prognostic tools in clinical practice to monitor the neurological condition and predict the final outcome. Blood biomarkers have been proposed and studied in this indication; however, no biomarker is currently used in clinical practice. The stroke-related neuroinflammatory processes have been associated with a poor outcome in stroke, as well as with poststroke complications. In this review, we focus on the most studied blood biomarkers of this inflammatory processes, cytokines, and C-reactive protein, evaluating its association with outcome and complications in stroke through the literature, and performing a systematic review on the association of C-reactive protein and functional outcome after stroke. Globally, we identified uncertainty with regard to the association of the evaluated biomarkers with stroke outcome, with little added value on top of clinical predictors such as age or stroke severity, which makes its implementation unlikely in clinical practice for global outcome prediction. Regarding poststroke complications, despite being more practical scenarios in which to make medical decisions following a biomarker prediction, not many studies have been performed, although there are now some candidates for prediction of poststroke infections. Finally, as potential new candidates, we reviewed the pathophysiological actions of damage-associated molecular patterns as triggers of the neuroinflammatory cascade of stroke, and their possible use as biomarkers.

### Clinical utility of fecal biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease [^114x5dAG]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel diseases rely on clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic parameters. Inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated as a surrogate marker for endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory activity. Fecal inflammatory biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin are direct products of bowel inflammation and provide an accurate and noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring modality for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This report contains an overview of the currently existing literature pertaining to clinical implications of fecal biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Utility of inflammatory markers in hospitalized children with skin erythema… [^116tRWMP]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

There is overlap in the clinical presentations of superficial skin infections and deeper infections. Inflammatory markers are frequently obtained in hospitalized patients with cellulitis. However, it is unknown whether inflammatory markers discriminate between superficial and deeper infections. When CRP and ESR were below these cutoffs, the negative predictive value was 89%. Among patients presenting with skin erythema, CRP ≥ 2 mg/dL and ESR ≥ 30 mm/hr were significantly associated with deeper infection, whereas values below these cutoffs were reassuring against deeper infection. Future study of inflammatory markers in skin and soft tissue infections may help develop tailored testing strategies.

6, 7, 10 As a result, clinicians frequently order inflammatory markers for patients with presumed cellulitis, 5, 11–14 particularly those with severe presentations requiring hospitalization, in an effort to identify deeper infections. We compared inflammatory marker values between the superficial and deeper infection groups, using χ² or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t test or Wilcoxon rank test for continuous variables. We constructed receiver operating characteristic curves for CRP, ESR, and WBC count to determine the optimal cutoff points for identifying patients with deeper infection. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were estimated for each cutoff point.

Discussion In this retrospective chart review study of hospitalized children with skin erythema, we found that CRP and ESR were significantly higher in children with deeper infections than in children with superficial infections. WBC was not significantly different between groups. Children with both CRP < 2 and ESR < 30 had a NPV for deeper infection of 89%. 5, 12, 23, 24 the data among children are limited. One prospective study revealed higher CRP in children with more severe cellulitis on ultrasound. 23 Elevation in inflammatory markers with osteomyelitis is well-described, 15, 16 and researchers in another study identified similar cutoffs in CRP and ESR, but not WBC, in identifying osteomyelitis, 25 suggesting potential clinical utility to these values. In our population, these cutoffs were applicable not only to osteomyelitis but myositis and tenosynovitis as well.
