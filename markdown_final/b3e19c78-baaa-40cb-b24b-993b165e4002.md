## Question

is reiter an additif articulaire ocnidtion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Reiter's syndrome is an additive articular condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "additive articular condition" means in this context. Then, I should verify the modern definition and classification of Reiter's syndrome versus reactive arthritis. Next, I will examine the typical joint involvement pattern in reactive arthritis and whether it behaves in an additive or migratory fashion. After that, I should review the pathophysiology and genetic predisposition to see if that supports an additive pattern. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note any exceptions or nuances that might modify the interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't anchor on an outdated eponym. "Reiter's syndrome" historically referred to the triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, but contemporary rheumatology uses "reactive arthritis" to reflect that this is a sterile inflammatory arthritis triggered by a preceding gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, typically within 1–3 weeks, and classified among the spondyloarthropathies [^111YhHM6] [^113tMsEi] [^111cen9S].

> Now, I need to check what "additive articular condition" implies. In rheumatology, an additive pattern means that new joints become involved over time without resolution of previously inflamed joints, so the total joint count increases, whereas a migratory pattern implies that inflammation moves from joint to joint with earlier joints settling as new ones become involved; I should confirm that this distinction is used in clinical descriptions of oligoarthritis patterns, including reactive arthritis, before drawing conclusions [^111YhHM6].

> Next, I should review the typical joint pattern in reactive arthritis. Wait, let me verify the wording from authoritative sources: reactive arthritis is characterized by an additive or migratory oligoarthritis, most often affecting large lower-limb joints such as the knees, ankles, and feet, and this pattern is repeatedly described in classification and review literature, which directly supports that reactive arthritis can indeed behave as an additive articular process in many patients [^111YhHM6] [^116TMRbj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether this additive behavior is universal or just one possible phenotype. The same sources emphasize heterogeneity in presentation, with some patients showing a migratory pattern and others an additive pattern, and they note that extra-articular features like enthesitis, dactylitis, and ocular or mucocutaneous involvement can accompany the joint disease, reinforcing that the articular pattern is variable but includes an additive subtype within the spectrum of reactive arthritis [^111YhHM6] [^114BeCim].

> I will now examine whether the pathophysiology plausibly supports an additive pattern. Reactive arthritis arises from immune-mediated synovitis triggered by antecedent infection in genetically susceptible hosts, frequently HLA-B27 positive, and the inflammatory cascade can persist and propagate to additional joints over time, which mechanistically aligns with an additive oligoarthritis rather than a purely migratory one; I should confirm the HLA-B27 association and its link to severity and chronicity, which further supports the potential for accumulating joint involvement in some patients [^111YhHM6] [^112uM8cP] [^11729uMA].

> But wait, what if someone argues that the classic triad is not always present and therefore the arthritis might not be truly additive? I need to ensure I separate the full triad from the articular pattern; indeed, most patients with reactive arthritis do not present with the complete triad, yet the oligoarticular pattern remains a core feature and can still be additive even when extra-articular manifestations are incomplete or absent, so the absence of the triad does not negate an additive joint pattern when clinically observed [^113tMsEi] [^111YhHM6].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, Reiter's syndrome — now termed reactive arthritis — is an additive articular condition in many cases, characterized by an additive or migratory oligoarthritis of large lower-extremity joints that develops after a triggering infection, with the additive pattern reflecting ongoing immune-mediated inflammation that can involve new joints over time; I should also note that the pattern is heterogeneous and not every patient will have strictly additive progression, but the additive phenotype is well recognized within the disease spectrum [^111YhHM6] [^116TMRbj].

Reiter's syndrome is best described as a **reactive arthritis** [^111YhHM6] — an inflammatory arthritis triggered by a preceding gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection [^111YhHM6] — rather than an "additive articular condition". The term "additive articular condition" is not standard medical terminology; if intended to mean progressive, cumulative joint involvement, Reiter's can indeed show additive joint inflammation over time, but this reflects its reactive, post-infectious immune pathogenesis rather than a distinct additive disease category [^111cen9S]. Modern nomenclature favors "reactive arthritis" over "Reiter's syndrome" due to historical concerns [^115JmjSF].

---

## Definition and pathophysiology

Reiter's syndrome, now termed **reactive arthritis (ReA)** [^112uM8cP], is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs after infection of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract [^111YhHM6]. It is characterized by a sterile synovitis triggered by an immune response to a remote infection, rather than direct joint infection [^11729uMA]. The pathophysiology involves molecular mimicry and immune complex deposition, leading to inflammation of the synovium and other tissues [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features

Reiter's syndrome typically presents with a **triad of symptoms**:

- **Arthritis**: Usually asymmetric oligoarthritis involving the lower limbs, particularly the knees, ankles, and feet [^notfound].

- **Urethritis**: Inflammation of the urethra, often associated with urinary symptoms [^11146niE].

- **Conjunctivitis**: Inflammation of the conjunctiva, sometimes progressing to uveitis [^113KfjXX].

Additional features may include **mucocutaneous lesions** (circinate balanitis, keratoderma blennorrhagicum) [^11146niE], enthesitis (inflammation at tendon/ligament insertion sites) [^115RJJJX], and extra-articular manifestations such as cardiovascular involvement [^115Wa16e].

---

## Joint involvement pattern

The arthritis in Reiter's syndrome is typically **asymmetric and oligoarticular**, involving large weight-bearing joints of the lower limbs [^111YhHM6]. The term "additive articular condition" is not a standard medical term; however, if interpreted to mean progressive, cumulative joint involvement, Reiter's syndrome can indeed exhibit additive joint inflammation over time. This additive pattern reflects the immune-mediated nature of the disease, where new joints may become involved as the immune response persists or recurs [^111YhHM6].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis of Reiter's syndrome is primarily **clinical**, based on the characteristic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis following a recent infection [^111YhHM6]. Laboratory tests may reveal elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) [^112bSeCy], and HLA-B27 positivity is present in approximately 60–80% of cases [^notfound]. Synovial fluid analysis typically shows sterile inflammation, distinguishing it from septic arthritis [^111YhHM6].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment of Reiter's syndrome focuses on controlling inflammation and preventing complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are **first-line therapy** [^113tMsEi]. Corticosteroids may be used for severe inflammation or refractory cases [^113gPfxm]. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine are considered for chronic or severe disease [^113rysdD]. Biologic agents, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, have shown efficacy in refractory cases [^112bSeCy]. Prognosis varies; most patients experience remission within months, but chronic or recurrent arthritis occurs in approximately 15–20% of cases, potentially leading to joint damage and disability [^11146niE].

---

## Comparison with other arthritides

Reiter's syndrome shares features with other inflammatory arthritides, particularly within the spondyloarthropathy spectrum, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis [^114BeCim]. Key distinctions include the **post-infectious trigger** and the **classic triad** of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis [^111YhHM6].

---

## Conclusion

Reiter's syndrome is best described as a **reactive arthritis** triggered by a preceding infection, rather than an "additive articular condition". While it can exhibit progressive joint involvement over time, this reflects its immune-mediated pathogenesis rather than a distinct additive disease category. Modern medical literature increasingly uses the term "reactive arthritis" to avoid the historical connotations associated with "Reiter's syndrome" [^115JmjSF].

## References

### Reiter's syndrome: the classic triad and more [^11146niE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Reiter's syndrome, also known as reactive arthritis, is the classic triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis occurring after an infection, particularly those in the urogenital or gastrointestinal tract. Dermatologic manifestations are common, including keratoderma blennorrhagicum, circinate balanitis, ulcerative vulvitis, nail changes, and oral lesions. Epidemiologically, the disease is more common in men, although cases have also been reported in children and women. The pathophysiology has yet to be elucidated, although infectious and immune factors are likely involved. Clinical presentation, severity, and prognosis vary widely. Treatment is difficult, especially in HIV-positive patients. Prognosis is variable; 15% to 20% of patients may develop severe chronic sequelae.

### Declining use of the eponym "Reiter's syndrome" in the medical literature, 1998–2003 [^115JmjSF]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The German physician Hans Reiter (1881–1969) is associated eponymously with the syndrome of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis occurring during or after episodes of diarrhea or urethritis. During World War II, Reiter, a physician leader of the Nazi party, authorized medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. Because of this, some physicians have argued against further use of the Reiter eponym. We investigated trends in use of the Reiter eponym from 1998 to 2003. We searched MEDLINE to identify English-language articles published between 1998 and 2003. Articles were classified by whether the eponym was used without qualification (ie, without mentioning its disfavored use) or not. Five hundred thirty-nine articles were identified. Use of the eponym without qualification was less common in articles published later (34.0% in 2003 vs 57.0% in 1998; adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.49, 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.71; p = 0.001) and in articles published in higher impact journals (36.8% vs 56.8% in journals without calculated impact factors; adjusted RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73; p = 0.002). Use without qualification was more common in articles written by US-based authors (60.6% vs 31.1% for European-based authors; adjusted RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.58–2.97; P < .001). We concluded that use of the Reiter eponym without qualification decreased from 1998 to 2003.

### Reactive arthritis and Reiter's syndrome following an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella enteritidis [^115bfre9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis and Reiter's syndrome have been reported following gastroenteritis. Prevalence studies for these conditions are uncommon, and the prevalence of Reiter's syndrome after Salmonella enteritidis infection has not been previously reported. After a large outbreak of S. enteritidis gastroenteritis, a survey of persons exposed to the implicated food source was conducted, and those with reactive arthritis were evaluated for possible risk factors. Among 481 persons responding to the questionnaire, 217 cases of S. enteritidis gastroenteritis were identified (31 confirmed and 186 clinical cases; attack rate, 45%). Twenty-nine percent of the cases had symptoms of reactive arthritis, 3% had symptoms of Reiter's syndrome, and 10% had reactive arthritis with oral ulcers. Markers for severe illness (diarrhea ≥ 7 days, emergency room visit or hospitalization, and antibiotic treatment) were statistically significant but colinear factors associated with reactive arthritis. Increased awareness of postdysenteric reactive arthritis and Reiter's syndrome is recommended.

### Infliximab in the treatment of an HIV positive patient with Reiter's syndrome [^112bSeCy]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Reiter's syndrome is an acute inflammatory arthritis with no standard treatment options for patients unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). In patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-RNA levels have been correlated with elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. We investigated the safety and activity of infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha chimeric monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of an HIV positive patient with Reiter's refractory to NSAID therapy. A 41-year-old HIV positive man with Reiter's syndrome was treated with infliximab 300 mg intravenously at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 6 to 7 weeks thereafter. He presented with severe fatigue, pain, muscle wasting, synovitis of the elbows, wrists and knees, a scaly rash in the groin area, burning during urination, and severe onycholysis on all digits. Laboratory assessment revealed hemoglobin 7.8 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 152 mm/h, white blood cell count 5700 cells/mm3, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 65.7 mg/dl. HIV viral load on presentation was 1600 quantitative:ultrasensitive (Qn:US) copies/ml, decreased from a maximum of 428,000 Qn:US copies/ml at the start of antiretroviral therapy. After 6 months taking infliximab, all complaints resolved, nails regrew, and the rash cleared. CRP decreased to 0.8 mg/dl and ESR to 22 mm/h. During this 6 month period antiretroviral therapy remained unchanged, and the viral titer remained below 400 Qn:US copies/ml.

### The arthritis connection to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): why has it taken so long to understand it? [^114oLR92]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a distinct literature gap from the late 1930s until the 1950s for arthritis-IBD associations. Why did this happen?

We are unable to find IBD-arthritis descriptions in the literature for the next decade or during the World War II postwar years; neither was a connection mentioned or referenced in the standard nomenclature of diseases approved by the American Rheumatism Association of 1952. For example, the first two editions in 1950 and in 1954 of the textbook Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine did not contain text, reference or discussion of IBD-related arthritis. Investigators who observed and commented on this information gap later in the century opined that the gap could be in part due to the attribution of these disease manifestations to be simply the coincidence of an association with RA.

However, an alternate view of this literature gap is possibly related to a distraction caused by the description of a newly recognised arthritis syndrome potentially triggered by an exogenous infectious agent. The tenth rheumatism review published in 1953 describes a recently characterised condition called Reiter's Syndrome where the statement is made that 'Numerous reports on this syndrome had appeared' referring to the American and English literature reports from the preceding years. The very first actual description of Reiter's syndrome was made by the English physician Benjamin Brodie over a century earlier in 1818 where he observed a 45-year-old man with arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis. In 1916, Reiter in Germany and Fiessinger-Leroy in France described postdysenteric cases of urethritis-arthritis-conjunctivitis combinations occurring in soldiers living in close quarters during World War I. The initial characterisation of the syndrome in USA was performed by Walter Bauer and Ephraim Engleman in 1942, describing the Reiter's triad in a 23-year-old man with no history of preceding diarrhoea or venereal disease; these investigators acknowledged 'until the aetiology is established, this symptom complex should be referred to as a syndrome rather than a disease'.

### Diagnosis and classification of reactive arthritis [^111YhHM6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is a form of seronegative spondyloarthritis clinically associated with inflammatory back pain, additive or migratory oligoarthritis, and extra-articular symptoms that typically follow a gastrointestinal or urogenital infection by a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 3–6 weeks. Once arthritis is observed, however, microbial tests and blood or synovial fluid cultures are negative, and only serum antibodies are detected. Reactive arthritis commonly affects young adults, most frequently white and carrying the HLA-B27 allele. The genetic susceptibility appears as necessary with only 1–15% of cases of infection developing reactive arthritis. Clinical symptoms are different from septic arthritis which manifests with fever, systemic signs of infection, and monoarthritis. The presence of large joint oligoarthritis, urogenital tract infection, and uveitis characterizes Reiter's syndrome as a clinical subtype. Ocular, skin, and heart involvement are not uncommon and may be largely variable in severity. Diagnostic criteria are based on the ACR guidelines and include rheumatological signs along with a proof of infection.

### A case of reactive arthritis: a great masquerader [^112BgeCh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory condition with multiorgan system disease potential. Because the standard constellation of symptoms in Reiter syndrome (arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis) is not typically present in all patients, the disease can be easily overlooked if clinical suspicion is not high upon presentation. To highlight the importance of recognizing the potential of this disease in patients with a history of either gastrointestinal or genitourinary illnesses, we present the case of a young healthy male presented on multiple occasions later diagnosed with Reiter syndrome in the setting of a recent diagnosis of prostatitis. He was noted to have classical symptoms including conjunctivitis and arthritis. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a brief hospital stay and did well. Although reactive arthritis is an easily managed disease, it is easily missed particularly in young otherwise healthy patients who may not present with classic symptoms. Vigilance with regard to patients with vague seemingly unrelated complaints particularly with a history of gastrointestinal- or genitourinary-related illnesses deserves consideration for this disease process.

### Musculoskeletal manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection [^116eDW96]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal manifestations of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are common and are sometimes the initial presentation of the disease. Knowledge of the conditions affecting muscle, bone, and joints in HIV-infected patients is essential for successful management. Myopathies may be caused by pyogenic infection (eg, pyomyositis), idiopathic inflammation (eg, polymyositis), or drug effect (eg, AZT myopathy). Characteristic skeletal infections, such as tuberculosis and bacillary angiomatosis, require a high index of suspicion for accurate diagnosis. Neoplastic processes, such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, occur more frequently as the immune system deteriorates. Inflammatory and reactive arthropathies are more prevalent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals and include Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, HIV-associated arthritis, painful articular syndrome, acute symmetric polyarthritis, and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Patients with atypical musculoskeletal complaints and a suspected history of exposure should be tested for HIV.

### Keratitis in reactive arthritis (reiter syndrome) in childhood [^11678Yus]. Cornea (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a rare ocular manifestation of reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome) in a child.

Methods

A 10-year-old girl who was admitted to our hospital with low-grade fever, arthritis, and aching left eye with blurred vision was diagnosed with Reiter reactive arthritis. At the time of admittance, the ophthalmologic examination revealed keratitis; this mildly affected the vision.

Results

Keratitis resolved under treatment with topical steroids and antibiotic drops after 1 month, without scarring. Although 75% of the patients with reactive arthritis present ophthalmic manifestations, keratitis is a very rare finding in reactive arthritis and even rarer in children.

Conclusions

It should be kept in mind that keratitis could be an ocular manifestation of reactive arthritis in young patients.

### Granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis as an effective treatment for reiter disease [^115rRz1y]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Reiter disease (RD) is characterized by a triad of sterile arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis. The conditions occur concomitantly or sequentially, and are associated with mucocutaneous features such as circinate balanitis and stomatitis. Arthritis usually occurs in attacks followed by recovery, but it sometimes progresses to permanent damage of the affected joints. Because the symptoms of this disorder are attributable to activated neutrophils, we assessed the efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis (GCAP) in a 73-year-old man with RD who had skin rashes on his penis, scrotum and right hand, with severe arthralgia. The patient's skin rash and joint pain responded dramatically to five sessions of GCAP delivered at intervals of 5 days. We present a detailed description of the patient and discuss the mechanisms of GCAP, and suggest that GCAP may be useful for treating RD.

### Role of bacteria and HLA-B27 in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis [^114hhYwM]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Strictly speaking, "reactive arthritis" is a conventional term with no study-verified definition. This review will focus on the type of arthritis that is induced by the following species: Chlamydia, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter. The types of arthritis caused by these pathogens share a clinical pattern that is common in the spondyloarthropathies, especially undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and Reiter's syndrome. All these diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, must also share major pathogenetic pathways.

### Pediatric psoriasis: understanding pathological conditions and advances in treatment [^113FA3GN]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Diagnosis

The International League of Associations for Rheumatology classifies JIA into seven types. According to this classification, PsA falls under either (1) arthritis with psoriasis or (2) a condition with two or more of (A) dactylitis, (B) nail deformities (nail pitting, onycholysis, etc.), and (C) a parent or sibling with psoriasis. However, cases that meet one or more of the following conditions are considered unclassified arthritis rather than PsA: (1) arthritis in an HLA‐B27 ‐positive boy with onset after his sixth birthday; (2) ankylosing spondylitis, enthesitis‐related arthritis, sacroiliitis with inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter syndrome, or acute anterior uveitis in the patient or a first‐degree relative; (3) the presence of rheumatoid factor on at least two occasions at least 3 months apart; and (4) the presence of systemic JIA.

### The arthritis connection to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): why has it taken so long to understand it? [^1137XGnt]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

More comprehensive descriptions of this form of acute and subsequent chronic arthritis related to an infectious agent did occur during the intervening World War II years primarily from descriptions by Paronen et al in Finland where prevalent close-quarters living conditions promoted the spread of bacillary dysentery across populations of civilians. American publications describing this condition also could have contributed to distracting investigators from further studies characterising IBD-arthritis, although it was prophetically stated in the tenth rheumatism review that postdysenteric arthritis can be clinically indistinguishable from Reiter's syndrome. Further, it is clearly mentioned in this 1953 rheumatism review that a possible relationship to bacillary dysentery should be considered under the discussion of the section called Aetiology of Reiter's Syndrome.

Bringing the gut-arthritis connection to the forefront of critical thinking was a result of an unintentional experiment of nature, again related to the war effort. A shipboard epidemic of bacillary dysentery took place immediately after an American naval vessel left port from somewhere in Europe in 1962, where Dr Rolf Noer carefully documented the clinical sequelae of this epidemic from the beginning to its conclusion. He found 9 cases of Reiter's syndrome out of 602 cases of bacillary dysentery, findings which could not be explained by chance. He then stated, "It appeared that our cases of Reiter's disease were sequelae of bacillary dysentery". Later and well after the genetic association between HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis (SpA) was discovered, Calin and Fries were able to locate, examine, and clinically and genetically characterise five of the original nine Noer cases; they discovered an 80% positivity rate for HLA-B27 in these former navy enlisted men, all of whom had subsequently experienced severe, progressive destructive SpA. Calin and Fries concluded that B27 had an effect on both the incidence and severity of postdysenteric Reiter's syndrome.

### Reactive arthritis: defined etiologies, emerging pathophysiology, and unresolved treatment [^117GNr3g]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

ReA is unique in that it is one of the few disease states of which there is a known trigger. This insight into disease initiation has led to great advances in the pathophysiology. Despite this detailed knowledge, the proper treatment remains elusive. In the years to come it is possible that the specific treatment will be dictated by the triggering microbe.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^1168L5Ja]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis should be made based on the radiological findings as X-ray examinations of joints are performed routinely when there is suspicion of PsA.

Lesions reflecting structural damage such as subchondral sclerosis, erosions, bone bridges and ankylosis of the joints are still graded primarily by X-ray examination but are also visible on MRI.

In the presence of joint space narrowing, first step is differentiating inflammatory arthritis from a degenerative arthritis. Asymmetric distribution, presence of osteophytes and sclerosis are typically present in osteoarthritis.

Distribution of the findings, the so-called "target area approach to arthritis" by Resnick, allow distinction between the different types of arthritis.
If inflammation involves a single joint, one must carefully exclude septic arthritis. In infectious spondylodiskitis or sacroiliitis surrounding soft tissue usually is involved and so, identification of an abscess in the soft tissue adjacent (paraspinal or epidural) is helpful for differential diagnosis.
If inflammatory arthritis is diffuse and involves the proximal joints of the hands and feet without bone proliferation, rheumatoid arthritis is most likely.
Distal involvement in hands and feet with bone proliferation suggests the presence of one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. Differentiation among these disorders (psoriatic arthritis, Reiter syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis) largely relies on the distribution of radiographic abnormalities and clinical information. Reiter syndrome is a reactive sterile inflammatory arthritis that follows an infection at a different site, commonly enteric or urogenital. An association with urethritis and conjunctivitis, as well as seropositivity for the HLA-B27 antigen, has been described. Ankylosing spondylitis is an idiopathic inflammatory arthritis, with 96% of patients are HLA-B27 positive, commonly involves the axial skeleton, although peripheral joints may also be affected. Sacroiliac joint disease is bilateral and symmetric and it usually precedes spinal involvement. Spine involvement is characterized by osteitis, syndesmophyte formation, facet inflammation, and eventual facet joint and vertebral body fusion.

The differential diagnosis for bone production at the vertebral margins includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), characterized by exuberant, flowing ossification along the anterolateral aspects of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies. The absence of facet joint, costovertebral joint, and sacroiliac joint ankylosis, erosions, and sclerosis is very helpful to differentiate DISH from spondyloarthritis.

### Profile of Reiter's disease in Saudi Arabia [^116TMRbj]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

We studied the clinical features of cases of Reiter's disease as seen in two tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, over a period of 9 years. We gathered 34 cases, 29 (85%) males and 5 (15%) females (M:F ratio 5.8:1). The mean age of onset was 29.4 (SD 6.4) years. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary infection were elicited in 24 patients (71%). Fever occurred in 6 patients (18%), fatigue in 13 (38%) and conjunctivitis in 13 (38%). Lower limb large joints were affected at presentation in 23 patients (68%), followed by combined presentation of peripheral joints and axial joints in 10 patients (30%). Sacroilitis was seen in 5 cases (15%). One patient had spondylitis, while enthesopathy was seen in 6 patients (18%). Bone scintigraphy was done in 14 patients, 11 of which were positive at peripheral joints, while 9 showed increased uptake at the sacroiliac joints. HLA B27 status was tested in 15 patients, 4 (27%) of which were positive.

### Reiter syndrome following protracted symptoms of cyclospora infection [^11697RKC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Two large outbreaks of diarrheal illness associated with Cyclospora cayetanensis, a coccidian parasite, provided an opportunity to evaluate clinical syndromes associated with this enteric pathogen. Reiter syndrome, a triad of ocular inflammation, inflammatory oligoarthritis, and sterile urethritis, has been associated with enteric infections. We describe the first case of Reiter syndrome following protracted symptoms of Cyclospora infection.

### Reactive arthritis: clinical aspects and medical management [^113tMsEi]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is an inflammatory arthritis that arises after certain gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections, representing a classic interplay between host and environment. It belongs to the group of arthritidies known as the spondyloarthropathies. The classic syndrome is a triad of symptoms, including the urethra, conjunctiva, and synovium; however, the majority of patients do not present with this triad. Diagnostic criteria for ReA exist, but data suggest new criteria are needed. Epidemiologic and prospective studies have been difficult to perform because of over-reliance on the complete classic triad of symptoms and the different terms and eponyms used. Studies assessing various treatment strategies are ongoing.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^114BeCim]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies

Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies consist of a wide range of diseases. The archetypical representative is ankylosing spondylitis, but reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), spondyloarthropathy associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and, arguably, Whipple's disease and Behcet's syndrome can all be classed as inflammatory spondyloarthropathy. They are linked to the HLA B27 antigen to variable degrees and enthesitis is a key feature.

The patient might present with clinical features suggestive of an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, such as inflammatory back pain, heel pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis or similar, and imaging is requested to establish the diagnosis. Differentiation from rheumatoid arthritis in the early stages of the disease when there are limited clinical, laboratory and imaging features can be difficult but establishing the correct diagnosis is important.

In other cases the patient might be known to have an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy and imaging is requested to narrow the differential diagnosis, e.g. psoriatic spondyloarthropathy versus classical ankylosing spondylitis.

### Severe acute lacrimal gland insufficiency in the initial stage of reactive arthritis (reiter's syndrome) [^113DLZc4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A male in early adolescence presented with a sudden drop in vision in the emergency clinic. At the presentation, visual acuity was counting fingers in both eyes. Clinical evaluation revealed severe conjunctival congestion, sterile corneal melt and acute severe aqueous deficiency (Schirmer values 0mm at 5min) in both eyes. He had a history of fever, body ache, large joint swelling and oral and urogenital ulcers of 20 days duration. Laboratory investigations revealed positive Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) B27, strongly positive Dense Fine Speckled (DFS)70, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), increased serum ferritin levels and pus cells on urine examination, corroborative with the clinical diagnosis of reactive arthritis. He was managed with emergency tarsorrhaphy, frequent artificial tear supplements, systemic antibiotics and immune modulators. The corneal epithelial defect healed rapidly with restoration of visual acuity to 20/20 in both eyes. Acute lacrimal gland insufficiency leading to corneal melts should be promptly diagnosed and managed to prevent vision-threatening complications.

### Bilateral multifocal posterior pole lesions in reiter syndrome [^113KfjXX]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Reactive arthritis is associated with conjunctivitis or iritis. Rarely reactive arthritis is accompanied by permanent visual loss from macular infarction or foveal scarring. We present the case of a rheumatologist who had a sudden onset of skin lesions, arthritis of several joints and bilateral visual loss. Most of these manifestations resolved after a course of oral corticosteroids. However he was left with decreased vision in the left eye and multiple lesions in the fovea over a follow-up of 2 years.

Arthritides in heel pain (Pathway 4) — systemic causes and adjunct testing may be relevant: Most cases of heel pain encountered in clinical practice are likely to have a biomechanical etiology and respond to recommended therapy, but the clinician should consider that various systemic arthritides are also capable of presentation as heel pain, including the seronegative arthritides, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's disease, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and gout. Patients with arthritides and heel pain may have other joint symptoms and should be questioned regarding concomitant arthralgias, and careful radiographic evaluation and laboratory testing may assist in determining the correct diagnosis and proper treatment for these unresponsive patients. Occasionally, scintigraphy may be useful in the diagnosis process because a pattern of joint involvement will be evidenced; radiographs of the heel may show erosions or proliferative changes specific to one of these diseases, and rheumatologic consultation may be useful in determining the diagnosis and treatment.

Differential diagnosis

In patients with intestinal manifestations and arthritis the diagnosis of IBD excludes other diseases with similar symptoms: reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome), Whipple's disease, Adamantiades-Behçet's disease, intestinal bypass, gluten sensitive enteropathy and parasitic infections. Initially the clinical signs of SpA must be recognized and differentiated from those of rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases. IBD is included in the differential diagnosis of SpA even when gut symptoms are mild. The presence of spondylitis in an HLA-B27 negative patient increases the risk of IBD. The differential diagnosis of joint pain in a patient with IBD is broad. It includes HOA, septic arthritis (common or opportunistic infections), osteonecrosis especially in patients treated with glucocorticoids and experience pain that is out of proportion to the degree of limitation of passive range of motion of the affected joint. Erythema nodosum may be difficult to distinguish from arthritis when lesions occur in a periarticular location. Inability to aspirate synovial fluid from a swollen and painful joint is a clue to the diagnosis.

### Clinical utility of common serum rheumatologic tests [^111g85XH]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Serum rheumatologic tests are generally most useful for confirming a clinically suspected diagnosis. Testing for rheumatoid factor is appropriate when rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome or cryoglobulinemia is suspected. Antinuclear antibody testing is highly sensitive for systemic lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies correlate with lupus nephritis; the titer often corresponds with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. Testing for anti-Ro (anti-SS-A) or anti-La (anti-SS-B) may help confirm the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus; these antibodies are associated with the extraglandular manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome. Cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing is highly sensitive and specific for Wegener's granulomatosis. Human leukocyte antigen-B27 is frequently present in ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter's syndrome, but the background presence of this antibody in white populations limits the value of testing. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a diagnostic criterion for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis; however, specificity is quite low. ESR values tend to correlate with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and may be useful for monitoring therapeutic response.

### Reactive arthritis [^111mZ4Fx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

ReA consists of sterile axial or peripheral articular inflammation, enthesitis, and extra-articular manifestations. Most patients are HLA-B27 positive, although determining the B27 status of an individual patient is irrelevant. Exposure to specific bacterial antigens is usually the inciting factor. Diagnosis usually can be made by clinical examination and history. The current standard therapy is NSAIDs and physiotherapy, but molecular biologic treatment may ultimately become the mainstay in recalcitrant and severe ReA.

Part I genetics, structure and function of HLA B27

Introduction

Human lymphocyte antigens (HLAs) have been discovered in the first half of the last century in the context of histocompatibility research. The association of HLA B27 with a common rheumatic disease, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), was discovered by Schlosstein et al and Brewerton et al in parallel in 1973, now 50 years ago. This is the strongest association of any known association of a common variant with any human disease. The heritability of AS is believed to explain 80% of the pathogenesis of the disease. Many susceptibility alleles for the disease have been identified, with 113 established loci contributing roughly 10% of the heritability of AS, over and above the major effect of HLA B27, which determines ~25% of the genetic risk. Other related diseases belonging to the spectrum of spondyloarthritis (SpA) such as Reiter's syndrome* and anterior uveitis (AU) are also associated with HLA B27.

* This term has been abandoned, the disease is now internationally named reactive arthritis.

The canonical function of HLA-B27 is to present peptides to CD8 lymphocytes, leading to adaptive immune responses against foreign and, potentially, self-antigens. The 'arthritogenic peptide' theory as a possible mechanism by which HLA-B27 induces AS proposes that HLA-B27 presents peptides from exogenous sources to CD8 lymphocytes, which subsequently cross-react with antigens at certain sites causing inflammation and associated symptoms.

Circinate balanitis is the commonest cutaneous manifestation of reactive arthritis (Reiter syndrome), but can also occur independently. Topical corticosteroid therapy is the most commonly used treatment, and topical calcineurin inhibitors have also been used successfully. We report a case of a 20-year-old man who presented with discrete erythematous patches with slightly raised keratotic annular borders on his glans penis. He also developed geographic tongue and severe arthritis. A clinical diagnosis of circinate balanitis was made, which was supported by the psoriasiform features on skin biopsy. The patient failed to respond to topical 0.05% clobetasol propionate cream, but a novel approach using a combination of dapsone and topical 0.1% tacrolimus ointment successfully cleared his rash.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^1112iftd]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, we feel that the term 'COVID-19-associated arthritis' is more appropriate because it acknowledges the unknown mechanistic links, the lack of epidemiological data, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the lack of uniformity in the literature, with these cases 'randomly' being named as either reactive arthritis or viral arthritis. Homogenising the nomenclature will hopefully contribute to more consistent data collection and reporting, and further investigation of this new potential condition. As knowledge evolves, refinement of the nomenclature and/or establishment of robust classification/diagnostic criteria is expected to occur.

The definitions of viral and reactive arthritis (in general) are still evolving and the inconsistency in nomenclature found in this review suggests that the use of the term 'COVID-19-associated arthritis' is more appropriate and inclusive, when describing arthritis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least until more mechanistic data regarding the potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and arthritis are available. Our review informs regarding the interpretation of future case reports of COVID-19-associated arthritis and the refinement of the definition and characteristics of this potential emerging new entity.

Table 1
Coronaviruses known to infect humans

Organ dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 can be a consequence of cytotoxic damage (direct injury) and immunological insult (indirect damage) to host cells. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19. Other COVID-19 complications may include acute liver, cardiac and kidney injury, as well as secondary infection, immunothrombosis and hyperinflammatory response.

As with other respiratory tract infections, musculoskeletal symptoms can develop with coronavirus infections. Arthralgia is reported in 15% of patients with COVID-19, and myalgia is even more common (44%). However, musculoskeletal symptoms do not seem to be related to COVID-19 severity.

The current COVID-19 pandemic raises several intriguing questions, as well as clinical challenges in the context of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Cases of 'SARS-CoV-2-associated arthritis' have been reported, and inconsistently described as cases of either viral arthritis or reactive arthritis. This distinction is sometimes difficult, and classically the term reactive arthritis has been used to describe an immune-mediated sterile arthritis (typically monoarticular or oligoarticular, often involving the lower extremities, and sometimes associated with dactylitis and enthesitis) occurring several days to weeks after bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, in genetically predisposed individuals; while the term viral arthritis has been used to describe the (often symmetric and polyarticular) articular manifestations of viral infections, potentially triggered by a variety of mechanisms, including direct invasion of the joint cells or tissues, immune complex formation and direct or indirect immune dysregulation due to persistent/latent viral infection, sometimes in the context of an upper respiratory tract infection. Microorganisms that have been associated with reactive and viral arthritis are listed in table 2.

To date, there is no agreement regarding viral or reactive arthritis diagnostic or classification criteria. The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on a careful history and physical examination. In this article, we aimed to review all the reported cases of 'COVID-19-associated arthritis', which we propose, is a better term to define the entire spectrum of new-onset arthritis believed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and new-onset arthritis has not been proven, and further studies are needed to understand the immunopathogenic mechanisms. However, as more cases are reported and clinical manifestations are heterogeneous, physicians should be sensitive to this phenomenon.

### Chlamydia-induced ReA: immune imbalances and persistent pathogens [^116U6B4V]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA), an inflammatory arthritic condition that is commonly associated with Chlamydia infections, represents a significant health burden, yet is poorly understood. The enigma of this disease is reflected in its problematic name and in its ill-defined pathogenesis. The existence of persistent pathogens in the arthritic joint is acknowledged, but their relevance remains elusive. Progress is being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of ReA, whereby an imbalance between type 1 and type 2 immune responses seems to be critical in determining susceptibility to disease. Such an imbalance occurs prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response, suggesting that innate cellular and molecular mechanisms in ReA should be prioritized as fruitful areas for investigation.

Discussion

In this systematic review, we gathered all published data on patients with COVID-19-associated arthritis. We summarised a total of 33 cases in two categories: onset up to 1 week after COVID-19 (7 cases), and onset > 1 week after COVID-19 (26 cases).

We propose a new classification for cases of arthritis possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: 'COVID-19-associated arthritis'. The distinction between reactive and viral arthritis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is artificial and there is no consensual definition for either of them, both in terms of clinical presentation as well as in terms of the required period of time between the onset of COVID-19 and the onset of arthritis. Some of the cases described are outside of the interval of time described as typical of reactive arthritis (1–4 weeks); these are reports in which the articular symptoms started before or at the same time as COVID-19 symptoms or in which the articular symptoms started at least 1 month after of the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Since important differential diagnoses of viral and reactive arthritis include crystal arthropathy, septic arthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases, serological evaluation and synovial fluid analysis are critical investigations. Arthrocentesis results were reported in 10 cases, and no crystal and/or microorganisms were detected in the synovial fluid of these patients.

Our study has limitations. It is based on a small number of reports and these being descriptive and voluntary observations they are prone to ascertainment and publication bias, and findings may not be generalisable to other populations and settings. Moreover, some cases were better documented than others, and for example, important investigations such as autoantibody and serological testing and synovial fluid analysis were not systematically performed. Furthermore, the SLR did not find epidemiological data about the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis during specific periods of the pandemic, which could be compared with the incidence or prevalence of cases of COVID-19 infection during the same period of the pandemic, and with the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis before the pandemic, in the same geographical area — this type of data could allow to better infer regarding a potential causal association between COVID-19 and arthritis, as studied in Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Behçet: the syndrome [^117QoszL]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Behçet's syndrome (BS) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. It can involve the skin, mucosa, joints, vessels (arteries and/or veins), eyes, and nervous and gastrointestinal systems, and so is referred to as a syndrome rather than as a unique and nosologically distinct condition. These involvements may present alone or co-exist in the same patient. Although all the possible combinations of the above-mentioned manifestations may occur, clusters of commonly co-existing involvements (also referred to as 'disease phenotypes') have been suggested, namely 'mucocutaneous and articular', 'peripheral vascular and extra-parenchymal neurological' and 'parenchymal neurological and ocular' phenotypes have been described. Patient-specific demographic and genetic features have been described as positively or negatively associated with specific disease phenotypes. This review will focus on the different clinical features of Behçet's syndrome, summarizing current evidence on the distinct disease manifestations as well as the major phenotypes.

### Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection [^113F1tc2]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

SARS-CoV-2 is now known to cause a host of extrapulmonary complications, including cardiovascular, neurologic and dermatologic sequelae, many occurring or lasting for weeks after infection. We report the first case of 'ReA' after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

No diagnostic or classification criteria have been established for ReA, but the American College of Rheumatology has issued general guidelines, and in 1999, the 4th International Workshop on ReA discussed the term 'reactive arthritis', proposing its use only for a clinical picture and microbes associated with HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis. Consequently, the definition of ReA is now based on a diagnostic criterion (table 3)that largely focuses on enteral or urethral infections. However, we previously reported a case of clinical ReA after HIV infection; a syndrome consistent with ReA has also been reported with dengue and chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, rubella and measles vaccines. In our case, the arthritis occurred precisely 3 weeks after the infectious episode; without a competing source of identifiable extra-articular infection, and synovial fluid cultures negative for bacteria, we are strongly led to a diagnosis of clinical ReA.

ReA tends to occur most often in men between ages 20 and 50. A 30–50% of patients with ReA carry HLA-B27. Although patients without HLA-B27 can develop ReA, as is in our case, some degree of genetic susceptibility is considered necessary, since ReA occurs in only 7–15% of infected population-level subjects. The association of HLA-B27 and ReA is further illustrated by the fact that the prevalence of disease in HLA-B27-positive individuals is five times greater than in the general population. In HLA-B27-positive relatives of patients with ReA, the prevalence is an additional 10 times greater. Moreover, HLA-B27 positivity may be a poor prognostic factor, as a previous study has shown that the presence of HLA-B27 in ReA has been linked to more severe disease, higher frequencies of sacroiliitis and extra-articular manifestations, and an increased likelihood of persistent arthropathy.

### Patterns of viral arthropathy and myalgia following COVID-19: a cross-sectional national survey [^112q6kWi]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Several unanswered questions regarding COVID-19 arthropathy and myalgia exist. Potentially the most pertinent is the underlying etiopathogenesis and the likelihood of arthropathy following resolution of COVID-19 symptoms representing an uncovered autoimmune disease versus a true component of long-covid syndrome. The pathogenesis of the more common viral arthritides has been well described previously. Molecular mimicry, a phenomenon in which immune cells react with epitopes both derived from the virus and from self, is one proposed mechanism for an autoimmune etiology of new-onset arthritis. This is opposed to actual synovial intrusion by the virus. Similar pathogenesis has been described relating to the receipt of COVID-19 vaccination as well.

Gracia-Ramos et al published a systematic review of 99 cases outlining new-onset autoimmune disease following resolution of COVID-19. These authors propose three distinct patterns of new-onset COVID-19 related arthropathy based on symptom timing (ie, prior to COVID-19 symptoms, during the active infection, or following recovery/symptom resolution). Of the 99 cases reviewed, 46 patients demonstrated some type of vasculitis. Six patients met criteria for Rheumatoid arthritis, nine met criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis, six met criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus, and nine were considered to have an inflammatory myopathy. The remaining 17 patients were determined to have reactive arthritis, although the authors correctly comment that traditional diagnostic criteria for reactive arthritis involves bacterial versus viral etiologies and variability of onset.

Yokogawa et al additionally describe their experiences with 306 patients admitted to their institution for COVID-19. While approximately one-fourth of these patients reported joint and muscle pain, four patients developed joint aspiration confirmed crystal-associated arthritis (eg, gout) with variable timing of onset, ranging from eight to 27 days from COVID-19 symptom presentation.

One difficulty in reviewing the literature for this particular topic is the potentially problematic use of the term, reactive arthritis (ReA), to describe COVID-19 related arthropathy. Traditionally, ReA is considered to be clinically similar to axial or peripheral spondyloarthropathies arising from bacterial gasteroentero- or genitourinary infections. More generally, this disorder is characterized by sterile synovitis in one or more large joints distant to the primary site of infection.

### What makes psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis so different? [^114WcDFR]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

In many ways, it may be easier to highlight what rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have in common. They are both common conditions characterised by a spectrum of features or clinical manifestations in different organ systems that have led many to conclude that they are actually 'disease syndromes'. Furthermore, many of the organ systems that are affected in both conditions are the same: skin, joints, eyes, vasculature and even the immune system. Indeed, some clinicians fail to recognise these two common arthritides as distinct. And yet, while the manifestations may have a superficial similarity, there are significant differences at a number of levels including clinical, anatomical, microscopic and molecular levels. However, these differences may explain certain clinical manifestations of the two diseases, and more importantly, they may explain different responses to specific therapies and potentially different disease outcomes and prognoses. This may be especially relevant as new therapeutic targets are examined that may be specific for RA or PsA.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^111ua3Bb]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The current COVID-19 pandemic raises several clinical challenges. Cases of COVID-19-associated arthritis have been reported, and inconsistently described as either COVID-19 viral arthritis or COVID-19 reactive arthritis. We aimed to review all the reported cases of 'COVID-19-associated arthritis', which we propose, is a better term to define the entire spectrum of new-onset arthritis believed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a systematic literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to search for articles published up to 13 December 2021. We included cohort studies, case series and case reports describing patients diagnosed with COVID-19 reactive or viral arthritis by a physician, irrespective of fulfilment of classification criteria. To identify relevant studies, medical subject headings and keywords related to 'COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection' and 'reactive arthritis' were used. Our search retrieved 419 articles, of which 31 were included in the review. A total of 33 cases were reported in these 31 articles, the majority being adults (28/33 = 85%) with peripheral joint involvement (26/33 = 79%). Most of the patients responded well to treatment and the disease was self-limiting. These 33 case reports describe a possible causal relationship between exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the onset of arthritis. However, since these cases were reported during a pandemic, other aetiologies cannot be fully excluded. The exact mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 might trigger arthritis is not fully understood and robust epidemiological data to support a causal relationship are still lacking.

Serological tests were included if they were performed, as well as immunological tests including rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein antibodies, and other laboratory tests such as acute phase reactants and full blood count results. The chronicity of the manifestations was recorded.

Data synthesis

Data were summarised by stratifying the results into two groups: COVID-19-associated arthritis with onset up to 1 week after the initial COVID-19 manifestations, and COVID-19-associated arthritis with onset > 1 week after the initial COVID-19 manifestations. The 1-week cut-off was arbitrarily defined, in order to distinguish early onset cases from medium-onset/late-onset cases, as they may have different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin. Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement. In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Biologic agents in juvenile spondyloarthropathies [^111UdW7e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The juvenile spondyloarthropathies (JSpA) are a group of related rheumatic diseases characterized by involvement of peripheral large joints, sacroiliitis / spondylitis and enthesitis that begin in the early years of life (prior to 16 th birthday). Spondyloarthropathies are strongly associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27. The nomenclature and concept of spondyloarthropathies has changed during the last several decades. The classification criteria defined by the European Spondylarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) marked an important milestone in the common nomenclature for these diseases. Diseases under the spondyloarthropathy nomenclature umbrella in the younger patients include: the seronegative enthesitis and arthropathy (SEA) syndrome, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS), reactive arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis. Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) according to the ILAR classification. The definition of ERA includes children with arthritis and enthesitis, or arthritis plus other features associated with spondyloarthropathy. ESSG criteria were developed for adult population and subsequently validated in children. ERA and psoriatic arthritis patients –according to ILAR- might fulfill ESSG criteria. ERA represents nearly 15–20% of patients with JIA in cohort studies, but it does differ in different parts of the world. Figure 1 Probably differences in prevalence could be related with: ethnicity, environment and different microbiological epidemiologies. JSpA are pathogenetically different from other types of JIA.

### A' benign' condition masquerading as arthritis [^116BPziH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 9 year-old boy presented with a 3-week history of low-grade fever, on and off, and additive arthritis of the lower limb joints with no overt antecedent trauma. Investigations for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), reactive and tuberculous arthritis were normal. He was started on anti-inflammatory drugs as for seronegative oligoarticular JIA. Since arthritis persisted despite treatment, MRI of the left knee joint was planned prior to an aspiration/synovial biopsy. MRI revealed a partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with a significant effusion. On careful re-examination, at this point, he was found to have generalised hypermobility with a Beighton score of 9/9. This had been missed initially, leading to a delay in diagnosis and management. He was managed with careful physiotherapy and lifestyle modification. The left knee effusion resolved within a month. This case is being reported in order to highlight the fact that joint hypermobility syndrome can be misdiagnosed as arthritis.

### Hereditary systemic autoinflammatory diseases and schnitzler's syndrome [^114pAn9M]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

NLRP3-related autoinflammatory diseases

Previously also known as cryopyrin-associated periodic fever (CAPS), NLRP3-AID is an umbrella term for the continuum of three syndromes of varying severity, namely the mild familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, the moderate Muckle–Wells syndrome and the severe early-onset chronic infantile neurological, cutaneous and articular syndrome/neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (CINCA/NOMID). All these disorders are due to gain of function mutations in NLRP3, also known as cryopyrin.

It has long been known that low levels of mutated NLRP3, due to somatic mosaicism, were responsible for what appeared to be genetically negative cases of CINCA/NOMID. However more recently, acquired forms of CAPS were found in adult patients, resulting from somatic mutations in NLRP3 that have arisen in later life within the bone marrow. The average age of disease onset in these patients is 50 years. In terms of symptomatology and response to treatment they were similar to patients with a germline form of CAPS. This disease mechanism is not limited to NLRP3, and there are reports of other genes associated with SAID acting in a similar fashion.

A change of terminology was recently proposed to better reflect the biological and clinical characteristics of these conditions. The term 'periodic' was deemed inaccurate since in some forms of CAPS (particularly CINCA/NOMID) the conditions tend to have a chronic inflammatory course.

A novel consensus method was recently used to establish the diagnostic criteria for NLRP3-AID. These include elevated inflammatory markers (CRP/serum amyloid) and at least two of the following six clinical manifestations: urticaria-like rash, cold/stress-triggered episodes, sensorineural hearing loss, chronic aseptic meningitis, musculoskeletal symptoms (arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia) and skeletal abnormalities (frontal bossing, epiphyseal overgrowth). The proposed diagnostic criteria have a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 94% across the entire severity spectrum of NLRP3-AID.

### Osteoarthritis-an untreatable disease? [^1137QoTc]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a painful and disabling disease that affects millions of patients. Its aetiology is largely unknown, but is most likely multi-factorial. Osteoarthritis poses a dilemma: it often begins attacking different joint tissues long before middle age, but cannot be diagnosed until it becomes symptomatic decades later, at which point structural alterations are already quite advanced. In this review, osteoarthritis is considered as a disease of the whole joint that may result from multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, one of which is the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis. No proven disease-modifying therapy exists for osteoarthritis and current treatment options for chronic osteoarthritic pain are insufficient, but new pharmacotherapeutic options are emerging.

### Clinical immunology review series: an approach to the patient with recurrent orogenital ulceration, including Behçet's syndrome [^113jL4qE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with recurrent orogenital ulcers may have complex aphthosis, Behçet's disease, secondary complex aphthosis (e.g. Reiter's syndrome, Crohn's disease, cyclical neutropenia) or non-aphthous disease (including bullous disorders, erythema multiforme, erosive lichen planus). Behçet's syndrome is a multi-system vasculitis of unknown aetiology for which there is no diagnostic test. Diagnosis is based on agreed clinical criteria that require recurrent oral ulcers and two of the following: recurrent genital ulcers, ocular inflammation, defined skin lesions and pathergy. The condition can present with a variety of symptoms, hence a high index of suspicion is necessary. The most common presentation is with recurrent mouth ulcers, often with genital ulcers; however, it may take some years before diagnostic criteria are met. All patients with idiopathic orogenital ulcers should be kept under review, with periodic focused assessment to detect evolution into Behçet's disease. There is often a delay of several years between patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria and a diagnosis being made, which may contribute to the morbidity of this condition. Despite considerable research effort, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this condition remains enigmatic.

### Diagnosis and management of autoinflammatory diseases in childhood [^114XFuTw]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autoinflammatory diseases are a group monogenic inflammatory conditions characterized by an early onset during childhood.

Discussion

Under the term "periodic fevers" are gathered some monogenic diseases (familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated syndrome) characterized by periodic or recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation causing fever often associated with rash, serositis (peritonitis, pleuritis), lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and other clinical manifestations. Systemic reactive (AA) amyloidosis may be a severe long-term complication. Cryopyrinopathies are a group of conditions associated to mutations of the gene Cryopyrin that are responsible for a spectrum of diseases (familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome) characterized by a chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation variably associated with a number of clinical features, such as urticarial-like rash, arthritis, sensorineural deafness, and central nervous system and bone involvement. Other disorders are dominated by the presence of sterile pyogen abscesses prevalently affecting the skin, joints, and bones (pyogenic disorders). These include pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome, and Majeed syndrome. Finally, some diseases, such as Blau's syndrome, are characterized by the appearance of typical noncaseating granulomatous inflammation affecting the joints, skin, and uveal tract (granulomatous disorders). In the present review, we will focus on the clinical presentation of these disorders in childhood and report on the available therapeutic strategies.

### Viewpoint: could better understanding of risk factors for comorbidities pave the way towards personalized therapy in rheumatoid arthritis? [^111X3Tky]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
Diverse coexisting conditions contribute to RA disease course, treatment efficacy, and quality of life.
Personalized treatment optimally should also consider the individual risk of future development of coexisting conditions.
This risk assessment can be based on the identification of biomarkers for different comorbidities.

RA, although primarily considered a disease of the joints, may affect several other organs as well, and furthermore might be associated with various coexisting conditions. The terminology of these associated conditions is multiple, including extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities, reflecting their complex, often not fully elucidated origin. In addition to joints, several organs can be affected in RA, for example the lungs, heart, blood vessels, bone and the central nervous system. As extra-articular manifestations, we mean conditions that have a clear association with the autoimmune processes of RA. The term comorbidity is widely used for coexisting conditions of different pathomechanisms, and we suggest that this term mainly refers to conditions that are fully or partially independent from RA. Coexisting condition seems to be an optimal term to cover all these pathologies that have different pathomechanisms and still can contribute to disease course and activity, treatment efficacy, mortality and quality of life. As rheumatologists are the specialists who manage RA, it is mainly their role to take into consideration all these coexisting conditions when considering the treatment options of individual patients.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^116yhDEa]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the exact mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 might cause arthritis is not fully understood, and mechanistic data are still lacking. The most common hypothesis is the existence of molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 viral epitopes and the synovial membrane causing local inflammation, but other theories have proposed a role for the presence of circulating immune complexes or localisation of the virus directly on joint tissue. Molecular mimicry triggers humoral and cellular autoreactivity in the host. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection induces systemic inflammation that can impact the musculoskeletal system allowing direct viral infection. Recent studies have found an association between the microbiome and reactive arthritis. Any disruption of the equilibrium between gut and microbiome is called dysbiosis, which sometimes can activate a T helper 17-mediated immune response in the host's intestinal lamina propria, thereby promoting local and systemic inflammation, which could be another pathogenic link between SARS-CoV-2 and arthritis. The dysbiotic gut microbiota that persists after disease resolution could be a factor predisposing to the development of persistent symptoms and/or multisystem inflammation syndromes that occur in some patients after clearing the virus.

In conclusion, this study summarised 33 cases of (possible) COVID-19-associated arthritis. The pattern of joint involvement described in these cases was diverse, but most patients had peripheral involvement with either polyarthritis or monarthritis. Most of the patients responded well to treatment (NSAIDs and glucocorticoids).

Mild disease symptoms resembling viral or reactive arthritis, a plausible temporal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the onset of arthritis, good response to treatment and low propensity to chronicity of the arthritis are preliminary characteristic features of COVID-19-associated arthritis. However, extensively excluding other possible causes of arthritis remains critical and challenging. Therefore, data should be interpreted with caution and bearing in mind the lack of robust mechanistic and epidemiological data, and that cases were reported with a short follow-up time after the onset of arthritis.

### Beyond the joints, the extra-articular manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis [^111CiRTK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease typically affecting the joints, but the systemic inflammatory process may involve other tissues and organs. Many extra-articular manifestations are recognized, which are related to worse long outcomes. Rheumatoid nodules are the most common extra-articular feature, found in about 30% of patients. Secondary Sjögren's syndrome and pulmonary manifestations are observed in almost 10% of patients, also in the early disease. Active RA with high disease activity has been associated with an increased risk of such features. Male gender, smoking habit, severe joint disease, worse function, high pro-inflammatory markers levels, high titer of rheumatoid factor, and HLA-related shared epitope have been reported as clinical predictors of occurrence of these rheumatoid complications. In addition, there is a little evidence deriving from randomized controlled trials in this field, thus the therapeutic strategy is mainly empiric and based on small case series and retrospective studies. However, considering that these extra-articular manifestations are usually related to the more active and severe RA, an aggressive therapeutic strategy is usually employed in view of the poor outcomes of these patients. The extra-articular features of RA remain, despite the improvement of joint damage, a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, since these are associated with a poor prognosis and need to be early recognized and promptly managed.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^113zP8Mn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Low-quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 may trigger reactive arthritis one to four weeks after the infection. Post COVID-19 reactive arthritis resolves within a few days, and no additional treatment is required. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 prompt us to further investigate the immunopathogenic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases. Caution should be exerted when managing post-infectious COVID-19 patient with arthralgia.

### Rare diagnosis of melkersson-rosenthal syndrome in a paediatric patient [^115o8aDL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by the triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, facial nerve palsy and fissured tongue. This diagnosis is particularly rare in children. We aim to increase awareness of the syndromic association of these clinical features since most patients present with a monosymptomatic form, reiterating the importance of detailed history and thorough physical examination, for the timely identification of these patients. Not only the recurring of symptoms, but also the association of MRS with other medical conditions, make 'earlier' diagnosis of the Syndrome beneficial. The average delay in diagnosis is 4–9 years. Although most cases resolve without treatment, when treated, steroids are most commonly used. Variable options have been tried for refractory and frequently recurrent cases. We present a case of MRS in a 12-year-old girl, diagnosed 3 years after onset of symptoms. We reviewed updated literature for MRS and associated clinical conditions as well as published treatment options.

### Reactive arthritis [^111cen9S]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is classified as a spondyloarthropathy. Current concepts of disease suggest an infectious trigger, followed by inflammatory arthritis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction of host susceptibility and microorganism. Diagnosis relies on a compatible clinical syndrome and microbiologic confirmation of the pathogen. Antibiotic therapy seems useful in Chlamydia-triggered arthritis. The role of antibiotics in arthritis triggered by enteric pathogens is less clear. The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors in therapy is evolving. Many patients have a course limited to a few months, but others experience extraarticular disease and more prolonged courses.

### Antibiotics for treatment of reactive arthritis: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^1151tjzg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatments for reactive arthritis (ReA).

Methods

We did a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of ReA. We searched electronic databases and conference proceedings up to November 2011. Included trials reported on remission, joint counts, and pain or patient global scores in any language.

Results

Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion and 10 provided data for metaanalysis. The pooled relative risk of failure to achieve remission from a random effects model showed no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment on remission (7 trials, 375 participants, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49–1.10); however, substantial heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 76.3%, p < 0.0001). The treatment effect did not differ significantly by the type of organism triggering the ReA (chlamydia, 4 trials, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63–1.03, vs other microorganisms, 5 trials, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29–1.79, metaregression p = 0.477) or use of combination antibiotics (monotherapy, 6 trials, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.39–1.26, vs combination therapy, 1 trial, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99, metaregression p = 0.466). When unblinded trials were excluded, the treatment effect was attenuated and heterogeneity decreased (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70–1.10, I(2) = 32.8%, p = 0.19). No significant effects of antibiotic treatment were observed on joint counts, pain, or patient global scores; however, antibiotics were associated with a 97% increase in gastrointestinal adverse events.

Conclusion

Trials of antibiotic treatment for ReA have produced heterogeneous results that may be related to differences in study design. The efficacy of antibiotics is uncertain.

### Neck-tongue syndrome [^112Q7ueL]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Neck–tongue syndrome (NTS) is a rarely reported disorder characterised by paroxysmal episodes of intense pain in the upper cervical or occipital areas associated with ipsilateral hemiglossal dysaesthesia brought about by sudden neck movement. The most likely cause of this clinical entity is a temporary subluxation of the lateral atlantoaxial joint with impaction of the C2 ventral ramus against the articular processes on head rotation. NTS is an under-recognised condition that can be debilitating for patients and challenging for the treating physicians. Here, we report a 47-year-old man who fulfilled the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition criteria for a diagnosis of NTS was treated successfully with a chiropractic approach. There are currently no consensus guidelines for dealing with this disorder. Reassuringly, chiropractic care for uncomplicated NTS appears highly effective.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^1163tU14]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the intrinsic nature of case reports, it is unclear how generalisable these findings are. High variability in patient characteristics, diagnosis, examinations, and treatment were evident. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 may offer a useful opportunity to further investigate the immunopathogenetic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases.

Concluding, low quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 can target the musculoskeletal system causing reactive arthritis at its post-infectious stage. Caution should be used while managing post-infectious COVID-19 patient with arthralgia. It is unclear whether this condition can be prevented, whether previous vaccinations exert a preventive effect, and what the long-term sequelae of COVID-19-related reactive arthritis are.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^115NVXQH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — frequency, presentation, differential diagnosis, and management are summarized: musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia are common in patients receiving ICI therapy, as reported in up to 40% of those treated in clinical trials, and the most common musculoskeletal and rheumatic irAEs are arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis, which seem to be more frequent with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists and when agents are used in combination. Clinical presentations vary from involvement of large and/or small joints to oligoarthritis of large joints, features of reactive arthritis, or symmetrical polyarthritis with autoantibodies; differentials include degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatic disorders, crystal arthropathies, and septic arthritis, and inflammatory markers are usually very elevated. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required, with intra-articular corticosteroid injections an option if only one or two joints are affected.

### Classification criteria in axial spondyloarthritis: what have we learned; where are we going? [^112Z2zad]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that can have a predominately peripheral or axial presentation. Axial SpA (axSpA) affects the axial skeleton with either radiographic (r-axSpA) or nonradiographic (nr-axSpA) changes. Radiographic changes are a late disease feature and earlier disease stages can be identified by incorporating other imaging methods. The diagnosis of axSpA is a clinical diagnosis and classification criteria are not aimed to be diagnostic tools. The split between r-axSpA and nr-axSpA is artificial and we should move toward the unifying concept of axSpA. Our understanding of genetics, biomarkers, and immunopathophenotypes will drive further refinement of classification criteria.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115GbdTR]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might therefore not need much or any imaging input.

Imaging is, however, required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disease, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait and see approach is no longer acceptable.

The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these.

Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis: an update [^115jQjV2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immune-mediated disease involving chronic low-grade inflammation that may progressively lead to joint destruction, deformity, disability and even death. Despite its predominant osteoarticular and periarticular manifestations, RA is a systemic disease often associated with cutaneous and organ-specific extra-articular manifestations (EAM). Despite the fact that EAM have been studied in numerous RA cohorts, there is no uniformity in their definition or classification. This paper reviews current knowledge about EAM in terms of frequency, clinical aspects and current therapeutic approaches. In an initial attempt at a classification, we separated EAM from RA co-morbidities and from general, constitutional manifestations of systemic inflammation. Moreover, we distinguished EAM into cutaneous and visceral forms, both severe and not severe. In aggregated data from 12 large RA cohorts, patients with EAM, especially the severe forms, were found to have greater co-morbidity and mortality than patients without EAM. Understanding the complexity of EAM and their management remains a challenge for clinicians, especially since the effectiveness of drug therapy on EAM has not been systematically evaluated in randomized clinical trials.

Lung cancer initial evaluation — core components and paraneoplastic considerations are as follows: Initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination; CT imaging; pulmonary function tests; and hemoglobin, electrolyte, liver function, and calcium levels. Additional testing for distant metastases and paraneoplastic syndromes should be determined on the basis of these results, and paraneoplastic syndromes should be controlled rapidly with the goal of proceeding with definitive cancer treatment in a timely manner. Conclusions reiterate that the initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, CT imaging, basic laboratory tests, and selective testing for distant metastases and paraneoplastic syndromes.

### Response to IL-1-receptor antagonist in a child with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome [^116CWXy4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome are related disorders associated with mutations in the CIAS1 gene. They appear to represent a continuum of one disease characterized by IL-1-mediated inflammation. Until recently, these conditions have been difficult to treat; however, with the advent of IL-1-receptor antagonist therapy, many reports of successful treatment of patients with these autoinflammatory diseases have emerged in the past 2 years. We describe an 8-year-old girl, diagnosed with Familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome, confirmed by presence of a novel CIAS1 mutation, who was refractory to symptomatic treatment. As frequent attacks of urticaria and associated arthralgia had a debilitating effect on the child's lifestyle, a trial of IL-1-receptor antagonist (anakinra) was instituted. Dramatic sustained clinical improvement was evident within days and serum amyloid and C-reactive protein levels normalized within a month. Although several authors have reported successful use of this agent in children with chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome, we believe ours is the first report of successful treatment with anakinra in a young child with familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome.

### Chronic limping in childhood, what else other than juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case series [^111KM8ag]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CACP syndrome

CACP syndrome is a rare recessive disorder (prevalence of < 1/1,000,000) caused by a mutation in the PRG4 gene coding for a lubricating proteoglycan of the surface of articular cartilage. The loss of function mutation causes progressive joints deformity due to a hyperplasic process of the synoviocytes, responsible for the typical features (camptodactyly, arthropathy and coxa vara). In about 20% of cases, in addition to joint involvement, pericardial involvement is described, suggesting that CACP syndrome may also be due to a regulatory dysfunction in the proliferation of serosal cells. This condition is likely underdiagnosed and sometimes misdiagnosed as polyarticular or systemic JIA when pericardial involvement is present. However, in contrast to JIA, there is no joint inflammation, and therefore, there is little response to anti-inflammatory therapy; In addition, MRI allows to find the typical acetabular cysts. The therapeutic management is only symptomatic in association with physiotherapy and multidisciplinary approach.

Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) — for initial treatment, "IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are conditionally recommended over calcineurin inhibitors alone to achieve inactive disease and resolution of MAS. Glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended as part of initial treatment of systemic JIA with MAS. There is no preferred agent". The guideline also states "Formal recommendation deferred" regarding "PICO 24. In patients with systemic JIA, does the presence of subclinical MAS alter the treatment paradigm?" and "PICO 26. For nonresponse or partial response to biologic therapy, is addition of a calcineurin inhibitor superior to etoposide or IVIG or plasmapheresis for achievement of inactive disease and resolution of MAS?" For persistent disease activity after interleukin inhibitor therapy, "Biologic DMARDs or conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors. There is no preferred agent".

### Circinate oral and genital mucositis [^1122uRZv]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What additional study may help confirm the diagnosis?
A. Chest radiograph
B. Schirmer test
C. HLA-B27 determination
D. Fungal culture
E. Skin pathergy test

Answers:

A. Chest radiograph – Incorrect. Reactive arthritis does not involve lungs. Involvement of thoracic spine and thoracic joints is uncommon. Visceral involvement is rare and may include aortic valvular insufficiency, heart block, or pericarditis.
B. Schirmer test – Incorrect. Schirmer test is used to confirm Sjögren syndrome.
C. HLA-B27 determination – Correct. Although is not a defining laboratory finding, HLA-B27 is detected in up to 70% of the patients with reactive arthritis; positivity is associated with more severe symptoms and greater risk of chronicity.
D. Fungal culture – Incorrect. Clinical features are not suggesting mucosal candidiasis. The tongue is the most affected site in oral mucosa, and the patient did not report soreness or burning sensation on the lesions. Candida balanitis usually presents as erythematous or whitish macules and papules over the glans, along with soreness or itchiness.
E. Skin pathergy test – Incorrect. Skin pathergy test positivity is a defining criterion for Behçet syndrome.

### Windows for intervention in the prearthritis phase of rheumatoid arthritis? A narrative review of key triggering events and potential preventive strategies [^113CCNBH]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals without clinical signs of arthritis, but for different reasons are facing an increased risk for RA (eg, by testing positive for RA-related autoantibodies, presenting with small joint arthralgia, or being a first-degree relative (FDR) to a person with RA), are denoted at-risk subjects. This contrasts with the term pre-RA, which is only to be used for cases where clinical RA is known to have occurred. The risk of progression from at-risk to clinical RA is substantially different depending on the (combination of) factors underlying the at-risk classification, ranging from 0.2% to 57% over a year (table 1), highlighting the significant heterogeneity contained within the term at-risk. Stratifying the risk of progression among at-risk subjects is an important, but challenging, task to achieve personalised management of at-risk patients both in rheumatology and primary care settings. Importantly, risk stratification criteria were recently developed by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance for Rheumatology Associations, which can be used for defining more homogenous risk groups in clinical trials. It is likely that the characterisation of events that determine the transition from risk phase to overt disease would not only identify potential therapeutic targets but also likely improve individualisation of patient care.

### Reactive arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113gPfxm]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The patient presented 7 days after resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection with typical, although mild, symptoms of COVID-19 with severe swelling and pain in the left ankle joint and forefoot. Based on the overall picture, ReA appears to be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The most common differential diagnoses for oligoarthritis are ReA, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, sarcoidosis, Lyme arthritis, gouty arthritis and arthritis associated with IBD, as well as soft connective tissue disease or vasculitis. No symptoms suggestive of pathologies other than ReA — such as lymphadenopathy, back pain, skin lesions, a history of tick bites or Borrelia antibodies, IBD, psoriasis or symptoms consistent with soft connective tissue disease or vasculitis — were found on history, clinical presentation and comprehensive diagnostic examination.

ReA is a sterile joint inflammation complicating an extra-articular infection. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria, and the diagnosis is based mainly on clinical aspects such as oligoarthritis of the lower limbs that develops within 1–6 weeks of the previous infection, especially in young, HLA-B27-positive individuals. The suspected diagnosis of ReA was supported by the typical case constellation: the patient was young, HLA-B27-positive, had asymmetric oligoarthritis involving the lower extremity, the synovial fluid was sterile and symptoms began several days after resolution of infection. Complete response to NSAIDs and glucocorticoids was also consistent with typical features for ReA. The HLA-B27 allele is the genetic hallmark of SpA, including ReA; the phenotype is found in 50%–80% of cases with ReA, however, in many of the reports describing arthritis following infection with SARS-CoV2 published to date, patients were HLA-B27 negative or were not tested for HLA-B27. The mechanism by which HLA-B27 contributes to ReA is not yet fully understood. However, HLA-B27 correlates with more severe and prolonged arthritis and sacroiliitis and a higher incidence of extra-articular manifestations. Screening our patient for underlying respiratory and gastrointestinal coinfections, common in ReA, was negative, leading us to assume an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Treat to target in rheumatology: a historical account on occasion of the 10th anniversary [^112YMFCN]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic immune-mediated rheumatic diseases are characterized by inflammatory signs and symptoms, damage to joints, or spine and physical disability. In all these diseases the adverse outcomes are related to the degree of the inflammatory response and the duration of the high inflammatory situation. A state in which inflammation is minimized or eliminated is the therapeutic goal, but the time to reach such a state is also essential. Repeated treatment adaptations in the course of regular clinical assessments of disease activity are essential until the desired, predefined state is achieved. This approach constitutes the treat-to-target concept.

Recommendations for the treatment of AOSD

The consent recommendations for treatment of AOSD are the following (Fig. 2):

NSAIDS can be given in any patient suspected of AOSD.
The goal remains to limit the use of GC in AOSD, mainly because of the side effects. IL-1 blockade interferes less during the diagnostic trajectory and can be used for a therapeutic trial.
Mild disease, unresponsive to NSAIDs: short course of GC with or without MTX (dosing and administration see). If after 4–6 weeks GC exceeds 7.5 mg per day, step up to recommendations for more severe disease.
Severe systemic disease: either monotherapy IL-1 blockade, or GC and IL-1 blockade, or monotherapy GC. Step-up to IL-1 blockade should be considered in insufficient response on GC monotherapy or upon GC dependence.
Severe arthritis predominant: MTX and GC combination therapy, GC and IL-6 blockade combination therapy; IL-1 blockade and GC combination therapy; or IL-1 blockade monotherapy. IL-6 blockade may be preferred to IL-1 blockade in arthritis-dominant patients, but comparative studies are lacking.
Severe disease, unresponsive to initial treatment: switch to IL-1 blockade or IL-6 blockade, depending on the initial choice.
TNF blockade may be used in arthritis-predominant AOSD patients without systemic symptoms and upon suboptimal response to both IL-1 and IL-6 blockade.

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^115gKGDQ]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders are the most common symptomatic joint hypermobility conditions seen in clinical practice. The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also excludes other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders. Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it does not have a known genetic mutation to help with diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or recurrent dislocations. Hypermobile EDS and, less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction. The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition, diagnosis, and patient education, but by virtue of their ongoing relationship they can also help oversee and coordinate the multidisciplinary team many of these patients require.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^115qsXmF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) may trigger reactive arthritis at its post-infectious stage through immuno-mediated sequelae, including vasculitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, myositis, and lupus. COVID-19 could promote temporary immunosuppression, activating the immuno-mediated innate response. Though reactive arthritis is commonly triggered by sexually transmitted or gastrointestinal infections, syndromes consistent with reactive arthritis have been observed following Middle East respiratory syndrome, HIV, Dengue, Chickungunya, and Parvovirus B19.

Recently, several case reports originating from India, Pakistan, Italy and the United Kingdom have been published on reactive arthritis following COVID-19. The patients, mostly women aged from 30 to 50 years, developed symptoms of reactive arthritis one to four weeks after the infection (mean 22 days), similar to other forms of reactive arthritis. There was no evidence of an association between COVID-19 severity and the onset of reactive arthritis. Most patients recovered within a few days with no additional care or hospitalisation after a diagnosis by exclusion in all patients. Few patients experienced previous severe COVID-19, and only a few required intensive care units (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. Most patients had no history of autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease or travel history, and had not been prescribed any new medication. The clinical presentation was variable in terms of imaging, laboratory tests and physical examination. The location and progression of the reactive arthritis were variable. Knees, hands, and ankles were most commonly affected, with the lower back, feet, wrists, and hips less frequently. Most patients developed asymmetrical oligoarthritis, though some presented with mono-articular reactive arthritis. Similar to other forms of reactive arthritis, tumor, rubor, calor, and dolor were present in most patients and, in most cases, no associated extra-articular manifestation was documented, with inconstant nausea, cough, dysgeusia, diarrhoea, and fever. At plain radiography, no bony involvement was evidenced in most patients. Effusion, swelling and oedema were evidenced at magnetic resonance imaging and sonography. Tendinopathy, dactylitis, and enthesitis of the Achilles tendon were common. At aspiration, a mild inflammatory hypercellularity with no evidence of crystal deposition was reported at polarized light microscopy. Serological examination was also variable. Most patients presented higher values of C-reactive protein. Similar to other reactive arthritides, antibodies of rheumatological disorders were occasionally documented: anti-carbamylated protein antibody (ACPA) 1], rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and HLA-B27. Management was heterogeneous in terms of the type of pharmacotherapy, dosages and length of treatment. Most authors, following the recommendation for the management of peripheral arthritis, administered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including celecoxib, naproxen, indomethacin, etoricoxib, and ibuprofen. Ten to 80 mg of prednisolone and 4 to 8 mg of methylprednisolone were the most commonly administered steroids. Opioids were also administered orally in two patients. Other less common compounds were sulfasalazine, dilaudid, neurontin, TNF α inhibitor, certolizumab, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate.

### Neurological manifestations of the mendelian-inherited autoinflammatory syndromes [^112T18bS]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory syndromes include an expanding list of conditions characterized by unprovoked recurrent attacks of systemic inflammation with lack of auto-antibodies or autoreactive T cells. Many of these syndromes are genetic diseases with a Mendelian inheritance. Neurological manifestations may be one of the major clinical features and, in some cases, the presenting symptom of these syndromes. The purpose of this review is to increase the recognition among neurologists of the Mendelian-inherited autoinflammatory syndromes by highlighting the neurological manifestations in the context of other symptoms that should lead physicians to suspect these syndromes. Most important for neurologists are the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes that include familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (called chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome in Europe). We also review other syndromes with less common neurological involvement, including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, and hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome. Because these syndromes are often treatable and irreversible damage is prevented if they are treated early, it is important to recognize the features that may result in these syndromes presenting to a neurologist, especially in early childhood.

### Time to redefine erosive osteoarthritis [^1143io4R]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA), a disease that mainly targets cartilage, also affects ligaments, the subchondral bone and synovium, and, according to recent definitions, it is a disease of the joint as an organ. Its most characteristic radiographic features are joint space narrowing, bone sclerosis and osteophytes; bone erosions, and in particular subchondral bone erosions, have also been found in some patients. Bone erosions that classically affect the interphalangeal (IP) joints identify a disease subset called erosive osteoarthritis (OA). The particular localisation of erosive OA is considered so characteristic of the disease that the term has been used, since it was first described by Peter et al, almost interchangeably with erosive hand OA. A growing body of evidence, however, suggests that it is time to re-evaluate the definition, since the term erosive OA can be appropriately applied to other OA localisations including at the thumb base (TB)and facet joints. These different disease subsets share not only the same classic radiographic features, such as subchondral bone erosions, but also the severity of the disease's clinical expression.

### Pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis [^11729uMA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis is acute and chronic spinal inflammation initiating in the sacroiliac joints, often coupled with enthesitis, presenting as chronic inflammation at the sites of ligamentous and tendinous insertions into bone. Peripheral joint synovitis can be a prominent feature as well. Reactive arthritis is a sterile synovitis arising after an extra-articular infection of enteric or urogenital tracts. HLA-B27 has been known for about the past 30 years to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, but the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis is still not well defined. Although the clinical manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis may differ, this update discusses the two diseases together and focuses on recent evidence in both.

Recent Findings

With respect to HLA-B27 several recent studies address arthritogenic peptides, molecular mimicry, and aberrant forms of B27. Several candidate genes in addition to B27 have been implicated in recent genetic studies. With respect to bacterial infection, recent findings in bacterial antigenicity, host response through interactions of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and cytokines are providing new understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the pathogenesis of arthritis. Endogenous host factors such as proteoglycans may play a role as autoantigens and contribute to chronic inflammation on that basis.

Summary

Recent advances provide additional new insights into distinct pathogenetic mechanisms in AS and ReA that arise from a complex interplay between genetic factors including HLA-B27 and environmental factors.

### OsteoRheumatology: a new discipline? [^1122ab1Z]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

New treatments in OA

The actual treatments recommended for OA include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. No disease-modifying drugs are available to date for this pathology. Treatment of OA is not only a question of targeting the right molecule but also it is important to identify the proper subset of patients to treat considering the different phases of the disease. Moreover, different joint tissues can be involved in OA pathogenesis, including the synovium, cartilage and subchondral bone and they can be targeted by different pharmaceutical agent. Presently, OA is regarded as a heterogeneous disease, with different phenotypes. As a consequence, the next step is to investigate new treatment options in clearly defined clinical subsets within the broad OA population.

Acromegaly — diagnosis: We recommend measurement of IGF-1 levels in patients with typical clinical manifestations of acromegaly, especially those with acral and facial features. We suggest the measurement of IGF-1 in patients without the typical manifestations of acromegaly, but who have several of these associated conditions: sleep apnea syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, debilitating arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and hypertension. We recommend measuring serum IGF-1 to rule out acromegaly in a patient with a pituitary mass. We recommend against relying on the use of random GH levels to diagnose acromegaly. In patients with elevated or equivocal serum IGF-1 levels, we recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by finding lack of suppression of GH to < 1 μg/L following documented hyperglycemia during an oral glucose load.

1967. 03120150127035. REITER'S SYNDROME or the oculourethral synovial syndrome is usually characterized by the presence of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. Other fairly common manifestations include diarrhea and the presence of skin lesions. Myocarditis, pericarditis, and neuritis have been less frequently reported. 1–4. The disease occurs most commonly in young white men and follows a variable course marked by spontaneous remissions and exacerbations.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride capsule, delayed release… [^113BDS2h]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

- **Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope**: Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if these events occur
- **Serotonin Syndrome**: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue duloxetine delayed-release capsules and serotonergic agents.
- **Blood Pressure Increases**: Monitor blood pressure prior to initiating treatment and periodically throughout treatment
- **Inhibitors of CYP1A2 or Thioridazine**: Avoid co-administration with duloxetine delayed-release capsules
- **Hyponatremia**: Can occur in association with SIADH; consider discontinuation. In adult placebo-controlled trials, for patients with normal and abnormal baseline ALT values, elevation of ALT > 3 times the ULN occurred in 1. 25% of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to
0. 45% of placebo-treated patients.

In adult placebo-controlled studies using a fixed dose design, there was evidence of a duloxetine delayed-release capsules dose response relationship for ALT and AST elevation of > 3 times the ULN and > 5 times the ULN, respectively.
5. 3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, falls, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with the recommended duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls. In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo.

Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in BP. The risk of BP decreases may be greater in patients taking concomitant medications that induce orthostatic hypotension or are potent CYP1A2 inhibitors and in patients taking duloxetine delayed-release caps.
