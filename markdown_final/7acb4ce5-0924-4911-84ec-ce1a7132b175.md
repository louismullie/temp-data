## Question

Insulin pump to cure hypothyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an insulin pump can cure hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the approved purpose and evidence base for insulin pumps. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care treatment for hypothyroidism and its pathophysiology. Next, I will check whether any credible sources suggest a therapeutic overlap between insulin pump therapy and hypothyroidism. After that, I should examine physiologic reasons why insulin and thyroid hormone are not interchangeable. Finally, I need to assess safety implications and deliver a clear conclusion and practical guidance based on guidelines and labels.

> Wait, let me verify the role of insulin pumps before drawing conclusions: insulin pumps deliver continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes, primarily type 1 and selected type 2 patients who can safely use the device, often alongside continuous glucose monitoring and institutional protocols when hospitalized, but they are not designed to deliver thyroid hormone or treat thyroid disease [^114Sjo19] [^112TpEk3] [^115KEUhM].

> I should confirm the standard treatment for hypothyroidism: authoritative guidelines consistently recommend levothyroxine monotherapy as first-line therapy for primary hypothyroidism, with tailored goals and adjustments based on age, comorbidities, and clinical context; central hypothyroidism management similarly relies on levothyroxine replacement guided by free T4 rather than TSH targets, and none of these recommend any pump-based insulin therapy for thyroid hormone deficiency [^113yCqyy] [^115a2k8B] [^115rRbuc].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any credible document suggests insulin pumps treat hypothyroidism: I find no such evidence; in fact, the only intersection is comorbidity — patients can have both diabetes requiring an insulin pump and hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine, as illustrated by a case report where each condition was managed separately with the appropriate therapy, not interchangeably [^notfound].

> Let me think about the physiology to ensure I am not missing a mechanistic rationale: insulin regulates glucose uptake and metabolism via insulin receptors, whereas thyroid hormone (T4/T3) regulates basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis, and myriad genomic and non-genomic pathways via nuclear thyroid hormone receptors; insulin administration cannot substitute for absent thyroid hormone, just as thyroid hormone cannot replace insulin in diabetes, so the hormonal systems and targets are distinct and non-interchangeable.

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from endocrine overlap or metabolic effects; I need to check that: autoimmune polyglandular syndromes often co-associate type 1 diabetes and autoimmune hypothyroidism, and thyroid status can influence insulin sensitivity and glycemic patterns; correction of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine can modulate insulin requirements, yet that interaction does not imply that insulin (via pump or otherwise) treats hypothyroidism, it only means clinicians must adjust diabetes therapy as thyroid function normalizes [^115a2k8B] [^1176R1S4].

> I should double-check safety implications, because misapplying therapy here could be dangerous: using an insulin pump to try to "treat" hypothyroidism would be ineffective for thyroid hormone deficiency and could precipitate hypoglycemia and hypokalemia due to insulin's pharmacology, alongside fluid retention risk if combined with certain agents, while leaving hypothyroidism undertreated risks progression to severe decompensation such as myxedema coma, which is life-threatening and requires prompt thyroid hormone replacement, not insulin [^115YM6Yg] [^1116m29C] [^117KQdE5].

> Next, I should review whether any guideline or label hints at a therapeutic role for insulin in hypothyroidism; let me verify: ADA standards, Endocrine Society technology guidance, and FDA insulin labels uniformly address diabetes management and device use, with no indication for hypothyroidism treatment; conversely, thyroid guidelines uniformly endorse levothyroxine as the replacement therapy, underscoring that pumps are outside the scope of thyroid management [^112TpEk3] [^115KEUhM] [^113yCqyy].

> In conclusion — and I need to ensure this is precise — an insulin pump does not cure or treat hypothyroidism; insulin pumps are indicated for diabetes, while hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine replacement tailored to the clinical context, and when both diseases coexist they must be managed in parallel with condition-specific therapies and appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments [^112TpEk3] [^113yCqyy].

No, **insulin pumps do not cure hypothyroidism** because they deliver insulin, not thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is **treated with levothyroxine** [^113yCqyy], not insulin [^115a2k8B], and insulin pumps have no role in thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^111xCo8v]. Using insulin pumps in hypothyroid patients without diabetes is inappropriate and can cause serious harm, including hypoglycemia [^1116m29C] and ketoacidosis [^notfound]. The standard of care for hypothyroidism is lifelong levothyroxine therapy [^113yCqyy], with no evidence supporting insulin pumps for this condition [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disorder characterized by **insufficient production of thyroid hormones** (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) [^117FZctv] by the thyroid gland. The most common cause is autoimmune thyroid destruction (Hashimoto's thyroiditis); other causes include iodine deficiency, thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine therapy, and certain medications [^117FZctv]. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, growth, and development [^113Titvo]; their deficiency leads to **a wide range of clinical manifestations**, including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and cognitive impairment.

---

## Standard treatment for hypothyroidism

The standard treatment for hypothyroidism is **lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy** — primarily oral levothyroxine (synthetic T4) [^113yCqyy] — with dosing adjusted based on regular monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels [^115a2k8B]. Levothyroxine therapy effectively **restores normal thyroid hormone levels** [^113yC48n], alleviates symptoms [^117FZctv], and prevents complications of untreated hypothyroidism — such as cardiovascular disease, infertility, and myxedema coma [^115a2k8B].

---

## Insulin pumps: mechanism and clinical use

Insulin pumps are medical devices designed to deliver **continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)** for the management of diabetes mellitus, particularly type 1 diabetes [^114Rfx4k] [^1122WLcC]. These devices provide a continuous basal rate of insulin and allow bolus doses before meals or for correction of hyperglycemia [^1135Xekw]. Insulin pumps are indicated for patients with diabetes who require **intensive insulin therapy** [^114Sjo19], have difficulty achieving glycemic control with multiple daily injections, or experience frequent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

---

## Insulin pumps and hypothyroidism: scientific evidence

There is **no scientific evidence or clinical rationale** [^113yCqyy] for using insulin pumps to treat hypothyroidism. Pumps deliver insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, not thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland [^114Rfx4k] [^117FZctv]. Hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficiency of thyroid hormones, not insulin [^117FZctv]. Therefore, insulin or insulin pump therapy **has no therapeutic effect on hypothyroidism**, and administering insulin to patients without diabetes or insulin deficiency can cause severe, potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia [^1116m29C] [^115YM6Yg].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Using insulin pumps in hypothyroid patients without diabetes or insulin deficiency poses **significant risks and complications**, including [^116z4mvs]:

- **Hypoglycemia**: Excess insulin administration can cause dangerously low blood glucose levels, leading to seizures, loss of consciousness, or death [^1116m29C].

- **Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis**: Pump malfunction or insulin delivery failure can result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition [^116iLx81] [^116z4mvs].

- **Infection**: Insulin pumps require continuous subcutaneous infusion, increasing the risk of infection at the infusion site [^1135Xekw].

- **Device malfunction**: Insulin pumps are complex medical devices that can malfunction, leading to incorrect insulin delivery and potential harm to patients [^116z4mvs] [^112bEeN6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from major endocrine societies, including the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) [^111xCo8v], **do not recommend insulin pump therapy for hypothyroidism**. The standard of care remains levothyroxine replacement therapy [^113yC48n], with regular monitoring and dose adjustments based on thyroid function tests [^115rRbuc] [^113yCqyy].

---

## Conclusion

Insulin pumps **do not cure** hypothyroidism. They are designed for insulin delivery in diabetes management [^114Rfx4k] [^114Sjo19] and have no therapeutic effect on thyroid hormone deficiency. The standard treatment remains **levothyroxine replacement therapy** [^115a2k8B], and there is no scientific evidence or clinical rationale supporting insulin pump use for this condition [^113yC48n]. In patients without diabetes, pump use poses significant risks and complications, including hypoglycemia [^1116m29C], hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis [^116iLx81], infection [^1135Xekw], and device malfunction [^116z4mvs].

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

- **Methods**: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed.

### The rising cost of insulin for pump users: How policy drives prices [^116WAYAt]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

The price of insulin has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Medicare reimbursement for insulin is based on the route of administration via syringe (Part D) or via pump (Part B). Recently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a voluntary model for Part D enhanced plans that lower out-of-pocket costs to a co-pay of ≤ $35/month. Meanwhile, the 21st Century Cures Act and manufacturer price increases raised the cost of insulin for pump users by 304% in less than two years. Because insulin is a life-saving necessity and unlike other Part B infused drugs, we call on CMS to determine drug reimbursement on a drug-by-drug basis and to develop a payment model that lowers out-of-pocket costs for patients using insulin delivered via pumps.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical guidance: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus [^113nPcfZ]. Endocrine Connections (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with central diabetes insipidus, the SE 2018 guidelines recommend administering IV or IM vasopressin 1–2 mcg in patients with known central diabetes insipidus and excessive, inappropriately dilute urine output, with close observation of the clinical and biochemical response. Further doses of desmopressin should be considered when the production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns, to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Insulin pump therapy, multiple daily injections, and cardiovascular mortality in 18,168 people with type 1 diabetes: Observational study [^1122WLcC]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Discussion**

- **Principal findings**: This is the first large study from a population-based setting that documents the relation between insulin pump treatment and cardiovascular mortality. We studied individuals with type 1 diabetes during a mean follow-up period of 6.8 years. Among 2,441 of those treated with insulin pump therapy and 15,727 treated with multiple daily injections, insulin pump treatment was associated with a reduction of 45% for fatal coronary heart disease, 42% for fatal cardiovascular disease, and 27% for all-cause mortality. We evaluated the patients who used insulin pump therapy and do not know if the observed effect is attributable to continuous infusion of insulin or if some, if not all, of the effect is attributable to intensified glucose monitoring, increased motivation to control blood glucose, or a better knowledge about having type 1 diabetes.

- **Comparison with other studies**: The reduced number of severe hypoglycemic episodes could explain why insulin pump treatment is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. Such episodes can trigger cardiac arrhythmias and coronary plaque rupture. Administration of insulin by continuous infusion has been reported to reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemia compared with administration of insulin by multiple daily injections. There are indications that episodes of hypoglycemia occur together with cardiac arrhythmia. Stahn and colleagues used continuous glucose measurements and continuous electrocardiograms for five days to monitor 30 people with type 2 diabetes and previous cardiovascular disease.

### Availability of insulin pump therapy in clinical practice [^115fYhQg]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To examine the availability of insulin pump therapy in patients with Type 1 diabetes, patients using insulin pumps among a cohort of 7,224 patients were studied.

In logistic regression, used to evaluate variables not changing over time among the total cohort, use of insulin pumps varied by outpatient clinic (P < 0.001) and sex (P < 0.001). Cox regression analysis in 5,854 patients with detailed patient data prior to the use of an insulin pump showed associations between higher HbA(1c) (P < 0.0001), lower creatinine (P = 0.002), high and low insulin doses (P < 0.0001), younger age (P < 0.0001), and female sex (P < 0.0001) with the usage of an insulin pump. Women were 1.5 times more likely to start using an insulin pump (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.79). Patients in the 20- to 30-year age range were more than twice as likely to begin using an insulin pump than patients aged 40–50 years (hazard ratio 8.63, 95% confidence interval 5.91–12.59, and hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.80–5.64, respectively). A 10-μmol/L higher level of creatinine was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.39–0.81) for starting insulin pump use.

At 10 hospital outpatient clinics in Sweden, the use of insulin pump therapy varied by clinic. A higher proportion of women began using insulin pumps. Younger patients and patients with fewer complications were also more likely to start using an insulin pump. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in other geographical regions and to understand whether the results can be generalized.

### Insulin pump safety meeting: Summary report [^116z4mvs]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Technology Society convened a panel of insulin pump experts in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 12, 2008, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. The group consisted of physicians, nurses, diabetes educators, and engineers from across the United States. The panel members discussed safety features of insulin pump therapy and recommended adjustments to insulin pump design and use to enhance overall safety.

Software and hardware features of insulin pumps were analyzed from engineering, medical, nursing, and pump-user perspectives. The meeting was divided into four sections:

- **Engineering safety**: Designing software and hardware for insulin pump therapy.

- **Patient safety**: Selecting patients and clinical settings for insulin pump use.

- **Clinical safety**: Determining and delivering insulin dosages using insulin pump therapy.

- **Personal experiences**: A panel discussion about insulin pump safety.

Six aspects of insulin pump technology were noted to present potential safety issues: (1) software, (2) wireless communication, (3) hardware, (4) alarms, (5) human factors, and (6) bolus-dose calculation. There was consensus among meeting participants that insulin pump therapy is beneficial for patients of all ages and that insulin pump safety must be assured through careful regulation.

### WHO will be responsible for the dialysis bill? A case report and narrative review of insulin affordability 100 years after the discovery of insulin [^114iBhvD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old woman was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 9 and had previously been on an insulin pump. Other co-morbidities included CKD IV, HTN, and hypothyroidism. She presented with hyperglycemia of 400 mg/dl and fluid retention. Her GFR had decreased to 13. Her physical exam was notable for respiratory distress and anasarca. She failed to respond to aggressive IV diuresis, and urgent hemodialysis was initiated.

The patient had been lost to outpatient follow-up for a year. She had been co-managed by an endocrinologist and a primary care physician but had stopped going to her endocrinologist over a year ago due to the inability to afford the co-pays. She subsequently lost her insurance and had to pay out of pocket for her insulin; at this point, she decided to stop seeing her PCP and began to ration her insulin. Due to social stigma, she did not mention her financial issues to her healthcare providers. After identifying these challenges, we decided to start her on a more affordable regimen of NPH insulin. Through social work assistance, we were able to obtain a charity hemodialysis chair and discharge her home. She applied to Medicaid.

Healthcare expenditure with regard to diabetes rose to $327 billion from $245 billion in 2012. The price of insulin has continued to increase even after the drug's patent has expired due to the combination of FDA requirements, a monopoly in the insulin market, and the lack of federal price controls and Pharmacy Benefits Managers. The high out-of-pocket costs for insulin have led to many instances of insulin rationing among both uninsured individuals.

### The impact of insulin pump therapy compared to multiple daily injections on complications and mortality in type 1 diabetes: A real-world retrospective cohort study [^117WT1vc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This study investigates the effects of insulin pump therapy as opposed to multiple daily injections among individuals with type 1 diabetes. The research provides a comprehensive analysis of the complications and mortality rates associated with both treatment methods.

- **Methodology**: The study employed a real-world retrospective cohort design to assess the outcomes. Data were collected from medical records, ensuring a broad and relevant sample size that reflects actual clinical settings.

- **Findings**: Results indicated that insulin pump therapy can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes-related complications and improve mortality rates compared to multiple daily injections. This suggests a potential advantage for patients utilizing this technology.

- **Conclusion**: The findings highlight the importance of considering insulin pump therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes as it may offer improved health outcomes and longevity.

This research did not receive specific grants from any funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

### Insulin pump treatment; increasing prevalence, and predictors for better metabolic outcome in Danish children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^114tALLK]. Pediatric Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined nationwide data for insulin pump treatment. Since 1996, the Danish Childhood Diabetes Registry (DanDiabKids) has collected data on all Danish diabetic patients aged 0–15 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) use among Danish children with diabetes and to compare metabolic control in CSII-treated children and adolescents to those treated with multiple daily injections (MDI).

The Registry collects yearly data on insulin regimen, centrally measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and demographic data on all patients. In the period 2005–2011, 2983 young patients (1721 males) with diabetes were followed in the Registry. The mean observation period was 5.11 years (standard error [SE] 0.09). During the total period, 1846 patients were treated with MDI, and 1493 changed from MDI to CSII. In 2005, less than 5% of children were treated with CSII, while by 2011, the percentage of children on CSII increased to approximately 50%. The patients were divided into age groups: less than 10 years, 10–14 years, and 15 years.

HbA1c was significantly higher in MDI-treated children, +5.29 (CI 95% 4.29; 6.29 mmol/mol). HbA1c in all age groups was significantly lower in CSII-treated patients, and longitudinally, HbA1c continued to be lower in all age groups. In multivariate analysis, a low HbA1c at CSII start, centers with more than 100 pump patients, a more recent year of diabetes onset, a higher number of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) measurements, a higher number of daily boluses, and a higher percentage of patients using CSII were identified as predictors for better metabolic outcomes.

### Why is insulin pump treatment rarely used in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [^114QrhT8]. Pediatric Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has increased steadily in recent years. Compared to conventional insulin injection regimens, major advantages of CSII might include nearly physiological insulin secretion, lower rates of hypoglycemia, greater flexibility in daily life, and improved quality of life. However, data on CSII in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) are limited.

- **Objective**: To analyze the use of insulin pumps in CFRD and compare the demographics of pump-treated patients between CFRD and T1D.

- **Methods**: Data from the prospective German/Austrian diabetes patient registry on insulin-treated patients with either CFRD (n = 515) or T1D (n = 43,165) aged > 10 years at the manifestation of diabetes were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 4.1% (n = 21) of CFRD and 17.7% (n = 7,647) of T1D patients received insulin pump treatment within the recent year of care (p < 0.001). Pump-treated patients with CFRD had a significantly shorter duration of diabetes [median (Q1; Q3): 5.8 (2.9; 9.5) vs. 7.8 (4.3; 20.4) years, p = 0.026] and tended to be younger [22.0 (18.2; 30.1) vs. 24.9 (17.3; 45.9) years] than pump-treated T1D patients. The age at initiation of CSII appeared to be lower in CFRD [19.2 (16.5; 29.2) vs. 23.3 (14.8; 43.5) years]. Insulin pump therapy was used slightly more frequently in male CFRD patients than in females (4.7 vs. 3.6%), whereas in T1D, the opposite was observed (14.9 vs. 21.2%, p < 0.001). The discontinuation rate of CSII was higher in CFRD than in T1D (30.0 vs. 12.7%, p = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: Despite potential advantages, insulin pump therapy was rarely used in CFRD patients compared to T1D patients.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112TpEk3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in the management of hospitalized patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend continuing the use of an insulin pump or automated insulin delivery during hospitalization when clinically appropriate. This should be accompanied by confirmatory point-of-care blood glucose measurements for insulin dosing and hypoglycemia assessment and treatment if resources and training are available, and according to an institutional protocol.

### Significant hyperkalemia after discontinuation of an insulin pump [^115JmRSf]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetes who use insulin pumps may require modifications to their insulin therapy during surgery, often guided by blood glucose levels. However, altering insulin therapy can significantly impact potassium homeostasis in certain patients. This case highlights that changes in insulin therapy necessitate close monitoring not only of blood glucose but also of serum potassium levels. Additionally, factors including this patient's comorbidities and treatments that could affect potassium homeostasis are reviewed.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, particularly concerning the management of hypothyroidism in breastfeeding patients, the ATA 2017 guidelines recommend treating subclinical and overt hypothyroidism in lactating females. This is due to its adverse impact on milk production and letdown.

### Personality traits, metabolic control and the use of insulin pump functions in adults with Type 1 diabetes: An observational single-visit study [^1114cdEg]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

While a few studies have assessed the association between personality and metabolic outcomes in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), there have been none in adults or in subjects treated with insulin pumps, and hypoglycaemic episodes have not been considered in these studies. The aim of this observational single-visit study was to assess the association between personality traits and metabolic control, hypoglycaemic episodes, and insulin pump use in adult T1DM patients.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 52 adults with T1DM treated in a tertiary care centre (no complications or comorbidities; aged 27 ± 8 years; diabetes duration of 12.8 ± 6.8 years; treated with insulin pumps for 6.3 ± 0.4 years). "Big Five" personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) were assessed using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire. Data on HbA 1c, blood glucose levels, frequency of glucose testing, the number of hypoglycaemic episodes (< 3.9 mmol/l), basal and prandial insulin doses, and the number and types of boluses in the last 14 days were obtained from the insulin pumps and glucometers.

- **Results**: The mean levels of the assessed parameters were: HbA 1c 7.2 ± 1.2% (55.0 ± 13.1 mmol/mol), episodes of hypoglycaemia 7.0 (3.00–9.75), and glucose tests per day 7.3 ± 3.9. All personality traits showed average intensity. None of the traits were associated with HbA 1c, glycaemia, number of glucose tests, or number or kind of insulin boluses. Conscientiousness was the only factor associated with the incidence of hypoglycaemia.

### Faster insulin action is associated with improved glycaemic outcomes during closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes [^113Uqy67]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid-acting insulin analogues are widely used in insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes and closed-loop insulin delivery systems. However, little is known about the association between its pharmacodynamics, demographic factors, and glycaemic outcomes during closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy.

### Continuous subcutaneous IGF-1 therapy via insulin pump in a patient with Donohue syndrome [^113KYWNu]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Donohue syndrome (DS) is a severe form of congenital insulin resistance due to mutation(s) in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. Given the similarities between insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors, recombinant human IGF-1 (rhIGF-1) has been used to treat severe insulin resistance due to INSR mutation(s). Traditional subcutaneous therapy may be limited by the shortened IGF-1 half-life in these patients. We report the case of a female with molecularly confirmed DS treated with continuous rhIGF-1 therapy via an insulin pump. With treatment, the patient's hemoglobin A1c decreased from 9.8% to 8.8%, and her weight increased by 0.8 kg. Development of an ovarian tumor complicated her course, but it was unclear whether this was related to rhIGF-1 therapy. Limited treatment options exist for patients with DS. The use of continuous rhIGF-1 via an insulin pump may be a viable option, although further experience is needed to establish safety and efficacy.

### Recommendations for management of diabetes during Ramadan: Update 2010 [^116iLx81]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

An insulin pump provides continuous insulin delivery over a 24-hour period with basal infusion rates programmed and individualized for each patient. Patients self-administer boluses of insulin with meals or at times of hyperglycemia, often with mathematical support from the pump. The reliance on exclusively rapid-acting or short-acting insulin allows for flexibility over an extremely wide range of insulin doses with great precision. However, frequent glucose monitoring is required because failure of the pump or the infusion site can result in severe deterioration in control over a few hours.

Theoretically, the combined risks of hypoglycemia from prolonged daytime fasting and hyperglycemia from excessive nighttime eating can be better managed by an insulin pump–based regimen than by multiple insulin dose–injection therapy. Hypoglycemia can be aborted, reduced, prevented, and even more readily treated in pump-treated patients by timely downward adjustments or even stopping insulin delivery from the pump. Such an advantage is not available to those treated with a conventional insulin injection, in which insulin continues to be released from the site of injection throughout its predetermined duration of action. Any excess insulin action can only be counteracted by the intake of carbohydrates.

Fasting during Ramadan may be successfully accomplished in people with type 1 diabetes if they are fully educated and proficient with the use of the insulin pump and are otherwise metabolically stable and free from any acute illnesses. Prior to Ramadan, they should receive adequate training and education to manage their condition effectively.

### Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes: a still unresolved problem in the era of insulin analogs and pump therapy [^115Xqkp6]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated that in patients with type 1 diabetes, tight metabolic control achieved with intensive insulin therapy can reduce the risk of long-term microvascular complications. However, strict glycemic control carries an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. Episodes of hypoglycemia, especially at young ages, can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness, exert adverse effects on neurocognitive function, and cause significant emotional morbidity in the child and parents. Although the introduction of new insulin analogs in diabetes therapy and the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion raised hopes for a solution to this problem, these modalities have not been associated with the expected reduction in hypoglycemic episodes. The findings suggest that the prevention of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes lies in biologically controlled insulin secretion, as in islet transplantation, or the development of an autonomous closed-loop system that efficiently mimics the action of the pancreatic beta-cells and maintains blood glucose levels within the desired range.

### The rising cost of insulin for pump users: How policy drives prices [^114MPS1o]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

Given the cost and reimbursement discrepancies, OIG recommended a legislative change requiring Medicare Part B payments for DME-infused drugs to be brought in line with other Part B drugs, which are based on 106% of ASP, instead of using 2003 AWPs. This recommendation was enacted with the 21st Century Cures Act. However, simply adjusting payments for the two most highly overpaid DME-infused drugs (milrinone lactate and immune globulin), instead of revising the reimbursement for all DME-infused drugs, would have addressed 95% of the identified overpayments. Total savings would have been $267 million during the same time period, and insulin cost would not have been affected.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^113pqc6f]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Donohue syndrome and use of continuous subcutaneous insulin pump therapy [^111bvmZM]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Donohue syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by severe loss-of-function mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. The diagnosis is made on clinical, biochemical, and genetic grounds. Mutations are found on chromosome 19p13.2 and code for mutations in the INSR gene. Treatment is challenging and often unsuccessful, relying on maintaining normoglycaemia and avoiding fasting. In some patients, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF-1) has been trialed. The prognosis is poor, with most babies dying in infancy.

Ethically, it is important to consider the benefit versus burden of treatment, the quality of life of the surviving patient, and the parents' wishes when making decisions regarding withholding or withdrawing care.

### Recurrent hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patient due to hypothyroidism [^114x3j8z]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

To present a case report of recurrent hypoglycemia in a type 2 diabetic patient due to hypothyroidism, we describe a case involving a patient with type 2 diabetes who complained of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes in recent weeks. We also discuss the results of the diagnostic workup conducted to identify the cause of the recurrent hypoglycemia.

After ruling out common causes such as overdosing of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin, and renal or hepatic impairment, we identified overt hypothyroidism as the cause of the recurrent hypoglycemia. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated for this patient. Upon normalization of thyroid function, the patient did not experience further episodes of hypoglycemia. We did not find any reports on hypothyroidism as a cause of recurrent hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.

We conclude that during the diagnostic workup, clinicians should consider hypothyroidism as a potential cause of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.

### Octreotide [^1167CWAv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia**: Octreotide acetate injection alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon, and GH, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia occurring during octreotide acetate injection therapy is usually mild but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients, respectively, during octreotide acetate injection therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death were reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia following the initiation of octreotide acetate injection therapy.

	- Monitor glucose levels during octreotide acetate injection therapy and adjust the dosing of insulin or other anti-diabetic therapy accordingly.

- **Thyroid function abnormalities**: Octreotide suppresses the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Nutrition**: Octreotide acetate injection may alter the absorption of dietary fats. Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling's tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide acetate injection therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during octreotide acetate injection therapy.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1135fvsi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, specifically concerning insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend considering continuing insulin pump therapy rather than changing to subcutaneous (SC) basal-bolus insulin therapy in hospitals with access to personnel with expertise in insulin pump therapy. This applies to adult patients using insulin pump therapy for diabetes management before admission and hospitalized for a non-critical illness. It is advised to consider transitioning to scheduled SC basal-bolus insulin before discontinuing insulin pump therapy in patients with an anticipated hospital length of stay of more than one to two days where expertise in insulin pump therapy is not accessible.

As for Medicare Part B, Section 5004 of the 21st Century Cures Act ("Reducing Overpayments of Infusion Drugs", effective January 1, 2017) inadvertently contributed to insulin's high cost by changing the reimbursement methodology for the approximately 30 DME-infused drugs, including pump-delivered insulin. The number of covered drugs typically fluctuates each quarter depending on the set of DME-infused drugs for which there were claims.

### How many grays to get to the malfunction of insulin pumps? Determining the effects of radiation on insulin pump function [^112bEeN6]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Low credibility.

The primary objective was to determine if exposure to radiation has an effect on insulin pump function.

- **Method**: Four donated insulin pumps were filled with saline and set to identical program modes. They were attached together with a dosimeter and exposed to repeated CT scans.

- **Results**: Insulin Pump 1 experienced a "Prime" alarm and a darkened screen during CT scan radiation exposure; this pump was removed from further radiation exposure after 6 CT scans. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 all continued to receive 34 more consecutive CT scan exposures with no significant alarms, failures, or malfunctions. Insulin Pump 4 experienced "Low Battery" and "Stuck Button" alarms, both of which were easily fixed. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 received a total of at least 8,576 mrem from 34 CT scans worth of radiation without any significant alarms, malfunctions, or failures. Insulin Pump 1 was monitored after being removed from the study and continued to function normally with the darkened screen.

- **Conclusions**: It cannot be determined whether Insulin Pump 1 had minor malfunctions due to repetitive use as a demonstration model or due to the radiation exposure. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 were monitored for 2 additional months following radiation exposure and continued to function normally. Further research studies with a larger number of insulin pumps are warranted to determine the true effect of radiation exposure on insulin pump function.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning insulin therapy and delivery systems, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend offering insulin pump therapy, ideally with continuous glucose monitoring. This is advised for young and adult patients with T2DM who are on multiple daily injections and can use the device safely, either independently or with the assistance of a caregiver. The choice of the device should be based on the patient's circumstances, preferences, and needs.

### Type 1 diabetes prevention: A goal dependent on accepting a diagnosis of an asymptomatic disease [^111dtPgN]. Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes, a disease defined by absolute insulin deficiency, is considered a chronic autoimmune disorder resulting from the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. The incidence of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes has been increasing at a rate of 3%-5% per year globally. Despite the introduction of an impressive array of therapies aimed at improving disease management, no means for a practical "cure" exist. This said, hope remains high that any of a number of emerging technologies (e.g. continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps, smart algorithms), alongside advances in stem cell biology, cell encapsulation methodologies, and immunotherapy, will eventually impact the lives of those with recently diagnosed or established type 1 diabetes.

However, efforts aimed at reversing insulin dependence do not address the obvious benefits of disease prevention. Hence, key "stretch goals" for type 1 diabetes research include identifying improved and increasingly practical means for diagnosing the disease at earlier stages in its natural history (i.e. early, presymptomatic diagnosis), undertaking such efforts in the population at large to optimally identify those with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes, and introducing safe and effective therapeutic options for prevention.

### Armour thyroid [^1176R1S4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life. Exceptions include cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and patients undergoing a therapeutic trial of the drug.

Patients should immediately report any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity during therapy, such as chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.

- **Concomitant diabetes mellitus**: The daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need adjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward adjustment of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.

- **Concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy**: The prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants needs adjustment.

- **Biotin-containing supplements**: Instruct patients to discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before conducting thyroid function testing.

Partial hair loss may be experienced by children during the first few months of thyroid therapy. However, this is usually a transient phenomenon, and recovery is typically expected.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite general agreement on initiating and adjusting levothyroxine therapy, maintaining consistent euthyroidism involves many nuances and complexities. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on the initial dosage, as well as considering age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goals, life stage, and quality of life during dose adjustments, can be challenging and is continually evolving.

Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is crucial to avoid risks associated with periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, all aspects of the patient's life, including coexisting medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors, should be examined. If such factors do not appear to contribute and biochemical euthyroidism is maintained, a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be beneficial. Although this approach is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, it may be supported by studies offering lower-quality evidence and animal studies. Given this discrepancy, any trial of combination therapy should only continue as long as it benefits the patient. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary, and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has…

### Minimizing hypoglycemia while maintaining glycemic control in diabetes [^112vJdqb]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Preventing insulin excess requires innovative approaches, such as implantable pumps and pancreas and islet transplantation. Several interventions have shown significant effects in reducing hypoglycemia. For instance, implantable pumps placed within the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall and delivering insulin into the peritoneum have been pioneered in France. Although clinical experience is limited to approximately 350 patient-years, the investigators have reported significant reductions in severe hypoglycemia, impressive A1C concentrations, and improved quality of life. Evaluation of this therapy is predominantly based on observational studies, with some randomized trials conducted. Catheter blockage remains a persistent issue, and despite over 15 years of experience, this approach has not gained widespread clinical acceptance. It does not appear to be a viable treatment option for most adults with diabetes in the foreseeable future.

Pancreas transplantation dramatically addresses hypoglycemia problems. Whole pancreas transplantation achieves insulin independence in the short and medium term and resolves hypoglycemia unawareness, albeit at the expense of considerable perioperative morbidity and occasional mortality. The outcomes of whole pancreas transplantation have improved markedly in recent years, with an 80% graft survival rate at 5 years. It is now recognized as a treatment for severe hypoglycemic instability.

Islet cell transplantation, being less invasive, offers reduced insulin preservation.

### Effects of T4 replacement therapy on glucose metabolism in subjects with subclinical (SH) and overt hypothyroidism (OH) [^112JfshX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in subjects with overt (OH) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) before and after T4 replacement therapy. Disturbances in glucose metabolism have been observed in hypothyroid states. However, the clinical significance and potential reversibility of these alterations by T4 replacement therapy remain to be elucidated, especially in patients with SH.

Parameters of glucose metabolism were investigated in subjects with OH (n = 12) and SH (n = 11). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, and beta-cell function was evaluated by mathematical modeling of data derived from an oral glucose tolerance test.

Fasting and dynamic glycemia, as assessed by the AUC(Glucose), remained unaltered following substitution therapy (P > 0.05). Insulin sensitivity significantly improved only in subjects with OH (P < 0.05). Total insulin secretion was higher in OH before the initiation of therapy (P < 0.05).

In summary, SH and OH are characterized by attenuated basal plasma insulin levels.

### Sterile diluent [^111UJqV2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you use HUMALOG with NPH insulin, NPH insulin is the only type of insulin that can be mixed with HUMALOG. Do not mix HUMALOG with any other type of insulin. HUMALOG should be drawn up into the syringe first, before you draw up your NPH insulin. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are not sure about the right way to mix HUMALOG and NPH insulin. Give your injection right away.

- **Giving your HUMALOG injection with a syringe**: Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you should pinch the skin before injecting. HUMALOG starts acting fast, so give your injection within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly, or hard, or into scars or damaged skin.

- **Giving your HUMALOG using an insulin pump**: HUMALOG should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change your infusion set and rotate the infusion set insertion site according to the manufacturer's user manual. Change (rotate) your insertion sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the insertion sites.

### Position statement: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in very young children with type 1 diabetes [^113STVJn]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Insulin pump therapy has become increasingly popular for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in pediatric patients. Although significant experience has accrued with the use of this modality in older children and adolescents, much less data are available regarding continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in the very young. Policies of individual physician practices and insurance companies vary widely, and there is currently no consensus regarding the appropriateness of insulin pump therapy in the under 6 age group.

However, we have witnessed in recent years a significant increase in the number of clinical trials investigating the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in young patients. Reports of over 100 preschool-aged diabetic children treated with insulin pumps are available in the literature. Although these studies have been of relatively short duration (≤ 12 months), the results are remarkably consistent.

There is no evidence that insulin pump therapy results in a sustained improvement in glycemic control in this age group. Risks associated with these devices in the hands of reliable adults who are managing diabetes in very young children are low. Parental satisfaction related to the increased flexibility that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion affords anecdotally seems to be high, although formal examination of parental stress and health-related quality of life in this setting has been minimal.

Important questions remain regarding selection of appropriate candidates for insulin pump therapy and whether benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion justify its use.

### Personality traits, metabolic control and the use of insulin pump functions in adults with type 1 diabetes: An observational single-visit study [^111yEqsr]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

While a few studies have assessed the association between personality and metabolic outcomes in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), none have been conducted in adults or in subjects treated with insulin pumps. Additionally, hypoglycaemic episodes have not been considered in these studies. The aim of this observational single-visit study was to assess the association between personality traits and metabolic control, hypoglycaemic episodes, and insulin pump use in adult T1DM patients.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 52 adults with T1DM treated in a tertiary care centre (no complications or comorbidities; aged 27 ± 8 years; diabetes duration of 12.8 ± 6.8 years; treated with insulin pumps for 6.3 ± 0.4 years). "Big Five" personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) were assessed using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire. Data on HbA1c, blood glucose levels, frequency of glucose testing, number of hypoglycaemic episodes (< 3.9 mmol/L), basal and prandial insulin doses, and the number and types of boluses in the last 14 days were obtained from insulin pumps and glucometers.

- **Results**: The mean levels of the assessed parameters were: HbA1c 7.2 ± 1.2% (55.0 ± 13.1 mmol/mol), episodes of hypoglycaemia 7.0 (3.00–9.75), and glucose tests per day 7.3 ± 3.9. All personality traits showed average intensity. None of the traits were associated with HbA1c, glycaemia, number of glucose tests, or number or kind of insulin boluses. Conscientiousness was the only factor associated with the incidence of hypoglycaemia.

### Safety of nighttime 2-hour suspension of basal insulin in pump-treated type 1 diabetes even in the absence of low glucose [^114YFDAV]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The study involved subjects recruited from the Yale Type 1 Diabetes Program. Inclusion criteria were as follows: age between 15–50 years, a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes with a duration of at least one year, use of a Medtronic insulin pump or willingness to use it during the study, a history of pump use for at least three months, and an A1C level of ≤ 9% (75 mmol/mol). Additionally, the body mass index (BMI) had to be below the 95th percentile for age and sex, and participants had to have no other chronic medical conditions except treated hypothyroidism. Potential participants were also required not to be on medications other than insulin that could affect blood glucose levels, and they must not have experienced severe hypoglycemia episodes within three months before the study. Female subjects could not be pregnant or lactating.

- **Sensor-augmented therapy**: Subjects using sensor-augmented pump therapy were allowed to participate but were advised not to use their continuous glucose monitors to prevent care alterations due to real-time sensor readings.
- **Study partner requirement**: Both adult and pediatric subjects were required to have a responsible adult in the same household to serve as an alternate contact on basal suspension nights, and these individuals had to sign a study partner consent form.
- **Consent and approval**: An explanation of the study protocol was provided, and written informed consent was obtained from subjects who were 18 years or older. For those under 18, both adolescent assent and parental permission were required. The study was approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee.

### Insulin delivery technology for treatment of infants with neonatal diabetes mellitus: A systematic review [^112CNwEa]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). High credibility.

The literature search was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and provides a review of the literature about technologies for insulin delivery in the management of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). The search for eligible studies was performed from inception to 20 July 2024, in the PubMed database. The keywords used for the query strings were "neonatal diabetes mellitus" AND "insulin pump" and "neonatal diabetes mellitus" AND "closed loop". Only "insulin pump" is indexed in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus, while "neonatal diabetes mellitus" is indexed as a supplementary concept in association with other terms (permanent, hypothyroidism, and so on).

Non-English language papers were excluded. To be as comprehensive as possible, only guidelines and review papers were not included in the literature review section. Commentaries and editorials were taken into consideration only if they reported original data. Additional studies were searched from the reference lists of the selected papers. The literature search was carried out by two authors and identified 162 manuscripts with the first query string and 23 with the second. Once the criteria had been applied, most of them were excluded for not meeting the predefined criteria, and 25 papers were selected from the first search. Only one paper was added from the second search, and thus 26 papers were retrieved to assess for eligibility. Five articles were excluded either for not meeting the prespecified study treatment or due to [truncated].

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113nGTgj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Both the non-specific nature of complaints and inherent deficiencies in the diagnostic process raise an unsettling dilemma for patients and thyroid specialists alike. These issues are exemplified and particularly pertinent to an etiological disease entity whose consequences are paralleled in similar outcomes: primary hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Treatment requirements and dosing of the drug LT4 changed when guidelines relaxed the need for TSH-suppressive treatment targets for these patients.

The reason for this shift was not primarily motivated by any improvement in the replacement strategy but by a revision of the long-held tenet that TSH may act as a thyroid growth stimulating hormone. Even when present at a low level in the circulation, it was believed that TSH could potentially stimulate the growth of remaining tumor cells and thereby promote the relapse of thyroid cancer in the long term. This view has recently been revised, and TSH suppression is now deemed unnecessary for many thyroid cancer patients.

However, this remarkable strategy change has presented a unique opportunity to study the implications for patient complaints of such a far-reaching decision to abandon TSH-suppressive LT4 treatment in low-risk thyroid cancer. Although this could not be done in a prospective study, careful retrospective analysis revealed some interesting trends. Over the years when replacement therapy aimed at complete TSH suppression, a relatively low rate of persistent hypothyroid complaints was reported by patients.

### Outpatient-to-inpatient transition of insulin pump therapy: Successes and continuing challenges [^111xa89R]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin pump therapy is a complex technology prone to errors when employed in the hospital setting. When patients on insulin pump therapy require hospitalization, practitioners caring for them must decide whether to allow continued pump use. We provide the largest review regarding transitioning insulin pump therapy from the outpatient to inpatient setting.

Records of inpatient insulin pump users were retrospectively analyzed at a metropolitan Phoenix hospital between January 2006 and December 2009. Adherence to institutional procedures on insulin pump use was assessed, glycemic control was determined, and adverse events were examined.

- **Results**: We examined records on 65 patients with insulin pumps, totaling 125 hospitalizations. Mean (standard deviation) patient age was 55 (17) years, diabetes duration was 27 (14) years, pump duration was 6 (5) years, length of hospital stay was 4.7 (6.3) days, hemoglobin A1c was 7.3 (1.3)%, 85% had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 57% were women, and 97% were white. Admissions involving insulin pumps increased (23 in 2006, 17 in 2007, 40 in 2008, and 45 in 2009). Insulin pump therapy was continued in 83 (66%) hospitalizations. Among these hospitalizations, endocrinology consultations were obtained in 89%, consent agreements were found in 83%, insulin pump order sets were completed in 89%, admission glucose was checked in 100%, and nursing assessments of pump insertion sites were documented in 89%, but bedside insulin pump flow sheets were found in only 55%. Mean glucose of 175 (57) mg/dl was not significantly different.

### Use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) therapy in the hospital: A review of one institution's experience [^112JStBM]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the performance of our hospital's inpatient insulin pump policy.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five hospital admissions of 21 unique patients receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy were reviewed.

- **Results**: Between November 1, 2005, and November 30, 2006, there were 25 hospital admissions involving 21 patients receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy. The average age and duration of diabetes among these 21 patients was 50 and 29 years, respectively; 67% were women, 90% had type 1 diabetes, and all were white. The mean length of hospital stay was 4 days, and the average reported length of insulin pump therapy was 4 years. Patients in 16 of the admissions were identified as candidates for continued use of the insulin pump during the hospital stay. Over 90% of patients remaining on the insulin pump had documentation by nursing of the presence of the pump at the time of admission; 100% of the patients had an admission glucose recorded; 88% had a record of signed patient consent; 81% had evidence of completed preprinted insulin pump orders; 75% received a required endocrine consultation; and 75% of cases had documentation of completed bedside flow sheet. A high frequency of both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events occurred in the patients; however, no adverse events were related directly to the insulin pump.

- **Conclusions**: Insulin pump therapy can be safely continued in the hospital setting. While staff compliance with required procedures was high, there was still room for improvement. More data are needed, however, on whether this method of insulin delivery is ultimately beneficial for inpatient care.

Hypothyroidism is a disease characterized by thyroid hormone deficiency. Its prevalence ranges from 0.3% to 12% globally, depending on iodine intake, and it is more common in women and older adults. Untreated hypothyroidism can result in serious health complications such as heart failure and myxedema coma.

- **Observations**: Hashimoto thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease, is the cause of primary hypothyroidism in up to 85% of patients residing in areas with adequate nutritional iodine levels. The risk of developing hypothyroidism is associated with several factors: genetic predisposition (having a first-degree relative with hypothyroidism), environmental influences such as iodine deficiency, prior neck surgery or radiation therapy, pregnancy in the context of underlying autoimmune thyroid disease, and the use of certain medications like immune checkpoint inhibitors and amiodarone. Patients with hypothyroidism may exhibit nonspecific symptoms due to metabolic slowing, including fatigue (68%-83%), weight gain (24%-59%), cognitive issues (45%-48%) such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, and menstrual irregularities (approximately 23%) including oligomenorrhea and menorrhagia. Hypothyroidism can lead to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes, increase the risk for cardiovascular events like heart failure, and adversely affect female reproductive health by causing disrupted ovulation, infertility, and increased risk of miscarriage. Untreated hypothyroidism may progress to severe forms with decompensation, such as myxedema coma.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115rRbuc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, specifically concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine therapy in patients with pituitary disease and low/normal free T4 levels suspected to have mild central hypothyroidism (CeH) if suggestive symptoms are present. Alternatively, monitoring free T4 levels over time and initiating treatment is advised if the free T4 level decreases by ≥ 20%.

### Treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism with lanreotide acetate (Somatuline Autogel) [^113BoxwW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CH) may be treated conservatively in many children with octreotide given by multiple subcutaneous injections or via an insulin pump.

- **Objective**: We describe two children treated with a once-monthly injection of a long-acting somatostatin analog.

- **Patients and methods**: Both patients presented with hypoglycemia 30 minutes after birth and were subsequently diagnosed with CH. Initially, patients were treated with diazoxide, hydrochlorothiazide, frequent feedings, and octreotide via an insulin pump. With this therapy, they remained normoglycemic, with a good growth rate, normal weight gain, and excellent neurodevelopment. Treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analog lanreotide acetate (Somatuline Autogel), administered by deep subcutaneous injection of 30 mg once a month, began at the ages of 4½ and 4 years, respectively. Octreotide infusion was gradually weaned over one month. Continuous glucose monitoring after discontinuation of pump therapy showed normoglycemia. The first patient has now been treated with the lanreotide acetate for over 5 years, and the second for 3 years. Treatment is well-tolerated by the patients, and both the patients and their parents are satisfied with the transition from pump therapy to once-a-month injection, preferring it to pump therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Lanreotide acetate may be a safe and effective alternative to octreotide pump therapy in patients with CH, offering an improved quality of life. Longer follow-up of a larger patient group is needed.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^111s4mkq]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in children with type 1 diabetes requires careful screening. At diagnosis, children should be screened for thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. TSH concentrations are to be measured after metabolic control is established. If TSH concentrations are normal, they should be rechecked every 1–2 years, or sooner if the patient exhibits symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, thyromegaly, or an abnormal growth rate.

### New design of a percutaneous port system for continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion [^115fzSPY]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Low credibility.

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is treated with intensive insulin therapy, using either multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with insulin pumps. For individuals who cannot achieve acceptable glycemic control despite these intensive therapies and continuous glucose monitoring, continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery via an implantable pump or a percutaneous port system connected to an external insulin pump is an option. This article presents and discusses the second generation of the Accu-Chek® DiaPort system for continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery, highlighting its improvements over the previous generation.

### Hypothyroidism-etiologies, evaluation, and emergency care [^117KQdE5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone affects every human organ system and is a vital component of metabolism. While common and easily treatable, hypothyroidism does not usually require emergency management. However, myxedema coma is the decompensated form of hypothyroidism and can be life-threatening if not treated expediently.

### Continuous glucose monitoring-guided insulin dosing in pump-treated patients with type 1 diabetes: A clinical guide [^113YHjJM]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

This article describes our methods for structured continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-guided insulin dosing in pump-treated type 1 diabetes. Some of the methods have been previously reported, while others are based on clinical experience. It is expected that this guide will help those involved in the care of such patients, specifically those with CGM experience, to achieve better glucose control in their patients. More research needs to be conducted on insulin dosing, and we hope this article will encourage others to pursue this field. This guide is not intended to replace clinical judgment. The dosing approaches discussed apply only to patients on pump therapy and do not necessarily translate to patients treated with basal analog insulin.

### Alternative cause for hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated diabetes mellitus [^117X2tkL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 73-year-old woman who developed recurrent hypoglycaemia during a prolonged hospital stay following a mechanical fall. She had a complex history of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, diffuse systemic cutaneous sclerosis, Raynaud's disease, previous breast cancer, Barrett's oesophagus, and previous partial gastrectomy for a benign mass. Hypoglycaemia persisted despite weaning off insulin. She exhibited no clinical features of adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, had an acceptable cortisol level upon discontinuing prednisolone, and an optimal thyroid replacement.

A 72-hour fast elicited hypoglycaemia with a corresponding low insulin level. Although the C-peptide was detectable, there were no clinical, biochemical, or radiological features suggestive of insulinoma. Reactive hypoglycaemia post-partial gastrectomy was ruled out based on the limited relation of the hypoglycaemia to meals and the low insulin levels. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-induced hypoglycaemia was considered based on previous case reports and recent literature, with a successful resolution of hypoglycaemia upon discontinuation of HCQ.

### Liothyronine sodium [^116vQPLm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pediatric use**: The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]. In pediatric patients for whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended to discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels should be obtained at the end of the trial period. Laboratory test results and clinical assessments should be used to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Congenital hypothyroidism**: Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development and overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, it is important to initiate thyroid hormone therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Infants should be closely monitored during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Patients must be closely monitored to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth, while overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate bone age, potentially resulting in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

### Prime-time hypoglycemia: Factitious hypoglycemia during insulin-pump therapy [^115WY3bt]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Unexplained hypoglycemia in a pediatric diabetic patient can perplex even the savviest health care providers and lead to an extensive medical workup. We present here the cases of two children with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pumps who were hospitalized for episodes of hypoglycemia. A review of their insulin pumps revealed normal basal and bolus insulin delivery. However, subsequent review of the priming history in the pump revealed that both children were receiving additional insulin under the manual-prime function, which is not included in the daily totals and, therefore, was initially unnoticed. Ultimately, both children confessed to surreptitiously using this priming function to self-administer extra insulin. It is important that health care professionals who are caring for diabetic patients be aware of this possibility.

### The rising cost of insulin for pump users: How policy drives prices [^1126gz3b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

For Medicare Part B beneficiaries using insulin pumps, the 21st Century Cures Act effectively raised the cost of insulin by 251% overnight (between December 31, 2016, and January 1, 2017; see Figure 2) without any notification to patients and providers. As the reimbursement rate of DME-infused drugs remained steady at the 2003 average wholesale price (AWP), the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the number of Medicare suppliers submitting claims for pump-delivered insulin decreased annually from 2003 to 2016, creating an access issue for patients who needed to fill their prescriptions for pump-delivered insulin. Consequently, fewer patients were able to receive pump-delivered insulin at the 2003 AWP price, which indirectly affected them due to the sudden increase of 251% overnight in January 2017. Seventeen months later, manufacturers raised the price of insulin by another 53%, resulting in a total cost increase to patients of 304% in less than two years.

- **Economic impact of the 21st Century Cures Act on pump-delivered insulin**:
	- For one vial of insulin (1000 units).
	- Medicare payment based on 2003 AWP.
	- Medicare payment based on January 2017 average sales price (ASP).
	- Medicare payment based on October 2018 ASP.

The number of Medicare suppliers submitting claims for pump-delivered insulin decreased each year from 2003 (the AWP baseline) to 2016, reducing access. The lower 2003 cost for remaining Part B patients made them particularly sensitive to copayment cost increases in 2017–2018.

One might argue that most Medicare Part B beneficia…

### Apidra SoloStar [^1135Xekw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Continuous subcutaneous infusion (insulin pump)**: Refer to the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump user manual to see if Apidra can be used with the insulin pump. Use Apidra in accordance with the insulin pump system's instructions for use. Administer Apidra by continuous subcutaneous infusion in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. Rotate infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Train patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of insulin pump failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Change Apidra in the reservoir at least every 48 hours or according to the pump user manual, whichever is shorter. Change the infusion sets and the infusion set insertion site according to the manufacturer's user manual. Do not dilute or mix Apidra when administering by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Do not expose Apidra in the pump reservoir to temperatures greater than 98.6°F (37°C).

- **Intravenous administration**: Administer Apidra intravenously only under medical supervision with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to avoid hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5)]. Dilute Apidra to concentrations from 0.05 unit/mL to 1.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple etiologies are possible. A methodological and stepwise approach to the problem will uniformly identify a cause or at least a resolution.

### Remembrance of things past: The consequences of recurrent hypoglycaemia in diabetes [^115eNoEm]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In 1969, Dorothy Hodgkin solved the crystal structure for porcine insulin; work that led directly to the development of human and analogue insulins. In the 50 years since this discovery, there has been a remarkable evolution in diabetes care, with further refinements of injectable analogues to produce more consistent basal insulin levels, as well as faster-acting insulin analogues that more closely mimic prandial insulin release. Insulin pump therapy has also advanced and is rapidly progressing through combination with continuous glucose sensors and control algorithms, towards the introduction of the artificial pancreas into routine clinical practice.

Despite these advances, there remain a number of limitations to insulin therapy. Of these, the need to deliver insulin replacement peripherally, which results in both systemic hyperinsulinaemia and a failure of insulin to dissipate when glucose levels fall (i.e. insulin release from the subcutaneous depot is not glucose-dependent), is a major reason for the increased susceptibility of people with type 1 diabetes to hypoglycaemia. In people without diabetes, when glucose levels fall, pancreatic cell insulin production is decreased and α-cell glucagon secretion is increased, providing a stimulus to increase hepatic glucose production. If glucose levels fall further, the autonomic nervous system is activated. This results in the release of catecholamines both systemically and within peripheral tissues, as well as increased secretion of both anterior (e.g. cortisol) and posterior (e.g. vasopressin) pituitary hormones.

### Novolog [^117YTACX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Step 3**: Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. Pull down on the plunger until the black tip reaches the line for the number of units for your prescribed dose (see Figure C).

- **Step 4**: Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the Novolog vial (see Figure D).

- **Step 5**: Push the plunger all the way in. This puts air into the Novolog vial (see Figure E).

- **Step 6**: Turn the Novolog vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger down until the black tip is a few units past the line for your dose (see Figure F). If there are air bubbles, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise to the top (see Figure G).

- **Step 7**: Slowly push the plunger up until the black tip reaches the line for your Novolog dose (see Figure H).

- **Step 8**: Check the syringe to make sure you have the right dose of Novolog.

- **Step 9**: Pull the syringe out of the vial's rubber stopper (see Figure I).

- **Giving your injection**: Inject your Novolog exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Novolog can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs, or upper arms; infused in an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous infusion into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump); or given through a needle in your arm (intravenously) by your healthcare provider. If you inject Novolog, change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin).

### Hypothyroidism in context: Where we've been and where we're going [^113Titvo]. Advances in Therapy (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.

- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism is most frequently caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include the underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the US is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and its prevalence increases with age.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism, myxedema coma, presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia, and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and quality of life (QoL).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

### Diabetes technology-continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy and continuous glucose monitoring in adults: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114Rfx4k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to the choice of insulin, the 2016 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend prescribing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion over analog-based basal-bolus multiple daily injections. This recommendation applies to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who have not achieved their HbA1c goal or have achieved the goal but continue to experience severe hypoglycemia or high glucose variability. It is essential that the patient and their caregivers are willing and able to use the device.
