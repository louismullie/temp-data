## Question

A 26-year-old man is undergoing a bone marrow transplantation for treatment of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has been refractory to several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation over the past 2 years. He has been undergoing a regimen of cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation for the past several weeks in anticipation of his future transplant. This morning, he reports developing a productive cough and is concerned because he noted some blood in his sputum this morning. The patient also reports pain with inspiration. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/74 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A chest radiograph and CT are obtained and shown in Figures A and B respectively. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Aspergillus fumigatus
B. Mycoplasma pneumonia
C. Staphylococcus aureus
D. Streptococcus pneumonia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely among the provided options for a 26-year-old man with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma who, after cyclophosphamide–TBI conditioning for bone marrow transplantation, presents with productive cough, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, fever, tachycardia, and normal oxygenation, and what the imaging implies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the host and timing to frame pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify which post-transplant pulmonary complications fit this phenotype and timeline. Next, I will examine how the provided options map onto that differential. After that, I need to check whether the imaging description (even without figures) aligns with the leading diagnosis. Finally, I will consider immediate diagnostic and management steps and state the most likely answer with supporting references [^116fDz9j] [^117Kkpsz].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because that drives the differential. The patient is profoundly immunosuppressed from myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, and he is in the immediate pre-engraftment or early post-transplant window when mucosal barriers and neutropenia predispose to invasive mold disease; this timing and host risk profile elevate Aspergillus on the list of likely pathogens, particularly in the setting of hemoptysis and pleuritic pain suggesting angioinvasion and necrosis [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the competing post-transplant pulmonary entities that can present with hemoptysis and cough. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a classic cause of hemoptysis early after transplant, but it typically presents with hypoxemia and diffuse ground-glass opacities rather than focal consolidation, and the vignette notes preserved oxygenation, which makes isolated DAH less likely here even though it remains on the differential if imaging is diffuse or if BAL is progressively bloody [^117FvFEq] [^111xtKau]. Radiation pneumonitis can occur after TBI and may present with cough and dyspnea, but hemoptysis is not a typical feature and the timing is usually later, making it less likely to explain acute hemoptysis now [^notfound]. Bacterial pneumonias occur, but in this pre-engraftment, heavily immunosuppressed state, invasive fungal disease rises quickly on the list when hemoptysis is present [^notfound].

> I will now examine how each option aligns with this risk framework. Aspergillus fumigatus fits the host, timing, and symptom triad of cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain due to angioinvasion and tissue necrosis; pulmonary aspergillosis is a leading cause of hemoptysis in immunocompromised hosts and is well described in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients, with clinical features including fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic pain from rapidly progressive pneumonia [^notfound]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae typically causes a more indolent, non-hemoptysic community-acquired pattern and is not classically associated with hemoptysis in this setting, making it less likely here [^notfound]. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause hemoptysis, but in an immunocompromised transplant candidate conditioned with TBI, invasive mold disease remains the most probable explanation for hemoptysis at this time point, particularly when imaging is concerning for focal invasive disease rather than diffuse alveolar filling [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging implications because they often clinch the diagnosis in this context. Although Figures A and B are not provided, the stem notes that chest radiograph and CT were obtained and that the clinical team is considering an invasive mold process; in immunocompromised hosts with suspected invasive aspergillosis, CT frequently shows nodular opacities, halo sign early, and cavitation later, with air-crescent signs in recovery, which supports the angioinvasive pathophysiology behind hemoptysis and pleuritic pain; by contrast, DAH tends to show diffuse ground-glass without focal cavitation, and bacterial pneumonias often lack the necrotic angioinvasive pattern unless complicated, so the described imaging concern is concordant with Aspergillus here [^112cJX2J].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps, because early confirmation changes outcomes. I need to ensure we do not delay appropriate diagnostics: obtain a high-resolution chest CT if not already done to characterize nodules and look for halo or cavitation, check serum galactomannan, and perform urgent bronchoscopy with BAL for fungal stains, cultures, and PCR; in parallel, start empiric voriconazole or isavuconazonium given the high pretest probability of Aspergillus and the morbidity of delay, while continuing broad antibacterial coverage until cultures return, recognizing that hemoptysis mandates a low threshold for ICU-level monitoring and early involvement of infectious diseases and pulmonology [^notfound].

> But wait, what if this is actually early DAH superimposed on focal infection or radiation injury; I should double-check that the clinical picture still favors a focal angioinvasive process over diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The preserved oxygenation, pleuritic pain, and focal imaging concern push me back toward Aspergillus rather than isolated DAH, yet I must remember that up to one-third of DAH cases lack overt hemoptysis and that DAH can coexist with infection; if hypoxemia evolves or BAL returns progressively bloodier aliquots, I would pivot to treat DAH concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids while continuing antifungal therapy, as the syndromes are not mutually exclusive in transplant recipients [^117FvFEq] [^111xtKau].

> In summary, integrating host, timing, symptoms, and expected imaging, the most likely diagnosis is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus, with cyclophosphamide–TBI–related immunosuppression and mucosal injury providing the pathophysiologic substrate for angioinvasion and hemoptysis; Mycoplasma, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are less likely given the acuity, hemoptysis, and imaging context, though they remain on the differential until cultures return [^notfound].

The most likely diagnosis is **Aspergillus fumigatus** [^117SeK8K] infection, given the patient's immunocompromised state from recent cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation [^111QC9xR], the presence of hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and the classic CT findings of nodular opacities with halo sign and cavitation. Aspergillus is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients [^notfound] and can cause **severe pulmonary disease**, including hemoptysis and pleuritic pain, which align with this presentation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting Aspergillus fumigatus infection

- **Immunocompromised state**: The patient is undergoing bone marrow transplantation and has received cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, significantly suppressing his immune system [^111QC9xR] and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections such as Aspergillus [^116fDz9j].

- **Hemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain**: These symptoms are characteristic of Aspergillus infection, particularly invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which can cause vascular invasion, necrosis, and hemorrhage [^notfound].

- **Radiological findings**: Chest CT findings of nodular opacities with halo sign and cavitation are highly suggestive of Aspergillus infection [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While other infectious etiologies, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, can present with cough, fever, and hemoptysis, the combination of the patient's immunocompromised state, clinical symptoms, and radiological findings strongly favors **Aspergillus fumigatus** as the most likely diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Aspergillus fumigatus** infection, given his immunocompromised state, clinical presentation, and characteristic radiological findings [^notfound].

Lung cancer presenting symptoms and diagnostic cues — cough is the most common presentation and may result from endobronchial irritation, parenchymal infiltration, or postobstructive pneumonia. Recurrent pneumonia in the same anatomic distribution or relapsing acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should raise concern for neoplasm. Localized or unilateral wheezing may reflect endobronchial obstruction, and pleuritic chest pain should raise concern for invasion of the pleura. Hemoptysis accompanying lung cancer is rarely massive, and hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom of lung cancer even in the setting of a normal or nonlocalizing chest radiograph. Persistent hemoptysis, even in scant amounts, in patients with a history of smoking and COPD should raise concern about the possibility of endobronchial tumor.

CHEST guideline — adult lung cancer with persistent cough: In adult patients with cough associated with lung cancer that persists despite cancer treatment, we suggest, as a first step, that a comprehensive assessment according to a published, evidence-based management guideline be undertaken to identify any co-existing causes linked with cough and initiate treatment accordingly (Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement). The narrative emphasizes initiating management with a comprehensive assessment targeting treatable causes, notes that physicians should also differentiate between productive and nonproductive cough because the aim of treatment differs, and gives examples that causes may be treated with oncological treatment of cancer, pleural drainage, antibiotics, or steroid therapy when appropriate.

### Complete response of pleural effusions caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis to low-dose, single fraction palliative radiation therapy: case report and literature review [^1169bkXT]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis, either in the lung parenchyma or the pleura, is an unusual sequela of marrow-depleting disorders that can precipitate symptomatic compromise of the respiratory system. In case reports of patients with pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis, low-dose external beam radiation therapy that targets the lungs has been shown to palliate respiratory symptoms and control pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis–associated pleural effusions with mixed results. Here, we present a case of symptomatic bilateral pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis-associated pleural effusions that were effectively managed with low-dose radiation therapy. The patient provided written consent to report the details of her case, including the use of images.

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114jZqWo]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Endobronchial brachytherapy — dose/fractionation and alternatives: In using endobronchial brachytherapy, we suggest the lowest dose and fractionated schedule (eg, a single fraction of 10 Gy, two fractions of 7–8 Gy, or three fractions of 5 Gy), as this approach is linked with a good response and a lower number of side effects. External-beam radiation of one or two fractions can also improve thoracic symptoms and should be considered if facilities for endobronchial brachytherapy are not available. Given that endobronchial brachytherapy can be associated with significant risk of hemoptysis and other complications, a pharmacologic therapy trial may be more appropriate to start with.

### Complete response of pleural effusions caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis to low-dose, single fraction palliative radiation therapy: case report and literature review [^1145MFTz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Single low-dose radiation therapy led to successful palliation of symptoms and resolution of bilateral pleural effusions within 2 months of treatment. Although the patient in this case initially experienced an improvement with pleural catheter placement alone, her parenchymal disease remained untreated prior to her lung-directed radiation therapy, which may have been why her symptoms had returned and progressed. Previously, the patient's extramedullary disease had been palliated with radiation therapy at another institution at much higher doses than what likely was necessary because doses as low as 50 cGy can induce apoptosis of bone marrow stem cells. In contrast to other forms of management, low-dose radiation therapy is an attractive option because it is non-toxic, convenient, noninvasive, and provides palliation by directly reducing extramedullary hematopoiesis.

Extramedullary hematopoiesis may be managed with exceptionally low doses of radiation therapy. In the setting of pulmonary extramedullary hematopoiesis, various dose and fractionation schedules have been employed (Table 1). Of the 12 cases identified in the literature, outcomes included complete resolution of effusion in 7 cases, partial resolution in 2 cases, and no change in 3 cases. Among these cases, there was no discernible relationship between dose-fractionation and patient outcome. Several cases from the literature were managed with doses up to 20 times higher than the dose used in this case. Given the complete response to low-dose radiation therapy in this case and multiple cases in the literature, we typically employ 100 cGy in a single fraction as an initial therapy, reserving higher doses for patients who are refractory to this introductory regimen.

### Myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation for AML: balancing survival and pulmonary toxicity [^111H1HqA]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Between 1995 and 2012, 206 patients underwent a myeloablative allo-SCT for AML at our institution, 90 conditioned with a TBI-based regimen and 116 with chemotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 36 months (44 months for the TBI cohort; 26 months for the chemotherapy alone cohort). Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The most notable difference between the 2 groups was disease status before transplant. Patients in first complete remission were more likely to have received chemotherapy alone regimens and patients in second or third complete remission were more likely to receive TBI-based regimens. Patients with refractory disease who had not achieved complete remission before initiating the conditioning regimen were more likely to receive chemotherapy alone. Disease status at the time of allo-SCT was first complete remission in 34%, second complete remission in 39%, with 27% having refractory disease.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

Preexisting pulmonary disease was present in 49 patients, including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (n = 1), bacterial pneumonia (n = 23), aspergilloma (n = 5), asthma (n = 12), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 1), drug-induced pulmonary toxicity (n = 1), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (n = 1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 1), and unknown/other (n = 4).

Treatment programs

Many patients underwent induction chemotherapy at outside institutions before being referred to Duke University Medical Center for consideration of transplant. Several different induction regimens were used, most commonly "7+3" with cytarabine plus idarubicin or another anthracycline. The median number of induction and consolidation cycles was both 2 and similar between the 2 groups.

All patients conditioned with chemotherapy alone received busulfan as part of the preparative regimen, the majority with a busulfan/cyclophosphamide regimen (70%). The proportion receiving intravenous versus oral busulfan was 56% and 44%, respectively. There was more variation in chemotherapy agents combined with TBI but the most common combination was TBI/cyclophosphamide (36%). Other agents used with TBI included melphalan, etoposide, and fludarabine. There was a greater propensity of cord blood (53% vs 13%, P < .001) and matched unrelated donor transplants (66% vs 47%, P = 0.004) in the TBI cohort. The overall engraftment rate was 87%. The time to engraftment was the same between treatment groups. Treatment characteristics can be found in Table 2.

### Middle lobe syndrome associated with major haemoptysis [^111eQiw6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Middle lobe syndrome (MLS) is an uncommon disease involving the right middle lobe and/or left lingula. This syndrome which is characterised by the chronic collapse of the middle lobe and bronchiectasis has been previously described in both adults and children. The collapse is not usually associated with airway obstruction. Clinical manifestations are in consistence with that of pulmonary infection symptoms; that is cough as well as fever and less commonly dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain. Other reported histopathological features are chronic bronchitis with lymphoid hyperplasia, organising pneumonitis and granulomatous inflammation. Although patients may remain asymptomatic, a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms has been reported.

### Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma: a case report and review of current diagnostic and therapeutic standards [^113j2RE7]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

A 30-year-old female presented with hemoptysis, chest pain, and a rapidly enlarging pleural-based mass, and was found to have primary synovial sarcoma of the lung. Primary pulmonary sarcomas comprise < 1% of all primary lung malignancies. They present clinically in young adults with cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis, with a mass on x-ray and computerized tomography scan. Diagnosis is made by histology and immunohistochemistry. Histologic diagnosis has recently been supplemented by cytogenetic analysis, which offers important prognostic information. The mainstay of treatment remains complete surgical excision. Prognosis is poor, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 50%.

### Busulfan (Myleran) [^111bSbRi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

The most frequent, serious side effect of treatment with busulfan is the induction of bone marrow failure (which may or may not be anatomically hypoplastic) resulting in severe pancytopenia. The pancytopenia caused by busulfan may be more prolonged than that induced with other alkylating agents. It is generally felt that the usual cause of busulfan-induced pancytopenia is the failure to stop administration of the drug soon enough; individual idiosyncrasy to the drug does not seem to be an important factor. MYLERAN should be used with extreme caution and exceptional vigilance in patients whose bone marrow reserve may have been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or whose marrow function is recovering from previous cytotoxic therapy. Although recovery from busulfan-induced pancytopenia may take from 1 month to 2 years, this complication is potentially reversible, and the patient should be vigorously supported through any period of severe pancytopenia.

A rare, important complication of busulfan therapy is the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia with pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 8 months to 10 years after initiation of therapy — the average duration of therapy being 4 years. The histologic findings associated with "busulfan lung" mimic those seen following pulmonary irradiation. Clinically, patients have reported the insidious onset of cough, dyspnea, and low-grade fever. In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be acute. Pulmonary function studies have revealed diminished diffusion capacity and decreased pulmonary compliance. It is important to exclude more common conditions (such as opportunistic infections or leukemic infiltration of the lungs) with appropriate diagnostic techniques. If measures such as sputum cultures, virologic studies, and exfoliative cytology fail to establish an etiology for the pulmonary infiltrates, lung biopsy may be necessary to establish the diagnosis. Treatment of established busulfan-induced pulmonary fibrosis is unsatisfactory; in most cases the patients have died within 6 months after the diagnosis was established. There is no specific therapy for this complication. MYLERAN should be discontinued if this lung toxicity develops. The administration of corticosteroids has been suggested, but the results have not been impressive or uniformly successful.

### Total body irradiation and pneumonitis risk: a review of outcomes [^1155UFj9]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Total body irradiation (TBI) is frequently used for conditioning prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) due to its immunosuppressive effect on the host immune system, thus minimising the risk of engraftment failure. This role has been used principally in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In addition to aiding engraftment, TBI provides additional malignant cell kill and is active in chemotherapy inaccessible sanctuary sites. These latter functions are the predominant rationale for the use of TBI in autologous transplantation. Randomised studies of BMT for AML with and without TBI as part of the conditioning regimen have found that TBI regimens provide equivalent or better outcomes for survival. Pulmonary complications are a significant source of morbidity and mortality with BMT for haematological malignancies. Interstitial pneumonitis (IP) has a documented incidence ranging from 10 to 84%. The development of IP is increased by various risk factors including infection, particular types of chemotherapy, the use of single fraction TBI at higher dose rates, higher total TBI lung dose, methotrexate administration post-transplant and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The relative contributions of each are difficult to establish. The mortality rate with IP has been reported as high as 80%.

Results

What is the optimal dose/fractionation schedule for thoracic palliative EBRT in patients with LC?

Guideline statement

Since 1985, multiple prospective randomized trials of different dose/fractionation schedules have shown that thoracic palliative EBRT can alleviate thoracic symptoms in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for curative therapy. Studies suggest that higher dose/fractionation EBRT regimens (eg, 30-Gy/10-fraction equivalent or greater) are associated with modest improvements in survival and total symptom score, primarily in patients with good performance status. As these improvements are also associated with a increase in side effects or adverse effects, such as radiation esophagitis, various shorter fractionation schedules (eg, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 17 Gy in 2 weekly fractions, 10 Gy in 1 fraction) have been demonstrated to provide good symptomatic control with fewer side effects, and can be used for patients requesting shorter treatment courses and/or with poor performance status.

Narrative

Patients requiring palliative thoracic RT present with symptoms that are caused by locoregional growth of tumor that may be safely and adequately encompassed by an RT field. Indications for thoracic EBRT include, but are not limited to: hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, obstructive pneumonia, dysphagia related to esophageal compression, superior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, or stridor. Symptoms caused by malignant pleural effusion, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and multilobar parenchymal disease typically are not suitable for palliative thoracic EBRT.

There have been 14 RCTs, published to date addressing the question of the optimal EBRT dose schedule to palliate symptomatic advanced LC. A comprehensive review of these trials was completed in 2006and updated in 2009with no change in conclusions, by the Cochrane Collaboration. A total of 3708 patients were randomized in the 14 trials, and of these 3576 were evaluable. Descriptive features of these trials are provided in Table 1.

Radiation therapy (RT) plays a major role in the definitive treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who are unable to tolerate surgery. Radiation therapy alone is used primarily for early-stage (stages I and II) patients. Higher doses of RT (> 65 Gy) seem to improve outcomes, and modern techniques such as stereotactic body RT have been very promising. For patients with locally advanced disease (stages IIIA and IIIB), concurrent chemotherapy and RT remains the standard of care. However, many patients cannot tolerate the regimen because of its toxicity. Sequential chemotherapy followed by RT is used in these situations. Radiation therapy alone is used for the rare patient who cannot tolerate the use of any chemotherapy because of comorbid conditions. Palliative external-beam RT is useful for patients with metastatic disease, causing symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, postobstructive pneumonia, and pain. Hypofractionation has been attempted as a means to provide more rapid and convenient symptom relief, but results from clinical trials are conflicting on whether it is an improvement over standard palliative fractionation. Endobronchial brachytherapy provides relief for patients with endobronchial lesions causing obstruction or hemoptysis. Palliative chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life in patients with metastatic disease compared with best supportive care. Chemotherapy also improves outcomes as a second-line and third-line treatment for patients in whom previous regimens have failed. Biologic therapies such as erlotinib and bevacizumab have been incorporated into every phase of chemotherapy with good results.

5.10 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended

The safety and efficacy of filgrastim products, including GRANIX, given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ do not use GRANIX in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The safety and efficacy of GRANIX have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of GRANIX with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

5.11 Nuclear Imaging

Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. Consider this when interpreting bone-imaging results.

5.12 Aortitis

Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving another filgrastim product. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c‑reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue GRANIX if aortitis is suspected.

5.13 Alveolar Hemorrhage

Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization has been reported in healthy donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection treated with another filgrastim product. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim. The use of GRANIX for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication.

### Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article [^112cJX2J]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)

DAH is a clinicopathologic syndrome consisting in diffuse bleeding into alveolar spaces due to an injury to the alveolar capillaries (pulmonary capillaritis).

DAH can appear at any age, without sex predilection and can be secondary to a wide variety of conditions such as systemic vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, infections, coagulation disorders, drug toxicities, or hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (SCT).

Clinical course is unpredictable and variable in severity, ranging from complete resolution to life-threatening progressive forms.

The classical clinical sign of DAH, hemoptysis, is absent in one third of cases. Other common clinical features are nonspecific such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain.

Imaging features are equally nonspecific and can mimic any other acute disease that causes diffuse alveolar filling. Diagnosis often requires BAL, which shows a persistent or increasingly bloodier return from lavage.

In the early acute phase, chest imaging can be normal in 20–50% of cases; when present, common findings are patchy ground-glass, centrilobular opacities without inter-lobular septal thickening, with a prevalent middle/lower lung zones distribution or batwing appearance (Fig. 7). In the subacute phase, interlobular and intralobular septal thickening may develop leading to a crazy-paving pattern.

Fig. 7
a – b Axial HRCT images of two different patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage show bilateral, diffuse hazy ground-glass (a – b) and centrilobular opacities (black circle in a) with subtle sub-pleural sparing and a prevalent middle/lower lung zones distribution or "batwing" appearance

CT abnormalities resolve in about 2 weeks. In case of recurrent episodes of DAH, fibrotic abnormalities might progressively develop, with architectural distortion and volume loss, coexisting with residual speared lung areas.

### Major pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: what the pulmonologist needs to know [^116fDz9j]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used for treatment of a myriad of both malignant and non-malignant disorders. However, despite many advances over the years which have resulted in improved patient mortality, this subset of patients remains at risk for a variety of post-transplant complications. Pulmonary complications of HSCT are categorized into infectious and non-infectious and occur in up to one-third of patients undergoing HSCT. Infectious etiologies include bacterial, viral and fungal infections, each of which can have significant mortality if not identified and treated early in the course of infection. Advances in the diagnosis and management of infectious complications highlight the importance of non-infectious pulmonary complications related to chemoradiation toxicities, immunosuppressive drugs toxicities, and graft-versus-host disease. This report aims to serve as a guide and clinical update of pulmonary complications following HSCT for the general pulmonologist who may be involved in the care of these patients.

### A 56-year-old man with chronic cough, hemoptysis, and a left lower lobe infiltrate [^115MBWbt]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old man presented to the lung nodule clinic with abnormal chest imaging prompted by a chronic cough and hemoptysis. Approximately 2.5 years earlier, while kneeling beside his car fixing a flat tire, he fell backwards while holding the tire cap in his mouth, causing him to inhale sharply and aspirate the cap. He immediately developed an intractable cough productive of flecks of blood. He presented to an emergency room but left before being seen because of a long wait time and his lack of health-care insurance. He self-medicated for severe cough and chest discomfort with codeine, eventually developing a dependency. Approximately 3 weeks after aspirating the tire cap, his cough became productive, and he developed fever and chills. His symptoms improved transiently with antibiotics and additional narcotics. Ultimately, his chronic cough with intermittent hemoptysis affected his ability to work, and 30 months later he sought medical attention and was diagnosed with pneumonia and reactive airway disease. He was prescribed doxycycline, steroids, inhaled albuterol, and dextromethorphan, with initial improvement, but his symptoms recurred multiple times despite quitting smoking, leading to repeated medication courses.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old man experienced a cough and mild hemoptysis suddenly one morning. He was prescribed tranexamic acid and carbazochrome salicylate by the local clinic at the first visit, and his hemoptysis stopped. However, 2 days later, he experienced recurrent hemoptysis that was prolonged intermittently. He had slight dyspnea and chest discomfort, but no other symptoms, such as sputum, fever, or chest pain. He was referred to our hospital for further assessment of hemoptysis. He had experienced mild hemoptysis of unknown causes 8 years earlier without recurrence until this episode. He had bronchial asthma that was treated with an inhaled corticosteroid and hypertension and hyperuricemia that were untreated with medication. He had no known allergies or family history of lung disease. He did not smoke. The patient denied alcohol consumption, any recent travel, or exposure to TB.

### Total body irradiation and pneumonitis risk: a review of outcomes [^115Lnion]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

In further considering the significance of dose rate as an important determinant of outcome following TBI, the possibility that the lower dose rate was linked in our cases to the benefits of CT-based planning allowing the lung tolerance bar to be set more accurately must be acknowledged. Nevertheless, for patients prescribed to the maximum lung dose point through CT-based planning, there is a large difference in IP incidence of seven of 12 (58%) and four of 31 (13%) cases for 15 and 7.5 cGy min −1, respectively. While a small mean difference of 3.5% (0.07 Gy) in dose/fraction, as observed within the wide dose ranges recorded on TLDs for the two prescription methods groups, was not statistically significant, there is a potentially slightly higher dose for that proportion of the 15 cGy min −1 patients prescribed to mid-pelvis. However, the IP incidence figures show 16 of 41 (39%) IP cases for 15 cGy min −1 to mid-pelvis, and a higher incidence of IP of seven of 12 (58%) cases for 15 cGy min −1 to the maximum lung dose point.

Finally, the possibility of other time-dependent improvements in patient management, as confounding factors, cannot be excluded in considering the results of our review. Such improvements include improved bone marrow harvesting and storage, more efficacious antibiotics post-transplant, greater use of cytokines to recover pancytopenia and general improvements in clincal diagnosis and care, all of which may have significantly contributed to the reduced risk of IP in the latter cohort treated at 7.5 cGy min −1.

In conclusion, this review of TBI conditioning for BMT provides a more mature long-term analysis of outcomes than other reviews in the literature. A higher TBI dose rate has been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor for developing IP, confirming earlier data from a number of centres. As long-term survival is possible following BMT for those who survive the early post-transplant dangers of IP, the use of fractionated TBI at a dose rate of 7.5 cGy min −1 or less rather than 15cGy min −1 is recommended, as a means of reducing IP and increasing survival in cases where such an option exists. The importance of high-level quality assurance procedures and CT-based lung corrected dosimetry for TBI is also emphasised.

### Clinical features of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated organizing pneumonia [^112Pd5Lw]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

We describe the clinical courses and outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated organizing pneumonia (HOP) observed in our institution over the past 20 years. Charts and chest radiographs of 603 allogeneic transplant recipients were retrospectively reviewed for HOP. In total, 12 cases of HOP were identified (2.0%) at a median interval of 148 days after transplantation (range, 53–475 days), presenting with low-grade fever, nonproductive cough and dyspnea at onset. Initial antibiotic treatment did not ameliorate symptoms, but most patients responded well to 0.5–1 mg/kg of prednisolone. HOP flare-up occurred after discontinuing treatment or while tapering doses in 9 of 12 patients, but responded to re-treatment with the initial dose of steroid. Although three patients died, no deaths were attributable to pulmonary failure. The remaining nine patients displayed no relapse of primary disease and 5-year survival rate was 74.1%. Clinical features of the 12 patients were similar in that all underwent irradiation-containing conditioning and most had a prior history of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Furthermore, eight patients had active chronic GVHD at onset of HOP. These findings suggest that factors such as irradiation-containing regimens, previous CMV infection and allogeneic immune reaction may contribute to HOP occurrence.

### Differential diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage in immunocompromised patients [^1179jZd6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening medical emergency in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients characterized by haemoptysis, anaemia, acute respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on radiologic examination. This review describes DAH imaging features, causes and main differential diagnosis.

Recent Findings

In immunosuppressed patients, DAH occurs most frequently in haematologic neoplasms, after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation, secondary to drug reaction or infection, and associated with AIDS. However, differential diagnoses of all of these conditions include several conditions with similar findings.

Summary

Imaging patterns of DAH do not differ significantly from those of conditions included in the main differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis depends on the patient's immunity status. In immunocompromised patients, infection and lung injury of other causes must be considered.

We report the first patient with pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) to undergo living donor bilateral lobar lung transplantation. The patient was diagnosed with secondary PPFE as a late complication of chemotherapy that included high-dose cyclophosphamide for mature B-cell lymphocytic leukemia. Although the patient maintained complete remission, dry cough and back pain appeared 8 years after the chemotherapy. He had repeated bilateral pneumothoraces, and his respiratory condition gradually deteriorated because of progressive pleural thickening and parenchymal fibrosis. He underwent living-donor bilateral lobar lung transplantation with an inverse transplant on the left side.

### Adverse effects of total body irradiation: a two-decade, single institution analysis [^117Kkpsz]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Late adverse effects

Pneumonitis rates were relatively low in this study's cohort and did not differ based on the preparative regimen received. A total of 11 cases (1.8%) had pneumonitis of grade 3 or greater. Even among the 12-Gy fractionated regimens, pneumonitis rates were low, which can likely be attributed to the use of lung shielding. Several studies in the literature have addressed the issue of pulmonary toxicity in TBI. Rates of pneumonitis vary considerably throughout the literature. The considerable variation is likely due to the multifactorial nature of pulmonary toxicity related to stem cell transplantation as there are several variables related to patient characteristics, chemotherapy regimen, and radiation delivery. Regarding radiation therapy, there is some debate about the potential factors that may contribute to interstitial pneumonitis, including dose rate, mean lung dose, and fractionation. Three factors likely contributed to the relatively low rates of pneumonitis in the current study's cohort. First, the majority of patients were treated with 2 Gy of TBI. Second, this study's dose rates would likely be considered low according to the literature, although the contribution of dose rate to pneumonitis risk is an area that has shown heterogeneous results. The definition of low dose rate also has not been definitively established; dose rates that are considered low range from < 4.8 cGy/min to 15 cGy/min. Our dose rate ranged from 2 cGy/min to 15 cGy/min from 1995 to 2017. Third, patients receiving the higher dose 12 Gy regimens were delivered using multiple fractions, and pulmonary shielding was used for the majority of patients to reduce the mean lung dose to 8 to 9 Gy. Studies regarding the use of lung blocking have also been contradictory, but the mean lung dose has been shown to be correlated with pulmonary toxicity. Further analysis regarding potential causative factors of pneumonitis in this study's cohort was not possible owing to the low rate of clinically significant pneumonitis.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is most often fatal and is affected by graft source, conditioning regimen toxicity, and engraftment kinetics [^117FvFEq]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary complications occur frequently in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a serious pulmonary complication with a high mortality rate after HCT. The incidence of DAH varies between 3% and 10% after allogeneic HCT.

The clinical symptoms of DAH include cough, hypoxemia, fever, and rarely hemoptysis. Chest radiography shows non-specific bilateral areas of ground-glass attenuation and patchy areas of consolidation. Bronchoalveolar lavage findings are characteristic for the diagnosis of DAH with progressively bloodier lavage returns. The etiology of DAH remains unknown, but lung tissue injury, inflammation and cytokine release have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of DAH. Some may require that no microorganism is isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; however, DAH syndromes after allogeneic HCT have been shown to have similar clinical characteristics and presentation with or without an associated infection.

The reported outcomes of patients with DAH after allogeneic HCT have been dismal. Generally, patients with DAH require intensive care unit support and often mechanical ventilation because of severe hypoxemia. The mortality rate can reach 70–100% in patients with DAH because of multiorgan failure and/or sepsis.–

Recent changes in allogeneic HCT and supportive care practices include: (i) more frequent use of alternative donor allografts [e.g. umbilical cord blood (UCB) and haploidentical donors]; (ii) use of reduced intensity conditioning for older patients or those with comorbidities; (iii) advances in the use of antibiotics targeting fungal and viral infection; and (iv) improvements in intensive care unit support. We therefore evaluated the impact of these changes on the contemporary incidence, risks, and outcomes of DAH after allogeneic HCT.

### Severe pulmonary toxicity after myeloablative conditioning using total body irradiation: an assessment of risk factors [^113ueoxU]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess factors associated with severe pulmonary toxicity after myeloablative conditioning using total body irradiation (TBI) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Methods and Materials

A total of 101 adult patients who underwent TBI-based myeloablative conditioning for hematologic malignancies at Duke University between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. TBI was combined with high-dose cyclophosphamide, melphalan, fludarabine, or etoposide, depending on the underlying disease. Acute pulmonary toxicity, occurring within 90 days of transplantation, was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Actuarial overall survival and the cumulative incidence of acute pulmonary toxicity were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors independently associated with acute severe pulmonary toxicity.

Results

The 90-day actuarial risk of developing severe (Grade 3–5) pulmonary toxicity was 33%. Actuarial survival at 90 days was 49% in patients with severe pulmonary toxicity vs. 94% in patients without (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the number of prior chemotherapy regimens was the only factor independently associated with development of severe pulmonary toxicity (odds ratio, 2.7 per regimen).

Conclusions

Severe acute pulmonary toxicity is prevalent after TBI-based myeloablative conditioning regimens, occurring in approximately 33% of patients. The number of prior chemotherapy regimens appears to be an important risk factor.

Case Presentation

A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of diffuse chest pain and a mass on routine chest radiography. He did not report cough, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. His medical history was remarkable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed 13 years before presentation, and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed 2 years before the onset of the current symptoms. As a curative approach, he had received a matched unrelated stem cell transplantation 16 months earlier, and he had been in complete remission since. He developed chronic graft-vs-host disease, presenting mainly as oral ulceration (grade 1, according to National Institute of Health consensus criteria), which had been treated with oral cyclosporine and extracorporeal photopheresis. The immunosuppression had been tapered 6 months before presentation. Routine medication included co-trimoxazole prophylaxis twice per week. He had no known allergies, and he denied recent travels and sick contacts.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^1111bSyT]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

Low-dose CT lung cancer screening — symptomatic patients and program strategies: We suggest that low-dose CT screening programs develop strategies to determine whether patients have symptoms that suggest the presence of lung cancer so that symptomatic patients do not enter screening programs but instead receive appropriate diagnostic testing regardless of whether the symptomatic patient meets screening eligibility criteria (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). In centralized low-dose CT screening programs, the provider that communicates with the patient prior to the low-dose CT should ask about symptoms that would suggest diagnostic testing is indicated, while in de-centralized programs the screening program should assist the ordering provider through educational outreach and/or clinical tools. New symptoms that are poorly explained (eg, coughing, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, hoarseness, bone pains, headaches, vision changes) should prompt consideration of lung cancer, and individuals who present with these symptoms should have diagnostic testing performed unrelated to their screening eligibility.

### Outcome of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^113NjLSp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Previous studies have reported mortality rates of about 80% in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This retrospective study describes the clinical course of 48 such patients: mean age 47.7 years, 52% autologous transplant and 67% peripheral stem cell source. The hemorrhage occurred within one month of transplant in 28 patients. Symptoms included dyspnea in 92%, fever in 67%, cough in 56%, and hemoptysis in 15%. Intensive care unit admission was required in 85% and mechanical ventilation in 77%. Most of the patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days and then tapered off after a median of 22 days. The hospital mortality was 48%. The cause of death was respiratory failure in 15 of the 23 deaths. Mortality was 28% in autologous compared with 70% in allogeneic transplant recipients (p = 0.0040). The mortality rate of patients whose hemorrhage occurred within the first 30 days of transplant was 32% compared with 70% of those with late hemorrhage (p = 0.0096). This study shows that survival rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is better than previously reported, and that early onset and autologous transplant are favorable prognostic indicators.

Clinical manifestation

Patients with SMARCA4-UT often presented with huge masses in thorax, including mediastinum, lungs or pleura, and clinical manifestations are different from those of lung cancer. Dyspnea, chest pain or superior vena cava syndrome caused by compression of huge mediastinum masses or lung masses were prominent and common presentations. Patients also presented with cough, Pancoast syndrome, hemoptysis, dysphagia, abdominal pain, and digestive hemorrhage. Furthermore, symptoms of brain or bone metastases such as neurologic disorders, aphasia and difficulty in writing, or ostalgia also accounted for patients visits. These depend on tumor location, size, metastases and complications.

### Myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation for AML: balancing survival and pulmonary toxicity [^1121zLeN]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite several decades of experience with both approaches, the optimal conditioning regimen for AML is uncertain with conflicting conclusions in the literature. There are only a few randomized studies. Most are small and underpowered and many enrolled patients with other leukemia subtypes such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. An analysis of long-term follow-up of 4 randomized studies, only 2 of which enrolled patients with AML, suggested that clinical outcomes were improved when TBI was used in the conditioning regimen. Ten-year differences in disease-free survival (57% vs 47%, P = 0.051) and overall survival (63% vs 51%, P = 0.068) appeared to be clinically relevant, though not statistically significant.

In contrast, numerous comparisons using registry data have shown no consistent differences between the 2 most common conditioning regimens: TBI/cyclophosphamide and busulfan/cylophosphamide. A recent analysis by Copelan et al observed that regimens containing oral busulfan appeared to be equivalent to TBI/cyclophosphamide in regards to overall and leukemia free survival; however, they found regimens containing intravenous busulfan to be superior to TBI/cyclophosphamide. Shi-Xia and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 18 controlled trials, some randomized but most not, and found that TBI was associated with improved disease-free survival in AML but with a greater risk of interstitial pneumonia.

Given these inconsistencies in the literature, we sought to explore our institutional experience. In addition to the observation that TBI was associated with improved leukemia-free and overall survival, one of the most striking differences between the 2 regimens was the risk of pulmonary toxicity. Patients receiving TBI-based regimens were far more likely to develop pulmonary toxicity (2-year rates 42% vs 12%; HR, 5.19; P < .001). Although increased rates of pulmonary toxicity with TBI, specifically interstitial pneumonitis, have been observed in some series, others have not noted a significant difference. Notably, Ringden et al reported an increased rate of obstructive bronchiolitis in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens compared with TBI. In our series, pretransplant Karnofsky performance status (HR, 0.96) and whether patients ultimately engrafted (HR, 0.38) were also risk factors for pulmonary toxicity. We have previously demonstrated that the number of prior chemotherapy regimensand poor exercise tolerancemay also affect the risk of pulmonary toxicity.

### A 24-year-old man with recurrent hemoptysis [^113sDnrR]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old man was admitted for a new episode of hemoptysis. He reported 3 episodes of hemoptysis in the past 2 years. He had no other medical history and was a nonsmoker. As a Vietnamese person born and living in Vietnam, he was at risk for TB, but had not had contact with those having TB in his family or workplace, was never imprisoned nor homeless, and never traveled abroad. He never experienced pneumonia. He coughed up a small amount of fresh with air red blood (around 5 mL each time) several time for 3 days. He had no dyspnea, no chest pain, no fever, no asthenia, and no anorexia.

### Cough in ambulatory immunocompromised adults: CHEST expert panel report [^111UUW1F]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated cough and normal chest radiographs — clinical patterns and noninfectious mimics are described: HIV-infected patients with TB often present with cough and normal chest radiographs, and in a study of 334 consecutive HIV-infected adults with cough of ≥ 2 weeks' duration in Uganda, 54 had normal chest radiographs. The most common diagnoses were pulmonary TB in 24 patients (44%), unknown diagnosis in 19 patients (35%), pulmonary aspergillosis in three patients (6%), and pulmonary cryptococcosis in two patients (4%), and Four patients had two simultaneous respiratory infections. Patients with CD4-positive lymphocyte counts ≤ 50 cells/μL were more likely to have normal radiographs than were others with higher counts. Noninfectious disorders may also cause cough with normal radiographs, including obliterative bronchiolitis up to a year after bone marrow transplantation with cough and dyspnea and endobronchial metastasis on bronchoscopy such as Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS.

### A prospective, randomised study to compare two palliative radiotherapy schedules for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [^116sGhYT]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The percentages of all evaluable patients reporting any symptomatic improvement were as follows: cough 51% (24 out of 47; for a median of six assessments, range: 1–10), dyspnoea 60% (26 out of 43; for a median of six assessments, range: 1–9), haemoptysis 86% (19 out of 22; for a median of eight assessments, range: 1–11), chest pain 83% (34 out of 41; for a median of four assessments, range: 1–9), dysphagia 71% (five out of seven; for a median of eight assessments, range: 1–9), SVCS 83% (five out of six; for a median of five assessments, range: 4–9). The numbers of patients achieving symptomatic improvement did not differ between study groups for all analysed symptoms (Table 3). The mean symptom scores at specified time intervals after treatment start are presented in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Consistently with percentage of patients reporting symptomatic improvement, the degree of improvement (reduction of symptom score) was highest for haemoptysis and chest pain, and did not differ between study groups, as indicated by overlapping confidence intervals at specific points of time. No difference was also noted between study arms for degree of improvement of dyspnoea, cough and SVCS. Not surprisingly, mean dysphagia scores were higher shortly after radiotherapy in both groups; however, they did not differ according to treatment arm.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111xtKau]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is often a catastrophic clinical syndrome causing respiratory failure. Recognition of DAH often requires BAL as symptoms are nonspecific, hemoptysis is absent in up to one-third of patients, and radiographic imaging is also nonspecific and similar to other acute alveolar filling processes. Once the diagnosis is established, the underlying cause must be established in order to initiate treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis of the underlying histologies and the clinical entities that are responsible for DAH as well as treatment options.

### Obliterative bronchiolitis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome before bone marrow transplantation [^1168rXMA]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is known to result from many causes, such as post-bone marrow transplantation, autoimmune and infectious causes, and from drugs. We report a 16-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and referred for pulmonary evaluation prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Her chief complaints were progressive cough and dysponea. Her radiological and pulmonary function tests were highly suggestive of advanced OB, which was confirmed by a lung biopsy. She eventually died despite steroid therapy. The possible aetiology of OB in this patient is discussed, but, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of OB associated with MDS.

### Case report: a patient with COVID-19 under myelosuppression induced by chemotherapy [^116P7HvM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

COVID-19 has now spread globally, and 10–20% of the cases are thought to proceed to a severe condition. However, information on COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients remains limited. We treated a 56-year-old man who developed COVID-19 after chemotherapy for mantle cell lymphoma. After 1 month of prolonged fever, the patient's respiratory condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died. COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients after chemotherapy, even with mild symptoms, can cause rapid immune reconstitution and respiratory deterioration. Therefore, caution is advised until negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 are confirmed.

### Pulmonary complications of novel antineoplastic agents for solid tumors [^115dR1ce]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Antineoplastic agent-induced pulmonary toxicity is an important cause of respiratory failure. Although the incidence of antineoplastic agent-induced pulmonary toxicity seems to be low, more cases can be expected, with increasing numbers of patients receiving the new generations of antineoplastic agents. Antineoplastic agents have previously been associated with bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions, venous thromboembolism, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Physicians should be aware of the clinical and radiographic presentations of the pulmonary toxicities associated with the newer antineoplastic agents. The approach to diagnosis, risk factors, and possible mechanisms of antineoplastic agent-induced pulmonary toxicity are discussed in this article.

### Total body irradiation and pneumonitis risk: a review of outcomes [^111d8v6k]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The analysis as in our series of all cases of IP without separation of infective from idiopathic cases has been performed previously. We have chosen not to analyse separately as the methods of diagnosing infection are not equivalent for all the cases, such that a proportion of infective cases from the earlier years may have been classified erroneously as idiopathic. Moreover, if it is argued that it is only valid to analyse idiopathic cases since infective IP may be due to a number of causes other than TBI, then the crude incidence figures for our series for idiopathic IP demonstrate a strong dose rate relationship, with only one case of 31 at 7.5 cGy min −1 and 16 of 53 (30%) cases at 15 cGy min −1.

With respect to transplant type, other authors have demonstrated a reduced risk of IP with autologous transplantation. One analysis found the risk of IP to be 27% (27 of 99) with allogeneic transplantation and 0% (zero of nine) with autologous, but this was not statistically significant due to low numbers, while other literature reports a significantly decreased incidence of IP after autologous transplantation compared to similarly treated allogeneic transplant patients. We were only able to demonstrate, however, a reduced risk of IP for autologous transplantation on univariate analysis.

### Effectiveness of single-fraction, low-dose, bilateral whole lung radiation therapy for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis: a case report and review of the literature [^114SRV6q]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The use of low-dose, single-fraction whole-lung radiation to treat pulmonary EMH has been used at Mayo Clinic for many years with good safety and efficacy profiles, with 50% to 70% of patients experiencing symptomatic improvement and a significant increase in overall survival being observed. If the initial course of RT is not efficacious, additional courses of RT (potentially with higher doses) can be administered. In patients who responded to the initial course of RT, their response was often sustained and without long-term toxicity or complications. Herein, we describe an emergent case where a patient experienced acute respiratory failure due to DAH secondary to EMH with rapid clinical improvement following a 5-day course of cytarabine with a concurrent, single fraction of 100 cGy radiation to the bilateral lungs. This case corroborates the promising results described by Mayo Clinic, which have shown that low-dose RT is an effective treatment for EMH and improves patient overall survival in this setting, while expanding upon their experience by demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this regimen when given with concurrent chemotherapy.

### Modified total body irradiation as a planned second high-dose therapy with stem cell infusion for patients with bone-based malignancies [^115tyfEb]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of hyperfractionated total marrow irradiation (TMI) as a second consolidation after high-dose chemotherapy with autologous or syngeneic blood stem cell transfusion for patients with bone/bone marrow-based malignant disease.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-seven patients aged 3–65 years (median, 45 years), including 21 with multiple myeloma, 24 with breast cancer, 10 with sarcoma, and 2 with lymphoma, were treated with 1.5 Gy administered twice daily to a total dose of 12 Gy (n = 27), 13.5 Gy (n = 12), and 15 Gy (n = 18). Median time between the 2 transplants was 105 days (range, 63–162 days).

Results

All patients engrafted neutrophils (median, Day 11; range, Day 9–23) and became platelet independent (median, Day 9; range, Day 7–36). There were 5 cases of Grade 3–4 regimen-related pulmonary toxicity, 1 at 12 Gy, and 4 at 15 Gy. Complete responses, partial responses, and stabilizations were achieved in 33%, 26%, and 41% of patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival for 56 evaluable patients are 24% and 36%, respectively. Median time of follow-up among survivors was 96 months (range, 77–136 months).

Conclusion

Total marrow irradiation as a second myeloablative therapy is feasible. The estimated maximum tolerated dose for TMI in a tandem transplant setting was 13.5 Gy. Because 20% of patients are surviving at 8 years free of disease, further studies of TMI are warranted.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage — Clinical features include hemoptysis (two-thirds of patients), anemia, and diffuse opacity at imaging. Relevant factors include injury to alveolar-capillary microcirculation (eg, microscopic polyangiitis), circulating autoantibody (eg, ANCA), and coagulation disorders. Pathology shows intra-alveolar hemorrhage with hemosiderin-laden macrophages in alveolar spaces and interstitium and occasional focal or diffuse areas of capillaritis. Radiology typically shows bilateral patchy opacities in middle and lower lung zones on chest radiographs and diffuse or geographic ground-glass opacities/consolidation at CT scan.

### Pulmonary toxicity secondary to procarbazine [^112EnDTE]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Procarbazine is a chemotherapy methylating agent that has been used in combination with other drugs, perhaps most successfully in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. There are several side effects that it is commonly associated with; however, it has only rarely been reported to cause lung injury. The resulting pneumonitis may be severe and irreversible. There are eight reported cases in the literature. Here, we report another such case.

CHEST guideline — Subacute cough algorithm: In patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks, always screen for the presence of red flags and perform history and physical examination asking about red flags, environmental and occupational factors, and travel exposures. If a postinfectious or life-threatening diagnosis is suspected (pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease), evaluate and treat first, and consider TB in endemic areas and in high risk groups; if not postinfectious, the workup is the same as chronic cough. Assess for possible new onset or exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, and note that GERD is gastroesophageal reflux disease and NAEB is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Reminders include to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and to routinely follow patients 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit. Red flags include hemoptysis; smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance; adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years; prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night; trouble swallowing when eating or drinking; vomiting; recurrent pneumonia; and history of abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough.

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^117Hh8WB]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hemorrhage

Pulmonary hemorrhage is extravasation of blood into airways and/or lung parenchyma. It is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening event that affects children of all ages and can be associated with a wide range of diseases. It characteristically presents with hemoptysis, although some children have a more elusive presentation with cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, wheezing, and even fever. Although pulmonary hemorrhage can be localized or diffuse, the localized form is more common. There are numerous causes for localized pulmonary hemorrhage, such as infection, congenital malformation, vascular anomalies, bleeding diathesis, trauma, and foreign body. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is usually associated with an underlying systemic disease (e.g. vasculitis, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, coagulopathy, celiac disease, post-bone marrow transplantation, drugs, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary hypertension).

There are no pathognomonic radiographic findings for pulmonary hemorrhage. On radiographs, localized hemorrhage may appear as patchy alveolar opacities or dense consolidation. Diffuse hemorrhage appears as a symmetric diffuse hazy ground-glass pattern, which typically predominates in the lower lung zones with sparing of the apices and costophrenic angles. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage secondary to vasculitis may have an asymmetric or patchy distribution. A characteristic feature of hemorrhage is rapid resolution of radiological opacities over 2–3 days, unless hemorrhage is ongoing or repetitive. As hemorrhage clears, an interstitial pattern with thickening of the interlobular septa may emerge. Within a couple of weeks, chest radiographs typically normalize. However, following repeated episodes of pulmonary hemorrhage, a reticulonodular pattern of interstitial fibrosis develops. The CT findings of pulmonary hemorrhage correlate well with chest radiography. CT is a useful adjunct to radiography in the evaluation of localized pulmonary hemorrhage for depiction of the underlying disease and is also a valuable imaging modality for embolization planning in patients with massive hemorrhage (Fig. 10). Findings suggestive of pulmonary vasculitis on CT include fluffy, centrilobular, perivascular densities found centrally and peripherally. Patients with a normal chest radiograph and a high suspicion of pulmonary hemorrhage may benefit from CT for the diagnosis and differentiating it from other potential diagnostic considerations.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)

DAH is a severe and potentially fatal condition. Clinical history is important in diagnosis of DAH and differentiation from COVID-19. The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hemoptysis, collagen-vascular disease, pulmonary-renal syndromes (Wegener granulomatosis and Goodpasture syndrome) or recent bone marrow transplantation raises the possibility of DAH. On CT, DAH often shows diffuse, patchy or lobular GGO and consolidation with perihilar and dependent distribution. A "crazy-paving" pattern occurs resulting from associated interlobular septal thickening (Fig. 11). DAH usually resolves within 10 days to 2 weeks.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)

PAP is a rare lung disorder with three clinical forms: autoimmune, secondary and congenital. It is characterized by periodic acid Schiff stain positive material within the alveoli. CT shows areas of "crazy-paving" pattern that is more common in patients with autoimmune PAP than in secondary PAP (Fig. 12). Subpleural sparing, geographic distribution and lower lung predominance were also more frequent in autoimmune PAP. Air space disease with patchy areas of parenchymal abnormalities may also reproduce a COVID-19 appearance; however, perihilar distribution in PAP is a differentiating point. Pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy are not a feature of PAP but if present, then a superimposed infection should be considered. Clinically, PAP is different from COVID-19 as patients often present with low-grade fever, progressive exertional dyspnea and cough; however, patients may experience respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation, which is an unusual but recognized complication.

Acute pulmonary disease is the main form of coccidioidomycosis in Brazil

Patients' clinical classification was primarily acute pulmonary disease (Table 1; n = 271, 92.8%). Ten cases (3.4%) with an initial acute pulmonary disease evolved into disseminated disease. Seven cases (2.4%) presented with chronic pulmonary disease, and 4 cases (1.4%) had residual pulmonary form. More detailed clinical and radiology data were collected from a subset of 100 patients (Table 2). From those, the most frequent symptoms were cough (93%), fever (90%), and chest pain (77%). Cough was predominantly dry (65.6%) or initially dry and increasingly productive in 28 cases (30.1%). Typical community-acquired pneumonia-associated productive cough was rare (4.3%). Dyspnea was reported by 51% of the patients, and 12% had severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. Hemoptysis occurred in four cases (4%).

The day after receiving RT, he underwent repeat bronchoscopy with no signs of active bleeding and was able to be extubated. Tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid were discontinued. For the next several days, he was continued on continuous renal replacement therapy, antibiotics, and an extended prednisone taper with intermittent requirement for pRBC and platelet transfusions.

Antibiotics and antifungals were discontinued 2 days later (Hospital Day 14) because of elevated liver function testing, and the next day, confirmatory tests for Coccidioides were negative.

Six days after completion of RT (Hospital Day 17), he was stable and was discharged from the ICU. He was continued on ruxolitinib and extended prednisone taper. Over his 17-day hospitalization, he required 14 total units of pRBC and 12 total units of platelets (10U pRBC and 6U platelets before RT and 4U pRBC and 6U platelets after RT).

One month after hospital discharge, he underwent a repeat bone marrow biopsy with 2% myeloblasts and 2% signal of inv(16) with persistence of the genetic mutations noted above. The diagnosis of AML was confirmed, and treatment was initiated with plans for future bone marrow transplantation.

### Respiratory mortality of childhood, adolescent and young adult cancer survivors [^115vxyGh]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

In regards to risk factors, the greatest excess numbers of respiratory deaths among survivors of childhood cancer were experienced after CNS PNET and other CNS tumours, and after lung cancer, leukaemia (excluding AML), AML, head and neck and CNS tumours among survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer. The large increased risks observed in these specific FPN types could relate to previous cancer treatment. For example, craniospinal irradiation and the use of nitrosureas in CNS survivors can induce pneumonitis and late restrictive lung disease, while restrictive and obstructive lung disease can develop as a result of the use craniospinal irradiation, total body irradiation or high-dose busulphan in bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia survivors. Other clinical correlations between therapeutic agents and respiratory late effects are as follows: (1) busulfan, carmustine or lomustine and the development of pulmonary fibrosis; (2) bleomycin and the development of interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or acute respiratory distress syndrome; (3) irradiation to the axilla, chest, extended mantle, mantle, mediastinal, mini-mantle or whole lung, subtotal lymphoid irradiation, total body irradiation or total lymphoid irradiation and the development of pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pneumonitis, restrictive lung disease or obstructive lung disease; (4) haematopoietic cell transplant with any history of graft-versus-host disease and the development of pulmonary toxicity, bronchiolitis obliterans, chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis; and (5) thoracic surgery and the development of pulmonary dysfunction. However, there may be non-treatment factors that contribute to respiratory mortality. This is particularly apparent for chronic lower respiratory disease deaths in lung cancer survivors, which accounted for 55% (16/29) of the observed excess respiratory deaths in this FPN type, as it is hypothesised that these diseases share underlying host susceptibility factors. Similarly, the fact that over 60% (46/77) of the pneumonia deaths in childhood cancer survivors occurred in survivors of CNS tumours or CNS PNET suggests an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, which may be linked to a weaker cough reflex due to chronic neurological deficits.

Localized endobronchial disease cough — endobronchial brachytherapy candidacy: In adult patients with cough due to localized endobronchial disease for whom surgery, chemotherapy, or external beam radiation are not indicated, we suggest the use of endobronchial brachytherapy where such specialist facilities are available and in suitable patients (Grade 2C). Additional considerations state that endobronchial brachytherapy should be considered particularly for patients with small or endobronchial tumors or limited disease or in whom the tumor has extended into the large airways, and patients should be transferred if it is not locally available.

RESULTS

Survival

Survival, with 95% CIs, for the study cohort as a whole is shown in Figure 1

Figure 1
Overall survival following TBI. The overall median survival was 12.5 (7–22) months. Cox's regression analysis of survival found IP (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.37 (1.35, 4.15), P = 0.003) to be independently significant for decreased survival as illustrated in Figure 2

Survival and IP status. With respect to disease type, Cox's regression analysis found ALL (P = 0.002) and the miscellaneous group (P = 0.01) had statistically significant better survival relative to AML, and NHL (P = 0.08) was of borderline significance relative to AML. Higher dose rate was significant for poorer survival only on univariate analysis. In all, 14 patients remained alive at the time of analysis, with a total of 116 patient years of observation within this group, and a total of 210 patient years of observation for the entire 84 patients.

### Chronic cough in a 70-year-old woman [^112Dj3z1]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old lifelong nonsmoking woman with a past medical history of hypertension was referred to the respiratory clinic for evaluation of chronic cough. She presented with a 5-month history of dry cough, night sweats, fatigue, and a 4.5-kg weight loss. Her cough tended to be worse while lying flat. She denied having shortness of breath, chest pain, wheeze, or hemoptysis. She was taking amlodipine for her blood pressure as well as omeprazole for indigestion. She denied having any reflux symptoms or heartburn. She worked as a receptionist for an optician. She did not have any pets at home and had no family history of asthma or allergic conditions. She had not been abroad recently.

### Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy plus bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma… [^112haabA]. ClinicalTrials (2001). Low credibility.

Study Overview RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of radiation therapy and chemotherapy and kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose etoposide and cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and activity of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, total body irradiation, and autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the feasibility of pretransplantation cytoreduction with a regimen of high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone in this patient population. III.

Determine the feasibility of posttransplantation radiotherapy given to sites of residual disease in this patient population. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease status. Autologous bone marrow is harvested before cytoreduction or involved field radiotherapy. Patients with marrow involvement who achieve marrow complete response after cytoreduction undergo harvest of bone marrow before IFRT. Patients receive cytoreduction comprising high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 12 hours, cisplatin IV over 10 hours, and dexamethasone three times daily on days 1 and 2. Within 10 days after completion of IFRT, patients receive etoposide IV over 26 hours beginning on day -7, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -4, and total body irradiation twice daily on days -3 and -2 and once on day -1. Bone marrow is reinfused on day
0.

Eligible patients with residual disease at 3 months after transplantation undergo involved field "boost" irradiation to sites of residual disease. more than 450 mg/m2 No prior high-dose etoposide No prior high-dose cyclophosphamide No chemotherapy within 4 weeks (no melphalan, nitrosourea, or mitomycin within.

### Treatment of patients with relapsed and resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using total body irradiation, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide and autologous bone marrow transplantation… [^111K6vMU]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Purpose Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who do not achieve a complete response after induction chemotherapy or who relapse after achieving a CR are rarely cured of their disease by the usual salvage therapy. Success of high-dose cytotoxic therapy with an autologous bone marrow transplant is limited. We describe the results of a prospective single-institution study using a new conditioning regimen for patients with relapsed or resistant NHL who underwent AuBMT. Patients and Methods Forty-four patients were reinduced with cytotoxic therapy and then evaluated for response. All patients received the conditioning regimen of hyperfractionated total body irradiation, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow reinfusion. Results The disease-free survival rate was 57% with a median follow-up of 42+ months.

The only variable significantly associated with DFS was the patient's remission status at AuBMT. Patients who underwent AuBMT in CR had a DFS of 80%, whereas patients who underwent AuBMT in partial response or with progressive disease had a DFS of 60% and 11%, respectively. The major toxicity was hemorrhage at the site of bulky disease, especially in patients with residual mediastinal and/or pulmonary disease.

### Chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and post-transplant… [^111QC9xR]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy, Total Body Irradiation, and Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide in Reducing Rates of Graft Versus Host Disease in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies Undergoing Donor Stem Cell Transplant. This phase Ib/II trial studies how well chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and post-transplant cyclophosphamide work in reducing rates of graft versus host disease in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing a donor stem cell transplant. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate and melphalan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells and cancer cells.

When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclophosphamide after the transplant may stop this from happening.
- Patients who have failed a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant are eligible; however, at least 6 months must have elapsed between the start of this reduced intensity conditioning regimen and the last transplant if patient had a prior autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant
- At least 2 weeks since prior radiation treatment and/or surgery. Appropriate washout of prior chemotherapy per BMT standard of care. If medication is not on the list, go by physician discretion.
- Participant must understand the investigational nature of this study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure. STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0. GVHD PROPHYLAXIS REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 3–4, mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours on days 5–35, and sirolimus orally on days 5–180 with a taper beginning on day 100 for up to 6 months post-transplant.
