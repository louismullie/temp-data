## Question

What does a low DHEA level indicate in a female?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a low DHEA or DHEA-S level indicates in a female and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about normal physiology and age-related patterns to avoid overcalling disease. Then, I should verify the main pathological causes, especially adrenal insufficiency and hypopituitarism. Next, I will review how best to test and confirm the diagnosis, including when dynamic testing is needed. After that, I need to consider broader associations and whether they imply causality. Finally, I should examine therapeutic implications, when DHEA replacement is appropriate, and how to monitor and avoid pitfalls, before concluding with a practical, stepwise evaluation plan [^115qspRY] [^1135iuNx] [^115aQ2Bk].

> Let me first confirm the physiology so I do not misinterpret a normal variant as pathology. DHEA is produced in the adrenal zona reticularis under ACTH control and is largely sulfated to DHEA-S, which circulates at high concentrations, shows minimal diurnal variation, and is analytically more stable; importantly, DHEA-S declines progressively with age, independent of menopausal status, so age-specific reference ranges are crucial for interpretation [^115qspRY] [^112sFAMG].

> Wait, let me verify the age effect because an isolated "low" DHEA-S in an older woman may be entirely physiological. DHEA/DHEA-S peaks in early adulthood and then falls by roughly 70% or more by later life; moreover, there is wide interindividual variability in postmenopausal women, so a value flagged "low" by a non–age-adjusted lab range can still be normal for age and not imply disease by itself [^112sFAMG] [^115Bo29v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — when is a low DHEA-S abnormal for age and clinically meaningful? I should confirm that unexpectedly low age-adjusted DHEA-S raises suspicion for adrenal insufficiency; importantly, a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S essentially rules out adrenal insufficiency, whereas a low DHEA-S alone is insufficient to diagnose it without dynamic testing such as the cosyntropin stimulation test when clinical suspicion is present [^1135iuNx].

> Let me consider the principal pathologies I must exclude. In primary adrenal insufficiency, destruction of the cortex causes loss of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens, so DHEA/DHEA-S is characteristically low; in central adrenal insufficiency due to ACTH deficiency, DHEA/DHEA-S also falls, often profoundly; additionally, exogenous glucocorticoids can suppress ACTH and secondarily lower DHEA-S until the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis recovers [^112ku72n] [^113fL3UG] [^113uLZzA].

> I need to ensure I sequence the diagnostic work-up correctly. First, I should confirm the low value with a reliable assay, ideally LC-MS/MS or a well-validated method, because immunoassays can show positive bias; then, I will assess clinical context and symptoms; next, I should obtain an 8–9 AM serum cortisol and plasma ACTH, and proceed to ACTH stimulation testing if indicated; finally, I will reserve adrenal imaging for cases with confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency of unclear etiology or other red flags, not for low DHEA-S alone [^115qspRY] [^1135iuNx] [^11469Efd].

> But wait, what if the low DHEA-S is discovered during a work-up for androgen excess rather than deficiency? I should double-check source attribution: DHEA/DHEA-S primarily reflect adrenal androgen production, whereas testosterone is more ovarian; thus, a low DHEA-S in a hyperandrogenic presentation makes an adrenal source less likely, whereas an elevated DHEA-S points me toward the adrenals and may warrant adrenal imaging in severe or atypical cases, particularly in postmenopausal women with new-onset androgen excess [^115qspRY] [^111YSQq2] [^115Hqxs2].

> Next, I should review symptoms sometimes attributed to low adrenal androgens in women. Although some patients with adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism report low libido, low energy, or reduced well-being that may improve modestly with DHEA, diagnosing a generic "androgen deficiency syndrome" in healthy women is not recommended due to poor correlation between androgen levels and symptoms and lack of a well-defined syndrome — so I need to be cautious and context-specific [^1157rq8n] [^117TcpYS].

> Let me examine the broader prognostic associations without overinterpreting them. Observational data link lower DHEA-S to adverse outcomes such as higher all-cause mortality mainly in men, inconsistent in women, and to worse prognosis in cardiovascular cohorts; there are also cross-sectional associations with restrictive spirometry in women, but longitudinal data do not support causality, so low DHEA-S may be more of an illness or frailty marker than a modifiable risk factor by itself [^113VFzTF] [^111Ypbxy] [^115bRar3].

> I should confirm the therapeutic implications and avoid overuse. For women with primary adrenal insufficiency who, despite optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, have persistent low libido, low mood, or low energy, a monitored trial of oral DHEA 25–50 mg daily is reasonable, with monitoring using morning DHEA-S prior to dosing and careful surveillance for androgenic adverse effects; however, trials in Addison's disease show biochemical normalization with limited or no consistent benefits for sexual function, cognition, or fatigue, and androgenic side effects can occur, particularly at higher achieved DHEA-S levels [^115aQ2Bk] [^116ZCicv] [^112ku72n].

> Hold on, I should verify that routine DHEA is not advised for healthy postmenopausal women. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show no consistent benefit of systemic DHEA for libido, well-being, cognition, metabolic markers, or bone in women with normal adrenal function, and professional guidance recommends against routine use; although DHEA 50 mg can increase estradiol and testosterone biochemically, and clinical benefit is unproven. Furthermore, androgenic effects like acne and hirsutism are more common, so I should not generalize replacement outside clearly defined deficiency states [^114LPJZF] [^1157rq8n] [^114rchcE].

> Let me now integrate this into a practical approach when a low DHEA-S is reported. I should first confirm the result with an appropriate assay and age-specific reference range; then assess clinical context and symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency; next obtain morning cortisol and ACTH, proceeding to cosyntropin stimulation when indicated; if primary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, I will evaluate its etiology and consider DHEA as above if symptoms persist despite optimized steroid replacement; if central adrenal insufficiency or glucocorticoid-induced suppression is suspected, I will manage HPA axis recovery accordingly, recognizing that DHEA-S is a sensitive marker of ACTH deficiency but not diagnostic alone [^1135iuNx] [^11469Efd] [^113uLZzA].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not misclassify physiologic aging as disease: in many older women, a low DHEA-S reflects normal senescence of adrenal androgen production; when unexpectedly low for age or accompanied by compatible symptoms and other biochemical findings, it should prompt evaluation for primary or central adrenal insufficiency; outside these contexts, low DHEA-S may function as a nonspecific marker of illness rather than a treatment target, and routine DHEA supplementation in women with normal adrenal function is not supported by current evidence or guidelines [^115qspRY] [^1135iuNx] [^1157rq8n].

Low DHEA in females is most often due to **adrenal insufficiency** or **age-related decline** [^11142odu], and can present with fatigue, low libido, mood changes, and reduced bone density [^112GL3Rd] [^117TcpYS]. Diagnosis relies on **morning DHEA-S** [^1135iuNx] with age/sex-adjusted reference ranges [^116VVDEp], and DHEA-S is a useful adjunct in assessing adrenal function. DHEA replacement is considered for women with adrenal insufficiency [^115aQ2Bk] who have persistent low libido, mood, or energy despite optimized steroid therapy, with typical doses of **25–50 mg/day** [^112ku72n] and monitoring for androgenic side effects [^116ZCicv]. Routine DHEA use in healthy women is **not recommended** [^1157rq8n] due to limited evidence of benefit and potential risks [^114LPJZF].

## Physiological role of DHEA in females

DHEA is a precursor to androgens and estrogens [^115Hqxs2] that supports sexual function, mood, bone health, and metabolism, and its levels peak in early adulthood and **decline with age** [^11142odu].

---

## Causes of low DHEA levels in females

Low DHEA levels in females may result from:

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency [^11469Efd] reduces adrenal androgen production.

- **Hypopituitarism**: ACTH deficiency lowers adrenal androgen synthesis [^113fL3UG].

- **Aging**: DHEA declines ~70% from ages 20 to 60 [^11142odu].

- **Chronic illness and stress**: Chronic disease [^115bRar3] and stress [^112yGcP6] can suppress adrenal function.

- **Medications**: Long-term glucocorticoids [^113uLZzA] and some antidepressants can lower DHEA.

---

## Clinical symptoms and health implications

Low DHEA in females is associated with the following:

- **Fatigue and low energy**: Common in adrenal insufficiency [^112uCFEs].

- **Reduced libido and sexual dysfunction**: Linked to lower androgens [^112GL3Rd].

- **Mood disturbances**: Depression and anxiety are reported [^114k8LiV].

- **Bone health**: Lower BMD and higher fracture risk [^116DGA23].

- **Metabolic effects**: Increased adiposity and insulin resistance [^111UPHeo].

- **Immune function**: Potential immune dysregulation [^116uvacN].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and biochemical testing, including evaluation of fatigue, libido, mood, and bone health. **Morning DHEA-S** [^1135iuNx] should be measured using age- and sex-adjusted reference ranges [^116VVDEp]. Additional tests — such as cortisol and ACTH — and dynamic assessment (e.g. cosyntropin stimulation) [^112uCFEs] help evaluate adrenal function.

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the cause and severity, prioritizing correction of the underlying disorder and symptom relief. DHEA supplementation at **25–50 mg/day** may be considered for women with adrenal insufficiency who have persistent symptoms despite optimized steroid therapy [^115aQ2Bk] [^112ku72n]. Estrogen/progestin hormone therapy may be used for menopausal symptoms and bone health, while exercise, stress reduction, and nutrition support overall adrenal function [^114k8LiV].

---

## Risks and side effects of DHEA supplementation

Potential risks include the following:

- **Androgenic effects**: Acne, hirsutism, hair loss [^114yn5ey].

- **Hormonal imbalance**: Altered estrogen/testosterone levels [^114rchcE].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Possible lipid changes and cardiovascular effects [^1177CU7u].

- **Long-term safety**: Limited data on prolonged use [^115QVnUc].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential and should include both **clinical and laboratory parameters**. Monitor DHEA-S [^116ZCicv], testosterone, and estrogen; reassess fatigue, libido, mood, and bone health at follow-up visits. Watch for androgenic and metabolic adverse effects to guide dose adjustments or discontinuation if needed.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Guidelines recommend **targeted supplementation** — consider DHEA for women with adrenal insufficiency and persistent symptoms despite optimized steroid therapy [^115aQ2Bk] — and advise against **routine use** in healthy women due to limited benefit and potential risks [^111S1Cxo].

---

Low DHEA in females is linked to fatigue, low libido, mood changes, and bone loss; **evaluate with morning DHEA-S** [^1135iuNx] and **treat based on cause**, considering DHEA supplementation in adrenal insufficiency [^115aQ2Bk] with symptom monitoring.

### Androgen therapy in women: A reappraisal: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1157rq8n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

To update practice guidelines for the therapeutic use of androgens in women, a Task Force was appointed by the Endocrine Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE), and the International Menopause Society (IMS). This Task Force consisted of six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

The Task Force commissioned two systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials. The GRADE methodology was utilized; the strength of a recommendation is indicated by a number "1" (strong recommendation, we recommend) or "2" (weak recommendation, we suggest).

Consensus was determined through multiple e-mail communications and conference calls. Committees of the Endocrine Society, ASRM, ACOG, ESE, and IMS reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusions from this guideline include a continued recommendation against diagnosing androgen deficiency syndrome in healthy women due to the lack of a well-defined syndrome and the unavailability of data correlating androgen levels with specific signs or symptoms. Additionally, the guideline advises against the general use of testosterone for indications such as infertility; sexual dysfunction other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder; cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, or bone health; or general well-being. It also recommends against the routine use of dehydroepiandrosterone, due to limited data concerning its effectiveness and safety in normal women or those with adrenal insufficiency.

Regarding medical management for primary adrenal insufficiency, particularly in the context of DHEA replacement, the Endocrine Society's 2016 guidelines recommend considering a trial of DHEA replacement in women with primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) who experience low libido, depressive symptoms, and/or low energy levels despite otherwise optimized corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid replacement.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: the added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^1135iuNx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To review biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we examined the relevant literature, including our data, on various biochemical tests used to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are helpful only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated, whereas baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are useful only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although serum DHEA-S levels are low in patients with primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level of this steroid is not sufficient by itself for establishing the diagnosis. However, a normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measurements of baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. In addition to these, determining plasma levels of aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. With a random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both), the diagnosis is practically ruled out.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone: A springboard hormone for female sexuality [^112GL3Rd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the role of adrenal androgenic hormone precursors in female sexual function, a review of literature was conducted on sexual function and the androgen precursor hormones dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

The C(19) steroid DHEA functions as both an ovarian and adrenal androgen precursor hormone, whereas DHEAS is synthesized exclusively in the adrenal cortex. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate secretion begins at age 10, peaks at age 20, and subsequently declines. Low DHEAS levels are noted in individuals with adrenal insufficiency and in the elderly. A daily intake of dehydroepiandrosterone at 50 mg increases DHEAS levels. In women, but not in men, the increased DHEAS levels contribute to the production of additional downstream androgens, including testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, as well as androstenediol glucuronide. An improved female androgenic profile is associated with increased sexual thoughts and fantasies, as well as enhanced mood and well-being, especially in women with adrenal insufficiency. In individuals over age 65, DHEAS levels rise in both men and women with DHEA 50 mg/day. However, only in women was the elevation in DHEAS linked to a surge in testosterone levels. Women over the age of 70 reported increased libido, enhanced sexual satisfaction, a 26% reduction in bone resorption, and a 10% decrease in skin pigmentation.

The female adrenal androgen deficiency syndrome, characterized by low serum DHEAS levels, may be mitigated by DHEA supplements that elevate levels of DHEAS and downstream androgens, which are important for female sexuality.

### Long-term DHEA replacement in primary adrenal insufficiency: a randomized, controlled trial [^112ku72n]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) are the major circulating adrenal steroids and substrates for peripheral sex hormone biosynthesis. In Addison's disease, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies require lifelong replacement, but the associated near-total failure of DHEA synthesis is not typically corrected.

- **Objective and design**: In a double-blind trial, we randomized 106 subjects (44 males, 62 females) with Addison's disease to receive either 50 mg daily of micronized DHEA or placebo orally for 12 months to evaluate its longer-term effects on bone mineral density, body composition, cognitive function, well-being, and fatigue.

- **Results**: Circulating DHEAS as well as androstenedione rose significantly in both sexes, with testosterone increasing to low normal levels only in females. DHEA reversed ongoing loss of bone mineral density at the femoral neck (P < 0.05) but not at other sites. DHEA enhanced total body (P = 0.02) and truncal (P = 0.017) lean mass significantly, with no change in fat mass. At baseline, subscales of psychological well-being in questionnaires (Short Form-36, General Health Questionnaire-30) were significantly worse in Addison's patients compared to control populations (P < 0.001). One subscale of SF-36 improved significantly (P = 0.004) after DHEA treatment. There was no significant benefit of DHEA treatment on fatigue, cognitive or sexual function. Supraphysiological DHEAS levels were achieved in some older females who experienced mild androgenic side effects.

Conclusion: Although further long-term studies…

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^114rchcE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. Our analysis of 21 RCTs revealed that DHEA supplementation significantly increased both testosterone and estradiol concentrations, although substantial heterogeneity was observed across the included trials.

Our findings indicate that DHEA is particularly effective in elevating testosterone levels when administered at dosages ≥ 50 mg/day. Additionally, a marked increase in estradiol levels was noted among participants aged ≥ 60 years receiving the same dosage. These findings are consistent with a previous meta-analysis by Li et al, which reported increased testosterone levels in participants receiving > 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≤ 12 weeks, particularly among those under 60 years of age. Similarly, Zhu et al. found that estradiol concentrations were significantly increased in participants aged ≥ 60 years who received ≥ 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≥ 26 weeks. The variation in effective intervention duration may stem from differences in study populations. Our meta-analysis focused exclusively on postmenopausal women, which may have contributed to differing results compared to previous analyses involving broader populations.

Most of the included trials in our study had an intervention duration of 6 to 12 months; therefore, we used 26 weeks (approximately 6 months) as the stratification threshold. While the average increase in estradiol was 7.86 pg/mL, this change may be clinically minimal.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone substitution in female adrenal failure: No impact on endothelial function and cardiovascular parameters despite normalization of androgen status [^112AmN56]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). High credibility.

In female adrenal insufficiency, there is a reduced production of the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and low androgen levels. While oral DHEA can restore the androgen deficit, the clinical implications and safety of substitution therapy remain uncertain. A putative DHEA receptor in the vascular endothelium has been described, and in vitro studies have shown the involvement of DHEA in nitric oxide-dependent pathways.

- **Aim**: To evaluate the effects of DHEA substitution on cardiovascular parameters.

- **Design**: A six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted. Treatment consisted of either a 50 mg dose of DHEA or a placebo. Each treatment period was followed by a two-month washout period.

- **Material and methods**: Ten females with documented adrenal failure were included. Androgen levels were measured, and cardiovascular evaluations were performed before and after every treatment period. Two patients left the study due to skin side effects and anxiety, respectively. All patients had low circulating androgens at baseline and normal range androgens during DHEA treatment. Patients underwent evaluations using noninvasive endothelial cell function tests, MRI-based cardiac output measurements, echocardiography, ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, and assessments of maximal oxygen consumption.

- **Results**: DHEA treatment normalized androgen status to levels seen in healthy women. However, neither DHEA nor placebo treatment had an effect on echocardiographic parameters of myocardial dimensions or systolic and diastolic function, noninvasive endothelial cell function at the level of the brachial artery, 24-hour blood pressure, or heart rate.

### Clinical review: DHEA replacement for postmenopausal women [^111S1Cxo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that because dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEAS, are important precursors for estrogen as well as androgen production, treatment with DHEA is a physiologically based strategy for the alleviation of hormone deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women. We have summarized the physiology of DHEA in women and reviewed the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the effects of DHEA therapy in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We reviewed the medical literature for key papers investigating DHEA physiology and RCTs of the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women through November 2010. The focus was on sexual function, well-being, metabolic parameters, and cognition as study endpoints.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although cross-sectional studies have indicated a link between low DHEA levels and impaired sexual function, well-being, and cognitive performance in postmenopausal women, placebo-controlled RCTs do not show benefits of oral DHEA for any of these outcomes or favorable effects on lipids and carbohydrate metabolism.

- **Conclusions**: Taken together, findings from this review of the published literature do not support the use of DHEA in postmenopausal women at this time.

### Oral dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in older adults: effects on central adiposity, glucose metabolism and blood lipids [^1177CU7u]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). High credibility.

To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy on changes in central adiposity, insulin action, and blood lipids, researchers posited that many of the actions of DHEA in humans are mediated through its conversion to sex hormones, which modulate adiposity, muscularity, and insulin sensitivity. The effects of DHEA replacement on regional tissue composition, glucose metabolism, and blood lipid profile in older adults have been inconsistent.

- **Design**: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention was oral DHEA 50 mg/day or placebo for 12 months.

- **Participants**: Fifty-eight women and 61 men, aged 60–88 years, with low serum DHEA sulphate (DHEAS) levels at study entry.

- **Measurements**: Computed tomography measures of abdominal fat areas, thigh muscle and fat areas, DXA-derived trunk fat mass, serum glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge, and fasted serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were assessed before and after the intervention.

- **Results**: There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences between the DHEA and placebo groups in the changes in regional tissue composition or glucose metabolism. HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.01) and fasted triglycerides (P = 0.02) decreased in women and men taking DHEA.

- **Conclusion**: Restoring serum DHEAS levels in older adults to young adult levels for 1 year does not appear to reduce central adiposity or improve insulin action. The benefit of DHEA on decreasing serum triglycerides must be weighed against the HDL-lowering effect.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111YSQq2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Adrenal imaging to assess for androgen excess should urgently be undertaken in premenopausal women with severe biochemical disturbance characterized by significant predominant elevation of adrenal androgens (DHEAS and A4) and testosterone, and in all postmenopausal women with new-onset clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess. The recommended first-line investigation is an urgent unenhanced CT of the adrenal glands to allow better characterization of a potential adrenal mass.

CT imaging has a 99% sensitivity for diagnosing adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) with a cut-off of over 20 Hounsfield units (HU); however, its specificity is poor. This can lead to increased detection of adrenal incidentalomas, particularly in older patients, necessitating multidisciplinary team involvement to guide decision-making and prevent unnecessary surgical intervention.

MRI can also be undertaken to assess for adrenal gland neoplasia. Chemical-shift imaging can differentiate benign from malignant tumors by examining for signal loss on in-and-out-of-phase MRI. Additionally, 18 FDG-PET is another imaging modality that can help differentiate benign from malignant adrenal masses. This modality is highly sensitive to detecting metabolic changes, but spatial resolution for anatomical localization and specificity are poor, with a significant proportion of benign adenomas demonstrating tracer uptake.

Case studies have demonstrated the utility of iodine-131 6-beta-monomethyl-19-nor cholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy in localizing pathologic sources of ovarian and adrenal androgen excess. In the documented cases, androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal sources have been successfully identified through this method.

### Low serum DHEA-S is associated with impaired lung function in women [^115bRar3]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Considering that DHEA-S is almost the exclusive source of androgens in peripheral tissues in women, these data together suggest that DHEA-S, directly or indirectly through its androgenic metabolites, might contribute to sustaining respiratory function. Since androgens have known anabolic effects, one might speculate that DHEA-S deficiency contributes to respiratory muscle weakness, with a simultaneous restrictive lung function impairment. In our study, low DHEA-S was associated with a restrictive pattern on spirometry only in the cross-sectional analysis, while it was not associated with FVC decline in the longitudinal analysis. If the association was causal, this might point toward a short-term, maybe reversible, effect of DHEA-S deficiency on pulmonary vital capacity. Notably, among never-smokers or light smokers, one out of four women with a restrictive pattern was found to have low DHEA-S levels.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113uLZzA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy. Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects, including co-morbidities, co-medication, age, and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency. The choice may also be influenced by the medical context, such as the training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, the glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is documented. Conversely, if the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering can proceed until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) to determine HPA axis recovery. If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still provide a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to the recommendations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11469Efd]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, especially concerning the evaluation of underlying etiology, ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in adult patients with PAI:

- **Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level**: Test for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in infants and selected children and adults.

- **21-hydroxylase antibodies**: Test for autoimmune adrenalitis.

- **Plasma VLCFAs**: Test for adrenoleukodystrophy in males with negative 21-hydroxylase antibodies.

- **CT scan of the adrenals**: Eliminate adrenal infiltrative processes or metastases in all patients with an unknown etiology of adrenal insufficiency after laboratory testing.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: Clinical and biochemical insights [^115HpGdw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Androgen metabolism in women involves several key organs, including the ovaries, adrenal glands, and peripheral tissues. Androgenic precursors, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulphated ester DHEAS, as well as androstenedione (A4), are secreted by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. These precursors are activated into more potent androgens, such as testosterone (T) and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in the ovaries and peripheral tissues. Although testosterone may be produced and secreted by the adrenal gland in low concentrations, serum testosterone levels are generally considered indicative of ovarian androgen generation. In contrast, DHEA and DHEAS production primarily reflects adrenal androgen production. There is ongoing debate about the predominant source of androstenedione (A4) production, with contributions likely coming relatively equally from the adrenals and ovaries.

Figure 1 illustrates adrenal, ovarian, and peripheral androgen metabolism, demonstrating both classic and 11‐oxygenated androgen pathways. Androgenic precursors are secreted predominantly by the adrenal glands and activated to potent androgens in the ovaries and peripheral tissues. Important enzymes and compounds in these pathways include 5α-reductase type 1 and 2 (5αR 1/2), 11β‐hydroxyandrostenedione (11OHA4), 11β‐hydroxytestosterone (11OHT), 11‐hydroxydihydrotestosterone (11OHDHT), 11‐ketoandrostenedione (11KA4), 11‐ketotestosterone (11KT), 11‐ketodihydrotestosterone (11KDHT), 17‐hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), aldoketoreductase type 1C3 (AKR1C3), 11β‐hydroxylase type 1 (CYP11B1), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and testosterone (T).

### Endogenous sex steroid hormones, sex hormone-binding globulin, and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^113VFzTF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

We observed a significant association between the top and bottom third levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and lower risk of all-cause mortality in men (HR [95% CI]: 0.72 [0.57 to 0.91], I²: 73.99%, n = 6, Supplementary Fig. S1G) but not in women (HR [95% CI]: 0.84 [0.57 to 1.24], I²: 17.03%, n = 3, Supplementary Fig. S1H). The certainty of evidence was very low for men and moderate for women (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Table S7). Three studies reported the association of DHEAS and risk of all-cause mortality in men and women combined; meta-analysis of these studies also showed no association (HR [95% CI]: 0.90 [0.51 to 1.57], Supplementary Fig. S1I) with low certainty of evidence (Supplementary Table S8).

Similarly, we found no association between DHEAS levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death in men (HR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.41 to 1.41], I²: 58.35%, n = 5, Supplementary Fig. S2G) or women (HR [95% CI]: 0.83 [0.52 to 1.30], I²: 73.47%, n = 4, Supplementary Fig. S2H) with low certainty of evidence (Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Table S7).

Pooled effect estimates from two studies showed no association between dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and risk of all-cause mortality in men (HR [95% CI]: 0.73 [0.12 to 4.55], Supplementary Fig. S1J).

Only one study, by Mukama et al, presented the association of DHEAS and risk of cancer mortality in men and women. Another study by Islam et al. reported the association of DHEA and all-cause mortality in women, and a study by Chan et al. reported the association of DHEA and risk of CVD mortality in men.

### Society for Endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115dZb7s]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Overall, comprehensive data directly comparing differing imaging approaches in the evaluation of severe androgen excess are lacking; therefore, clinical presentation in tandem with reasoned biochemical evaluation is crucial to determining which imaging modality is most appropriate.

- **Recommendations**: When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality in selected patients and where culturally acceptable. Imaging is not necessary if two Rotterdam criteria are otherwise met (i.e. androgen excess and oligomenorrhea), unless there are otherwise atypical clinical and biochemical features. If clinical indications suggest non-PCOS pathology, cross-sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken as appropriate. MRI pelvis should be undertaken if an ovarian tumor is strongly suspected. Urgent cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should be undertaken if an adrenal pathology is suspected.

### Prognostic value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate for patients with cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ypbxy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The relationship between dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and various outcomes has been extensively studied.

- **DHEAS and ACM**:
	- Eleven studies reported positive associations between low DHEAS concentrations and all-cause mortality (ACM). Meta-analysis results demonstrated that cardiovascular disease (CVD) with low DHEAS was associated with a 47% higher risk of future mortality events (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38–1.56; P < 0.00001).

	- *Figure 2*: The relationship between dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and all-cause mortality.

- **DHEAS and fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular events**:
	- Six studies investigated deficient DHEAS levels and fatal cardiovascular events, while seven studies explored low DHEAS in nonfatal cardiovascular events. Additionally, one study reported on DHEAS concerning both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events separately. In the meta-analysis, pooled estimates for the lowest compared to the highest category of baseline DHEAS indicated a significantly increased risk for fatal cardiovascular events, without heterogeneity (I² = 0%). The pooled risk ratio was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.30–1.91; P < 0.00001).

	- *Figure 3*: The relationship between dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and fatal cardiovascular events.

	- The pooled estimate for nonfatal cardiovascular events showed a slightly higher association, with a risk ratio of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.24–1.62; P < 0.00001), again without heterogeneity (I² = 0%). The hazard ratio for fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular events was markedly higher, with a risk ratio of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.23–3.10; P = 0.005).

### Clinical review: The benefits and harms of systemic dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LPJZF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) therapy has been proposed to replenish the depletion of endogenous DHEA and its sulfate form, which occurs with advancing age and is thought to be associated with loss of libido and menopausal symptoms.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence supporting the use of systemic DHEA in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through January 2014. Pairs of reviewers, working independently, selected studies and extracted data from eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used the random-effects model to pool across studies and evaluated heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic.

We included 23 RCTs with moderate to high risk of bias enrolling 1188 women. DHEA use was not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function (standardized mean difference, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.73; P value = .06; I(2) = 62%). There was also no significant effect of DHEA on serious adverse effects, serum lipids, serum glucose, weight, body mass index, or bone mineral density. This evidence warranted low confidence in the results, mostly due to imprecision, risk of bias, and inconsistency across RCTs.

Evidence warranting low confidence suggests that DHEA administration does not significantly impact sexual symptoms or selected metabolic markers in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

### Prognostic value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate for patients with cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117DTU5r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis, we found that cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients with lower dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels may have a poorer prognosis than those with higher DHEAS levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the relationship between DHEAS and CVD outcomes.

Our meta-analysis included all English-language and Chinese-language published studies up until September 5, 2016, that compared CVD outcomes in patients with lower or higher concentrations of DHEAS. Twenty-five published studies were selected according to specified inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 92,489 patients. Of note, a lower concentration of DHEAS was associated with a significantly increased risk of overall mortality when all studies were considered (risk ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38–1.56).

Sex hormones play a pivotal role in regulating body composition in both men and women. DHEAS, as their precursor, has been shown to have many biological effects, and the clinical significance of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEAS in CVD remains uncertain. Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the association between low DHEAS and all-cause disease or CVD mortality is conflicting. Most studies in men show a negative relationship between DHEAS level, mortality, and CVD mobility. Similar conclusions in postmenopausal women with low DHEAS levels have been reported and are associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Conversely, no association was observed between DHEAS and mortality in several studies.

Our meta-analysis, including 92,489 patients, clarified the association between DHEAS levels and CVD prognosis.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114e6NH5]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Are there normal values and treatment targets?

As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were "plugged into" the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/L). The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

- **Limitations in clinical practice**: The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons: (1) the small sample sizes of the original publications, (2) insufficient accuracy and precision of RIA testosterone measurements.

### Wide distribution of the serum dehydroepiandrosterone and sex steroid levels in postmenopausal women: Role of the ovary [^115Bo29v]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The exclusive source of sex steroids (at least estrogens) after menopause is recognized to be dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This study examines the interindividual variability of serum DHEA and its metabolites, as well as the contribution of the ovary to global sex steroid physiology in postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: Serum levels of DHEA and 11 of its metabolites were measured by gas or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in 442 intact and 71 ovariectomized postmenopausal women aged 42 to 74 years.

- **Results**: With a mean ± SD concentration of 2.03 ± 1.33 ng/mL, serum DHEA in intact postmenopausal women is highly variable, with 5th and 95th percentiles at 0.55 and 4.34 ng/mL, respectively, representing a 7.9-fold difference. A comparable variability is observed for the 11 metabolites of DHEA. The 22.3% higher serum DHEA in intact compared with ovariectomized women is accompanied by parallel differences for all the other steroids, indicating that all sex steroids originate from circulating DHEA in postmenopausal women with no direct secretion of active estrogens or androgens by the postmenopausal ovary.

- **Conclusions**: The 7.9-fold difference between low and high serum DHEA levels provides an explanation for the lack of signs of hormone deficiency in some women, whereas most exhibit symptoms or signs. The approximately 20% contribution of the ovary to the total pool of DHEA, with no direct secretion of estrogens or androgens in the circulation, could possibly explain the reported negative effect of oophorectomy on longevity, especially concerning coronary heart disease.

### Approach to androgen excess in women: Clinical and biochemical insights [^111XiV8b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

- **DHEAS**: DHEAS is water-soluble and present in large quantities, circulating in the micromolar range in serum. It may be measured with either RIA or LC-MS/MS; however, the latter is not critical due to its significantly higher circulating concentration than serum T in women. Severe DHEAS elevation in premenopausal women is most likely attributable to PCOS, but in the postmenopausal phase of life, the likelihood of ACC is extremely high (Figures 3 and 4). Nonetheless, we recommend imaging all premenopausal women with DHEAS elevations > 20 μmol/L and all postmenopausal women with levels in excess of 5 μmol/L presenting with androgen excess.

- **11-Oxygenated androgens**: 11-Oxygenated androgens are currently not routinely available in most clinical biochemistry laboratories. Their wider clinical availability in the future may represent an additional diagnostic tool for clinicians in evaluating androgen excess. Future research areas include the utility of 11-oxygenated androgens to differentiate between adrenal and ovarian hyperandrogenism, as biomarkers of disease control in CAH, and in discriminating between nonclassic CAH and more severe forms of PCOS. It remains to be elucidated whether 11-oxygenated androgens may play a role as surrogate markers of metabolic risk in women with PCOS. 11OHA4 can only be generated by adrenal CYP11B1 activity and, therefore, in theory, should help discriminate between underlying adrenal and ovarian pathology in the workup of androgen excess.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^116rsRRT]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Adrenal insufficiency screening**: All boys and men, but not girls and women, should be routinely screened for adrenal insufficiency with early morning cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) measurements. Screening should be initiated in the first 6 months of life, then performed every 3–6 months before the age of 10 years, and yearly thereafter. It is advised to perform screening parallel to MRI when possible.

- **Evaluation for adrenal insufficiency**: Prompt evaluation is necessary for patients with symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency to identify and prevent an adrenal crisis. If a patient is in crisis, a random cortisol and ACTH level measurement is sufficient, provided serum specimens are drawn before glucocorticoid administration. If mildly symptomatic, early morning fasted cortisol and ACTH measurement is preferred.

- **Screening for mineralocorticoid deficiency**: Patients screened for adrenal insufficiency, or diagnosed with it, should also be screened for mineralocorticoid deficiency with plasma renin and serum electrolytes. Prompt evaluation with plasma renin and serum electrolytes is necessary for patients showing symptoms of mineralocorticoid deficiency.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is common in male patients with ALD but rare in women. Screening in adult patients should continue irrespective of age, as it is inexpensive and early diagnosis offers significant potential health benefits. Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by low or normal…

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115Hqxs2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is responsible for adrenal androgen precursor synthesis, which is under the control of pituitary corticotropin (ACTH). The adrenal gland secretes several 19 carbon (C19) steroids, with DHEA and DHEAS produced in the greatest quantity. The majority of DHEA is converted to A4 via oxidation of the 3-beta-hydroxyl group through the action of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3βHSD2). Small quantities of the active androgen testosterone (T) can also be produced from A4 in the adrenal glands through the activity of aldoketoreductase type 1 C3 (AKR1C3), but the bulk of circulating T in women is of ovarian origin. DHEA and DHEAS are therefore considered biomarkers of adrenal androgen secretion, while A4 can originate from both ovaries and adrenals.

Androgen synthesis in the theca cells of the ovarian follicular unit is under tonic stimulation by pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). Ovarian thecal cells can generate DHEA de novo from cholesterol and pregnenolone through the actions of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme and 17α-hydroxylase, and thereafter it is converted to A4 and T. Venous sampling studies have confirmed significant gradients between ovarian vein and peripheral samples for both T and A4, even after menopause, with a significantly greater relative production of T from the ovary. Serum T in women is therefore considered an accurate biomarker of ovarian androgen generation, particularly if adrenal precursors such as DHEA or DHEAS are not simultaneously elevated.

### The hypoandrogenic woman: Pathophysiologic overview [^117TcpYS]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To review the pathophysiologic changes associated with androgen insufficiency in females, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the English-language literature from 1940 to 2001. Data suggest that diminished androgen levels, most frequently noted in surgically menopausal patients, may be associated with numerous symptoms, including reduced sexual libido and desire, loss of motivation, flat affect, and reduced energy. A lack of consensus regarding the definition of abnormally low values for free and total serum androgen levels has made diagnosing hypoandrogenic states challenging.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone combined with exercise improves muscle strength and physical function in frail older women [^116tJjoQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). High credibility.

To investigate the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) combined with exercise on bone mass, strength, and physical function in older, frail women, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at a major medical institution. The participants were ninety-nine women with a mean age of 76.6 ± 6.0 years, all having low sulfated DHEA (DHEAS) levels, low bone mass, and frailty.

Participants received either 50 mg/d DHEA or a placebo for six months, with all receiving additional calcium and cholecalciferol. They engaged in 90-minute exercise regimens twice weekly.

- **Measurements of outcomes**: Hormone levels, bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, body composition, upper and lower extremity strength, and physical performance were measured.

- **Results**: A total of 87 women (88%) completed the six-month study. Although there were no significant changes in BMD or bone turnover markers, DHEA supplementation led to an increase in lower extremity strength (from 459 ± 121 N to 484 ± 147 N; p = 0.01). The Short Physical Performance Battery score, focusing on lower extremity function, also improved in the DHEA group (from 10.1 ± 1.8 to 10.7 ± 1.9; p = 0.02). Significant changes were observed in hormone levels, including DHEAS, estradiol, estrone, and testosterone, with a decline in sex hormone-binding globulin levels in those taking DHEA.

In conclusion, DHEA supplementation enhanced lower extremity strength and function among older, frail women who were involved in gentle exercise programs such as chair aerobics or yoga. There was no observed change in BMD, possibly due to the small sample size, the short duration of the study, or the lack of effect.

### The value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements in the assessment of adrenal function [^116VVDEp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated ester (DHEA-S) are corticotropin-dependent adrenal androgen precursors that are uniformly low in treated patients with corticotropin deficiency. There are no data investigating the diagnostic value of DHEA-S measurements in the prospective assessment of adrenal function. This study examined serum DHEA-S levels as possible markers for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function in patients with large pituitary adenomas.

Patients were characterized to have normal HPA (n = 47) or abnormal HPA (ABN-HPA, n = 35) function based on their respective responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Patients also underwent low-dose Cortrosyn (1 micro g, LDC) and standard-dose Cortrosyn stimulation testing. All patients with ABN-HPA had very low age- and gender-matched serum DHEA-S levels. When the normal response to LDC was set at a cortisol level of at least 18.1 micro g/dL, 10 of 31 patients with ABN-HPA exhibited normal responses.

Receiver operating characteristic curves for baseline DHEA-S and for maximal cortisol responses to LDC had areas of 0.984 (confidence interval, 0.962–1.000) and 0.893 (confidence interval, 0.817–0.969), respectively. LDC- or SDC-stimulated serum cortisol levels have significant limitations in defining HPA function. A normal age- and gender-specific serum DHEA-S level makes the diagnosis of corticotropin deficiency extremely unlikely. However, when serum DHEA-S levels are low, further testing is necessary to define HPA function.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone restores hepatocellular function and prevents liver damage in estrogen-deficient females following trauma and hemorrhage [^116uvacN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the administration of the sex steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in males following trauma-hemorrhagic shock exerts beneficial effects on the impaired cardiovascular and immunological functions under those conditions. Given that the effects of sex steroids are gender-specific, this study examined whether the administration of DHEA has beneficial effects on hepatocellular function in female rats with low estrogen levels following trauma-hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Ovariectomy was performed on female Sprague-Dawley rats 14 days before the experiments. The animals then underwent a 5-cm midline laparotomy and were subjected to hemorrhagic shock (40 mm Hg for 90 minutes). This was followed by fluid resuscitation with Ringer's lactate over 60 minutes and administration of DHEA (30 mg/kg BW) or vehicle subcutaneously at the end of resuscitation. At 24 hours after resuscitation, hepatocellular function (clearance of indocyanine green [ICG]) and hepatocyte damage (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were measured. Plasma levels of DHEA and 17beta-estradiol were also assayed.

- **Results**: Vehicle-treated rats exhibited significantly reduced hepatocellular function, increased ALT activity, and decreased levels of 17beta-estradiol following trauma-hemorrhage compared to sham-operated animals (P < 0.05, ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test). In animals receiving DHEA following trauma-hemorrhage, hepatocellular function and ALT activity were similar to those of sham animals. However, the administration of DHEA did not affect the plasma levels of 17beta-estradiol.

- **Conclusions**: Administration of DHEA after trauma and hemorrhage in estrogen-deficient female rats restores hepatocellular function and prevents liver damage without altering plasma levels of 17beta-estradiol.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^117NNqfZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

When a patient is not a suitable candidate for surgery for a benign ovarian cause of severe hyperandrogenism, treatment with GnRH analogs is an alternative. Depending on the menopausal status of the patient, she may experience symptoms of estrogen withdrawal, and in this situation, estrogen add-back therapy could be considered. Estrogen substitution is also important to consider during long-term treatment with GnRH analogs given the risk of accelerated bone loss.

The primary treatment for androgen-secreting adrenal tumors is adrenalectomy for histopathological diagnosis of a malignant or benign tumor. Complete surgical resection can be sufficient therapy. In cases of malignancy, adjuvant therapy with mitotane, chemotherapy, or radiation may be used. Adrenal function must be closely monitored after surgery for the detection of adrenal insufficiency or re-tumor.

Postmenopausal women with testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L and a history of PCOS with persistent or aggravating hyperandrogenic symptoms are treated with antiandrogen therapy. There are different types of antiandrogens with various mechanisms of action and potential side effects. Ovarian androgen overproduction can be inhibited by GnRH analogues; androgen effects can be blocked by androgen receptor blockers (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or by a 5α-reductase inhibitor (finasteride), blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT, which is the most potent androgen in peripheral tissue. However, treatment of metabolic symptoms with metformin or other substances has limited effect on hyperandrogenism.

### Fatty acid metabolism in the elderly: Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone replacement in hormonally deficient men and women [^111UPHeo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Aging, low dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone are associated with increased adiposity and metabolic risk. Treatment with these hormones may improve these abnormalities. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of aging, DHEA, or testosterone replacement on adiposity, meal fat partitioning, and postabsorptive lipolysis.

This was a cross-sectional, 2-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the general community. Participants included elderly women and men (≥ 60 years) with low DHEA sulfate (women and men) and bioavailable testosterone (men) concentrations, along with young adults.

- **Interventions**: Thirty elderly women each received 50 mg DHEA or placebo daily for 2 years. Thirty elderly men received 75 mg DHEA, 29 received 5 mg testosterone (patch), and 32 received placebo daily for 2 years. Thirty young women and 32 young men served as controls.

- **Main outcome measures**: In vivo measures of meal fat storage into subcutaneous (sc) fat, postabsorptive lipolysis, and regional adiposity at baseline and after treatment.

At baseline, the elderly had more body fat, greater systemic lipolysis (women, P = 0.0003; men, P < 0.0001) adjusted for resting energy expenditure, greater meal fat oxidation (women, P = 0.026; men, P = 0.0025), and less meal fat storage in sc fat (women, P = 0.0139; men, P = 0.0006). Although testosterone treatment increased meal fat storage into upper- vs. lower-body fat in elderly men, neither hormone affected regional adiposity, meal fat oxidation, or systemic lipolysis.

### Effects of DHEA replacement on bone mineral density and body composition in elderly women and men [^116DGA23]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor for both oestrogens as well as androgens. Its marked decline with ageing may influence age-related changes in tissues influenced by sex hormones. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of DHEA replacement on bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in elderly women and men with low serum DHEA sulphate (DHEAS) levels.

- **Design**: Prospective 6-month trial of oral DHEA replacement, 50 mg/day.

- **Patients**: Experimental subjects were 10 women and eight men, aged 73 ± 1 years. Control subjects were 10 women and eight men, aged 74 ± 1 years.

- **Measurements**: BMD, body composition, serum markers of bone turnover, serum lipids and lipoproteins, oral glucose tolerance, serum IGF-I, total serum oestrogens, and testosterone.

- **Results**: BMD of the total body and lumbar spine increased (mean ± SEM; 1.6 ± 0.6% and 2.5 ± 0.8%, respectively; both P ≤ 0.05), fat mass decreased (-1.3 ± 0.4 kg; P < 0.01) and fat-free mass increased (0.9 ± 0.4 kg; P ≤ 0.05) in response to DHEA replacement. DHEA replacement also resulted in increases in serum IGF-I (from 108 ± 8 to 143 ± 7 microg/l; P < 0.01) and total serum testosterone concentrations (from 10.7 ± 1.2 to 15.6 ± 1.8 nmol/l in the men and from 2.1 ± 0.2 to 4.5 ± 0.4 nmol/l in the women; both P ≤ 0.05).

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During menopause, a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels. This can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which are subsequently converted to testosterone and estrogens. It is possible that administering DHEA may increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women to alleviate their symptoms and improve general wellbeing and sexual function, including libido, dyspareunia, and satisfaction. Treatment with DHEA is controversial due to concerns about its effectiveness and safety. This review aims to clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in treating menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomized controlled trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

- **Search methods**: The databases searched on June 3, 2014, with no language restrictions, included the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS. Conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge were also searched. Ongoing trials were identified in trial registers, and reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

### Low neuroactive steroids identifies a biological subtype of depression in adults with human immunodeficiency virus on suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^112yGcP6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

High cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ratio is associated with high depressive symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy.

- **Volcano plots**: In the discovery (top; n = 55) and validation (bottom; n = 44) sets, volcano plots illustrate statistical significance of the fold change for neuroactive steroid metabolites (blue data points) and cortisol/steroid ratios (red data points) in participants with high versus low depressive symptoms.
- **Beeswarm plots**: Individual participant levels of cortisol (left panels), DHEA-S (middle panels), and cortisol/DHEA-S ratios (right panels) are shown in participants with low versus high depressive symptoms in the discovery (top panels) and validation (bottom panels) cohorts. DHEA-S levels are lower in participants with high versus low depressive symptoms, while cortisol levels are similar.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in healthy men with an age-related decline of dehydroepiandrosterone secretion [^11154z8y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Serum dehydroepiandrosterone declines with age. Whether this represents a harmful deficiency or an age-related adaptation is not known. Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement in adrenal insufficiency, a state of pathological loss of dehydroepiandrosterone production, improves well-being, mood, and sexuality. To determine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in healthy men with a physiological, age-related decline in serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, we conducted a double-blind cross-over study in 22 healthy male volunteers (age range, 50–69 years) with endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels below 4.1 micromol/liter (1500 ng/ml). Participants received 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone (50 mg/day) and 4 months of placebo treatment in random order, with a 1-month washout period.

Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment increased serum dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to concentrations usually found in young men. Circulating androgen levels did not change; however, androgen metabolites increased, indicating enhanced peripheral androgen synthesis. At baseline, psychometric assessment revealed normal well-being and sexuality scores. After 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone, no effect on sexuality was observed, whereas some mood scores improved slightly but were not significantly different from scores after placebo. Compared with placebo, dehydroepiandrosterone had no effect on serum lipids, bone markers, body composition, or exercise capacity. Thus, in contrast to previous findings in adrenal insufficiency, we found no obvious benefit of 4 months of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in healthy men experiencing an age-related decline in dehydroepiandrosterone secretion.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society disease state clinical review: Guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome — Part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive-aged women worldwide. This document, produced through collaboration between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES), aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It serves as a summary of best practices in 2015.

PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). There is general agreement among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological), and polycystic ovaries. A careful clinical assessment of a woman's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation is necessary, with emphasis on the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging.

Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should ideally be determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. The value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111GtxeD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Androgen excess is common in women and refers to clinical or biochemical evidence of elevated androgenic steroids, such as testosterone. It is primarily associated with underlying polycystic ovary syndrome. However, severe androgen excess is less common and may indicate the presence of underlying adrenal or ovarian neoplasms, genetic disorders, or severe insulin resistance syndromes. Currently, there are few consensus guidelines to assist clinicians with a standardized management approach for patients with severe androgen excess.

This clinical practice guideline has been developed with expertise from colleagues in endocrinology, gynecology, clinical biochemistry, and nursing. It also provides a unique patient perspective to guide clinicians.

The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to collate multi-disciplinary guidance for clinical practitioners in the investigation of severe androgen excess. Recommendations have been made in the areas of clinical assessment, biochemical workup, dynamic testing, and imaging, informed where possible by the best available evidence.

In conclusion, this guideline will provide guidance for clinicians in their approach to patients with severe androgen excess.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^112sFAMG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Androgen metabolism in women involves a complex interplay between the ovaries, adrenal glands, and peripheral tissues. In the classic androgen pathway, androgenic precursors such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as androstenedione (A4) are produced in large quantities by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex. DHEA can be inactivated to its sulfated ester, DHEAS, by the action of DHEA sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1), which requires 3ʹ‐phosphoadenosine‐5ʹ‐phosphosulfate (PAPS) for its catalytic activity. Mutations encoding the gene for PAPS synthase 2 (PAPSS2) are associated with impaired DHEA sulfation, resulting in a monogenic syndrome phenotypically similar to PCOS, featuring androgen excess and oligomenorrhoea. DHEAS circulates in the micromolar range and represents the most abundant steroid in human circulation; it may also be converted back to DHEA by the action of steroid sulfatase (STS), thereby releasing DHEA into the androgen pool for peripheral activation into more potent metabolites.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone treatment in the aging male — what should the urologist know [^116CfsQ7]. European urology (2005). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has attracted considerable attention as a means against the decrements of aging. This review summarizes clinical studies evaluating DHEA as a treatment option for age-related conditions and diseases.

- **Methods**: Literature search of PubMed-documented publications and abstracts from meetings.

- **Results**: The collected data indicate that DHEA supplementation to counteract its gradual decrease over age is beneficial. Positive effects on the cardiovascular system, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), the skin, the central nervous system (CNS), and the immune system have been reported. Improvement of sexual function by DHEA has been demonstrated.

- **Conclusion**: Although long-term clinical trials applying the standards of evidence-based methods are not available at present, the consistency of the data and the extensive practical experience may justify the use of DHEA in aging men. This is contingent upon the rules of classical endocrinology being thoroughly followed, including diagnosis based on the clinical picture and biochemical evidence, compliance with periodic evaluations, and individual dose adjustment to maintain serum concentrations in the physiological range of young males. Being one among other important hormonal factors, DHEA can delay and correct age-related disorders only to a certain degree.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115qspRY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is produced by the conjugation of sulfate to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), mediated by the enzyme sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1). Synthesis occurs almost exclusively in the adrenal gland. DHEAS is measured instead of DHEA in most clinical laboratories due to challenges with analyzing the latter. Although not androgenic, DHEAS is the major adrenally derived C19 steroid. Elevated DHEAS concentrations strongly suggest an adrenal source of androgen excess and are useful in the biochemical workup of an adrenal mass. DHEAS should be measured in all patients with clinical or other biochemical features of androgen excess. Across the UK, immunoassay is the most widely used methodology for DHEAS analysis. Most manufacturers currently display a positive bias when compared to LC‐MS/MS users, which has been attributed to issues with assay standardization and specificity. An important consideration when interpreting DHEAS results is that concentrations are not prone to diurnal variation, and there is no significant change throughout the menstrual cycle, although concentrations decline with advancing age.

- **Recommendations**: DHEAS measurement is an important adjunctive test when discriminating whether elevated active androgen concentrations are of adrenal or ovarian origin. DHEAS should be measured using a well-validated LC-MS/MS method, where possible. All results should be interpreted against evidence-based reference ranges. These should be categorized as either age-specific and/or pre- and postmenopausal.

### Should dehydroepiandrosterone be administered to women [^114k8LiV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Androgen prohormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) increase in early puberty, peak in the second and third decades, and thereafter decline, independent of menopausal status. Investigators have examined their potential beneficial effects in normal women and those with DHEA-deficient states.

A review of the literature from 1985 to 2021 explores the potential benefits and risks of androgen prohormones in women.

Studies have examined the potential benefit of DHEA therapy for anti-aging, sexual dysfunction, infertility, metabolic bone health, cognition, and wellbeing in hormone-deficient states such as primary adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and anorexia, as well as administration to normal women across the lifespan. Data support small benefits in quality of life and mood but not for anxiety or sexual function in women with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or anorexia. No consistent beneficial effects of DHEA administration have been observed for menopausal symptoms, sexual function, cognition, or overall wellbeing in normal women. Local administration of DHEA shows benefit in vulvovaginal atrophy. Use of DHEA to improve induction of ovulation response in women with diminished ovarian reserve is not recommended. Risks of high physiologic or pharmacologic use of DHEA include androgenic and estrogenic side effects, which are of concern for long-term administration.

A clinical case involves a 49-year-old woman with Addison's disease who is on low-dose estrogen with cyclic progesterone therapy for menopausal management.

### Screening for androgen deficiency in women: Methodological and interpretive issues [^116rjEEv]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To appreciate the problems in obtaining and interpreting androgen levels in women.

- **Design**: Review of the literature to compare various laboratories and methods of analysis of serum androgens.

- **Patient(s)**: Normal control populations culled from the literature to compare with patients previously reported on by us; data from our laboratory quality control compared with data from the literature.

- **Result(s)**: Investigators and laboratories disagree on the best methods of measuring testosterone (T) levels in women. Measuring DHEAS levels is much less controversial.

- **Conclusion(s)**: Serum T levels should be measured in the morning hours and during the middle third of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women. DHEAS levels may be measured at any time. Androgens decrease with age, but age-related levels are not accurate because control populations have never been screened for sexual dysfunction. Such control populations need to be obtained.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone status and efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation for bone health in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Uazdy]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). High credibility.

This study was designed to determine the status of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and to assess the efficacy of DHEA supplementation as a treatment for bone health in women with AN.

Studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from inception to February 14, 2022. Observational studies that compared serum DHEA levels between women with AN and healthy controls were included for meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of DHEA supplementation on bone mass were reviewed.

A meta-analysis of 15 cross-sectional studies revealed that patients with AN had significantly elevated serum DHEA levels (mean difference (MD) = 311.63 ng/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI), 78.01–545.25) and reduced DHEAS levels (MD = -24.90 μg/dl; 95% CI, -41.72 to -8.07) compared with healthy controls. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that DHEA monotherapy does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) compared with placebo after adjusting for weight gain. While the combination of DHEA and conjugated oral contraceptives has led to increased bone strength and decreased bone loss, the beneficial effect appears to be limited to older adolescents and adults with closed physes. Potential detrimental effects on BMD were identified in younger adolescents with open physes in one study.

Due to the lack of apparent benefit of DHEA in women with AN and its potential detrimental effect on BMD in young patients with AN, evidence does not support the use of DHEA as a treatment for bone health in this population.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men aged ≥ 50 years, particularly those with a body mass index > 25 kg/m^2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: A case-controlled observational study [^111fFGLw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Insufficient replacement of sex steroids has been suggested as a factor contributing to increased risk of morbidity and mortality in women with hypopituitarism. However, sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism have not been comprehensively mapped. In this case-controlled observational study of women with well-defined hypopituitarism and a population-based cohort of women as controls, sex hormone levels were assessed using a validated, high-sensitivity LC/MS-MS method. Irrespective of age, women with HH had lower levels of sex steroid precursors (DHEA, androstenedione) as well as androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) than controls, while there were fewer alterations in eugonadal women with hypopituitarism. Similar patterns were observed for progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estrone, and estradiol. Women with HH and ACTH deficiency had markedly lower levels of all sex hormones than those without ACTH deficiency.

This study is the first to present comprehensive sex steroid profiles measured by a highly sensitive mass spectrometry assay in women with varying severity of hypopituitarism. A study using column chromatography-preceded radioimmunoassay reported that mean serum DHEA sulphate, testosterone, as well as androstenedione levels were lower in women with both HH and ACTH deficiency compared with HH only, aligning with our findings. Additionally, this study reports that DHEA, DHT, progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estrone, and estradiol levels were very low in this patient group. Furthermore, sex steroid levels were addressed in younger and older women separately.

### A randomized trial of oral DHEA treatment for sexual function, well-being, and menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with low libido [^114yn5ey]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate DHEAS, which are the most abundant steroids in women, decline with age. We have shown an association between low sexual function and low circulating DHEAS levels in women.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the restoration of circulating DHEA levels in postmenopausal women to the levels seen in young individuals improves sexual function.

- **Methods**: Ninety-three postmenopausal women not using estrogen therapy were enrolled in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and received either DHEA 50 mg or placebo (PL) daily.

- **Main outcome measures**: Efficacy was assessed through 26 weeks. The main outcome measures were the change in total satisfying sexual events (SSE) and the change in the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale (SSS) total score. Secondary measures were the Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire (PGWB) and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL). Hormonal levels, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinical labs were evaluated over 52 weeks.

- **Results**: Eighty-five participants (91%) were included in the 26-week efficacy analysis. There were no significant differences between the DHEA and PL groups in the change in total SSE per month or the SSS, PGWB, and MENQOL change scores. Overall AE reports and the number of withdrawals as a result of AEs were similar in both groups; however, more women in the DHEA group experienced androgenic effects of acne and increased hair growth.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, treatment of postmenopausal women with DHEA did not significantly improve sexual function, well-being, or menopause-specific quality of life compared to placebo over a 26-week period.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^1152Aw9U]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

Our findings align with previous research indicating that a 50 mg/day dose of DHEA significantly elevates both testosterone and estradiol levels. A narrative review reported that supplementation with 50 mg of DHEA led to peak estradiol levels that may offer estrogenic benefits, such as improved bone health and protection against bone loss. These results are further supported by other meta-analyses that reported similar hormonal increases following DHEA supplementation.

Our review also observed a significant increase in testosterone levels with DHEA supplementation administered for ≥ 26 weeks. In line with this, the review conducted by Wierman et al. evaluated the effect of DHEA over a long period in older women and found that both estradiol and testosterone levels significantly increased. A prospective clinical trial found that 50 mg/day of DHEA led to a higher estradiol concentration and testosterone levels after 6 months of treatment. These findings highlight the dynamic, time-dependent hormonal response to DHEA supplementation.

Biochemically, DHEA serves as a precursor to both estrogens as well as androgens. Once converted to DHEA sulfate in the liver, it undergoes further enzymatic transformation in peripheral tissues, where it contributes to the synthesis of active estrogens as well as androgens, including estradiol and testosterone.

It is important to note that elevated levels of estradiol can have adverse effects, such as stimulating the endometrium. Consequently, prolonged high estradiol levels may increase the risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, it is crucial…

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114kXfbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**:
	1. **Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women**: Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB) and appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, though whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

	2. **Measurement accuracy**: Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion).

	3. **Clinical practice considerations**: Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate when liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays are not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion).

	4. **Research focus**: Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologic…

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111jUCQF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Virilising ovarian tumours (VOTs) are predominantly benign tumours that can present at any age, with 25% presenting postmenopausally. The prevalence of VOTs in postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism is around 2.7%. Approximately 5%–8% of ovarian tumours are hormonally active, and 1% secrete androgens. Androgen-secreting tumours derive from sex-cord and stromal cells of the ovary.

- **Classification of primary ovarian tumours**: Primary ovarian tumours can be grouped according to the WHO classification into epithelial and non-epithelial. Androgen-secreting tumours typically arise from sex-cord and stromal cells of the ovary.

- **Clinical algorithm for the investigation of androgen excess in women**: The diagnostic approach should be divided into routine or urgent pathways based on the presence or absence of a number of central clinical and biochemical factors. Baseline biochemical workup includes FSH, LH, oestradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, androstenedione, sex hormone-binding globulin, and prolactin. FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinising hormone), OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test), ONDST (overnight dexamethasone suppression test), PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), PET (positron emission tomography), UFC (urinary free cortisol).

Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumours (SLCT) are the most common type in premenopausal women, whereas Leydig cell tumours (LCT) are the most common pathology after menopause. Granulosa cell tumours account for 70% of cases.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^11142odu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

In humans and other mammals, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a vital prohormone primarily produced by the adrenal glands. It serves as a precursor to biologically active androgens and estrogens. After being synthesized in the adrenal cortex, DHEA is taken up by various tissues, including the liver, gonads, kidneys, and brain, where it is metabolized into different steroid hormones depending on the specific tissue context. In the bloodstream, DHEA is largely converted into its sulfated form, DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), which circulates at much higher concentrations and can be further metabolized into active sex hormones as needed.

DHEA levels decline significantly with age, decreasing by approximately 70% between the ages of 20 and 60, primarily due to reduced adrenal production. DHEA supplementation has been explored as an adjunct therapy for postmenopausal women, alongside hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and has demonstrated potential benefits in improving metabolic and endocrine function, as well as sexual health. DHEA exerts androgenic, estrogenic, and steroidal effects and has been associated with various biological functions, including antioxidant properties, neuroprotection, and anticancer activity. Supplementation may help maintain hormonal balance, enhance mood, support brain function, and potentially mitigate age-related decline.

Estradiol, the most potent female sex hormone, fluctuates throughout a woman's life and menstrual cycle. It plays a critical role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis by modulating the secretion of gonadotropins.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: A case-controlled observational study [^113fL3UG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Women with hypopituitarism remain at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Insufficient replacement of sex steroids has been suggested as a contributing factor, but sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism have not been comprehensively mapped.

- **Objective**: To quantify sex steroids in women with hypopituitarism by a high-sensitivity assay.

- **Methods**: Using a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria, women with hypopituitarism (n = 104) who started GH replacement between 1995 and 2014 at a single center were categorized as eugonadal or having hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). A population-based cohort of women (n = 288) served as controls. Eugonadal women and controls were categorized as pre-/postmenopausal, and HH women as younger/older (≤ or > 52 years). Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estradiol, and estrone were analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay.

- **Results**: Among both premenopausal/younger and postmenopausal/older women, women with HH had lower levels of sex steroid precursors (DHEA, androstenedione) as well as androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) than controls. Progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, estrone, and estradiol showed similar patterns. Women with HH and ACTH deficiency had markedly lower concentrations of all sex hormones than those without ACTH deficiency.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates for the first time a broad and severe sex steroid deficiency in both younger and older women with HH, particularly in those with ACTH deficiency.
