## Question

When to get breast ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to get a breast ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how age, pregnancy, and risk status change the first-line modality. Then, I should verify the role of ultrasound for palpable masses across ages. Next, I will examine supplemental screening in dense breasts and reconcile conflicting evidence. After that, I need to check indications for symptomatic presentations like nipple discharge and axillary nodes. I will then review interventional guidance and staging scenarios. Finally, I should confirm what to avoid, how to document and interpret results, and how to integrate shared decision-making and follow-up pathways.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: ultrasound is not a replacement for screening mammography in average-risk women, and its use should be tailored to clinical context, age, pregnancy/lactation, breast density, and risk profile, with mammography remaining the foundation for screening in women aged 40–74 years [^111w79wY] [^111A6rZF] [^116Efq2G].

> For women under 30 years old with a palpable mass, I should confirm that ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality because of high sensitivity, lack of ionizing radiation, and the predominance of benign disease in this group; mammography is generally deferred unless ultrasound is suspicious or the patient is high risk, in which case diagnostic mammography can be added [^111WuyUU] [^115JBhqQ] [^1166Cd8r].

> For women aged 30–39 with a palpable mass, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography can be used first based on institutional preference and clinical suspicion, with the other modality often added to complete the evaluation, and ultrasound remains highly sensitive in this age range [^111WuyUU] [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g].

> For women aged 40 and older with a palpable mass, I should double-check that diagnostic mammography is the appropriate initial study, with targeted ultrasound typically performed concurrently or immediately afterward to characterize the palpable finding and guide management; ultrasound helps distinguish solid from cystic lesions and directs biopsy if needed [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^1166Cd8r].

> In pregnancy and lactation, I need to ensure ultrasound is the initial modality of choice for any breast symptom because it avoids radiation; mammography can be performed with shielding if necessary when ultrasound is suspicious or inconclusive, and MRI is generally avoided in pregnancy due to gadolinium concerns, though it may be considered postpartum if needed [^116FrVZs] [^1166Cd8r].

> Next, I should review supplemental screening in dense breasts. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit and harms: multiple studies and meta-analyses show that adding ultrasound to mammography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection by roughly 2–7 per 1000 screens but also increases false positives and biopsies; importantly, the J-START randomized trial showed more cancers detected and fewer interval cancers with the combination, though mortality benefit remains unproven [^1134JE64] [^113yzUWQ] [^112Ay1Zb].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions because they differ: the USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend routine supplemental ultrasound for dense breasts, whereas ACR Appropriateness Criteria allow consideration of ultrasound in dense-breasted women after shared decision-making about benefits and harms; EUSOBI notes possible use in average or intermediate risk with dense breasts, and European guidelines suggest MRI for extremely dense breasts when available, with ultrasound as an alternative when MRI is not feasible [^111w79wY] [^116Efq2G] [^112Ay1Zb] [^113h9Q8y].

> I will now examine symptomatic presentations beyond a palpable mass. For pathologic nipple discharge, I should confirm that imaging is indicated and that ultrasound is typically added to mammography/DBT, with ultrasound often first in women under 30; MRI or ductography are reserved for negative standard evaluations when suspicion persists [^1155BXy7] [^1137uwkK].

> For axillary lymphadenopathy or suspected regional nodal disease, let me think about staging: ultrasound of the axilla and nodal basins is recommended in newly diagnosed breast cancer or when nodes are palpable or suspicious, and ultrasound-guided core biopsy of abnormal nodes is standard to establish pathologic nodal status before surgery [^1166Cd8r] [^112LzfpM] [^115xRcbQ].

> For interventional guidance, I should confirm that ultrasound is the preferred modality when the target is visible sonographically because it offers real-time visualization, patient comfort, and efficiency; core needle biopsy is preferred over FNA for tissue diagnosis, and clip placement facilitates localization and concordance assessment [^113BYtRo] [^112UXWpG] [^116hc5N9].

> But wait, what if the lesion is only seen on mammography or MRI? In that case, stereotactic or MRI-guided biopsy is indicated, and I need to ensure radiologic–pathologic concordance and plan surgical management accordingly; ultrasound should not be used as a substitute when the lesion is not sonographically visible [^116hc5N9] [^111QHNQk].

> I should confirm scenarios where ultrasound aids staging and treatment planning. In patients who cannot undergo MRI, whole-breast ultrasound can be used for locoregional staging, including evaluation of the contralateral breast and nodal basins, and for treatment planning such as radiation fields; however, ultrasound alone should not replace sentinel lymph node biopsy for axillary staging [^115xRcbQ] [^115WrqQL].

> Let me consider what to avoid. Ultrasound should not be used as a stand-alone screening tool in average-risk women because of lower sensitivity for some cancers, operator dependence, and high false-positive rates; it is also inappropriate to order ultrasound without a clinical indication, and self-referral for screening without a physician order is discouraged [^1158zPN7] [^111vL4sZ].

> Next, I should review documentation and interpretation standards. I need to ensure studies are performed with high-frequency linear transducers, images are archived with laterality and measurements, and reports use BI-RADS lexicon; operators should be credentialed, and facilities should monitor image quality and maintain competency through CME and case volumes [^115ciLZB] [^113VDECy] [^114NdCWB].

> For follow-up and management, I should double-check that BI-RADS 3 lesions on ultrasound generally warrant short-interval follow-up rather than immediate biopsy, whereas BI-RADS 4 or 5 lesions require tissue diagnosis; shared decision-making is essential when discussing supplemental ultrasound in dense breasts, balancing modest gains in detection against increased callbacks and biopsies [^116693r4] [^113go1Zn] [^111w79wY].

> In summary, I need to ensure my algorithm remains context-specific: use ultrasound first for palpable masses in women under 30, consider ultrasound first or in combination for ages 30–39, and pair diagnostic mammography with ultrasound for women 40 and older; deploy ultrasound for pregnancy/lactation symptoms, for targeted problem-solving of mammographic or MRI findings, for axillary assessment and biopsy, for interventional guidance, and selectively for supplemental screening in dense-breasted women after counseling about benefits and harms; avoid using ultrasound as a sole screening test in average-risk women and adhere to quality, documentation, and BI-RADS standards throughout [^111WuyUU] [^115JBhqQ] [^1166Cd8r] [^111w79wY] [^115ciLZB].

Breast ultrasound is indicated for **symptomatic evaluation** of palpable masses, focal pain, nipple discharge, or skin changes, especially in women under 40, pregnant or lactating patients, and those with dense breasts [^111WuyUU] [^1166Cd8r]. It is also used to **characterize abnormalities** found on mammography or MRI, guide biopsies, and assess implants or axillary nodes [^1166Cd8r] [^113BYtRo]. Ultrasound is not recommended as a standalone screening tool for average-risk women, but may be considered as supplemental screening for high-risk patients who cannot undergo MRI or for women with dense breasts after shared decision-making, given increased false positives and biopsy rates [^111w79wY] [^113tvLSq] [^1134JE64].

---

## Indications for breast ultrasound

### Symptomatic evaluation

- **Palpable masses**: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging for palpable masses in women under 30, pregnant or lactating patients, and those with dense breasts, as it effectively differentiates solid from cystic lesions and guides management [^111WuyUU] [^1166Cd8r].

- **Focal breast pain**: Ultrasound can identify underlying masses or cysts in patients with localized, persistent pain [^113vqr4K].

- **Nipple discharge**: Ultrasound is indicated for pathologic nipple discharge (bloody, spontaneous, single duct) to evaluate for intraductal papillomas or malignancy [^1155BXy7].

- **Skin changes**: Ultrasound can assess skin thickening, retraction, or dimpling, which may indicate underlying malignancy or inflammatory conditions [^113vqr4K].

---

### Characterization of abnormalities

Ultrasound is used to **characterize masses or asymmetries** detected on mammography or MRI, helping distinguish benign from malignant lesions and guiding biopsy decisions [^1166Cd8r]. It is also the preferred modality for **evaluating breast implants** to detect rupture, leakage, or capsular contracture [^1166Cd8r].

---

### Guidance for interventions

Ultrasound provides **real-time guidance** for biopsies, aspirations, and preoperative wire localizations, improving accuracy and reducing patient discomfort [^113BYtRo] [^112UXWpG].

---

### Axillary assessment

Ultrasound is used to **evaluate axillary lymph nodes** in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer or suspicious clinical findings, aiding staging and surgical planning [^1166Cd8r] [^115xRcbQ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False positives**: Ultrasound can detect benign lesions that may lead to unnecessary biopsies and anxiety, particularly in screening contexts [^1134JE64] [^117AhdTb].

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with operator expertise, emphasizing the need for experienced radiologists and standardized protocols [^111UKVJK] [^114yz44f].

- **Not for calcifications**: Ultrasound is less sensitive than mammography for detecting microcalcifications, which are often indicative of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) [^117AhdTb].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging** |
|-|-|
| Palpable mass in women < 30 years | Ultrasound first [^111WuyUU] [^115JBhqQ] |
| Palpable mass in women ≥ 40 years | Diagnostic mammography first, then ultrasound [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] |
| Pregnant or lactating patients | Ultrasound first [^1166Cd8r] [^116FrVZs] |
| Dense breasts (screening) | Consider supplemental ultrasound after shared decision-making [^111w79wY] [^113tvLSq] |
| High-risk patients (MRI contraindicated) | Consider supplemental ultrasound [^113tvLSq] [^116thJpK] |
| Abnormal mammogram or MRI | Ultrasound for further characterization [^1166Cd8r] [^1158zPN7] |
| Suspected implant complications | Ultrasound first [^1166Cd8r] |

---

Breast ultrasound is a **versatile, noninvasive tool** for evaluating symptoms, characterizing abnormalities, and guiding interventions, with its use tailored to patient age, clinical presentation, and breast density. It is not a standalone screening method for average-risk women but has a valuable role in specific scenarios, including dense breasts and high-risk patients who cannot undergo MRI.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of a diagnostic breast ultrasound examination [^114NdCWB]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

Personnel qualifications — physicians supervising, performing, and/or interpreting breast ultrasound examinations should be licensed medical practitioners with a thorough understanding of indications and of the basic physical principles and limitations of ultrasound imaging; they should be familiar with alternative and complementary imaging and capable of correlating those results with sonographic findings, and have a thorough understanding of ultrasound technology and instrumentation, ultrasound power output, equipment calibration, and safety. Physicians responsible for breast ultrasound examinations should demonstrate knowledge of breast anatomy, physiology, and pathology, provide evidence of training and competence, and the initial qualifications as outlined in the Breast Ultrasound Accreditation Program Requirements provide this foundation; real-time performance and interpretation of diagnostic breast ultrasound are preferred, if possible, and remote supervision and interpretation by a qualified radiologist can be performed in specific situations in which patients would otherwise not have access to diagnostic imaging. For maintenance of competence, the physician should perform a sufficient number of procedures and continued competence should depend on participation in a quality control program; continuing medical education should be in accordance with the ACR Practice Parameter for Continuing Medical Education (CME) and should include CME in ultrasonography as appropriate.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of whole-breast ultrasound for screening and staging [^1111VhdT]. ACR (2024). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — scope and use for whole-breast ultrasound emphasizes that this is an educational tool to assist care rather than a legal mandate, stating that it is designed to assist practitioners, that practice parameters are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice, and that ultimate judgment rests with the practitioner; an approach differing from this guidance alone does not imply care below standard, and practitioners should follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, resources, and patient needs. The introduction states this parameter assists practitioners performing ultrasound examination of an entire breast, and when ultrasound is used in a focused manner or for interventional guidance, related American College of Radiology (ACR) practice parameters should be consulted, specifically the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of a Diagnostic Breast Ultrasound Examination and the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Breast Interventional Procedures.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^116ZHjXw]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a safe and widely available method for breast imaging. It is the method of choice when assessing young women (under age 40) with a palpable lump and a complementary method after mammography in older women with a palpable lump. Breast cancer screening with breast US alone is discouraged, while supplemental screening with US may be an option to be considered for women with dense breasts, even though associated with a high false positive rate. When a tissue diagnosis is needed for a suspicious lesion, US-guided biopsy should be preferred if the lesion is clearly identified with this method.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^117PDYsC]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

No. If breast US is not indicated and is performed, for example for screening in very young women at average risk for breast cancer, there is a non-negligible chance of false positive findings which could require unnecessary further work-up including needle biopsy or additional imaging procedures, causing anxiety to the woman and costs to the health care system. In addition, women should not forget that if US is used as a stand-alone screening tool instead of mammography, cancers could be missed, especially in fatty breasts.
5 After receiving the result of a breast handheld US, can women try to get a reliable second opinion on the test?

This possibility is limited by important technical reasons. If the original examiner missed a lesion, no documentation exists of this. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, the only way to get a real second opinion is for the breast US examination to be repeated by another examiner. This underlines the importance of selecting quality-assured/certified breast imaging centres for the original breast US examination. Notably, this is not true for mammography, which can be read by a second radiologist without it being necessary to repeat the test, (with only few exceptions due to technical deficits of the original mammogram).

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^111KUDTm]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Breast ultrasound (US) is one of the four main methods for diagnosing breast diseases, together with mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and image-guided needle biopsy.

This article is the third in a series of recommendations for information for women issued by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI), the first focusing on mammography and the second on breast MRI. It is addressed to the women themselves and to physicians dealing with patients for whom breast US is, or may be, under consideration. In particular, seven special information notes (from A to G) and five frequently asked questions are formulated for use in direct communication with women. Considering the relevant differences across European countries in terms of available technology, national guidelines, clinical practices, health care systems, and insurance coverage, these recommendations can have different applications under local conditions.

A search on the PubMed/Medline has been performed for papers published from January 2007 to December 2016, subsequently updated to December 2017, using the terms "breast" AND "ultrasound". Articles with an informative content most suitable for the aim of the article were selected as references with special regard to predetermined issues: safety/quality; protocols and techniques; test performance (sensitivity and specificity); screening and clinical indications. Other articles were added as references as suggested by the authors.

The entire text underwent a double evaluation by the authors, each of them contributing with relevant intellectual content. However, as many different issues are considered, single authors generally agreeing on these recommendations may have different opinions on individual statements.

### Imaging management of palpable breast abnormalities [^1139EuZJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Women commonly present to imaging departments with a palpable breast abnormality. However, widespread confusion remains regarding the most appropriate sequence and extent of imaging required. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evidence informing current management guidelines for the care of patients with palpable breast abnormalities.

Conclusion

Ultrasound is a highly effective imaging tool for guiding effective evaluation of women with palpable breast abnormalities and should be used for all women with suspicious findings at clinical breast examination. The exception is cases in which mammography shows a clearly benign correlate or a normal, fatty area of breast tissue in the location of the palpable finding. Breast ultrasound should be the primary imaging tool for women with palpable lumps who are pregnant, lactating, or younger than 30 years. For women 40 years old and older, mammography, followed in most cases by ultrasound, is recommended. For women 30–39 years old, ultrasound or mammography may be performed first at the discretion of the radiologist or referring provider. There is little to no role for breast MRI or other advanced imaging technologies in the routine diagnostic evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities.

### Updates in breast ultrasound [^115Sz2DG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is becoming an indispensable tool for the surgeon in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of breast problems. Hands-on ultrasound education for surgeons and the ongoing improvements in imaging technology have made surgeon-performed breast ultrasound an effective method of identifying and diagnosing breast lesions and have increased the surgeon's ability to perform ultrasound-guided interventional procedures. This article reviews the current state of surgeon-performed breast ultrasound.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of a diagnostic breast ultrasound examination [^111vL4sZ]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

ACR diagnostic breast ultrasound — documentation and requisition requirements specify that documentation that satisfies medical necessity includes 1) signs and symptoms and/or 2) relevant history (including known diagnoses). The request for the examination must be originated by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider, and the accompanying clinical information should be provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed health care provider familiar with the patient's clinical problem or question and consistent with the state's scope of practice requirements.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of whole-breast ultrasound for screening and staging [^1111bPuV]. ACR (2024). High credibility.

ACR practice parameter — practice considerations for whole-breast ultrasound screening emphasize that prior to beginning a whole-breast ultrasound screening examination, careful note should be taken of any clinical signs, symptoms, or previously identified abnormalities, and if any of these exist, a diagnostic examination is appropriate and should be recommended, with the report noting when screening occurs in a patient who needs diagnostic breast imaging and including recommendation for appropriate diagnostic imaging. Whole-breast ultrasound should be interpreted in the context of mammography if performed, recent mammographic images should be available to the interpreting physician, older mammograms can be useful, and if whole-breast ultrasound has been performed previously, the current examination should be compared with prior studies. Interpretation of whole-breast ultrasound performed as a screening examination should focus on identifying any findings that merit diagnostic evaluation, and patients with indeterminate findings should receive an ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System® (BI-RADS®) assessment of Incomplete: Need Additional Imaging Evaluation (BI-RADS Category 0) and be recalled for diagnostic imaging. For documentation of handheld whole-breast ultrasound, negative images should be annotated with breast side, location, and transducer orientation, and single images of each quadrant as well as one image of the retroareolar region are sufficient for documentation. Images of specific findings during handheld whole-breast ultrasound should be obtained in two projections, preferably orthogonal, labeled with laterality, clock-face location, distance from the nipple, and transducer orientation, using clock-face rather than quadrant notation for specific findings, and distance from the nipple should be measured from the nipple itself rather than the areolar edge. Variability in tissue composition encountered on ultrasound mirrors mammographic density variation and may affect conspicuity, and for this reason, tissue composition should be reported for supplemental screening ultrasound examinations. Patients may undergo screening whole-breast ultrasound and subsequent diagnostic breast imaging on the same date, and each examination should receive its own assessment, although a single report may be generated with an overall assessment and management recommendations for the combined examinations.

Acr practice parameter — preamble — clarifies that the document is an educational tool and not a legal standard; clinical judgment remains paramount and adherence does not guarantee outcomes. It states that practice parameters "are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended… to establish a legal standard of care", that the ultimate judgment rests with the practitioner considering all circumstances, and that following guidance will not assure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome; instead, practitioners should follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, available resources, and patient needs.

### Enhancing your acoustics: ultrasound image optimization of breast lesions [^113enGsC]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A general understanding of ultrasound physics relative to image optimization is essential when performing breast ultrasound examinations and in accurately interpreting images of the breast. Appropriate technique is crucial to achieve accurate lesion characterization and is emphasized in the second edition of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System for ultrasound (2013). This pictorial essay reviews clinically relevant ultrasound physics to best characterize breast lesions for guiding the clinician to the proper diagnosis. Differences in chosen parameters on ultrasound imaging can create variability in the appearance of breast lesions.

### Screening breast ultrasound: past, present, and future [^112QpBFk]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. This article discusses breast ultrasound for the detection of breast cancer in the screening environment, as well as strategies for integrating screening breast ultrasound, including automated breast ultrasound. CONCLUSION. Breast density is an increasingly pertinent issue in breast cancer diagnosis. Breast density results in a decrease in the sensitivity of mammography for cancer detection, with a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer. Ultrasound detects additional cancers.

Indications for breast US

Definite, possible, and inappropriate indications for breast US are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the following paragraphs we will enter into the details for those indications being most clinically relevant or debated.

Definite indications for breast ultrasound

Table 2
Possible indications for breast ultrasound

Table 3
Inappropriate indications for breast ultrasound

Screening

In high-risk women who cannot undergo screening with MRI, US is indicated in very young women under about 30–35 years of age and as an adjunct to mammography in older women. Of note, in BRCA mutation carriers, evidence of higher sensitivity to radiation exposure of the breast tissue suggests avoiding mammography, at least at young age.

In women at average or intermediate risk with dense breasts, supplemental screening with either handheld or automated bilateral breast US can be performed after a negative mammogram to increase cancer detection, albeit at the price of a high false positive recall rate. Additionally, invasive cancers detected by US, which tend to be small and node negative, are thus more likely to be treated with curative intent. Taking into consideration that interval cancers are those diagnosed in the time interval between two scheduled screening examinations, the addition of US screening to mammography in women with dense breasts has been shown in one study to reduce the interval cancer rate to a level similar to that observed in women with non-dense breasts screened with mammography only. These results support implementation of research in randomised controlled trials on additional US in women with increased breast tissue density. A systematic review published in 2009 reported that supplemental breast US screening after negative mammography in women with American College of Radiology (ACR) density 2–4 allowed a cancer detection rate of 0.32% (mean size 9.9 mm, negative nodal status), most cancers being detected in women with ACR density 3 or 4, with biopsy rates from 2.3% to 4.7% and a PPV from 8.4% to 13.7%, about one third of the PPV of mammography.

### Breast ultrasound [^114mwK6C]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is second in importance only to mammography in the evaluation of breast abnormalities. The ability of US to diagnose benign simple cysts accurately has spared innumerable women from needless biopsies and aspirations. When a suspicious solid abnormality is detected by ultrasound, it readily provides convenient, inexpensive, accurate imaging guidance for interventional procedures. Future studies of US as a screening tool must weigh potential benefits against the potential risks because of increased biopsies performed for false-positive results.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous breast biopsy [^111kGQsE]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous tissue sampling of the breast has positively altered the management of breast lesions, both benign and malignant, since its inception in the 1980s and subsequent widespread acceptance in the 1990s. Its safety, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness have been validated in several studies. However, percutaneous biopsy serves a patient best when performed by an operator with full awareness of patient׳s salient imaging findings; a knowledge of the benefits, limitations, and technical requirements of breast ultrasound; and a thorough understanding of what constitutes an adequate and concordant pathologic specimen. This article outlines a general approach to ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous breast biopsy and discusses indications, potential complications, and technical aspects of the procedure.

Examination protocol and technical issues

Clear instructions and explanations regarding the entire procedure should be provided to the woman. The optimal protocol for performing breast US requires the patient to lie in the supine position with the chest undressed and with arms flexed behind the head to flatten the breast or in the oblique position for scanning the lateral part of the breast and, when needed, axilla. Breast US can even be performed in women who cannot lie down or flex the arms behind the head, although in these conditions it becomes more difficult to perform the examination and the results might be suboptimal.

A clinical US scanner with dedicated linear probes working from 10 to 15–18 MHz for the superficial details or small breasts, and from 4 to 8 MHz for deeper areas or very large breasts, should be employed. A contact gel is always applied to the breast to allow the US waves to be sent from the probe to the breast tissues. The probe is placed on the breast and moved in multiple directions, with a gentle pressure that makes US usually painless and well tolerated.

Importantly, for many indications, breast US is aimed at evaluating specific clinical findings or findings detected through other imaging modalities. In many cases, only a unilateral, targeted breast US examination is performed and not a bilateral whole breast US. Thus, whether both breasts, only one breast or just a part of one breast will be scanned depends on the indication, mammographic breast density, and local policies. The axilla will be scanned in women with clinical or radiological abnormalities, in women with personal history of breast cancer, and whenever the radiologist evaluates this to be useful. Of note, routine axillary scanning during screening breast US after negative mammography showed no effect on additional cancer detection but increased the number of false-positive results. If suspicious nodes are seen in the axilla, other nearby lymph node stations (i.e. supra- or infra-clavicular locations, in the neck or below the clavicle) may be examined.
Note B. Follow carefully the instructions of the radiologists during the breast US examination. She/he will ask you to move your trunk or your arms to get the best position for scanning each of your breasts. Your cooperation is needed to get the best diagnostic performance and reduce the examination time. A certain pressure of the probe on your breast is necessary to avoid artefacts, i.e. unwanted alterations of the images possibly reducing the diagnostic power of the examination. If the pressure is uncomfortable, please tell the examiner immediately.

General issues, safety, and quality

Ultrasound is an imaging method based on the application of sound waves, i.e. not radiation but mechanical periodic compression/rarefaction waves of a medium, for producing images of the internal body structures. In particular, this method uses sound waves with frequencies above the upper limit of human hearing (limited from 16 Hz to 20 kHz), indeed defined as ultrasound, in particular frequencies of at least 1 MHz, able to penetrate biologic tissues. Images are obtained by sending pulses of US waves into the tissues using a probe, which is a transducer that can transmit and receive US. Gel, which is used as a propagation medium, is interposed between the US probe and the skin of the region to be examined. These waves are variably reflected as echoes by the tissues, from which comes the denomination of echography, other equivalent denominations being sonography or ultrasonography. Reflected echoes are received by the probe and forwarded as electronic signals to a computer system that finally generates the images.

Importantly, US is a technique that does not expose the woman to radiation and its related risks. The US waves used for medical imaging do not cause injury to human tissues, allowing a very safe diagnostic approach. There are no contraindications to breast US. Practical difficulties can be encountered in women with severe disabilities preventing the correct positioning or in obese women due to limited penetration depth. The cost of breast US is comparable to that of mammography and much lower than that of breast MRI, although the time spent by the physician performing the examination is usually not (or only scarcely) included in the reimbursement evaluation.

Assurance of the technical quality of US equipment should follow specific protocols. As a general suggestion, women should be aware that US equipment older than 10 years may not yield state-of-the-art examination results.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of a diagnostic breast ultrasound examination [^115ciLZB]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

Equipment specifications — diagnostic breast ultrasound (US) performance includes that equipment performance monitoring should be in accordance with the ACR–AAPM Technical Standard for Diagnostic Medical Physics Performance Monitoring of Real Time Ultrasound Equipment. Breast ultrasound should be performed with a high-resolution, real-time, linear-array, broad-bandwidth transducer operating at a center frequency of at least 12 MHz, but preferably higher. Other transducers may be utilized in special circumstances. Focal zones should be electronically adjustable. In general, the highest frequency capable of adequate penetration to the depth of interest should be used. For evaluating superficial lesions, scanning through a thin standoff device or thick layer of gel may be helpful in offsetting the transducer face from the uppermost layer of skin to bring it into the focal zone of the transducer.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^117AhdTb]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Notably, breast US also detects a variety of non-palpable benign lesions, which are very common in the breast but may otherwise have gone unnoticed, sometimes requiring needle biopsy, showing their benignancy (false positives). This is one of the major drawbacks of the use of breast US as a screening tool. A systematic review of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts reported very low positive predictive value of both handheld and automated breast US (from 3.2 to 7.5%) and a biopsy rate as high as about 6%.

Invasive cancers not visible or not detected on US are in general either very small, behind the nipple or lesions which are difficult to distinguish from normal gland or fat tissue or from fibrocystic changes, such as invasive lobular cancers, accounting for up to 15% of all breast cancers. US may also miss microinvasive cancers and diffusely growing cancers. Accordingly, suspicious findings at clinical examination, mammography, or MRI should not be dismissed because of a normal US, even when US has been targeted to the region thought to harbour the finding. Moreover, US is less sensitive than mammography for non-invasive breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) commonly detected at mammography due to the presence of calcifications.
Note D. When both mammography and breast US are requested, US should be performed after mammography. The best scenario is that both mammography and US are evaluated at the same time from the same radiologist providing a unique conclusion from the two examinations. Your radiologist may recommend an adjunct US if you have very dense breasts and a negative mammogram, also taking into account other risk factors. If you feel a palpable lump, US may be the first-line examination used, especially before 40 years of age.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^111UKVJK]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

When using the most common modality of US image generation (i.e. with the probe manually moved on the body surface of a patient — handheld, also called manual, US), the diagnostic performance of breast US is dramatically influenced by the specific competence and experience of the operator. As a consequence, handheld US of the breast should only be carried out by specially trained and experienced physicians, preferentially a breast radiologist. In fact, in the vast majority of European countries, handheld breast US is performed by physicians, not by radiographers or so-called "sonographers". Of note, although automated three-dimensional whole-breast US systems can be used by radiographers for generating three-dimensional US datasets, the interpretation of the images always requires the experience of an expert in handheld breast US to keep false positive and false negative calls as low as possible. In the case of suspicious findings with automated breast US, handheld US should be performed to confirm the finding and make a clinical decision.

During handheld breast US, the physician chooses images to capture and makes them available with the report. In fact, unlike other breast imaging methods such as mammography or MRI, the vast majority of the handheld US examination is not recorded. Of note, many experienced breast radiologists use breast US for targeted investigations of areas of concern, documenting abnormalities that she/he has noticed during the scanning process. When a whole breast handheld examination is performed, at least one image of normal findings for each quadrant and for the retroareolar region, optionally for the axilla, should be documented. Notably, if an examiner overlooks an abnormality during the US examination, that abnormality will not be available for later reviews of that US examination. This, in turn, means that quality assurance for handheld breast US is more challenging than it is for other breast imaging methods, due to a higher proportion of human variability in determining the diagnostic result: handheld breast US is highly operator-dependent. Third parties cannot review a previous study with the only exception of those findings identified and documented with images by the original examiner. However, this is not true for automated whole breast US, a standardised approach, where the whole examination is recorded, even though this technique suffers from other specific limitations (see below).

### "I can see clearly now". fundamentals of breast ultrasound optimization [^114yz44f]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Unlike other modalities in breast imaging, breast ultrasound is very operator dependent. Proper characterization and management of breast lesions depends on the knowledge and skill of the radiologist performing the exam. Breast ultrasound optimization continues to evolve as the technology of ultrasound machines improves. The American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program requirements for graduate medical education in diagnostic radiology recently updated requirements to include competency in ultrasound physics, knobology, and image generation. As trainees are held to high ultrasound optimization standards, practicing radiologists who perform breast ultrasound exams must keep up to date on current breast ultrasound optimization techniques to avoid mischaracterizing and mismanaging breast ultrasound findings. In this paper, ultrasound optimization techniques, including patient positioning, transducer frequency, transducer contact and pressure, depth, gain, focus, tissue harmonic imaging, spatial compounding, dynamic range, speed of sound imaging, Doppler evaluation, and elastography will be described. Multiple ultrasound case examples will be used to illustrate application of these skills. After reading this paper, the reader will be able to apply these techniques to their own breast ultrasound practice, improving characterization and management of breast lesions in their patients.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of a diagnostic breast ultrasound examination [^113VDECy]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

Documentation for diagnostic breast ultrasound — recording and reporting requirements specifies that reporting should be in accordance with the ACR Practice Parameter for Communication of Diagnostic Imaging Findings, images of all important findings should be recorded in a retrievable and reviewable image storage format, and documentation of a negative handheld or automated whole-breast ultrasound examination is recommended. Adequate documentation is essential, with a permanent record of the ultrasound examination and its interpretation, and comparison with prior relevant imaging studies may be helpful. Images of all appropriate areas, both normal and abnormal, should be recorded and lesions denoted as abnormal should generally be measured; the initials of the operator should be accessible on the images or electronically on PACS. An official interpretation (final report) should be included in the patient's medical record, and it is recommended that the report include a description of the area scanned. Retention of ultrasound examination images should be based on clinical need and relevant legal and local health care facility requirements.

### Current uses of ultrasound in the evaluation of the breast [^114fgTK6]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is an important imaging modality in evaluating the breast. One of the most common uses of ultrasound is to help distinguish benign from malignant breast disease, primarily with gray-scale ultrasound but also with Doppler ultrasound. Another common use is to provide guidance for interventional procedures. Less common uses include assisting in staging of breast cancer and evaluating patients with implants. Recently there has been an interest in using ultrasound to screen asymptomatic women for breast cancer, as is done with mammography. Further studies must be performed to assess if this reduces mortality from breast cancer. Although primarily used to image the female breast, ultrasound also can be used to evaluate breast-related concerns in men. Uses of contrast-enhanced ultrasound are still experimental and would add an invasive component to an otherwise noninvasive study.

### Evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities [^111WuyUU]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

A palpable breast abnormality is one of the most common presenting clinical breast complaints. Although the majority of palpable abnormalities are benign, they are among the most common presenting symptoms of breast cancer, and those breast cancers detected symptomatically tend to have poorer prognosis than their screen-detected counterparts. Clinical breast examination is a vital part of the workup of palpable abnormalities. However, as physical exam features of most masses are not reliable for categorization of malignancy, imaging evaluation is necessary. Choice of imaging modality, which includes diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasound, is dependent upon patient age. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for evaluation of palpable masses in women younger than 30 years of age because of its high negative predictive value and sensitivity and lack of ionizing radiation. For women aged 30–39 years, ultrasound or mammography can be performed as the initial imaging evaluation, with ultrasound maintaining a high sensitivity in women younger than 40 years old. Mammography, often followed by ultrasound, is the recommended imaging evaluation sequence for women aged 40 and older. Utilization of advanced imaging modalities for evaluation of the palpable area of concern is not supported by evidence.

### Ultrasound guided core breast biopsies [^113BYtRo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Core needle biopsies are common procedures performed in breast imaging centers. Utilizing ultrasound guidance for biopsy of suspicious findings within the breast and axilla is the standard of care when lesions are visible on ultrasound. Most ultrasound guided breast biopsies are performed by radiologists interpreting breast imaging who correlate findings across modalities including mammography, ultrasound and breast MRI, however interventional radiologists may perform in some practice settings. Appropriate knowledge of complete breast imaging is important not only for localization, but for determining radiologic-pathologic concordance. Proper localization, technique, and post biopsy management are essential to the success of the procedure and providing proper care for patients. This article discusses indications, strategies for accurate targeting, how-to biopsy techniques, post biopsy considerations and radiologic-pathologic concordance incorporating recommendations from the American College of Radiology Practice Parameter for the Performance of Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Breast Interventional procedures.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of whole-breast ultrasound for screening and staging [^1116cs4d]. ACR (2024). High credibility.

Whole-breast ultrasound methods and technical factors state that whole-breast ultrasound can be performed with a general-purpose ultrasound machine or systems designed specifically for whole-breast ultrasound; if a general-purpose machine is employed, a linear high-frequency transducer with a center frequency of at least 12 MHz if possible should be used for breast scanning. Handheld whole-breast screening ultrasound relies on the operator to identify and capture images, and because lesion characterization by ultrasonography is highly dependent on technical factors, operators should optimize gain settings, focal zone selections, and fields of view when capturing images. Semiautomated whole-breast ultrasound involves adding a robotic arm to a general-purpose ultrasound machine to guide the transducer over the breast, producing uniplanar images in sequential scan rows that are stitched together into a single continuous video for each breast; because a trained operator positions the transducer and maintains appropriate pressure, the technique is considered semiautomated, and proprietary viewing software enables localization of findings using the nipple, scan row, and frame number.

### ACR appropriateness criteria breast cancer screening [^116thJpK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Mammography is the recommended method for breast cancer screening of women in the general population. However, mammography alone does not perform as well as mammography plus supplemental screening in high-risk women. Therefore, supplemental screening with MRI or ultrasound is recommended in selected high-risk populations. Screening breast MRI is recommended in women at high risk for breast cancer on the basis of family history or genetic predisposition. Ultrasound is an option for those high-risk women who cannot undergo MRI. Recent literature also supports the use of breast MRI in some women of intermediate risk, and ultrasound may be an option for intermediate-risk women with dense breasts. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of other imaging modalities, such as thermography, breast-specific gamma imaging, positron emission mammography, and optical imaging, for breast cancer screening. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review includes an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Breast cancer screening and diagnosis: a synopsis of the European breast guidelines [^111Udfik]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The European Commission Initiative for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis guidelines (European Breast Guidelines) are coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The target audience for the guidelines includes women, health professionals, and policymakers.

Methods

An international guideline panel of 28 multidisciplinary members, including patients, developed questions and corresponding recommendations that were informed by systematic reviews of the evidence conducted between March 2016 and December 2018. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to structure the process and minimize the influence of competing interests by enhancing transparency. Questions and recommendations, expressed as strong or conditional, focused on outcomes that matter to women and provided a rating of the certainty of evidence.

Recommendations

This synopsis of the European Breast Guidelines provides recommendations regarding organized screening programs for women aged 40 to 75 years who are at average risk. The recommendations address digital mammography screening and the addition of hand-held ultrasonography, automated breast ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging compared with mammography alone. The recommendations also discuss the frequency of screening and inform decision making for women at average risk who are recalled for suspicious lesions or who have high breast density.

### Position statement and best practice recommendations on the imaging use of ultrasound from the European Society of Radiology ultrasound subcommittee [^117V6BdY]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

There is also a substantial difference between conventional radiology department ultrasound and Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS). For many clinical indications, ultrasound is the established first-line imaging modality worldwide. Conventional ultrasound has been performed across multiple specialties for more than four decades. The equipment used is generally more sophisticated, hence more expensive and uses a wider variety of transducers across a wide range of imaging applications. Point-of-care ultrasound can be performed using less sophisticated and less expensive equipment, often portable or handheld devices. Point of Care ultrasound is designed to answer specific limited clinical questions and has become prevalent among various specialists for such limited uses, whereas diagnostic ultrasound as a key component of radiological practice allows for a more comprehensive and advanced clinical interpretation.

Another issue is whether the radiologist should perform diagnostic ultrasound scans and interventional procedures on patients who refer themselves directly to the ultrasound facility. This is particularly common in some private settings in subspecialties such as MSK and breast US, where imaging findings suggest the need for a therapeutic or diagnostic interventional procedure. While a danger of self-referral for financial gain exists in any scenario where a doctor stands to gain from initiating actions from which he/she will earn income, this is not confined to radiology. Most instances of self-referral in medicine arise from a sincere effort on the part of a doctor to utilise available tools to best effect. There is no reason to believe that conscientious radiologists will behave any differently from other clinical colleagues in terms of self-referral. Any rules that may be suggested must apply to all specialties, or none at all, and should be supported by evidence of their necessity.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of a diagnostic breast ultrasound examination [^1166Cd8r]. ACR (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic breast ultrasound — clinical indications include evaluation of suspected or apparent abnormalities detected on mammography (with or without digital breast tomosynthesis), breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or other imaging modalities; initial imaging evaluation of palpable breast masses in patients under 30 years of age who are not at high risk for development of breast cancer; evaluation of symptoms in lactating and pregnant patients; evaluation of problems associated with breast implants; guidance for biopsy and other interventional procedures for breast and axilla; treatment planning for radiation therapy; and identification of abnormal axillary lymph node(s) in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent breast cancer, or in patients with findings highly suggestive of malignancy or palpable findings in the axilla. Current automated breast ultrasound systems are inadequate to depict the axilla, and if the axilla is evaluated during supplemental screening, handheld, conventional high-resolution imaging is required; supplemental screening for occult cancers in patients with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts at elevated risk or with newly suspected breast cancer who are not candidates for MRI is addressed in the ACR Practice Parameter for the Performance of Whole-Breast Ultrasound for Screening and Staging.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging of the breast-a consensus and mission statement from the EUSOBI international breast diffusion-weighted imaging working group [^1124ttm2]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

When to perform breast DWI?

Breast DWI may be part of any multiparametric breast MRI protocol independent of the clinical indication for MRI, as DWI improves the characterization of lesions detected by contrast-enhanced MRI irrespective of the indication. This includes breast MRI performed for pre-operative staging of known breast cancer (ipsi- and contralateral), monitoring neoadjuvant systemic therapy, evaluating carcinomas of unknown primary origin, resolving equivocal findings from other imaging modalities, and solving problem. For all these indications, breast DWI is considered an important addition to DCE-MRI to improve specificity, with the aim of reducing the number of recalls and biopsies of benign breast lesions. A more detailed description of current indications for breast MRI is found in existing guidelines from the EUSOBI, European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists, and American College of Radiology.

The working group highlights a special case: the application of breast DWI for breast cancer screening. There is not yet enough evidence to recommend for or against the inclusion of DWI in screening protocols. While DWI may improve lesion classification in this setting, its use should be balanced against the limited frequency of abnormal findings (because in screening, most exams are normal). For example, rather than performing DWI in all screening examinations, in order to prevent unnecessary biopsies, a multiparametric MRI including DWI could be performed as a secondary evaluation in women with ambiguous findings at the screening test.

Could breast DWI be used as a stand-alone test for breast cancer detection?

In general, even though breast DWI has high specificity for lesion characterization, the sensitivity of DCE-MRI still exceeds that of breast DWI, albeit the sensitivity of DWI alone may be equal to or even higher than that of commonly used screening techniques such as mammography and ultrasound. Thus, currently, its use for cancer detection as part of an unenhanced MRI examination requires further investigation and should be considered only in cases where DCE-MRI is not accessible or not appropriate. In particular, DWI may be a valuable alternative option in patients with contraindications to gadolinium-based contrast agents (such as patients with severe kidney dysfunction at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and patients with a previous acute reaction to a gadolinium-based contrast agent).

Is breast DWI helpful in the assessment of implants?

Breast DWI is not helpful in the assessment of breast implant integrity, which relies on other dedicated non-contrast techniques such as T2-weighted imaging and silicone specific sequences and thus is not needed for this purpose. It is, however, as useful as in any other indication for lesion classification in patients with implants.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^114st56g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Screening ultrasound as an adjunct to mammography in women with mammographically dense breasts [^113go1Zn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

There are potential benefits and harms of screening ultrasound (US) to supplement mammographic screening of women with dense breast tissue. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of studies assessing the efficacy of screening US to supplement mammography among women with dense breasts. From a total of 189 peer-reviewed publications on the performance of screening US, 12 studies were relevant to our analysis. The reporting of breast cancer risk factors varied across studies; however, the study populations tended to be at greater than average risk for developing breast cancer. Overall, US detected an additional 0.3–7.7 cancers per 1000 examinations (median, 4.2) and was associated with an additional 11.7–106.6 biopsies per 1000 examinations (median, 52.2). Significant improvements in cancer detection in dense breasts have been achieved with the transition from film to digital mammography. Thus adjunctive screening with ultrasound should be considered in the context of current screening mammography performance. Clinicians should discuss breast density as 1 of several important breast cancer risk factors, consider the potential harms of adjunctive screening, and arrive at a shared decision consistent with each woman's preferences and values.

### BI-RADS 3 on screening breast ultrasound: what is It and what is the appropriate management? [^1153BE8G]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

US is widely used in breast imaging for diagnostic purposes and is also used increasingly for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. US frequently depicts masses that are occult on mammography, even after tomosynthesis, and the vast majority of such masses are benign. Many masses seen only on screening US are easily recognized as benign simple cysts. Probably benign, BI-RADS 3, or low suspicion, BI-RADS 4A masses are also common and often prompt short-interval follow-up or biopsy, respectively, yet the vast majority of these are benign. This review details appropriate characterization, classification, and new approaches to the management of probably benign masses seen on screening US that can reduce false positives and, thereby, reduce costs and patient anxiety.

### How to optimize breast ultrasound [^114Q7hSY]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common female cancer, and the second cause of cancer-related mortality of women in our society. Mammography is the gold-standard method of breast imaging. However it is not an optimal screening tool, especially in cases of dense breast parenchyma. Even when optimally performed, its sensitivity ranges between 69 and 90%. Ultrasound represents an additional diagnostic tool that raises the detection rate of benign and malignant breast lesions. It is the method of choice for differentiating solid from cystic lesions, for further characterizing mammographic findings and better appreciating palpable breast lesions. B-mode ultrasonography is used in every day practice. Harmonic imaging and compound imaging can be used to ameliorate the image contrast and resolution. Colour Doppler is used for studying lesion vascularization however there is no consensus as to whether it really permits to differentiate malignancies from benign lesions. New technical developments such as breast elastography, 3D ultrasound and dedicated ultrasound computed aided diagnosis (CAD) are promising methods for the future.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^113vqr4K]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic assessment

In patients with symptoms or signs suspicious for breast cancer, which typically comprise palpable lumps (but also, nipple inversion, localised skin retraction or other modifications, serous or bloody nipple discharge), US is an established tool complementing clinical examination and mammography at all ages. It is the method of choice for assessing breast lumps in young women. US can also reveal the origin of the symptoms in patients with painful cysts. When patients present with unilateral, localised, non-cyclic breast pain, the chance of malignancy is as low as 1%. In pregnant or lactating women with a palpable lump, focal breast pain, or nipple discharge, US is also the initial modality of choice for identifying most benign and malignant masses. However, when needed, using adequate shielding, mammography can be supplemented even during pregnancy and injury to the unborn baby is not expected beyond week 16.

Patients presenting with diffuse breast pain, usually in association with the premenstrual phase, are often evaluated and treated only on a clinical basis.

Assessment of lesions detected by mammography

Targeted US plays a complementary role when a mass or an asymmetry is seen on a mammogram. It may help in differentiating cystic from solid lesions and excluding or identifying a solid mass underlying an asymmetry. In the presence of clustered calcifications, particularly clusters larger than 10 mm, US can depict associated masses, ductal change, or intracystic lesions, cysts and microcysts that may be crucial for diagnosis.
Note E: Mammography is clearly superior to US in identifying and characterising calcifications. However, in the presence of calcifications on mammography, targeted US is recommended to reveal possible underlying masses.

### Breast cancer screening (PDQ ®)-health professional version… [^1118jtiu]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Mammography is the most widely used screening modality for the detection of breast cancer. There is evidence that it decreases breast cancer mortality in women aged 50 to 69 years and that it is associated with harms, including the detection of clinically insignificant cancers that pose no threat to life. The benefit of mammography for women aged 40 to 49 years is uncertain. Among Black women, screening every 2 years between the ages of 50 years and 74 years would avert an estimated 9. 2 breast cancer deaths per 1, 000 women screened, while biennial screening starting at age 40 years would avert an additional

1. 8 breast cancer deaths. In response to these findings and to address inequities in breast cancer outcomes, the USPSTF recommended that all average-risk women initiate screening at age 40 years and be screened every 2 years until age 74 years. Although this approach may result in additional lives saved, the models demonstrate that earlier screening also increases the likelihood of harm from mammography screening.

Older women Screening mammography may yield cancer diagnoses in approximately 1% of women aged 66 to 79 years, but most of these cancers are low risk. The question remains whether the diagnosis and treatment of localized breast cancer in older women is beneficial. Young women There is no evidence of benefit in performing screening mammography in average-risk women younger than 40 years. There was no difference in detection rates of early-stage or late-stage tumors.

Whole-breast ultrasound measurement and lesion characterization — For the minority of whole-breast ultrasound studies performed in the diagnostic setting, the practice parameters for focused breast ultrasound apply, and lesions should be characterized by feature categories and descriptors as listed and exemplified in BI-RADS. In accordance with BI-RADS, at least three measurements should be given for each lesion when possible, and lesions should be evaluated and measured in two orthogonal planes (radial and antiradial; transverse and longitudinal). The longest dimension in each plane should be given, as well as a third measurement perpendicular to either of the first two, and if the maximum dimension is on a plane oblique to the standard orientation used, it also should be recorded.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain annual mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in average-risk females (< 15% lifetime risk of breast cancer) beginning at age 40. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPalpable breast Masses [^115HQ2DZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and the second leading cause of female cancer death in the United States. Although the majority of palpable breast lumps are benign, a new palpable breast mass is a common presenting sign of breast cancer. Any woman presenting with a palpable lesion should have a thorough clinical breast examination, but because many breast masses may not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is necessary in almost all cases to characterize the palpable lesion. Recommended imaging options in the context of a palpable mass include diagnostic mammography and targeted-breast ultrasound and are dependent on patient age and degree of radiologic suspicion as detailed in the document Variants. There is little role for advanced technologies such as MRI, positron emission mammography, or molecular breast imaging in the evaluation of a palpable mass. When a suspicious finding is identified, biopsy is indicated. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Advances in breast imaging with current screening recommendations and controversies [^11392Xik]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last several decades, breast imaging has undergone transformation. Technological advances in mammography and ultrasound and the development and increased availability of imaging modalities used in supplemental screening and diagnostic settings, including tomosynthesis and breast MRI, have allowed for improved breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Image-guided core breast biopsies have largely replaced fine needle aspirations. This article discusses the current status of breast imaging in the screening and diagnostic settings and is intended to inform the referring physician of why and how common studies and procedures are performed in the breast imaging clinic.

### Breast ultrasound for the interventionalist [^117Tc7AY]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound (US)-guided interventional procedures are routinely performed for lesions visualized on US and are the standard of care in the diagnosis and management of breast disease. When performed correctly, these procedures are safe, minimally invasive, and have a high diagnostic accuracy comparable to surgical biopsy. The most commonly performed US-guided procedures include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and preoperative wire localization. The success of these procedures depends on a thorough understanding of the indications, strong technical skills, and appropriate postbiopsy management. This article reviews the indications and techniques for US-guided interventional procedures. Concordance of imaging and pathology results, potential challenges, and associated complications are also discussed.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^116693r4]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

In most countries, a structured reporting and classification system is adopted for describing breast US findings and guiding management. In some European countries, especially in the United Kingdom, a five-level scale from U1 to U5 is used, where U stands for US. U1 means normal (no abnormalities), U2 benign abnormal findings, U3 indeterminate (equivocal)/probably benign findings, U4 findings suspicious of malignancy, U5, findings highly suspicious of malignancy. The most commonly applied system is the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS). BI-RADS 1 means normal (no abnormalities), BI-RADS 2 benign abnormal findings, BI-RADS 3 probably benign findings (for which a short-interval – typically 6-month – follow-up is recommended), BI-RADS 4 suspicious findings for which needle biopsy is recommended, BI-RADS 5 findings highly suggestive for malignancy for which needle biopsy is recommended, BI-RADS 6 known biopsy-proven malignancy (reserved for US examinations performed made for cancer staging or monitoring of neo-adjuvant therapy). Finally, this system also includes a BI-RADS 0 category, which is used for incomplete/inconclusive tests requiring additional imaging evaluation. Note that both the U4/BI-RADS 4 and U5/BI-RADS 5 diagnostic categories require tissue sampling through biopsy. In contrast to the U3 category (which includes cases with a relatively higher probability of cancer), the BI-RADS 3 category implies a low cancer risk (lower than 2%) and requires short term (usually 6 months) follow-up but may also be biopsied if the patient requests it or when follow-up is deemed difficult.
Note G. Even though the use of stardardised assessment categories facilitates the understanding of the report, do not hesitate to discuss unclear issues of your US examination with your breast radiologist. Do this in particular in the case of U3 or BI-RADS 3, if you are wondering about the need to undergo a needle biopsy or you are thinking of postponing the needle biopsy, as well as in the case of U4/BI-RADS 4 or U5/BI-RADS 5 and when further imaging work-up is suggested (e.g. digital breast tomosynthesis, MRI).

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^116pHNi7]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Sensitivity of breast US is high for characterising mammographic masses, lower in in the presence of isolated calcifications, i.e. of those without an associated mass. If the suspicion of cancer persists after targeted US or the lesion cannot be clearly identified at US, further work-up is necessary such as a needle biopsy under mammographic guidance or, in particular cases, contrast-enhanced MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography.

In women with dense breasts, US screening is able to detect additional cancers, described to be from 2 to 7 every 1000 negative mammograms, to be considered as the combined result of the limitations of mammography in the presence of dense breasts and of other associated risk factors. High rates (over 2 per 1000 mammograms) of additional cancer detection rate may be due to population preselection. The masking effect of breast density appears to be lower for US than for mammography. In general, the sensitivity of US is good, even for small cancers that occur in dense (usually hyperechoic) surrounding tissue and present as masses, with or without microcalcifications. The sensitivity decreases for masses in large breasts, in fatty breasts, and in breasts with inhomogeneous breast tissue, either by many interposed fatty components or due to mastopathy changes, being strongly variable with lesion size, palpability, composition of the surrounding tissue, and breast size.

### Image-guided biopsy of breast lesions-when to use what biopsy technique [^116hc5N9]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this manuscript, an international expert statement is provided for the biopsy of breast lesions. While previous studies have focused on sensitivities and specificities of biopsy techniques a clear recommendation when to use what approach has been absent. Using a RAND/UCLA approach with interactive discussion on discrepantly scored items resulted in a general expert opinion of the optimal biopsy method for most lesions under most image-guiding modalities.

The panel agreed that ultrasound is, in principle, the guiding method of choice, due to procedural ease, flexibility of the approach, patient comfort, and real-time feedback. Other methods (e.g. DBT or MRI) are appropriate when the lesion is not visible under ultrasound. The lack of real-time feedback with other imaging methods, and the often subtle or diffuse nature of lesions without a clear ultrasound correlate led to the general statement that biopsy under imaging techniques other than ultrasound should be performed using VAB in all cases. Consequently, no further stratification on lesion types was attempted for guidance methods other than US. While data on biopsy accuracy with different methods is limited for other imaging techniques, such as CEM or dedicated breast CT, a few recent studies on CEM-guided biopsy provide valuable initial clinical insights. These studies reported early clinical experiences with CEM-guided biopsy in general using VAB, suggesting its potential utility. However, further research is necessary to validate these results. It is acknowledged that not all hospitals will have the possibility to perform VAB under all imaging methods, and it is recognized that sometimes CNB under other modalities can give conclusive answers. However, when this is attempted, radiological-pathological correlation is essential, and in case of doubt, localization and surgical excisional biopsy should be performed.

### Mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk [^116KW2n6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease diagnosed in women worldwide. Screening with mammography has the ability to detect breast cancer at an early stage. The diagnostic accuracy of mammography screening largely depends on the radiographic density of the imaged breasts. In radiographically dense breasts, non-calcified breast cancers are more likely to be missed than in fatty breasts. As a consequence, some cancers are not detected by mammography screening. Supporters of adjunct ultrasonography to the screening regimen for breast cancer argue that it might be a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce the false negative rates of the screening process. Critics, however, are concerned that performing supplemental ultrasonography on women at average risk will also increase the rate of false positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via OvidSP) and EMBASE up until February 2012. To detect ongoing or unpublished studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and the National Cancer Institute's clinical trial database until June 2012. In addition, we conducted grey literature searches using the following sources: OpenGrey; National Institute of Health RePORTER; Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRPROJ); Hayes, Inc. Health Technology Assessment; The New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Literature Index and Conference Papers Index.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with either individual or cluster randomisation, and prospective, controlled non-randomised studies with a low risk of bias and a sample size of at least 500 participants. In addition to studies eligible for efficacy, we considered any controlled, non-randomised study with a low risk of bias and a study size of at least 500 participants for the assessment of harms. Our population of interest were women between the ages of 40 and 75 years who were at average risk for breast cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. None of the studies met our inclusion criteria.

Main Results

Our review did not detect any controlled studies on the use of adjunct ultrasonography for screening in women at average risk for breast cancer. One ongoing randomised controlled trial was identified (J-START, Japan).

Authors' Conclusions

Presently, there is no methodologically sound evidence available justifying the routine use of ultrasonography as an adjunct screening tool in women at average risk for breast cancer.

US-guided percutaneous interventions

Most breast cancers are detected by screening mammography or because of clinical symptoms. The standard workflow to assess suspicious lesions is based on mammography, US, and – when necessary – image-guided needle biopsy. Criteria were developed for decision making about biopsy of US-detected masses. When a suspicious lesion is identifiable on US, US is the preferred image guidance technique for percutaneous needle biopsy. In fact, the procedure is fast, has low costs, allows for the use of smaller needles, is only minimally uncomfortable for the patient and does not expose the patient to radiation. US-guided breast biopsies offer great advantages over mammography or MRI guidance methods for needle biopsy. US-guided interventions can be requested not only by radiologists but also by referring physicians to established histopathologic diagnosis and allow treatment planning. Open surgical diagnostic biopsies are performed only in a few particular cases, either when image-guided biopsy is not possible or due to patient's preference.

Independent of whether a mass is palpable or not, US guidance allows the operator to follow the procedure in real time and to verify the needle position for improving the overall accuracy. The patient position during biopsy is quite similar to the US examination. Breast compression is not required. The skin is disinfected and local anaesthesia is injected. A small incision of the skin is sometimes made at the entry site for an easier needle passage. The current good practice is the use of a 14-gauge or larger needle (which means using needles identified with smaller gauge numbers) to obtain three to six samples. Markers visible at various imaging modalities may be positioned at the biopsy site under US guidance, especially when there is a chance of masking or the disappearance of the biopsied lesion due to bleeding or very small size. This final step allows the evaluation of the concordance of the biopsy position as compared with other imaging modalities and, in case of neo-adjuvant therapy (i.e. a systemic medical treatment adopted in the case of large tumours to be reduced before surgery), to have the tumour position marked also in the case of complete response to therapy.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaEvaluation of nipple discharge [^1137uwkK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate imaging evaluation of nipple discharge depends the nature of the discharge. Imaging is not indicated for women with physiologic nipple discharge. For evaluation of pathologic nipple discharge, multiple breast imaging modalities are rated for evidence-based appropriateness under various scenarios. For women age 40 or older, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) should be the initial examination. Ultrasound is usually added as a complementary examination, with some exceptions. For women age 30 to 39, either mammogram or ultrasound may be used as the initial examination on the basis of institutional preference. For women age 30 or younger, ultrasound should be the initial examination, with mammography/DBT added when ultrasound shows suspicious findings or if the patient is predisposed to developing breast cancer. For men age 25 or older, mammography/DBT should be performed initially, with ultrasound added as indicated, given the high incidence of breast cancer in men with pathologic nipple discharge. Although MRI and ductography are not usually appropriate as initial examinations, each may be useful when the initial standard imaging evaluation is negative. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria evaluation of the symptomatic male breast [^111FC5se]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Most male breast problems are benign, and men with typical symptoms of gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia do not usually need imaging. When a differentiation between benign disease and breast cancer cannot be made on the basis of clinical findings or when the clinical findings are suspicious for breast cancer, imaging is indicated. Mammography is useful in both identifying cancer and obviating the need for biopsy in patients for whom a benign mammographic impression confirms the clinical impression. However, because of the relationship of breast cancer to increasing age, age-based protocols that do not include mammography have been developed. For men with an indeterminate palpable mass, begin with ultrasound if the patient is < 25 years of age, because breast cancer is highly unlikely. Mammography should be performed if ultrasound is suspicious. For men ≥ 25 years of age or having a highly concerning physical examination, usually begin with mammography; ultrasound is useful if mammography is inconclusive or suspicious. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Breast MRI: guidelines from the European society of breast imaging [^1125bgtD]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of breast MRI is to obtain a reliable evaluation of any lesion within the breast. It is currently always used as an adjunct to the standard diagnostic procedures of the breast, i.e. clinical examination, mammography and ultrasound. Whereas the sensitivity of breast MRI is usually very high, specificity — as in all breast imaging modalities — depends on many factors such as reader expertise, use of adequate techniques and composition of the patient cohorts. Since breast MRI will always yield MR-only visible questionable lesions that require an MR-guided intervention for clarification, MRI should only be offered by institutions that can also offer a MRI-guided breast biopsy or that are in close contact with a site that can perform this type of biopsy for them. Radiologists involved in breast imaging should ensure that they have a thorough knowledge of the MRI techniques that are necessary for breast imaging, that they know how to evaluate a breast MRI using the ACR BI-RADS MRI lexicon, and most important, when to perform breast MRI. This manuscript provides guidelines on the current best practice for the use of breast MRI, and the methods to be used, from the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI).

### Screening ultrasonography as adjunct to screening mammography across the spectrum of breast cancer risk… [^112k2iST]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

BCSC indicates Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium; BI-RADS, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. Question Does adding whole-breast ultrasonography to mammography improve breast cancer screening effectiveness. Findings In this cohort study, for women whose breast cancer risk ranged from low to very high, there were significantly higher short-interval follow-up and biopsy recommendation rates with screening mammography plus same-day ultrasonography compared with mammography alone. However, no significant increase in cancer detection or decrease in interval cancer rates was observed. We identified breast ultrasonography examinations with an indication of screening performed on the same day as a screening mammogram from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013. The dates of analysis were March 2014 to December
2018.

Exclusion criteria included a personal history of breast cancer, mastectomy, or BI-RADS 6 assessment; unilateral examination; and self-reported symptoms. For each screening examination, women were followed up for 12 months afterward or until the next screening examination, whichever occurred earlier, for breast cancer diagnoses. True-positive screens were defined as positive screens with a breast cancer diagnosis. We identified 6081 mammography plus ultrasonography examinations in 3386 women. Our study found that for every 1000 women screened with mammography plus ultrasonography approximately 5 women would be diagnosed as having breast cancer, while 57 women would receive a recommendation for biopsy, and 52 of these women would have benign, false-positive results at pathology.

An additional 39 women would receive recommendations for short-interval imaging follow-up of detected findings, and approximately 2 women would be diagnosed as having breast cancer within 1 year of having negative screening results. The results presented in this study reflect real-world clinical practice in the United States for women across the spectrum of breast cancer risk who received same-day, supplemental ultrasonography screening, adding information about the incremental performance and outcomes of supplemental screening with ultrasonography compared with mammography alone. We observed that supplemental ultrasonography screening was used not only in women with dense breasts:

25. 7% of women receiving it had nondense breasts.

### Addition of ultrasound to mammography in the case of dense breast tissue: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112k3YiJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

These calculations suggest that there are important capacity considerations for an introduction of ultrasound as a supplementary screening method for women with dense breasts. At present, ultrasound is used as part of assessment after positive mammography, i.e. in 410/10,000 screened women. Hence, the use of ultrasound in screening for 40% of the target population would require a ten-fold increase in the ultrasound availability. To lessen the impact on service providers, supplemental ultrasound screening could instead be considered for smaller subgroups of women with a particularly increased risk of breast cancer. As an example, ultrasound screening could be reserved for the approximately 10% women with extremely dense breasts whose relative risk of breast cancer is increased approximately threefold compared to the rest of the population. Assuming the same supplemental detection with ultrasound as in the meta analysis, this strategy would require 898 instead of 3766 ultrasound examinations per 10,000 screened women and a 25% overall increase in referrals for assessment (an additional 103/10,000). A conservative estimate of the expected increase in the detection rate, based on the average effect found in our meta-analysis, would be in the order of 10% (an additional 8/10,000; Supplementary Table 5B).

From the above calculations, it is evident that although the addition of ultrasound would increase the number of assessments, the major call on resources would be the performance of the ultrasound examinations. This could potentially be kept to a manageable level by use of a high density threshold.

At present, 31 women per 10,000 screened have an interval breast cancer diagnosed after negative mammography. It is likely that supplementary ultrasound could help decrease this risk by detecting cancers already at screening, but it is not yet clear by how much because the extent of overdiagnosis for now remains uncertain. Assuming that, like in mammography, also here overdiagnosis can explain only a small proportion of cases, the additional detection by supplementary ultrasound (estimated above at 19 or 8 per 10,000), could prove to be clinically meaningful in decreasing the overall interval cancer rate.

Axillary breast cancer — imaging and immunohistochemical workup: The guidelines suggest the use of a mammogram and breast ultrasound for such patients, and testing for immunohistochemical markers including ER/PR and HER2 is recommended; elevated ER/PR levels provide strong evidence for a breast cancer diagnosis. MRI of the breast should be considered for a patient with histopathologic evidence of breast cancer when mammography and ultrasound are not adequate to assess the extent of the disease, may be especially helpful in patients with dense breast tissue, positive axillary nodes, and suspected occult primary breast tumor or to evaluate the chest wall, and has been shown to be useful in identifying the primary site and may also facilitate breast conservation by allowing for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy. The NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary also provide recommendations for additional workup, including chest and abdominal CT to evaluate for evidence of distant metastases for adenocarcinoma of the axillary nodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion; in particular, breast MRI and ultrasound are recommended and axillary ultrasound should also be performed.

### Ultrasound imaging… [^114qWk2J]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Uses Ultrasound imaging is a medical tool that can help a physician evaluate, diagnose and treat medical conditions. Common ultrasound imaging procedures include:

- Abdominal ultrasound
- Bone sonometry
- Breast ultrasound
- Doppler fetal heart rate monitors
- Doppler ultrasound.
- Echocardiogram
- Fetal ultrasound
- Ultrasound-guided biopsies
- Ophthalmic ultrasound. Because of the particular concern for effects on the fetus, organizations such as the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine have advocated prudent use of ultrasound imaging in pregnancy.

Furthermore, the use of ultrasound solely for non-medical purposes such as obtaining fetal 'keepsake' videos has been discouraged. Keepsake images or videos are reasonable if they are produced during a medically-indicated exam, and if no additional exposure is required. Information for Patients including Expectant Mothers For all medical imaging procedures, the FDA recommends that patients talk to their health care provider to understand the reason for the examination, the medical information that will be obtained, the potential risks, and how the results will be used to manage the medical condition or pregnancy. Because ultrasound is not based on ionizing radiation, it is particularly useful for women of child-bearing age when CT or other imaging methods would otherwise result in exposure to radiation. Expectant Mothers Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging method for viewing the fetus during pregnancy.

Routine examinations are performed to assess and monitor the health status of the fetus and mother. Ultrasound examinations provide parents with a valuable opportunity to view and hear the heartbeat of the fetus, bond with the unborn baby, and capture images to share with family and friends. In fetal ultrasound, three-dimensional ultrasound allows the visualization of some facial features and possibly other parts such as fingers and toes of the fetus. Four-dimensional ultrasound is 3D ultrasound in motion. While ultrasound is generally considered to be safe with very low risks, the risks may increase with unnecessary prolonged exposure to ultrasound energy, or when untrained users operate the device.

### Breast cancer screening-NCI… [^111exfnC]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast Cancer Screening Key Points
- Tests are used to screen for different types of cancer when a person does not have symptoms.
- Mammography is the most common screening test for breast cancer.
- Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to screen women who have a high risk of breast cancer.
- Whether a woman should be screened for breast cancer and the screening test to use depends on certain factors.
- Other screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials.
- Breast exam
- Thermography
- Tissue sampling
- Ultrasound exam
- Screening tests for breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Many factors affect whether mammography is able to detect breast cancer:

- The age and weight of the patient.
- The size and type of tumor.
- Where the tumor has formed in the breast.
- How sensitive the breast tissue is to hormones.
- How dense the breast tissue is.
- The timing of the mammography within the woman's menstrual cycle.
- The quality of the mammogram picture.
- The skill of the radiologist in reading the mammogram. Other screening tests have been or are being studied in clinical trials. Studies have been done to find out if the following breast cancer screening tests are useful in finding breast cancer or helping women with breast cancer live longer. Tissue sampling Breast tissue sampling is taking cells from breast tissue to check under a microscope. Breast tissue sampling as a screening test has not been shown to decrease the risk of dying from breast cancer. Ultrasound exam A procedure in which high-energy sound waves are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound is sometimes used as an additional screening test for women who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer.

It is not known if supplemental screening with ultrasound leads to better health outcomes. Mammography exposes the breast to low doses of radiation. Being exposed to high doses of radiation is a risk factor for breast cancer. The radiation dose used with a mammogram is very low. Women who start getting mammograms at age 50 and continue getting them every 2 years have a lower risk of developing breast cancer from radiation exposure during a mammogram than women who start getting mammograms at age 40 and continue getting them every year. Women with large breasts or with breast implants may be exposed to slightly higher radiation doses during screening mammography.

### Mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography for breast cancer screening in women at average risk [^1134JE64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening mammography can detect breast cancer at an early stage. Supporters of adding ultrasonography to the screening regimen consider it a safe and inexpensive approach to reduce false-negative rates during screening. However, those opposed to it argue that performing supplemental ultrasonography will also increase the rate of false-positive findings and can lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

Objectives

To assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of mammography in combination with breast ultrasonography versus mammography alone for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and ClinicalTrials.gov up until 3 May 2021.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy and harms, we considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non-randomised studies enrolling at least 500 women at average risk for breast cancer between the ages of 40 and 75. We also included studies where 80% of the population met our age and breast cancer risk inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full texts, assessed risk of bias, and applied the GRADE approach. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on available event rates. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included eight studies: one RCT, two prospective cohort studies, and five retrospective cohort studies, enrolling 209,207 women with a follow-up duration from one to three years. The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography; one study used breast tomosynthesis; and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. Six of the eight studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, whilst two studies screened women once, twice, or more. None of the studies assessed whether mammography screening in combination with ultrasonography led to lower mortality from breast cancer or all-cause mortality. High certainty evidence from one trial showed that screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography detects more breast cancer than mammography alone. The J-START (Japan Strategic Anti-cancer Randomised Trial), enrolling 72,717 asymptomatic women, had a low risk of bias and found that two additional breast cancers per 1000 women were detected over two years with one additional ultrasonography than with mammography alone (5 versus 3 per 1000; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.94). Low certainty evidence showed that the percentage of invasive tumours was similar, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (69.6% (128 of 184) versus 73.5% (86 of 117); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09). However, positive lymph node status was detected less frequently in women with invasive cancer who underwent mammography screening in combination with ultrasonography than in women who underwent mammography alone (18% (23 of 128) versus 34% (29 of 86); RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.86; moderate certainty evidence). Further, interval carcinomas occurred less frequently in the group screened by mammography and ultrasonography compared with mammography alone (5 versus 10 in 10,000 women; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89; 72,717 participants; high certainty evidence). False-negative results were less common when ultrasonography was used in addition to mammography than with mammography alone: 9% (18 of 202) versus 23% (35 of 152; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). However, the number of false-positive results and necessary biopsies were higher in the group with additional ultrasonography screening. Amongst 1000 women who do not have cancer, 37 more received a false-positive result when they participated in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography than with mammography alone (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.50; high certainty evidence). Compared to mammography alone, for every 1000 women participating in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography, 27 more women will have a biopsy (RR 2.49, 95% CI 2.28 to 2.72; high certainty evidence). Results from cohort studies with methodological limitations confirmed these findings. A secondary analysis of the J-START provided results from 19,213 women with dense and non-dense breasts. In women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected three more cancer cases (0 fewer to 7 more) per 1000 women screened than mammography alone (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.72; 11,390 participants; high certainty evidence). A meta-analysis of three cohort studies with data from 50,327 women with dense breasts supported this finding, showing that mammography and ultrasonography combined led to statistically significantly more diagnosed cancer cases compared to mammography alone (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.56; 50,327 participants; moderate certainty evidence). For women with non-dense breasts, the secondary analysis of the J-START study demonstrated that more cancer cases were detected when adding ultrasound to mammography screening compared to mammography alone (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.68; 7823 participants; moderate certainty evidence), whilst two cohort studies with data from 40,636 women found no statistically significant difference between the two screening methods (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on one study in women at average risk of breast cancer, ultrasonography in addition to mammography leads to more screening-detected breast cancer cases. For women with dense breasts, cohort studies more in line with real-life clinical practice confirmed this finding, whilst cohort studies for women with non-dense breasts showed no statistically significant difference between the two screening interventions. However, the number of false-positive results and biopsy rates were higher in women receiving additional ultrasonography for breast cancer screening. None of the included studies analysed whether the higher number of screen-detected cancers in the intervention group resulted in a lower mortality rate compared to mammography alone. Randomised controlled trials or prospective cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to assess the effects of the two screening interventions on morbidity and mortality.

### ACR practice parameter for the performance of whole-breast ultrasound for screening and staging [^115xRcbQ]. ACR (2024). High credibility.

Whole-breast ultrasound for cancer staging — When used for cancer staging, the regional lymph node basins can be assessed sonographically, including the axilla, infraclavicular and supraclavicular regions, lower cervical region, and the internal mammary chain. The decision to evaluate the axilla preoperatively with ultrasound varies by practice, and consensus between the radiologists, medical oncologists, and breast surgeons is beneficial for optimal patient management.

Introduction

Since the publication of the randomised trials showing a significant breast cancer mortality reduction with the offer of breast screening with mammography, large numbers of screening programmes have been instituted worldwide. – These programmes are estimated to prevent substantial numbers of breast cancer deaths – and standards have been developed to monitor and maintain the quality of the services.

One area where there is room for improvement is the lower sensitivity of mammographic screening in women with dense breast tissue. Since the introduction of legislation in the USA requiring disclosure of mammographic density to screenees, there has been considerable international interest in potential variation in screening regimen based on breast density. Possible tactics include increased frequency of screening in the case of dense breast tissue, but in both the USA and Europe, there is much interest in supplemental imaging in addition to mammography. The latter option seems logical, since if a test is shown to be less sensitive in a population, using a different test may be more effective than applying the same test more frequently.

While there is strong evidence that magnetic resonance imaging confers a substantial improvement in sensitivity, particularly in high-risk groups, it remains an expensive option and requires considerable commitment from the screenee. There is therefore interest in the use of ultrasound, hand-held or automatic, in addition to mammography in the case of dense breast tissue. A policy decision regarding the use of adjunctive ultrasound for screening in dense breasts would need to be informed by evidence on the increase in breast cancer detection capability, the resource and human costs of the ultrasound imaging, and the resource and human costs of further diagnostic workup as a result of positive ultrasound findings. A decision would also need to be made as to how to define the dense tissue subgroup of the population, as there are many methods of measuring breast density.

In this paper, we review the published literature on the use of ultrasound in addition to mammography in screening women with dense breast tissue. We summarise in quantitative terms the likely benefit in terms of increased breast cancer detection, and the effect on the increased diagnostic activity, specifically in terms of recall rates for assessment. The benefit and the required diagnostic activity are further discussed in the context of a routine mammography screening service such as the one implemented by the NHS Breast Screening Programme.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable breast masses: 2022 update [^115JBhqQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### NCT05797545 | Comparison of ultrasound and breast MRI… [^111E6hgb]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, most guidelines consistently recommend annual mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer. However, in women with dense breasts, mammographic sensitivity decreased from a level of 85. 7%-88. 8% in patients with almost entirely fatty tissue to
62. 2%-68. 1%. Even more, sensitivity of mammography was lower in women with a PHBC within the initial 5 years after primary breast cancer treatment. In addition, dense breasts lead to an increased percentage of interval cancer. Thus, the need for a better surveillance modality has emerged. In this context, breast US may be considered as a supplemental screening modality because it is widely available, does not need contrast agents, and is of relatively lower cost. A few studies indicate that adding screening US to mammography reduced interval cancer rates for women with dense breasts and enable detection of early-stage cancers at an average of 4. 2 cancers per 1000 US examinations.

As an another candidate, breast MRI shows high sensitivity and offers the highest cancer detection rate but its routine usage in women with a PHBC is still on debate. Another possible imaging modality is breast magnetic resonance imaging. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines suggest annual screening with mammography and MRI is recommended for ① women with Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene mutations, ② first-degree family members of carriers of BRCA mutations, ③ women with a lifetime risk of.

- Women who agreed to undergo regular annual mammography, breast ultrasound, and breast MRI Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients with symptoms related to current breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence
- If you have been diagnosed with regional recurrence or distant metastases.
- In case of bilateral total mastectomy
- If women are receiving chemotherapy for cancer in other organs

- Glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or patients with renal insufficiency on dialysis

Conclusion

Studies have consistently shown an increased detection by supplementary ultrasound of predominantly small but invasive breast cancers in women with dense breasts. The feasibility of this screening method in routine practice might be at present limited given its resource use, although the strain on the health care capacities might be manageable by a careful targeting of the highest-risk women among those with dense breasts.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast cancer screening [^111Lb4MR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in intermediate-risk females (personal history of breast cancer, lobular neoplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or 15–20% lifetime risk of breast cancer). Consider obtaining MRI as an adjunct to mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on risk factors. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### Evaluation of adjunctive ultrasonography for breast cancer detection among women aged 40–49 years with varying breast density undergoing screening mammography: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113yzUWQ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the performance of adjunctive ultrasonography for breast cancer detection among women undergoing screening mammography change according to breast tissue density?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, screening mammography alone demonstrated low sensitivity, whereas adjunctive ultrasonography improved sensitivity both in dense and nondense breasts.

Meaning

These findings suggest that adjunctive ultrasonography has the potential to improve the detection of early-stage and invasive cancers across both dense and nondense breasts and to mitigate the flaws of mammographic screening.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^112Ay1Zb]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast ultrasound

Several studies have shown that supplemental breast ultrasound screening in women with dense breasts increases the detection of 0.9–7.7 cancers per 1000 screening examinations and reduces the interval cancer rate compared to mammography alone. These detected cancers are usually small, invasive, and node-negative. In the last decade, automated breast ultrasound systems have also been introduced on the market to overcome some of the limitations of handheld ultrasound, such as operator dependence, long acquisition time when performed by a physician, and limited reproducibility. The main drawbacks of supplemental breast ultrasound screening remain the increase in recalls and biopsy rates, leading to a reduction of the positive predictive value of screening to about 5%. Mostly due to the long examination times, the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound for screening is questionable. EUSOBI (European Society of Breast Imaging) guidelines suggest the possible usage of supplemental ultrasound screening in women at average or intermediate risk with dense breast and negative mammography, but the balance between advantages and disadvantages was not judged to be clear enough to adopt additional ultrasound as a general policy.

Discussion

Main findings

In its latest review from 2016, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there is limited evidence for an increased detection of breast cancer using supplemental ultrasound in women with dense breasts, citing the lack of randomised controlled trials and study design heterogeneity among the reasons. Our meta-analysis, focusing on the most recent studies, showed an on average 40% increase in the detection of asymptomatic breast cancers. Cases missed by mammography were detected by ultrasound in all but one (underpowered) study.

There are still no data on whether the additional detection by ultrasound improves mortality from breast cancer, which is in line with the conclusions made by IARC's review. The cases detected only by ultrasound were frequently relatively small, however, the majority were invasive cancers. Some studies reported interval cancers, but for the time being those data appear less informative, as the length of follow-up and the completeness of the ascertainment differed substantially between studies. In the future, it would be helpful to see results from a large cohort with complete ascertainment of interval cancer cases, as this would give us an estimate of the effect of supplementary ultrasound on screening programme sensitivity and its ability to reduce breast cancer mortality.

### Ultrasound-guided breast biopsies: basic and new techniques [^116rVhpe]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound‐guided breast biopsies can be challenging to perform, especially when the target is adjacent to the nipple, skin, or implant or when the target is small and in very posterior, dense fibroglandular tissue. Oftentimes, a slightly modified approach can result in a diagnostic biopsy specimen with minimal complications. After a brief review of basic techniques for ultrasound‐guided breast biopsies that includes a review of conventional breast biopsy devices, a presentation of procedural modifications and techniques to consider for more challenging cases is described. In particular, novel open‐trough and tandem‐needle techniques are detailed. Several cases using these techniques are then presented.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^11494vFN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations and conclusions (Level C) — initial evaluation, biopsy methods, and age-based imaging are described. The initial evaluation of a woman with breast-related symptoms should include review of her history to characterize her symptoms and to identify risk factors for breast cancer and should involve a clinical breast examination. Three options are available for histologic evaluation of abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging — fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy — and core needle biopsy generally is the preferred method because it has few complications and minimizes surgical changes to the breast. Evaluation of a breast mass requires age-appropriate breast imaging with management guided by the BI-RADS classification regarding continued imaging observation or biopsy. The appropriate diagnostic imaging study is determined by age; for women younger than 30 years with a palpable mass, ultrasonography is the preferred initial modality.

### A review of supplemental screening ultrasound for breast cancer: certain populations of women with dense breast tissue may benefit [^1141ru53]. Academic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Breast density has been shown to be a strong, independent risk factor for breast cancer. Unfortunately, mammography is less accurate on dense breast tissue compared to fattier breast tissue. Multiple studies suggest a solution to this by demonstrating the ability of supplemental screening ultrasound to detect additional malignant lesions in women with dense breast tissue but negative mammography. In particular, supplemental screening ultrasound may be beneficial to women with dense breast tissue and intermediate or average risk for breast cancer, women in specific ethnic populations with greater prevalence of dense breast tissue, and women living in resource-poor healthcare environments. Although magnetic resonance imaging is currently recommended for women with high risk for breast cancer, not all women can access or tolerate a magnetic resonance imaging examination. Notably, ultrasound does not require intravenous gadolinium and may be an alternative for women with socioeconomic or medical restrictions, which limit their access to magnetic resonance imaging. Limitations of supplemental screening ultrasound include a substantial rate of false-positives, increased cost, and limited resource availability, particularly in regard to the time required for image interpretation. Additional clinical experience with this application of ultrasound, improved patient selection criteria, and new technology, such as the promising results seen with automated whole breast ultrasound, may address these limitations. In light of recent legislation in some states that has called for discussing supplemental imaging with patients who have dense breast tissue, the optimal role for supplemental screening ultrasound merits further exploration.

Indications for whole-breast ultrasound may include, but are not limited to: screening, as an optional adjunct to screening mammography, for patients with a high lifetime breast cancer risk (20% or greater) who are not candidates for breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who are unable to tolerate or elect not to undergo MRI, or who cannot easily access breast MRI; patients with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts for whom supplemental screening options have been suggested; and cancer staging in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer who are not candidates for breast MRI, who are unable to tolerate or elect not to undergo MRI, or who cannot easily access breast MRI.

### Training and standards for performance, interpretation, and structured reporting for supplemental breast cancer screening [^115gk7qe]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. To compensate for the reduction of mammography's sensitivity in women with dense breasts, supplemental screening can increase the cancer detection rate. The modalities suggested are MRI, which is the most sensitive and is indicated for women with the highest risk of breast cancer, and ultrasound, which is suggested for dense-breasted average-risk women. CONCLUSION. For decades, ultrasound has been a focused examination. Extending a handheld ultrasound examination to depict the entire breast requires formal didactic training and hands-on scanning to learn suitable, efficient methods. Automated options also require intensive training in performance and interpretation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® breast imaging during pregnancy [^116FrVZs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are physiologic and structural changes of the breast that occur during pregnancy that can make the clinical examination and imaging more challenging. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is uncommon but increasing as more women postpone childbearing. PABC can present clinically as a palpable lump, focal pain, nipple discharge, or diffuse breast enlargement. Mammography is safe to perform during pregnancy. Both high- and normal-risk women should continue their routine screening mammography examinations during pregnancy. Diagnostic mammography and/or ultrasound is tailored to evaluate the clinical symptoms and for locoregional staging of newly diagnosed PABC. Breast MRI is not advocated for screening or diagnostic evaluation of the breast during pregnancy due to unknown safety of gadolinium exposure to the fetus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals.

### Breast imaging for interventional pathologists [^111QHNQk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Pathologist-performed, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy is one of the frontiers of pathology. The College of American Pathologists, American Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society of Cytopathology offer courses and certificate programs for pathologists in this area. The courses emphasize the biopsy of masses in the thyroid and head and neck. There is little training in ultrasound-guided biopsy of breast masses. To successfully perform an imaging-guided biopsy of the breast, pathologists should understand the basics of mammography and breast ultrasound.

Objective

To review the basics of mammography and breast ultrasound to help interventional pathologists add ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsies of the breast to their list of core competencies.

Data Sources

Classic and recent literature and textbooks on mammography and breast ultrasound.

Conclusions

The heart of early breast cancer detection is the screening mammogram. Abnormalities detected on screening, such as masses, densities, architectural distortions, nipple retraction, skin thickening, abnormal lymph nodes, and microcalcifications, will lead to a diagnostic mammogram and/or breast ultrasound. Lesions classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 or 5, and a few classified as 3 lesions, require biopsy. If the lesion is visible on ultrasound, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and/or core-needle biopsy is the procedure of choice. Suspicious lesions visible only on mammogram require stereotactic x-ray-guided biopsy. Interventional pathologists who understand the values and limitations of mammography and breast ultrasound are ready for the challenges of pathologist-performed, ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsies of the breast.

### ESR essentials: screening for breast cancer-general recommendations by EUSOBI [^113h9Q8y]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women accounting for about 30% of all new cancer cases and the incidence is constantly increasing. Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations, including underdiagnosis, false positive cases, and overdiagnosis. Indeed, breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities, including digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, breast MRI, and, more recently, contrast-enhanced mammography, are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS: Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach, regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35–40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available, ultrasound can be performed as an alternative, although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians.

### Addition of ultrasound to mammography in the case of dense breast tissue: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Pm7Xx]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

We did a thorough systematic search in the leading medical database, and, additionally, hand-searched all identified reviews and similar secondary literature. We used pre-specified selection criteria and excluded studies that did not describe routine screening settings.

Although none of the studies was a randomised trial, both mammography and ultrasound testing in the selected studies were undertaken sequentially in the same women. This means that all women acted as their own controls, thereby accounting for between-patient variability. However, we cannot exclude a potential study effect on mammography interpretation particularly in the more complex cases, originating from the radiologists being aware that ultrasound will form part of the screening evaluation.

Nevertheless, several studies identified in our search had to be excluded from the review as they did not report the data separately for asymptomatic women undergoing screening, or by their breast density. This suggests that a substantial amount of the relevant data may have remained unreported, however, funnel plot analysis suggested only a small effect of a publication bias.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® evaluation of nipple discharge: 2022 update [^1155BXy7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The type of nipple discharge dictates the appropriate imaging study. Physiologic nipple discharge is common and does not require diagnostic imaging. Pathologic nipple discharge in women, men, and transgender patients necessitates breast imaging. Evidence-based guidelines were used to evaluate breast imaging modalities for appropriateness based on patient age and gender. For an adult female or male 40 years of age or greater, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is performed initially. Breast ultrasound is usually performed at the same time with rare exception. For males or females 30 to 39 years of age, mammography/DBT or breast ultrasound is performed based on institutional preference and individual patient considerations. For young women less than 30 years of age, ultrasound is performed first with mammography/DBT added if there are suspicious findings or if the patient is at elevated lifetime risk for developing breast cancer. There is a high incidence of breast cancer in males with pathologic discharge. Men 25 years and older should be evaluated using mammography/DBT and ultrasound added when indicted. In transfeminine (male-to-female) patients, mammography/DBT and ultrasound are useful due to the increased incidence of breast cancer. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence.
