## Question

antibiotic for ssinus infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic to use for a sinus infection and how to distinguish when antibiotics are warranted versus when they are not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating viral acute rhinosinusitis from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that trigger antibiotic use. Next, I will select first-line and alternative agents with attention to duration, resistance risk, and safety. After that, I need to check what to avoid, when to escalate or switch, and how to handle penicillin allergy. Finally, I will review chronic rhinosinusitis, pediatric nuances, stewardship metrics, and follow-up timing to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care [^114RCeCn] [^115meHhE] [^1123tx9v] [^1129kxFt] [^11552ayP].

> Let me first confirm the disease buckets because antibiotics hinge on this distinction: most cases are acute viral rhinosinusitis and are self-limited, a subset meet criteria for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that may benefit modestly from antibiotics, and a different entity is chronic rhinosinusitis where inflammation predominates and routine antibiotics are not helpful outside specific scenarios [^114RCeCn] [^113u7KgV] [^1129kxFt].

> I need to ensure I apply the correct diagnostic triggers for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis; hold on, I should verify the three classic pathways: persistent symptoms beyond 10 days without improvement, severe onset with fever 39 C or higher plus purulent nasal discharge or facial pain for at least 3 consecutive days, or a "double sickening" pattern with initial improvement followed by worsening after 5–7 days of a viral illness [^112WnXrG] [^116sL2Da].

> Wait, let me verify the benefit magnitude before jumping to antibiotics; Cochrane data in adults shows antibiotics shorten time to cure but only about 5 more per 100 recover faster between days 7–14, giving a number needed to treat around 18, so watchful waiting remains reasonable when criteria are borderline or symptoms are mild to moderate and the patient can be reliably followed [^1129kxFt] [^114RCeCn].

> Next, I will now examine first-line therapy for adults who do meet criteria; guidelines recommend amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate as preferred initial choices because they cover the key pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis with a favorable balance of efficacy and safety, and high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg can be used when resistance risk is higher, for example with severe infection or recent antibiotic exposure [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE] [^111p1NoR].

> Hold on, I should confirm the duration because overtreatment is common; most adults do well with 5–7 days, and broader evidence across respiratory infections supports the paradigm that shorter effective courses reduce adverse events and resistance without sacrificing outcomes when patients are improving clinically, so I will avoid defaulting to 10 days unless there are complicating factors or a slow response [^115meHhE] [^1115KrVP] [^116rgAo8].

> I should double-check which agents to avoid upfront; macrolides such as azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have high resistance rates in common ABRS pathogens and are not recommended as monotherapy for empiric treatment despite historical use, so I will not choose them unless there is a compelling, culture-directed rationale [^115oMEci].

> But wait, what if I am tempted to use a fluoroquinolone for convenience; moxifloxacin and levofloxacin are effective and FDA-approved, yet they should be reserved for patients with no alternative options because of serious adverse effects and to protect class utility, even though levofloxacin has validated 5-day and 10–14 day regimens with similar success rates, so I will keep these as last-resort agents [^116P9EVJ] [^1145gu11].

> For penicillin allergy, let me think about reaction phenotype; in non-anaphylactic histories, doxycycline is a reasonable alternative that maintains coverage against typical respiratory pathogens, whereas severe IgE-mediated reactions require careful selection of second-line, non–beta-lactam options guided by local resistance and, when possible, culture data, so I should confirm the allergy type before prescribing [^115oMEci] [^11552ayP].

> I need to ensure I am not conflating acute and chronic disease; chronic rhinosinusitis lasting more than 12 weeks is primarily inflammatory and current high-quality guidance advises against short-term oral antibiotics, even for acute exacerbations without clear bacterial features, while long-term macrolide regimens show mixed and limited evidence and should be considered only in select endotypes under specialist oversight, so I will prioritize topical steroids, saline irrigation, and comorbidity management first [^113u7KgV] [^111N1J1i] [^1154FJc6].

> Next, I should review stewardship realities; inappropriate prescribing for sinusitis remains common, with studies showing around 81% of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis were inappropriate in some systems and that antibiotic selection and duration often deviate from guidelines, though targeted interventions can reduce overall prescribing, shift choices toward amoxicillin/clavulanate, and shorten durations to 5 days, which reinforces my need to document criteria and right-size therapy every time [^112Y3GKJ] [^112XTMct] [^114TZTYt].

> Let me consider pediatrics briefly; in children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, antibiotics decrease treatment failure by about 41% versus placebo at the cost of more diarrhea, so while many cases improve spontaneously, the risk–benefit calculus can favor antibiotics more often in children who meet bacterial criteria or are sicker, but I should still avoid unnecessary treatment and counsel families on expected time course and adverse effects [^111wqasB].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up and what to do if the patient does not improve; guidelines recommend reassessing after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy to confirm the diagnosis, exclude alternative causes, look for complications, and, if ABRS remains likely, change the antibiotic rather than extending an ineffective agent indefinitely, with imaging or specialty referral reserved for red flags or persistent nonresponse [^11271JBL] [^114RCeCn].

> I will now synthesize this into a practical flow; first, confirm duration and pattern of illness to distinguish viral from bacterial and avoid antibiotics if symptoms are under 10 days without severe features, then initiate amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate for 5–7 days when criteria are met, use doxycycline for non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, avoid macrolides and TMP/SMX empirically, reserve fluoroquinolones for those with no alternatives, and reassess within 3–5 days to adjust course or investigate further if not improving, while in chronic rhinosinusitis emphasize anti-inflammatory therapy and avoid routine systemic antibiotics [^112WnXrG] [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE] [^115oMEci] [^11271JBL] [^113u7KgV].

---

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the **first-line antibiotic for acute bacterial sinus infections** in adults for 5–7 days [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE]. Use **high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone** (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) for severe disease, recent antibiotic use, or high resistance risk. For penicillin allergy, use **doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone**. Avoid macrolides and TMP/SMX due to resistance [^115oMEci]. Reassess at 3–5 days; if there is no improvement, switch therapy or obtain cultures [^11271JBL].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **ABRS** when any of the following criteria are present:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Nasal discharge or cough ≥ 10 days without improvement [^112WnXrG].

- **Severe symptoms**: Fever ≥ 39°C, purulent nasal discharge, or facial pain ≥ 3 consecutive days [^112WnXrG].

- **Worsening symptoms**: New fever, headache, or increased discharge after initial improvement ("double sickening") [^112WnXrG].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended as **first-line therapy for ABRS** because it is effective against common pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) and covers beta-lactamase producers [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID | 5–7 days [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE] |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate (high-dose) | 2,000/125 mg PO BID | 5–7 days (severe infection, recent antibiotics, or high resistance risk) |

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

Alternative antibiotics are recommended for patients with a **penicillin allergy** or when first-line therapy is contraindicated:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID | 5–7 days | Penicillin allergy |
| Levofloxacin | 750 mg PO daily | 5 days | - Severe infection <br/> - Recent antibiotics <br/> - Or high resistance risk [^1145gu11] |
| Moxifloxacin | 400 mg PO daily | 7–10 days | - Severe infection <br/> - Recent antibiotics <br/> - Or high resistance risk |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

Certain antibiotics are **not recommended** due to high resistance among common pathogens, including **Macrolides** (azithromycin, clarithromycin) [^115oMEci] and **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** (TMP/SMX) [^115oMEci].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ABRS is generally **5–7 days**; shorter courses (5 days) are effective and associated with fewer adverse events compared with longer courses (10–14 days) [^11552ayP] [^115meHhE].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Patients should be reassessed within **3–5 days** of initiating antibiotic therapy. If there is no improvement or symptoms worsen, clinicians should:

- **Reassess diagnosis**: Confirm ABRS and exclude other causes [^11271JBL].

- **Change antibiotic**: If ABRS is confirmed [^11271JBL].

- **Obtain cultures**: Consider sinus aspirate or endoscopic cultures in refractory cases.

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic rhinosinusitis**: Antibiotics are generally not recommended unless there is an acute bacterial exacerbation [^111cqXha].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require broader-spectrum antibiotics and longer treatment durations.

- **Pediatric patients**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is also first-line therapy, with dosing adjusted for weight and age.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotic** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line therapy | Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 5–7 days |
| Severe infection or recent antibiotics | High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate or respiratory fluoroquinolone | 5–7 days |
| Penicillin allergy | Doxycycline or respiratory fluoroquinolone | 5–7 days |
| Antibiotics to avoid | - Macrolides <br/> - TMP/SMX | N/A |

---

Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the **first-line antibiotic for acute bacterial sinus infections**, with alternatives for penicillin allergy or severe infection. Antibiotics should be reserved for confirmed bacterial cases, with reassessment at 3–5 days to ensure clinical improvement.

## References

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^116P9EVJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, moxifloxacin should be reserved for the treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

- **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis**: Moxifloxacin is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Due to the association of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.14)] and the self-limiting nature of ABECB in some patients, moxifloxacin should be reserved for the treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

### Levofloxacin [^1145gu11]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10–14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates (defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary) in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10.0] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2016 guidelines recommend reserving antibiotic treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in specific situations. Antibiotics should be initiated in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, the onset of severe symptoms, or signs such as a high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for three or more consecutive days. Additionally, treatment is advised for patients experiencing the onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted five days and was initially improving, known as "double sickening".

### No "one-size-fits-all": Chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^114TZTYt]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Sinusitis (acute and chronic) is a common infection in primary care, accounting for nearly 30 million diagnoses annually and over 10% of antibiotic-related visits. Despite national guidelines promoting judicious antibiotic use, management practices differ widely, highlighting sinusitis as an important antimicrobial stewardship target for optimizing outpatient prescribing.

International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) encounter coding has become foundational for outpatient stewardship metrics that identify suboptimal outpatient antibiotic use. While several studies have demonstrated the utility of the antibiotic prescribing rate (APR), a billing data-based antibiotic stewardship metric, few have evaluated its value for diagnoses such as sinusitis, in which antibiotics are situationally indicated. We assessed the impact of different ICD-10 definitions on outpatient sinusitis APR to characterize its use and utility as a stewardship metric for these diagnoses.

### Antibiotics for acute sinusitis in children: A meta-analysis [^111wqasB]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the leading causes of antibiotic prescriptions in children. No recent systematic reviews have examined the efficacy of antibiotics compared with placebo.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine if antibiotics are superior to placebo in the treatment of acute sinusitis in children.

- **Data sources**: Medline and Embase were searched from their origin to July 2023.

- **Study selection**: We considered randomized placebo-controlled studies focusing on the treatment of acute sinusitis. In all studies, symptoms were present for less than four weeks, and subjects were under 18 years of age.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently extracted the data. We pooled data primarily using fixed-effects models.

- **Results**: Analysis of six included studies showed that antibiotic treatment reduced the rate of treatment failure by 41% (with a risk ratio of 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.49–0.72) compared with placebo. There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 69.7%), which decreased substantially when the one study with a high risk of bias was removed (I² = 26.9%). Children treated with antibiotics were 1.6 times more likely to have diarrhea than those who were not treated with antibiotics (risk ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.51).

- **Limitations**: A small number of studies were eligible for inclusion. Included studies differed in their methodology.

- **Conclusions**: In children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, antibiotics significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure compared with placebo. However, given the favorable natural history of sinusitis…

### Extracts from the Cochrane Library: Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^116rgHFR]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a quarterly section in the journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to illuminate implications for clinical decision-making. This installment features a Cochrane Review entitled "Antibiotics for Acute Maxillary Sinusitis", which concludes a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^113AApZc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies, and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2,058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were clinical cure and clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (number of trials = 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (number of trials = 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute sinusitis [^115NKemo]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Are oral or parenteral corticosteroids associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute sinusitis compared with placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?

Oral corticosteroids combined with antibiotics may be associated with a modest benefit for the short-term relief of symptoms in adults with severe symptoms of acute sinusitis compared with antibiotics alone. However, oral corticosteroids as monotherapy are not associated with improved clinical outcomes in adults with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^116sL2Da]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy initiation, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend reserving antibiotics for patients who present with fever, facial pain, and purulent nasal drainage persisting for 7–10 days. Additionally, antibiotics are suggested for those exhibiting improvement followed by a worsening of symptoms (double-sickening) or experiencing severe symptoms lasting 3 or more days.

### Prospective observational study of chronic rhinosinusitis: Environmental triggers and antibiotic implications [^113GKaf7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A prolonged course of antibiotic therapy is often initiated for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) based on symptomatology. We examined differences in clinical manifestations and underlying conditions in patients with symptoms typical for CRS. CT scan abnormality of the sinuses was the gold standard for the diagnosis of CRS.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective observational study of 125 adults with classic symptoms of CRS undergoing nasal endoscopy and sinus CT.

- **Results**: The patients were classified into two groups: (1) those with radiographic evidence of sinusitis by CT (Sx + CT) (75) and (2) those with normal CT scans of the sinus (Sx - CT) (50). Decreased smell was significantly more common in Sx + CT than in Sx - CT patients (P = 0.003). Paradoxically, headache, facial pain, and sleep disturbance occurred significantly more frequently in patients with Sx - CT than in patients with Sx + CT (P < .05). The absence of mucopurulence on endoscopy proved to be highly specific for Sx - CT patients (100%). On the other hand, sensitivity was low; only 24% of Sx + CT patients demonstrated mucopurulence by endoscopy. Improvement in response to antibiotics was similar between both CRS categories.

- **Conclusions**: Most symptoms considered typical for CRS proved to be nonspecific. Interestingly, symptoms that were more severe were significantly more likely to occur in younger patients who were Sx - CT. The efficacy of antibiotic therapy was uncertain. We suggest that objective evidence of mucopurulence assessed by endoscopy or CT should be obtained if antibiotics are to be given.

### Impact of first-line vs second-line antibiotics for the treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis [^115gME2K]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of newer and more expensive (second-line) antibiotics over older and less expensive (first-line) antibiotics in relieving acute sinusitis symptoms has been questioned. However, many studies have not considered the development of complications or the cost of care in their analyses.

- **Objective**: To compare the effectiveness and cost of first-line versus second-line antibiotics for treating acute uncomplicated sinusitis in adults.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a pharmaceutical database containing demographic, clinical (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision), treatment, and charge information for 29,102 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis and receiving initial antibiotic treatment between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study focused on the absence of an additional antibiotic claim within 28 days after the initial antibiotic, the presence of a claim for a second antibiotic, serious sinusitis complications, and the direct charges and use associated with the acute sinusitis treatment.

- **Results**: Seventeen different antibiotics were prescribed. A majority (59.5%) of patients received a first-line antibiotic. The overall success rate was 90.4% (95% confidence interval, 90.0%-90.8%). Specifically, the success rate was 90.1% for the 17,329 patients receiving a first-line antibiotic and 90.8% for the 11,773 patients receiving a second-line antibiotic, marking a 0.7% difference (95% CI, 0.01%-1.40%; p < 0.05). Two cases of periorbital cellulitis occurred, with one case in each treatment group.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Unpyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the high utilization of antibiotic treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), there is a paucity of high-quality prospective studies. For treatment of CRS with antibiotics for less than 3 weeks, the majority of studies focus on the treatment of acute exacerbations of CRS (AECRS). While there are several non-placebo controlled studies and two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) on the role of prolonged treatment with macrolide antibiotics for CRS, there are few studies evaluating non-macrolide therapies. Herein, we will review the available evidence.

For the purposes of this discussion, three to four weeks or less is considered a 'short-term' antibiotic course, while greater than three to four weeks is considered a 'long-term' course. In general practice, the duration of courses is usually shorter than 10 days. The aim of short-term antibiotic courses is to treat suspected acute bacterial infections causing exacerbations.

There have been only two small placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of short-term antibiotics in CRS, excluding studies focused only on AECRS. Sabino et al. studied patients with acute exacerbations of CRS with or without polyps and found that following a two-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11), both groups exhibited overall improvement on day 14 compared to day 0 (p < 0.01). Van Zele conducted a three-arm study comparing a 20-day course of doxycycline, oral methylprednisolone, and placebo in 47 patients with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^1119WNTr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary alerts clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis, developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. The guideline includes 17 boldfaced action statements: three statements on viral rhinosinusitis, seven on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and seven on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

- **Evidence profiles**: Accompany each statement and are summarized to explain why the statement was made and how it can be implemented.
- **Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis**: Focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately.
- **Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis**: Focus on the appropriate use of diagnostic tests.

Please note that surgical therapy is not discussed in this guideline.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: A longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^115pKyaa]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

The adjusted proportion of cases prescribed antibiotics by registrars for sore throat (a), otitis media (b), and sinusitis (c) between 2010 and 2019 is presented. In multivariable analyses, the time factor (Year) was significantly associated with reduced antibiotic prescribing between 2010 and 2019 for sore throat (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.86–0.92; p < 0.001), otitis media (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.86–0.94; p < 0.001), and sinusitis (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88–0.96; p < 0.001). For more details, refer to Tables 3–5 for regression models on sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis, respectively.

- **Regression models**: Prescribing antibiotics for:
	- **Acute sore throat (2010–2019)**.
	- **Otitis media (2010–2019) ReCEnT data**.
	- **Sinusitis (2010–2019) ReCEnT data**.

Regression diagnostics confirmed reasonable linearity of the time effect for each model, which demonstrated good fit: sore throat (χ² = 37.5, p = 0.01), otitis media (χ² = 12.4, p = 0.82), and sinusitis (χ² = 22.6, p = 0.21). No influential observations were detected. Supplementary Tables 1–3 present the independent variables tested for inclusion in the models and the univariable associations of individual covariates with antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and acute sinusitis, respectively.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: A longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^114ZaUC1]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

Otitis media is another example of a condition with inappropriately high antibiotic prescribing rates. In Australia, antibiotics are reported to be prescribed by unselected general practitioners (GPs) in approximately 84.5% of otitis media cases and by registrars in 78.8% of cases. This aligns with our findings that registrars prescribed antibiotics in 77% of otitis media cases. Similar to sore throat, the decision to prescribe antibiotics is complex. This is largely due to the risk of complications, particularly in young children with bilateral infection and/or otorrhoea, where antibiotics are indicated. In children between 6 months and 2 years with unilateral, non-otorrhoeal infection, ideal prescribing rates are benchmarked at 19% of cases (IQR: 9–33%). Another study suggests antibiotics should be prescribed in 20–31% of cases of acute otitis media. Overall, there are limited situations in which patients over 2 years old with otitis media may benefit from antibiotics.

In the case of sinusitis, the marginal benefit and very low risk of complications mean antibiotics should very infrequently be prescribed for adults with acute sinusitis. Ideal prescribing rates have been reported as between 0% and 20% of acute sinusitis in adults (> 19 years). Antibiotics have reportedly been prescribed by all GPs in 80.7% of cases and by registrars in 71.2% of cases of acute sinusitis. We report a prescribing rate of 66% in 2019. While these estimates vary, they all sit well above the recommended benchmarks. McCullough et al. showed that sinusitis was one of the most over-prescribed conditions.

### Patterns of care before and after the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline [^116Ckzhk]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Determine if patterns of care for acute sinusitis have changed after the publication of the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline. This was investigated through a cross-sectional study with historical controls. Data were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey for cases of adult acute sinusitis in 2005–2006 (before guideline publication) and 2009–2010 (> 1 year after guideline publication). The study analyzed changes in the rates of analgesic recommendations, oral antibiotic prescriptions, and the choice of antibiotic therapy both before and after guideline publication in relation to the guideline recommendations.

An estimated 18.1 ± 1.8 million cases of adult acute sinusitis were analyzed before (7.9 ± 0.9 million visits for 2005–2006) and after (10.2 ± 1.5 million visits for 2009–2010) guideline publication. Recommendation rates for analgesics did not change significantly, with 18.9% before and 23.0% after (P = 0.470). However, the proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics increased after guideline publication, from 75.5% before to 85.7% after (P = 0.021). Consistent with guideline recommendations, the use of amoxicillin as the preferred antibiotic increased from 8.1% to 29.4% after guideline publication (P = 0.001).

In conclusion, the care patterns for the medical treatment of acute adult sinusitis have evolved following the guideline publication, marked by an increase in the rate of oral antibiotic prescriptions and greater use of amoxicillin as a first-line treatment option.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113oNzHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Topically administered antibiotics would potentially have the advantages of minimal systemic absorption and associated adverse effects while delivering significantly greater concentrations to the desired site. However, topical therapies in un-operated sinuses have limited penetrance and are usually not included in the medical regimens prescribed for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). With the recognition of S. aureus as a pathogenic disease modifier of CRS, the effect of treating surgically recalcitrant postoperative patients with topical mupirocin has been studied, and some efficacy has been demonstrated. However, there is also evidence that mupirocin irrigation may lead to resistance and the predominance of resistant bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa. After mupirocin lavages are stopped, colonization with S. aureus tends to recur.

In patients with a background of cystic fibrosis (CF) or primary dyskinesia, for whom P. aeruginosa is often the dominant pathogen, topical gentamicin may be administered either by nebulization or addition to lavage bottles. However, long-term treatment has been shown to induce a moderate incidence of gentamicin resistance. In both the idiopathic CRS population and the CF population, the available evidence supports short-term treatment with topical antibiotics for exacerbations.

Novel topical antibiotic delivery methods, such as co-delivering antibiotics with fibrin sealant at the completion of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and applying a drug-eluting stent containing an ivacaftor-ciprofloxacin mixture, are being studied.

There is also an expanding body of in vitro research exploring these methods.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote the appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### Ventilator-associated sinusitis: Microbiological results of sinus aspirates in patients on antibiotics [^111oPYug]. Anesthesiology (2000). Low credibility.

The efficacy of systemic antibiotics on the treatment of ventilator-associated infectious maxillary sinusitis (VAIMS) is debated. The objective of this study was to determine the etiologic diagnosis of VAIMS in patients receiving antibiotics.

- **Methods**: Patients mechanically ventilated for 72 hours or more, who had persistent fever while on antibiotics for 48 hours or more, underwent a computed tomography scan followed by a transnasal puncture of the involved maxillary sinuses. VAIMS was defined by fever of 38 degrees C or higher, radiographic signs (an air-fluid level or opacification of maxillary sinuses on a computed tomography scan), and a quantitative culture of sinus aspirate yielding 103 or more colony-forming units/ml.

- **Results**: Twenty-four patients showed radiographic signs of sinusitis. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of prior mechanical ventilation and antibiotic exposure was 9.5 ± 4.7 days and 6 ± 4 days, respectively. Six unilateral and nine bilateral VAIMS were diagnosed in 15 patients. The median number of etiologic organisms per patient was two (range, one to four). Bacteriologic cultures yielded gram-positive bacteria (n = 21), gram-negative bacteria (n = 22), and yeasts (n = 5). Forty percent of causative agents were susceptible to the antibiotics prescribed. Seven patients with VAIMS developed 10 concomitant infections: ventilator-associated pneumonia (n = 5), urinary tract infection (n = 3), and catheter infections (n = 2). In all cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the implicated agents were the causative organisms identified in the sinus aspirate cultures.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114LHdAn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Given that a clear link between bacteria and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has not yet been established, an increasing number of researchers have shifted the focus of their research to immunological factors underlying CRS. Some have postulated that CRS is a purely immune-mediated disease in which the observed microbial changes are either secondary or limited to causing exacerbations. Increasingly sophisticated analysis of the inflammatory pathways altered in CRS has revealed many new potential targets for pharmacological intervention, encouraging further research in this field.

- **Inflammatory mechanisms**: CRS has been historically classified by simple clinical phenotyping into CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). In the contemporary model of CRS pathogenesis, research focus has moved toward the identification of the molecular pathways (or endotypes) that have been activated. In cases of CRS, mucosal barrier disruption may initiate a chronic inflammatory response that fails to resolve. The inflammatory changes may utilize type 1, type 2, or type 3 inflammatory pathways, either alone or in combination.

Type 1 responses are directed against intracellular pathogens, most commonly viruses, and are characterized by the cytokine interferon-γ. Type 2 responses are directed against large, extracellular parasites and are characterized by cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, as well as activation and recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells. Type 3 responses are directed against extracellular bacteria and fungi and are characterized by cytokines IL-17 and IL-22. Each type of response is mediated by an innate lymphocyte.

### Radiographic resolution of chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis after 6 weeks vs 3 weeks of oral antibiotics [^116mpxaS]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Maximal medical therapy is poorly defined in chronic sinusitis treatment. The objective of this study was to objectively evaluate the radiographic response of chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis after 3 and 6 weeks of oral antibiotics.

Methods: Thirty-five patients with confirmed chronic sinusitis without polyposis (disease apparent on initial computed tomography [CT] with appropriate symptom duration) were prescribed 6 weeks of antibiotics. When possible, culture-directed antibiotics were used; otherwise, clindamycin was used empirically. A CT was performed after 3 and 6 weeks of therapy. CTs were then graded by the Lund-Mackay system, and demographic data were reviewed.

Results: Of the 35 patients, 16 underwent all 3 CT scans and completed all 6 weeks of antibiotics. Three patients completed only 3 weeks of antibiotics, and 16 did not undergo the interval 3-week CT. Six patients (38%) had statistically significant improvement in their CT scans between weeks 3 and 6. In this subset of patients who improved, 37% of their overall radiographic improvement occurred in the 3- to 6-week treatment interval. No prognostic variables predicted which patients would radiographically improve after 3 weeks of antibiotics.

Conclusion: Some patients achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution after the completion of a 3-week course of antibiotics. Therefore, maximal medical therapy for chronic sinusitis may consist of longer than 3 weeks of therapy to ensure maximal benefit.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes, and the side effects of different treatments.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey, accessed 15 January 2013), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model.

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^1115KrVP]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been conducted on the comparison of short versus long antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. The aim of this umbrella review is to assess the soundness of the evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Methods**: A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was performed on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from inpatient and outpatient settings were included; reviews in pediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest were clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, risk of bias of all included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1), and overall quality of evidence according to GRADE.

- **Findings**: We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; they were generally of a low to critically low quality. Twenty-one reviews conducted a meta-analysis. For CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU; 14 reviews, of which eight did a meta-analysis) and AECOPD (eight reviews, of which five did a meta-analysis), the results supported the trend towards shorter treatment duration.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114uHCQS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Several non-placebo-controlled randomized studies compared parallel, short-term antibiotic regimes in cases of CRS. Fan et al. found that patients in a higher dose clarithromycin group demonstrated better nasal symptom, Lund-Kennedy, and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) scores at weeks 2 and 4 compared with both baseline values and the low dose clarithromycin group. Namyslowski et al. showed improvement in CRS or AECRS symptoms at days 3 to 5 in patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to those taking cefuroxime. However, by days 15 to 18, there was no significant difference in clinical cure rates or bacteriologic eradication between the groups. The other five studies had nuanced results but, to summarize, showed no difference in symptomatology outcomes between head-to-head comparisons of various antibiotics given in short-term courses. The absence of a placebo arm in these studies precludes substantive conclusions. A minority of these studies evaluated outcomes after one month.

There have been a number of studies on the efficacy of long-term macrolide and non-macrolide antibiotics in CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Several phase 4 studies have demonstrated symptom improvement, but each study has methodological flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. These studies have been reviewed in great detail elsewhere.

At the time of writing, there have been only two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) of long-term antibiotic therapy for CRS. Both studies evaluated 12-week treatment with macrolides: Wallwork et al. evaluated roxithromycin at 150 mg daily in 64 patients with CRS.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: a longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^116eSVfb]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Registrars' antibiotic prescribing rates for new presentations of sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis have decreased from 2010 to 2019: for sore throat by 16% (from 76% to 60%); for otitis media by 11% (from 88% to 77%); and for sinusitis, by 18% (from 84% to 66%). The "year" was independently associated with significantly reduced antibiotic prescribing for all three conditions.

The results suggest that registrars' antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis is decreasing. This is consistent with results from the 2021 Antimicrobial Use and Resistance in Australia (AURA) report, which describes a steady decrease in community-based prescribing (for any condition) of antibiotics in Australia over the past 10 years. We found that in 2019, registrars prescribed antibiotics in 60% of new sore throat cases, 77% of new acute otitis media cases, and 66% of new acute sinusitis cases. This compares to all GPs who prescribed antibiotics in 2019 in 84.6% of new acute tonsillitis cases, 84.5% of acute otitis media cases, and 80.7% of acute and chronic sinusitis cases. Overall, it appears registrars consistently prescribe fewer antibiotics than the wider GP population.

The decision to prescribe for each of these conditions, particularly sore throat, is complex. Unlike URTIs (the "common cold") and acute bronchitis, for which antibiotics are not recommended, antibiotics have been reported to (modestly) reduce sore throat symptoms. However, it is important to note that this condition…

### Antibiotic recommendations for acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis: Conundrum no more [^111b1Y38]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

There has been a substantial change in the prevalence and microbiologic characteristics of cases of acute otitis media due to the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Trends in nasopharyngeal colonization and the microbiology of acute otitis media support a change in the recommendation for antibiotic management of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis in children.

### Levofloxacin [^115JAziY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth for 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high-dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multi-center study. This study compared levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates, defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary, in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

- **Rates of clinical success by pathogen**: In the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry, results were comparable for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post-treatment.

*Note: Forty percent of the subjects in this trial had specimens obtained by sinus endoscopy.

### Efficacy/safety of amoxicillin/clavulanate in adults with bacterial rhinosinusitis [^111p1NoR]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common and uncomfortable condition, frequently caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* or *Haemophilus influenzae*. Antibacterial resistance among these and other common respiratory pathogens is now widespread and of concern. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was developed to be effective against the common respiratory pathogens, including many resistant strains.

This open-label, noncomparative study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg in adult patients with ABRS. Requirements for study entry included a clinical diagnosis of ABRS supported by radiologic findings. Additionally, sinus puncture for bacteriologic assessment was required at study entry.

Overall, bacteriologic success (eradication or clinical evidence of eradication) at the follow-up visit (days 17–28) was achieved in 87.8% (722/822) of patients with one or more pathogens isolated at screening, in 93.2% (246/264) of patients with *S. pneumoniae*, in 96.7% (29/30) of those with penicillin-resistant *S. pneumoniae* (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations ≥ 2 microg/mL), and in 88.7% (110/124) of patients with beta-lactamase-positive pathogens. Bacteriologic success was achieved against six of seven *S. pneumoniae* isolates with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4/2 microg/mL or higher.

Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was generally well tolerated. This new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation provides a suitable option for treating ABRS caused by resistant strains.

### No "one-size-fits all": Chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^11323Ttx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

We included all adult telemedicine and office encounters from January 2021 to March 2022 categorized as sinusitis encounters by associated ICD-10s (Supplement Table 1) from two academic urgent care and eight primary care clinics. To identify these encounters, we used an internal data model to categorize most discharge encounter diagnoses by ICD-10 into tiers — those for which antibiotics are almost always (tier 1), sometimes (tier 2), or almost never (tier 3) indicated. All sinusitis ICD-10s are considered Tier 2. In the case of encounters with multiple ICD-10s, we classified the encounter by the ICD-10 with the lowest tier. For example, if an encounter was associated with both a Tier 1 (lowest tier) ICD-10 and a sinusitis ICD-10 (tier 2), it would be classified as a Tier 1 encounter and not included in this analysis to increase the likelihood that the associated antibiotic prescription was intended for sinusitis. We extracted encounter date, location, ICD-10, and antibiotic prescriptions from the electronic health record.

We calculated sinusitis APRs by dividing the number of encounters associated with an antibiotic by the total number of encounters. Sinusitis encounters were defined as acute or chronic based on billed ICD-10 code (Supplemental Table 1). We compared overall, acute, and chronic sinusitis APRs by clinic type to assess the impact of ICD-10 definition on APR.

We randomly selected 50% of chronic sinusitis encounters in 2021 as well as 100 acute sinusitis encounters for manual chart review to assess symptom documentation and if antibiotic prescriptions.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). High credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is an abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis update [^114QsmB7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function, and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, an immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis and pharyngitis in an integrated healthcare system [^112Y3GKJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

We evaluated the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis and pharyngitis. Overall, 81% of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis were inappropriate, and 48% of antibiotic prescriptions for pharyngitis were inappropriate. Types of prescribing errors differed between the two infections, including lack of an indication for antibiotics and excessive duration in approximately 50% of sinusitis cases, as well as incorrect antibiotic dose in approximately 33% of pharyngitis cases.

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, several medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines serve to assist practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains due to the disparity of guideline recommendations and the fact that some recommendations are outdated. This review presents three illustrative case studies designed to provide clarity regarding these guidelines.

- **Case 1**: A typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous two weeks.
- **Case 2**: A more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy that ultimately requires referral to an otolaryngologist.
- **Case 3**: An atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan.

It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for healthcare providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

Three specific issues were considered:

- **Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children**: Evaluation of different antibiotic regimens.
- **Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens**: Consideration of additional treatment options beyond antibiotics.
- **Diagnostic accuracy and concordance**: Analysis of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children aged 6 years or younger who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to further assess the clinical scenario.

### International consensus statement on allergy and rhinology: Rhinosinusitis [^111N1J1i]. International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the ICAR-RS 2016 guidelines recommend against the use of non-macrolide antibiotics (less than a 3-week course) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in non-acute clinical situations.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics impacts patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomized studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties; studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics.

### Improving antibiotic use for sinusitis and upper respiratory tract infections: A virtual-visit antibiotic stewardship initiative [^112XTMct]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Asynchronous virtual patient care is increasingly used; however, the effectiveness of virtually delivering guideline-concordant care in conjunction with antibiotic stewardship initiatives remains uncertain. We developed a bundled stewardship intervention to improve antibiotic use in E-visits for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs).

- **Methods**: In this before-and-after study, adult patients who completed E-visits for "cough", "flu", or "sinus symptoms" at Michigan Medicine between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2020, were included. Patient demographics, diagnoses, and antibiotic details were collected. The multifaceted intervention occurred over 6 months. Segmented linear regression was performed to estimate the effect of the intervention on appropriate antibiotic use for URTI diagnoses (defined as no antibiotic prescribed) and sinusitis (defined as guideline-concordant antibiotic selection and duration). Regression lines were fit at the time of writing before the bundled intervention (January 2019) and after the bundled intervention (May 2019).

- **Results**: In total, 5,151 E-visits were included. The intervention decreased the number of visits for flu, cough, or sinus symptoms with prescribed antibiotics from 43.2% to 28.9% (P < .001). Guideline concordance of antibiotic prescriptions improved following the intervention: first-line amoxicillin-clavulanate rose from 37.9% of prescriptions to 66.1% (P < .001), second-line doxycycline rose from 13.8% to 22.7% (P < .001); and the median duration of antibiotics decreased from 10 days to 5 days (P < .001).

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^117Mxw2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults were included. Trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture, were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to determine whether the treatment was a failure. In meta-analyzing the placebo-controlled studies, data were combined across antibiotic classes. The primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up.

- **Main results**: Fifty-seven studies were included in the review: six placebo-controlled and 51 comparing different antibiotic classes. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo, where clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of **Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery**. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis and the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management. These tests include radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. The recommendations also cover the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy.

Emphasis was placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify the management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, an immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

This executive summary describes the guidelines developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's **Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition)**, which summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, and family practice, ensuring a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.

### International consensus statement on allergy and rhinology: Rhinosinusitis [^1154FJc6]. International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis, the ICAR-RS 2016 guidelines specifically address antibiotic therapy. They recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of non-macrolide antibiotics for less than 3 weeks in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^117Cdzbw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

A common theme raised by many suppressive antibiotic therapy (SAT) review papers is that the quality of the primary evidence makes it difficult to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Some potential strategies for future research include the following:

- **Stratifying analyses**: Patients with different factors, such as surgical or medical management prior to SAT, should be analyzed separately. Studies examining a strictly defined demographic — such as patients meeting specific age criteria or those who have undergone multiple previous prosthetic-associated surgeries — often report lower success rates.

- **Selecting comparison groups**: Where possible, use groups of patients not receiving SAT. This may provide a more realistic view of the efficacy of SAT. It is acknowledged that patients in the non-SAT group may not be fully comparable to those receiving SAT; if they were as comorbid as the SAT cohort, they presumably would have been prescribed SAT as well.

- **Designing studies with larger cohort sizes**: Increasing cohort sizes can enhance the statistical power of results. Larger cohort studies tend to be multicentered or utilize nationally available databases to identify patients.

- **Including early failure groups**: Include patients who did not receive a minimum duration of SAT, usually due to death from their infection or another cause, as a separate early failure group. Excluding these patients entirely likely overestimates the success rate of SAT by creating a more resilient cohort with a better initial prognosis for the analysis.

Due to the lack of comprehensive data, further research is necessary to improve clinical applicability in suppressive antibiotic therapy.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: What do we know and where do we go from here [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

Over the past 25 years, researchers have conducted over 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating that short courses of antibiotics are non-inferior to long courses for common bacterial infections.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis, and sinusitis.

- **Sources**: Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

- **Content**: Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. It remains unclear whether durations can be further shortened with debridement, although small studies are promising.

- **Implications**: With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population and ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials.

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: A cost-effectiveness analysis [^111djKtt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

- **Design**: For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness and included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective".

- **Measurements and main results**: For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, the use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively), while empirical antibiotics were cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary treatments.

### No "one-size-fits all": Chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^115Ah3Na]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Our project had several limitations. First, this was a single-center experience, which limits generalizability. Second, we did not quantify all possible opportunities in antibiotic prescriptions, including choice, dose, and duration. Third, documentation may not always reflect the full array of symptoms a patient discussed during an encounter, and billing data may be inaccurate. Fourth, despite the use of a tiered system for categorization, sinusitis may not always be the intended diagnosis for an antibiotic prescription.

Our findings are important for stewardship programs to consider when developing internal metrics for sinusitis to track the impact of interventions. The dilutional effect of combining acute and chronic ICD-10 in APR analysis for sinusitis highlights the need for improved ICD-10 utilization and methods to control for "carryover" ICD-10s. Until strategies are implemented to control for "carryover" ICD-10s of chronic problems in primary care, it would be prudent to analyze acute and chronic sinusitis ICD-10 categories separately to ensure that APR accurately reflects antibiotic prescribing practices.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: a longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^114z68kx]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide minimal benefit for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis, highlighting the necessity for antibiotic stewardship with reduced prescribing to combat antibiotic resistance. Considering that most antibiotic prescribing occurs in general practice and prescribing habits develop early, general practitioner (GP) trainees (registrars) play a crucial role in effective antibiotic stewardship.

This study aims to establish temporal trends in Australian registrars' antibiotic prescribing for acute sore throat, acute otitis media, and acute sinusitis through a longitudinal analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study from 2010 to 2019.

ReCEnT is an ongoing cohort study examining registrars' in-consultation experiences and clinical behaviours. Prior to 2016, 5 of the 17 Australian training regions participated. From 2016 onwards, 3 of 9 regions participated, representing 42% of Australian registrars.

The primary measure for this study was the prescription of an antibiotic for a new acute problem/diagnosis of sore throat, otitis media, or sinusitis, with the study factor being the year from 2010 to 2019.

Antibiotics were prescribed in 66% of sore throat diagnoses, 81% for otitis media, and 72% for sinusitis. Notably, prescribing frequencies decreased between 2010 and 2019 by 16% for sore throat (from 76% to 60%), by 11% for otitis media (from 88% to 77%), and by 18% for sinusitis (from 84% to 66%). Multivariable analyses demonstrated that the variable "Year" was associated with reduced prescribing for sore throat (OR 0.89; 95%CI 0.86–0.92; p < 0.001), otitis media (OR 0.90; 95%CI 0.86–0.94; p < 0.001), and sinusitis.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are neither routinely performed nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information and collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

- **Main results**: We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of a placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I² statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics.

### Acute and chronic frontal sinusitis [^113Q46HX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the recent literature published on the microbiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical management of acute and chronic frontal sinus disease. Two retrospective studies investigated the microbiology of frontal sinusitis in patients who underwent sinus surgery. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus predominated in acute infection in patients with acute frontal sinusitis, while S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria were commonly isolated in chronic sinusitis. Surgery is indicated to treat patients with acute and chronic sinusitis and their complications. Several surgical procedures were recently evaluated, and these are briefly reviewed.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms or imaging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^113u7KgV]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend not using short-term oral antibiotics in patients with CRS without polyps, even in cases of acute exacerbations.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113YiLhx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Perioperative antibiotics

There are no clinical studies whose results support the administration of systemic antibiotics immediately prior to sinus surgery.

According to the classification of surgical wounds, endoscopic sinus surgery is a 'clean-contaminated' operative field, although the grading would change to 'contaminated' if non-purulent inflammation were encountered. An acute inflammatory flare-up or acute sinusitis with purulence would warrant prophylactic antibiotics, but a clean-contaminated wound does not require such prophylaxis. A survey among American Rhinologic Society members revealed that 54% routinely administered antibiotics on induction, although there is no evidence to support this practice.

The same survey revealed that 62% of respondents routinely gave postoperative antibiotics, with 76% citing the reduction of postoperative infection risk as the reason. Culture-directed antibiotic usage in the presence of overt purulence is generally accepted, but there is limited evidence for this. The culturing of S. aureus from intraoperative swabs has been associated with worse surgical outcomes. However, a randomized study demonstrated that the general short-term outcomes of surgery did not change with a course of postoperative antibiotics. Furthermore, while some have observed a reduction in early postoperative crusting, others used Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores to demonstrate that non-culture-dependent empiric antibiotics led to a reduction in quality-of-life gain in the early postoperative period.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). High credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

- **Action statements**: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish between different types and causes of rhinosinusitis in their diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^112SaKn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease.

Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: A longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^113vSMzn]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide minimal benefit for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis. Antibiotic stewardship, with reduced prescribing, is required to address antibiotic resistance. As most antibiotic prescribing occurs in general practice and prescribing habits develop early, general practitioner (GP) trainees (registrars) are important for effective antibiotic stewardship.

- **Objectives**: To establish temporal trends in Australian registrars' antibiotic prescribing for acute sore throat, acute otitis media, and acute sinusitis.

- **Design**: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study from 2010 to 2019.

- **Participants**: ReCEnT is an ongoing cohort study of registrars' in-consultation experiences and clinical behaviours. Pre-2016, 5 of 17 Australian training regions participated. From 2016, 3 of 9 regions (42% of Australian registrars) participate.

- **Main measures**: The outcome was prescription of an antibiotic for a new acute problem/diagnosis of sore throat, otitis media, or sinusitis. The study factor was year (2010–2019).

- **Key results**: Antibiotics were prescribed in 66% of sore throat diagnoses, 81% of otitis media, and 72% of sinusitis. Prescribing frequencies decreased between 2010 and 2019 by 16% for sore throat (from 76% to 60%), by 11% for otitis media (from 88% to 77%), and by 18% for sinusitis (from 84% to 66%). In multivariable analyses, "Year" was associated with reduced prescribing for sore throat (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.86–0.92; p < 0.001), otitis media (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.86–0.94; p < 0.001), and sinusitis (OR 0.90 [data seems cut off here]).

### Telithromycin new product overview [^112vmfx6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs), which include community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis, significantly contribute to health care costs in the United States. Although many antibiotic prescriptions are written each year for the treatment of CARTIs, most are prescribed on an empiric basis. Concerns about the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the changing pattern of pathogens isolated from subjects with CARTIs have raised questions about the empiric treatment paradigm.

When choosing appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CARTIs, physicians must consider not only the spectrum of activity of antibiotics but also the potential risk of resistance. Telithromycin is the first member of the ketolide class, a new family of antimicrobials structurally related to the macrolides, to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CARTIs. The spectrum of activity of telithromycin includes common typical and atypical causative pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Clinical trials have shown that telithromycin is as effective as traditionally used antimicrobial agents in treating mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis update [^1123tx9v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend distinguishing chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and other causes of sinonasal symptoms.

### Bacterial sinusitis can be a focus for initial lung colonisation and chronic lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis [^111dDwJM]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2013). Low credibility.

A major purpose of treating patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is to prevent or delay chronic lung infections with CF-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. In the intermittent stage, bacteria can usually be eradicated from the lungs with antibiotics, but following eradication, the next lung colonisations often occur with bacteria of identical genotype. This may be due to re-colonisation from the patient's paranasal sinuses.

In our study, we found that approximately two-thirds of CF patients having sinus surgery (FESS) had growth of CF-lung-pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria in their sinuses (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia cepacia complex). The environment in the sinuses is in many ways similar to that of the lower respiratory tract, e.g. low oxygen concentration in secretions. Sinus bacteria are more difficult to eradicate than in the lungs, thus, having good conditions for adapting to the environment in the lungs.

In the presence of bacteria, the environment of the sinuses differs from that of the lower respiratory tract by having a higher immunoglobulin A (IgA): IgG ratio and reduced inflammation. We found a significant correlation between the concentration of IgA against P. aeruginosa (standard antigen and alginate) in nasal secretions and saliva and CF patients' infection status (not lung colonised, intermittently colonised, or chronically lung-infected with P. aeruginosa). This supports the hypothesis that infections often originate in the sinuses and can be a focus for initial lung colonisation or for maintaining lung infections in CF patients.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111cqXha]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The CPGAS recommends systemic antibiotics for acute exacerbations of CRS, particularly in patients with persistent purulent drainage. It also notes that some patients with CRSsNP may benefit from prolonged antibiotic treatment.

The JTFPP recommends antibiotics as an option in the treatment of CRS, noting that greater benefit with antibiotics has been reported in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP. It also emphasizes that the role of antibiotics in CRS is controversial.
